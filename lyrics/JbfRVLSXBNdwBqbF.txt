Got up early found something's missing
My only name
No one else sees but I got stuck
And soon forever came

Stopped pushing on for just a second
Then nothing's changed
Who am I this time where's my name?
Guess it crept away

No one's calling for me at the door
An unpredictable won't bother anymore
And silently gets harder to ignore
Look straight ahead,
there's nothing left to see
What's done is done,
this life has got it's hold on me.
Just let it go, what now can never be.

I forgot that I might see
So many beautiful things
I forgot that I might need
To find out what life could bring...
Beautiful things.

Take this happy ending away
It's all the same
God won't waste this simplicity
On possibility

Get me up wake me up
Dreams are filling this trace of blame
Frozen still I thought I could stop
Now who's gonna wait

No one's calling for me at the door
An unpredictable won't bother anymore
And silently gets harder to ignore

Look straight ahead
There's nothing left to see
What's done is done
This life has got its hold on me
Just let it go
What now can never be
So many...
beautiful things.

Now what do I do?
Can I change my mind?
Did I think things through?

It was once my life
It was my life at one time

I forgot that i might see
So many beautiful things
I forgot that i might need
To find out what life could bring
