We'll roll on with our heads held high
Our conscience in the gutter
Our dreams up in the sky
We'll roll on with our heads held high
Our conscience in the gutter
Our dreams up in the sky

The shipyards are deserted on the docks of Melbourne town
The wharfies standing strong
They gathered round to see what the union had to say
There's too much work and not enough pay
Say

We'll roll on with our heads held high
Our conscience in the gutter
Our dreams up in the sky
We'll roll on with our heads held high
Our conscience in the gutter
Our dreams up in the sky

We'll protest in peace, keep the whole thing quiet
The last thing needed is a wage-fuelled riot
Cos they don't really care
They're always standing there
Running from the outside
From the outside
Running from the outside world

Do you really care?
Why are you standing there
Filming for the outside world?
Do you really care?
Why are you standing there
filming for the outside world?

Five weeks had passed when the union made it clear
Spirits slowly faded and the end was getting near
You see you're all expendable and when all is said and done
You'll go back to work tomorrow
Or meet your new replacement, son!
