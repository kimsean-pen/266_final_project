All this time I've wasted
Waiting for the world to end
Dizzy indecision
Veering off the open road
Anchors away

Lack of infrastructure
Someone hear me out
I'm dying inside, there's nowhere to hide
Where do I go?

Get back in the cage
Just keep me away
I'm staggering.

I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone

Easy to resemble
Hard to learn the workings of
This lonesome charade

I'm filled with hesitation
Staring down the tide

It pulls you apart
It stabs in the dark
It carries away

I'm starting to see
The problem with me
Is everything

I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone

I can feel you tonight
I can feel you
I can feel you tonight
I can feel you

I never know who I am
I only know what I'm not
It doesn't make any sense
It doesn't follow the plot
I never learn how to love
I only learn how to fight
I only see in the dark
But never kept to the night
I got a flurry of words
But I got nothing to say
And why does everything,
Always end this way?
If I asked you to let me go,
Would you hold on, would you hold on?
I try hard to let go but the pull is too great
Consumed with the promise
Of one last chance
Are you holding on?
Cause I'm still holding on

I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone
I can't wait to find you, I really hate that I'm alone

I can feel you tonight
I can feel you
I can feel you tonight
I can feel you
I can feel you tonight
I can feel you
I can feel you tonight
I can feel you
