Let go, only you can make it right
But you won't even look in my eye
Everything you want to save you just enslaves you

Let go, of everything you fear inside
All you do is let the fear decide
If they will love you or if you will just discover

I'm not here to save you
I'm not here to change your mind
I'm not here to hold you down
Or leave you half-alive
I came here to wake you
To open up your mind
Go on, go on, just close your eyes
Save your life
You gotta die to save you.

Lights out
Shadows closing in around you

Pray now
Scream without a sound

Let go of everything you fear inside
All you do is let the fear define
Who you are when you just let it overtake you.

I'm not here to save you
I'm not here to change your mind
I'm not here to hold you down
Or leave you half-alive
I came here to wake you
To open up your eyes
Go on go, just close your eyes
You could save your life, it could save your life
You gotta die to save you

Let go, only you can make it right
And she won't even look in my eye
Everything you want to save you falls away

Let it Go
Let it Go
Let it Go

I'm not here to save you
I'm not here to change your mind
I'm not here to hold you down
Or leave you half-alive
I came here to wake you
To open up your mind
Go on go on, just close your eyes
You can save your life, save your life
You gotta die to save you.
