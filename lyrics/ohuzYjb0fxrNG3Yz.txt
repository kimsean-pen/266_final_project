I think I'm outta my mind
I give in too many times
The way you move in the night
Yeah, you know what you're doing

I make some bad decisions
You push me past my limits
Going to fast, admit it
And I can't stop
Right when the coast is clearest
That's when I know you're nearest
Pull me in close, I feel it
And I can't stop this

Trouble always find me
Ain't no point in hiding
Don't have to remind me
No matter where I go
I know it's right behind me
Got the perfect timing
Trouble always finds me no matter where I go

I think you're good at this game
You bite your lip and I stay
You know you're getting your way
Yeah, I know what you're doing

I make some bad decisions
You push me past my limits
Going to fast, admit it
And I can't stop
Right when the coast is clearest
That's when I know you're nearest
Pull me in close, I feel it
And I can't stop it

Trouble always find me
Ain't no point in hiding
Don't have to remind me
No matter where I go
I know it's right behind me
Got the perfect timing
Trouble always finds me no matter where I go

Echo, echo, echo, echo
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble always finds me
Echo, echo, echo, echo
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble always finds me
Trouble always finds me
No, no

I make some bad decisions
You push me past my limits
Going to fast, admit it
And I can't stop

Trouble always find me
Ain't no point in hiding
Don't have to remind me
No matter where I go
I know it's right behind me
Got the perfect timing
Trouble always finds me no matter where I go

Echo, echo, echo, echo
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble always finds me
Echo, echo, echo, echo
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Trouble always finds me
