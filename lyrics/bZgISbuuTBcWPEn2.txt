1000 umbrellas
Upturned couldn't catch all the rain
That drained out of my head
When you said we were
Over and over I cried
Till I floated downstream
To a town they call
Misery, oh oh, Misery
Misery, oh oh, Misery

And one million teacups
I bet couldn't hold all the wet
That fell out of my eyes
When you fell out with me
Now I'm crawling the wallpaper
That's looking more like a road map
To Misery, oh oh, Misery

How can you smile and forecast
Weather's getting better
And you'll soon forget her
If you let the sunshine come through
How can you smile and forecast
Weather's getting better
If you never let a girl rain all over you

And just when I thought
That my vista was golden in hue
1000 umbrellas opened to spoil the view

One billion salt seas
Recalled from school atlas
Alas would be filled to the brim
Sunny Jim couldn't jump it
How can I be pleased
When I'm handed the keys
To a town they call
Misery, oh oh, Misery

So with a mop and a bucket
I'll just say forget her
And carry on sweeping up
Where I've been weeping
The Jesters will creep in
To strike down the newly crowned monarch
Of Misery, oh oh, Misery

How can you smile and forecast
Weather's getting better
And you'll soon forget her
If you let the sunshine come through
How can you smile and forecast
Weather's getting better
If you never let a girl rain all over you

Just when I thought that my skies were a June July blue
1000 umbrellas opened
2000 umbrellas opened
10, 000 umbrellas opened to spoil the view
