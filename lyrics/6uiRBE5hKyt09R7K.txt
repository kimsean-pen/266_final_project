Counting stars, laying in the grass
Side by side, your head in my shoulder...
We talk a lot about nothing much,
With every breath we're getting closer
Parallel in this universe
Do we light up our hearts just to watch'em burn?
Parallel, I will cross the lines.
Cause maybe tonight...

The stars align!
The stars align!

What if I'm the one who was meant for you,
Was all along right in front of you
Just didn't see, it was there all the time
Got a feeling tonight, yeah
The stars align!
The stars align!
I pick the thoughts out of your mind
And put the pieces into a puzzle
Everything I wanna say about you
Is more than enough to write a novel
Parallel in this universe
Do we light up our hearts just to watch'em burn?
Parallel, I will cross the lines.
Cause maybe tonight

The stars align!
The stars align!

What if I'm the one who was meant for you,
Was all along right in front of you
Just didn't see it was there all the time
Got a feeling tonight, yeah
The stars align
I'd throw a rope around the moon,
And pull it close whatever it takes to be with you
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight the stars align.
The stars align!
The stars align!
What if I'm the one who was meant for you,
Was all along right in front of you
Just didn't see it was there all the time
Got a feeling tonight, yeah
The stars align!
Stars align!
The stars align!
