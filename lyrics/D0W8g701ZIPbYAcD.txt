See the wolf in sheep's skin
Waiting in the shadows, watching, learning
Too bad I did not recognize

The dark undertow
Pulling you away
We've been infiltrated, in fact violated
Carefully orchestrated

Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive
Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive

You swallowed the lies
In a search for inner peace
With open ears and eyes
Could you not feel?

The dark undertow
Pulling you down
You've been infiltrated, in fact violated
Ultimately desecrated

Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive
Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive, never forget
Never ever

When the dust has settled
I'll watch you drown, drown, drown in your regret

The dark undertow
Pulling you away
We've been infiltrated, in fact violated
Carefully orchestrated

Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive
Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing, I'll never forgive, never forget
Never ever
