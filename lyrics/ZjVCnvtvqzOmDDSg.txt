In like the rose that grows on your soul,
Out of time now you're out for more.
In like the stone that forms in your heart,
Out of reach but you can't give up

This time...
I'm on a wire to see your star... shine
I'm on a wire to see your star... shine

In like the sun that falls on us all,
Out of time but you can't let go.
Into the dark you've stumbled alone,
Out of sight now you can't return

This time...
I'm on a wire to see your star... shine
I'm on a wire to see your star... shine

I've been blind, I've torn out my eyes but I fear no more
I've been blind, you've turned from my side but I felt your voice

In like the cold that grows in your bones,
Out of time now you can't go on.
End of the road you've taken alone,
Devil's hands will replace the ones I've known...

I'm on a wire to see your star... shine
I'm on a wire to see your star

Please darling, hear me darling,
See darling you don't owe them nothing
I'm on a wire, I've taken your silence but can't no more
Please darling, hear me darling,
See darling you don't owe them nothing
I'm on a wire you fade in the light where I can't follow

Time, keeps this love alive but your hope is gone
Time, keeps this love alive but your hope is gone...
