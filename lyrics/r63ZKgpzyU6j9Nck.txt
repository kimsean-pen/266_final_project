In your eyes, I have seen
All the feeling and the rains
And death is cold, death is sure
Why dont we all fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
Why dont we fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
Why dont we fall in love?

All the feeling and the rains
And death is cold, death is sure
Why dont we all fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
Why dont we fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
Why dont we fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh

In your eyes, I have seen
All the feeling and the rains
And death is cold, death is sure
Why dont we all fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
Why dont we fall in love?
Oh, whoa, oh oh
