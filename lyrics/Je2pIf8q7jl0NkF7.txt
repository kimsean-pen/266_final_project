Ayy, ayyy, yeah, yeah
Comin' off the gin yeah, yeah (Ayy)
Ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy, ayy
Ayy, yeah

I feel like a villain
No remorse, I run'em out
I had to change my digits
New niggas acting up
I just mind my business
Mask off, dressed down (Ayy, ayy)
You know my position
Turn my shit up fucking loud
Cancel, fucking cancel, they move backwards
Bands up, got my bands up, it's a handful (It's a)
Mention (Ayy), all of you so silly like Picasso
Bad look had to tear this shit up like an animal
Young nigga, rich as fuck
But I want no Ice
Ride around with my hood up (Ayy, ayy)
They know Scarlxrd isn't nice
Mask on my face when I'm strolling through the night
Got a hand full of fans
Guess I had to pay the price

On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up! (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up! (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Live in the night, don't know
Eat like a cannibal, feeding myself
Your life is laughable, talk on my death and all
Ah just have to Cherish myself
Had to go ride and go chase something radical
Now I just murder myself
It's all about me, me, me, me I'm so full of myself
Ayy, I've been up chasing the work
Ayy, niggas they hate I got money
Keeping my head down
I barely discovered your mama
No bullshit respecting my message
And these fuckers out there
Think they can try me, yah
I'm my own biggest rival, yah
All of these racks, I'm surviving, yah

Pick up and run the wealth hey,
Had to go run the wealth, hey
Run up a cheque until yuh,
I gotta adorn the belt, ayy
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
I might dance to my steady notes, of course
I'm on drugs when my steady fold, yeah, yeah
Making moves till I'm red and blue
Huh, Getting down in my mansion
Wait, how did I get my fix some more
I don't buy no more shit no more
Never go mix my drink no more
And I won't talk that shit no more
Everyone so lit, I promise I'm lyrical, would never be minimal

On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
On my way, heh, shut the fuck up!
(Fuck up! Ayy, ayy)
