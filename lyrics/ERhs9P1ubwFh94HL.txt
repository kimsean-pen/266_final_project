I'm deep in my sorrow and feeling down
Not waiting for rapture to come around
With nothing to lose I'm about to clear my mind
So many times I have dealt with my pain
And now it is driving me almost insane
I had a future but now it is left far behind

Then out of the corner comes a light
Taking my breath, divine and bright
Changing my world, left me adrift
So silently

I have tried to comprehend
I've hid my pride and made amends
But all I had was misery to see
When I'm close to her it's so intense
I hold her tight, it makes no sense
Cause still she is a mystery to me

Ain't taking it for granted what we've got
But I'm willing to give it my best shot
Avoiding the darkest whispers from my past
I've got no regrets, I've got no remorse
This is my life and I've chosen my course
I'm taking the challenge and I know it's gonna last

Then out of the comer comes a light
Taking my breath, divine and bright
Changing my world, left me adrift
So silently

I have tried to comprehend
I've hid my pride and made amends
But all I had was misery to see
When I'm close to her it's so intense
I hold her tight, it makes no sense
Cause still she is a mystery to me

I have tried to comprehend
I've hid my pride and made amends
Cause still she is a mystery to me

I have tried to comprehend
I've hid my pride and made amends
But all I had was misery to see
When I'm close to her it's so intense
I hold her tight, it makes no sense
Cause still she is a mystery to me
A mystery to me
A mystery to me
