Let it slide, all the choices I made
Let it burn as it rolls down my face
Let it fall, just to be the one again
But if I want I won't be loved by you at all

Let it slip every promise I break
Let it burn all that blows that we trade
Let it fall, 'cause this place has been condemned
And we both know that we can't be here anymore

Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
But I lost sight on the target when you let down your guard
Should've run, run a hundred miles
Never look back, jack, 'cause now we can't backtrack

And yeah, I know what you'll say nothing can change
No one to blame, it's on the tip of my tongue
Here it comes, this is crazy, you should know that
I would go back in a heartbeat

Just to make your heart beat

Let it fail, it's too late to be saved
Let it roll, they're all across this grave
Let it blaze, there's a darkness in the flame
And it's lost, and we can't bear it anymore

Let it slide, I can't start it again
Let it burn while it's held in my hand
Let it fall, 'cause this journey's at its end
It's only luck that I was loved by you at all

Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
But I lost sight on the target when you let down your guard
Should've run, run a hundred miles
Never look back, jack, 'cause now we can't backtrack

And yeah, I know what you'll say nothing can change
No one to blame, it's on the tip of my tongue
Here it comes, this is crazy, you should know that
I would go back in a heartbeat

Just to make your heart beat

Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
But I lost sight on the target when you let down your guard
Should've run, run a hundred miles
Never look back, jack, 'cause now we can't backtrack

And yeah, I know what you'll say nothing can change
No one to blame, it's on the tip of my tongue
Here it comes, this is crazy, you should know that
I would go back in a heartbeat

Just to make your heart beat
