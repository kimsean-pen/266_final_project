Look down
The ground below is crumbling
Look up
The stars are all exploding

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ho, hi (hi, hi, hi)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's the last day on earth
In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams)
In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams)
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me
In my dreams

Between the dust and the debris
There's a light surrounding you and me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ho, hi (hi, hi, hi)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's the last day on earth
In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams) In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams)
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me
In my dreams

And you hold me closer than I can ever remember being held
And i'm not afraid to sleep now, if we can stay like this until

It's the last day on earth
In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams)
In my dreams (my dreams, my dreams)
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ho, hi (hi, hi, hi)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

In my head I replay our conversations
Over and over til they feel like hallucinations
You know me, I love to lose my mind
And every time anybody speaks your name I still feel the same
I ache, I ache, I ache inside

In my head I replay our conversations
Over and over til they feel like hallucinations
You know me, I love to lose my mind (it's the last)
And every time anybody speaks your name I still feel the same
I ache, I ache, I ache inside (day on earth)

I ache, I ache, I ache inside
I ache, I ache, I ache inside
I ache, I ache, I ache inside
