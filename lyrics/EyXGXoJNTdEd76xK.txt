One minute, you told me two lies
That you love me and it was you and I
One minute, I came to see
Half a man of what you used to be
Did it take a minute for her to steal
Everything you thought that was real?
Or maybe longer [?] more
Before she took you out to the hotel floor
Did you die yourself [?]
Hey, you're giving me a heart attack
Oh, what are you thinking
What all do you take me for?
Oh, what are you thinking
She's cheaper than a dollar store version of me
Version of me, version of me, version of me, version of
me
Version of me, version of me, version of me
Does she wear things that I don't
[?] world
Well, she's got you right where you had me
Right between the heart
Oh, isn't she a dream
Did you die yourself [?]
Oh, what are you thinking
What all do you take me for?
Oh, what are you thinking
She's cheaper than a dollar store version of me
Version of me, version of me, version of me, version of
me
Version of me, version of me, version of me
Good woman, I'm good, good woman
But you still want more, yeah, you still want more
Good woman, I'm good, good woman
But you still want more, yeah, you still want more
Good woman, I'm good, good woman, I'm good, good
woman
But you still want more
Good woman, I'm good, good woman, I'm good, good
woman
Oh, what are you thinking
What all do you take me for?
Oh, what are you thinking
She's cheaper than a dollar store version of me
Oh, what are you thinking
What all do you take me for?
Oh, what are you thinking
She's cheaper than a dollar store version of me
Version of me, version of me, version of me, version of
me
Version of me, version of me, version of me
Good woman, I'm good, good woman
But you still want more, yeah, you still want more
Good woman, I'm good, good woman
But you still want more
