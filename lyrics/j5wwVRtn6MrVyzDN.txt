Take me to your house
Figure each other out
What is this feeling girl
Every day feels the same
And am I going insane
What is this feeling now

Am I dazed?
What is this face?
And am I dazed?
Or is this fate?

My mind [?] round and round
I see every thing that surrounds
What is this feeling now
Every day feels the same
And am I going insane
What is this feeling now

Am I dazed?
What is this face?
And am I dazed?
Or is this fate?
