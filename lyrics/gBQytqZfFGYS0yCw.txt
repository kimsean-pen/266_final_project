It's too bad about the races
The smile with friendly faces
And walk around and shaking hands and trying to fake it
All I need is Jaylen glasses & season passes for love,
Qe'll flunk more pre-show seats for something cheaper

All I C is u & me
If romance is dead then I'm a ghost who haunts around our favourite places
All I C is u & me
if romance is dead then I'm a ghost who haunts around our favourite places

It's too bad about the children
The drooled famous faces
And wishful trading
Places shouting
Momma's faceless

It's not me, it's you & me and everyone we know
The feely autumn, sober morning, so sick boredom

It's me i know I get lazy one shot away from crazy
The crazier the better sometimes cannon tells me
Now I feel that I'm a poser I'm already humping
All I need's a bendable no magazine it's tomten

All I C is u & me
If romance is dead then I'm a ghost who haunts around our favourite places
All I C is u & me
if romance is dead then I'm a ghost who haunts around our favourite places

All I C is u & me
if romance is dead then I'm a ghost who haunts around our favourite places
