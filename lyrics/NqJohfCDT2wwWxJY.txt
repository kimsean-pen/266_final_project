It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees

I wanna see this world
I wanne see it boiled
I wanna see this world
I wanna see it boiled

It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees

I wanna hear the dogs crying for water
I wanna see the fish go belly up in the sea
And all those lemurs and all those tiny creatures
I wanna see them burn
It's only 4 degrees

And all those rhynos and all those big mammals
I wanna see them lying crying in the fields

I wanna see them burn
It's only 4 degrees
I wanna see them burn
It's only 4 degrees
I wanna see them burn
It's only 4 degrees

I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them

I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them

I wanna burn the sky
I wanna burn the breeze
I wanna see the animals die in the trees

Oh let's let's go
It's only 4 degrees
Oh let's let's go
It's only 4 degrees
Oh let's let's go
It's only 4 degrees
Oh let's let's go
It's only 4 degrees

I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them

I wanna burn them
