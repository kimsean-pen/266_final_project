Back to ones
From the top, ready or not
Here it comes
For you and me
But that was easier said than done
In the light of day things can change from slim to none
I succumb
But loving you is a loaded gun

I, I, I don't wanna be this
No-o-body needs to see this
I, I try to resist
But the light's getting low to a glow 'till you're touching my lips

Wanna go but I wouldn't
I wanna stay when I shouldn't
I wanna say no when I couldn't

So meet me in the dark
Kiss me in the shadows of every spark
I know we shouldn't start
But baby I'm a slave to rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart

Meant to be
Or maybe just a dangerous fantasy
But before the fall
You were always real to me
And after me, comes to you so easily (easy)
But loving you just sticks to me

I, I, I don't wanna be this
No-o-body needs to see this
I, I try to resist
But the light's getting low to a glow 'till you're touching my lips

Wanna go but I wouldn't
I wanna stay when I shouldn't
I wanna say no when I couldn't

So meet me in the dark
Kiss me in the shadows of every spark
I know we shouldn't start
But baby I'm a slave to rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart

Slave to the rhythm
Slave to the rhythm, I know
Slave to the rhythm (I know)
Slave to the rhythm I know
Slave to the rhythm (I know)
Slave to the rhythm I know
Slave to the rhythm (I know)
Slave to the rhythm I know

But you don't leave me so

Meet me in the dark
Kiss me in the shadows of every spark
I know we shouldn't start, baby
But baby I'm a slave to rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
(The rhythm of your heart)
(The rhythm of your heart)
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
Oh, oh, the rhythm of your heart
(Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm I know)
