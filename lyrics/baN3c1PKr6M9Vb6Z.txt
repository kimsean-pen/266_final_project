Meet me in outer space

We could spend the night
watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
won't you come with me?
We could start again
How do you do it?

Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew
Meet me in outer space

I will hold you close, if you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place, it might be the only way
That I can show you how
it feels to be inside you
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?

It's better than I ever knew
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
You are stellar
You are stellar
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do

How do you do it?
Its better than I ever knew
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
