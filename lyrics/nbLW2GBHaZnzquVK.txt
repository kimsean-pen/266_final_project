Small man
big world
Lost beyond the pale
I know you
inside out
I can tell the tale

Across the sky
a change of time
Last night I lost a day
I'm here and there
or anywhere
away from Manderley

And if I were
the King of Rome
I couldn't be more tragic
My fate to roam
so far from home
in search of my lost magic

Oh, baby come back
Oh, baby come back to me

The desert moon
A new lagoon
We glide upon the surface
Night falls fast
No shadows cast
Arriving without purpose

Oh, baby call me
Oh, baby call me today

And if I were
the King of Rome
I couldn't be more lonely
With so much scope
to dream and hope
someday you'll deign to phone me

Oh, baby call me
Oh, baby call me today

I long for
your inscrutable pale face
I hunger for
your beautiful embrace
