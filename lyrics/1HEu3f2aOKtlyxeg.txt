Be kind to the bees
Be kind to the bugs
Be conscious of others
Be careful with drugs
Be kind to yourself
Even though it gets hard
Don't let the distractions
Stack up to the stars

Shave my head, burn my clothes, sell my car
I fell in another world
All the less I leave behind
Tell my ma I'll be fine
Another world
We all got lots to worry 'bout too
I still worry 'bout you

Be kind to the bees
Be kind to the bugs
Be conscious of others
Be careful with drugs
Be kind to yourself
Even though it gets hard
Don't let the distractions
Stack up to the stars
