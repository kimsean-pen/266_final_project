Made my way to past a man's hollow
Even though it was too soon
And all the kings men say there's no tomorrow so
I follow the sorrow song of the moon

Scriptures singin' man I can't seem to find my way back home
It's been a hundred years I've no idea which direction to go
This is my song of sorrow
This is my song of sorrow

This is my song of sorrow

Weak and wide eyed my pride is swallowed
I'm beggin' for my hearts last beat
And I'm repaying all the time I've borrowed
So forever the sorrow song I sing

Scriptures singin' man I can't seem to find my way back home
It's been a hundred years I've no idea which direction to go
This is my song of sorrow
This is my song of sorrow

Song of sorrow
Song of sorrow
Song of sorrow

Scriptures singin' man I can't seem to find my way back home
It's been a hundred years I've no idea which direction to go
Scriptures singin' man I can't seem to find my way back home
It's been a hundred years I've no idea which direction to go
This is my song of sorrow
This is my song of sorrow

This is my song of sorrow
