Memories burn
on the black and white horizon
of your knowledge of
what was never said

Uou've had enough of the road
that was laid along beside you
like a lover meant
for another bed

And so you left in the morning
and all that's left behind you
are the fading frames
that you've got instead

When you've had too much
and the weight of the expected
has got you feeling introspective
can I give you the perspective that you need

You've got a hazy head
but happy knees
and despite your inhibition
you'll take it to the streets
watching every face that you see

And when you've had too much

Take us to the place that satiates elation
give us all the space that we need

I know you just wanna see me breathe
but you better just hold on
and come back to me

Cuz I'll take you to the place where you
come down and just react
to what you're about to see

I'll take you to the place where you
come down and just react
to what you're about to see

You've had enough
too much
and all you have collected
is heavy with the taste
of ambition misdirected
bitter 'bout the pace that you keep

And so you left in the morning
and all that's left behind you
are the fading frames
that you've got instead
