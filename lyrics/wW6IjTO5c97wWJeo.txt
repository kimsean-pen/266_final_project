If you're going to get out,
you might as well get out with me.
If you're going downtown,
I might as well be on your way.

And I sit all night.
I sit still all night.
I won't tell one soul.
I won't tell one soul.

I just can't get it straight you see, and oh well.
That distraction inside of me, oh well.
I've just can't get it straight you see, and oh well.

It's fine by you.
I am fine by you.
I won't tell one soul.
I won't tell one soul.

If you're going down town,
take me with you, I don't care.
If I'm going to get out,
I just admit it, I only get out with you.
If I'm going to get out,
I just admit it, I only get out for you.

And I sit all night.
I sit still all night.
I won't tell one soul.
I won't tell one soul.

If you're going down town,
if your'e going down town,
will you leave here,
you'll leave here.

If you're going down town,
if your'e going down town,
will you leave here,
you'll leave here.

If you're going down town,
if your'e going down town,
will you leave here,
you'll leave here.

If you're going down town,
if your'e going down town,
will you leave here,
you'll leave here.

And I sit all night.
If your going downtown.
I sit still all night.
If you're going downtown.
I won't tell one soul.
If you're going downtown.
I won't tell one soul.
