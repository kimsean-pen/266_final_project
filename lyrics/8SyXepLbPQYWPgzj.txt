This is a cold world
And I'm dying to stay
As much as I wanted to
I am an old girl
In the fight of age
As much as I wanted to

As much as I wanted to
When I resolve into the crowd
Would I feel as if I found what it means?
When the world is beating me
As much as I wanted to
When I resolve into the crowd
Would I feel as if I found what it means?
When the world is beating me
As much as I wanted to
As much as I wanted to
Love me for as long as you can
Hold me for a temporary friend
I have no following
Love me, love me
Love me
I want you to know
I have no
