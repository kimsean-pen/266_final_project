Changes
My memories retain us
With their vibrations
Intuition
From the starlight visions
I'm foolish
I'm so foolish

I don't wanna go back

Soul sensations
I'm blessing for patience
Fetish in bristles
Thoughts in prison
Inhibitions
To us ain't wisdom
Your future's tainted
Darling, escape it
Tasteless
We are so tasteless
But we're healing
If you lose your feelings

Beware of the youth, Darling
