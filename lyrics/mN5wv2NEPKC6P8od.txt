I am what I am, so I spit you out!
Do i cut the ties, or do I hold on tight
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise

But it's my life!
(I'm takin back what's mine)
It's our time!
(To rise above)
It's my life!
(I'm takin back what's mine)
It's our time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over

I am what I am! so I spit you out
Can you justify how I...
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise

But it's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine)
It's our time!
(To rise above)
It's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine)
It's our time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over now!

I know you're faking
you try to get me back
I know you're faking it

Feel it's over
Feel it's over

{Live Talking}
Bullet For My Valentine
How We Doing Every One?
{End Live Talking}
But It's my life!
(I'm takin back what's mine)
It's our time!
(To rise above)
It's my life!
(I'm takin back what's mine)
It's our time!
(To rise above!)
