I should have known better
Than to expect it all
You want everything
And you end up grabbing at air

I had so much to give
So much hope, we held each other high
But the heroes are gone
And all that's left is you and me

I learned the hard way
That life should be easy
But I want you to know that it was hard to show
The things that I know now

All that's left is you and me
And here we are, nowhere

All that's left is you and me
And here we are, nowhere
