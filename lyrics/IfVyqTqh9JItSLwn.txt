it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye was half the words you knew
while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love, i sent my love

in a life built out of only goodbyes
is there even room for you to try
while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love, i sent my love

it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye was just what you do
in a life built out of only goodbye
is there even room for you
is there even room for you

while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love, i sent my love
