Wildflower
In winter you sleep
Cold in the ground
Never a sound
Wildflower

Wildflower
In springtime you wake
Leaves reaching up to the sun
Starting to speak
Wildflower, wildflower

You love the? of your kind
We love the valleys and mountains
Summer is here
Wildflower, wildflower, wildflower

Now autumn runs red
No warm rays are shed
But you left a beautiful seed asleep in your bed
Wildflower, wildflower, wildflower
Wildflower, wildflower, wildflower
