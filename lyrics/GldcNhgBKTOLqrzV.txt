look out get out of way
i'm going to the atomic cafe
i'm going to the atomic cafe
you're a mystery to me kabuki girl
don't say sayanaro
i want to see you tomorrow
i want to see you tonight
Your a mystery to me kabuki girl!

your face is white
your hair is black
you'll probably stab me in the back
but that's the chance i'm gonna take

don't say sayanaro
i want to see you tomorrow
i want to see you tonight
you're a mystery to me kabuki girl

east is east
west is west
girls from the east are the best
they got more of what i'm lookin' for

look out get out of way!
i'm going to the atomic cafe
i'm going to the atomic cafe
you're a mystery to me kabuki girl!
