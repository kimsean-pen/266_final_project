We've only got a few hours
So bring your body real close to mine
I don't wanna forget girl
The way this feels tonight

I wish you could come with me
So I always get to see those eyes
I don't wanna forget you
But we don't live a normal life

Don't be afraid when I'm state to state
From New York to LA
I don't wanna forget girl
The way this feels tonight

Girl I got you on my mind
The way this feels tonight

We both know that this day would come
And just like the setting sun
It's not how I feel inside
But girl, we had a good ride

Don't be afraid when I'm state to state
From New York to LA
I don't wanna forget girl
The way this feels tonight

Girl I got you on my mind
The way this feels tonight
But we're running out of time
The way this feels tonight

We've only got a few hours
So bring your body real close to mine
I don't wanna forget you

The way this feels tonight
And girl I got you on my mind
The way this feels tonight

Don't be afraid when I'm state to state
From New York to LA
And I don't wanna forget girl
The way this feels tonight
