Save the feeling from slipping
Torn to pieces I'm scattered
Make your dreams worth gripping
When I wake I'm dripping

I couldn't even pay for you
I couldn't even stay for you

Fourteen weeks I shiver
Cold and undelivered
Save the feeling from slipping
Torn to pieces I'm slipping

I couldn't even pay for you
I couldn't even stay for you

Reaching the front, stretching my arms
Feeling the blood rush now its done
Drowning at sea, blinded by sun
Seeking the low with everyone

Waiting for you, waiting for you
To sit down and tell me how I've done
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Accepting the mold that I've become
