All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine

Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leavin'
Broken hearts behind

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
Well that tangles me
To keep me alive

In all that exists
But none has your beauty
But I see your face
I will survive

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine above you
Will kiss you every night

All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine

Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leavin'
Yea, we're leavin'
Broken hearts behind

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine above you
Will kiss you every night

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
