Show me what you're worth
Get up
Facedown, thinking out loud
He's so hardcore when he's running his mouth
There's always gonna be that fucking guy
You got a few things bottled up
Jump on a couple bottles like double dutch
JÃ¤ger got you faded when society's got you jaded
How do you expect to grow
When all you wanna do is break
It's time to let shit go
And let the chorus play

No, I don't wanna be tough
I wanna make sure they can see me cry sure enough
Don't wanna bottle this up
The way you make me feel when you're around
Tough guy dies a little inside
This town might show no love
But kid you gotta wake up

This is the real world
And you're only hurting yourself
When you spend every waking moment
With your fingers crossed
I don't think you can afford
To set karma further in motion

Go ahead
No one cares
Talk shit you mean nothing
Talk shit you mean nothing

No, I don't wanna be tough
I wanna make sure they can see me cry sure enough
Don't wanna bottle this up
The way you make me feel when you're around
Tough guy dies a little inside
This town might show no love
But no, I don't wanna be tough

Ask me what I see in you
I don't see nothing, I see right through
You're transparent, I know you don't wanna hear it
And I don't wanna be the person to slip up and hurt your feelings
I guess they don't wanna say it to your face
But I will 'cause somebody gotta put you in your place
I'm not afraid to scream and shout
And fr-fr-fr-fr-freak out and throw my hands up
And l-let it out
Punk bitch walking tall like you got something to prove
Nah man, 'cause deep down you know it sucks to be you
Stingray affliction
Making small stabs in passing
But the pain is bigger than it seems
Stop holding me under and let me breathe

Just let me breathe
The pain is bigger than it seems
A tough guy dies a little inside
Just let me breathe
The pain is bigger than it seems
Stop holding me under and let me breathe
