One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
I'd lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
And what I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turned around
Fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck
She was waiting outside the door

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And not meant to be
Took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day
That I breathe for
Friends agree, there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend on losing again

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turned around
Fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck
She was waiting outside the door

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend on losing again
