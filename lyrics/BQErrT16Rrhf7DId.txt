For every child there dawns a day
They wonder from where they come
Why is the sky so pink tonight
How fast to clouds fly by
And so you come up with stories you tell
Eyes are open wide when you tell them about the sky
'N all that beneath resides

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make'em big and blue
The factory eats you, it swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream, at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave
The cloud factory

If you join the same brigade I did when I was young
You will never see beyond the skyline of this town
Take my word, my son, and run
While your dreams fly free
Have them write my story down
Like silence breaking sound

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make'em big and blue
The factory eats you, it swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream, at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave
The cloud factory

It's sad if you never leave you believe what you see
And you follow the lead, but the eyes, they deceive
There is nothing to see but cloud factory dreams...
But hey, isn't it fun at the end of the day
When everyone looks like me?
Swallowing pints of stale apathy
Having dreams where I would be
without the factory

If you ever dream, at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
There's no hook, no sinker, no line
And you will never leave
The cloud factory

There is a factory clouds are made in
They make'em big and blue
The factory eats you, it swallows you whole
It fills you with conceit
And never lets you leave
If you ever dream, at the end of the day
That you're gonna live as a free man
Irony shall be the justice you find
In case you ever leave
The cloud factory
