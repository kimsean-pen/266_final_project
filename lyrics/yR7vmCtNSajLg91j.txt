You know, I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know, I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if I'm feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling

For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know, I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens

You know, I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know-ow, I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling

For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know, I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens

(I would get beat to...)
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one on the record for you

You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her...

Feeling someone stepping towards you
Can't describe just what I'm feeling
For you, I'd go write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know they think it's messed up to sell out for your girl

For you, I'd go step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you, I would get beat to smithereens
