Lost and found
I found myself
In a hopeful place
In a hopeless state
And I crossed the line between what's wrong and right-fully so
I gave my dignity to make it on my own

Abandonment adopted me
When being true to myself did all but set me free
Birth giver, tell me how could you give
Your offspring to the darkness you've been hiding in

I spend my days fighting off my bad luck
If these streets could talk I'd conversate
And they'd tell me to stay up

Ay sleepwalker tell me where have you been
All of my life, I've been trying to fit in
I've been talking to walls
Feeling my heart rate
Feeling so small
This world is a big place
And I ain't got nowhere to go, so take me on a roll

At my lowest, means hit the ends and I'm so ashamed
Sinking further into sorrow and regret
I've paved my way through a maze I'll never complete
I can't see the sun from how dark it's gotten impossible to dig out

I spend my days fighting off my bad luck
If these streets could talk I'd conversate
And they'd tell me to stay up

Ay sleepwalker tell me where have you been
All of my life, I've been trying to fit in
I've been talking to the walls
Feeling my heart rate
Feeling so small
This world is a big place
And I ain't got nowhere to go, so take me on a roll

I found myself inside
A self created bliss
And now I'm more alive
Than I have ever been
I spare no expense
Shit, I ain't even got none to spend

Ay sleepwalker tell me where have you been
All of my life, I've been trying to fit in
I've been talking to the walls
Feeling my heart rate
Feeling so small
This world is a big place
And I ain't got nowhere to go, so take me on a roll
