you told me the sun would always rise
and if it shouldn't shine have faith
'cause one day that great burning star's light
one once again dance across my face

I heard the roar of the parting seas
and the mourning of a blackened sun
I saw the last flower wither away
when our flesh turned to stone
I felt the frigid blood in my veins grow still
like winter's paralyzed streams
as the soil beneath our feet gave way
to iron and asphalt dreams

when nighttime stars flicker with grief and despair
and dusk threatens senses too dazed to stay clear
their heavens will beckon,
and angels will whisper my name
wings of scarlet hue, their truth soaked in blood
on wounded knees I've crawled
through the nameless streets of this world I love

my heart is heavy with burden
I'm feeling empty inside
so fill me up and give me a taste of life

give me a place to hide, mother
offer me your caress and let it last forever
let me cry in your arms
let me die in your embrace

my hands have held your paradise
your heavens blazed
from upon the highest hills,
my lonely and wanting eyes did gaze
for I was in love with life and this world
but they tried to take that from me
if this is the reward of the harvest
then I gladly give you my share
