For all those born to serve
And those that chose to hide
(how many worker bees died within our hive)
Let their sadness be our blessing
Let their losses
Lead the way

The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come

For all those born to die
And those that lost the fight
(how many fallen friends died within our sights)
Let their hard roads be our way out
Let their passion lead the way

The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come

No matter the man or the machine
Beasts will become what
They were meant to be
In the name of lovers in the name of wars
We'll show the demons for what they are

Dark horse ride
Towards the light
Dark horse ride onward

Towards to light
Onward
