My my my what fangs you have
Once upon a time
Your eyes were wide not dead

Then all the energy reverse the chemistry
You'd better not mess with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red

You should've warned me you were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
With all the energy reverse the chemistry
You'd better not mess with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is... blood red
Blood red

So tell me what it's like living with your disease?
You walk the streets at night
Looking like a well dressed thief, oh

With all the chemistry destroy the memories
You'd better mess with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red

You should've warned me you were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
With all the energy reverts the chemistry
You better not mess with the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is blood red
Blood red

You should've warned me you were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
With all the energy reverse the chemistry
You'd better not mess with the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is
Blood red
