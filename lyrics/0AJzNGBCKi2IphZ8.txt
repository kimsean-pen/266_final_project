She's posting all the time, but the boards are down.
It's a burned out building.
He's spending all his time on his back
Staring at the ceiling.

They spend themselves that way
I'm with that, I'm with them.

Come on, You arent. you are,... Alive, Dammit.

Gnawing on the prey.
I think about you some.
Where to put you all. backed up data for the raining time
Insulate a fragile mind
Capsulize a broken find

Don't do this man
There's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without,... warning.
Don't do this man
There's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without,... warning. without,...

She just ignores the time that the boards came down
It's a numbed out feeling.
He just accepts that pain.a hate mantra
A spiritual killing

They just relax that way
I'm with that, I'm with them. you arent, you are,...alive damnit

Crayon past the line, stay after school
Crossword filled in non-photo blue

So now they'll never find you

I get the same result
We get the same effect
I get the same result
We get the same effect

Cant go through this now,
im leaving a message,...
Stapled on your head...

Don't do this man
There's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning.
repeat.
repeat.
end.
