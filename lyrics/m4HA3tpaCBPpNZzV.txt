Every day she wakes up
Her life will be a movie
All the things she does, written in her diary
But when the day is done, she cannot tell the truth

Pretend her life's exciting
Pretend she'll never lose

Talulah Gosh was a present story day
Talulah Gosh was a pop celebrity
You can lie to everyone
But please, please don't lie to me

Now she is a popstar
With her own TV show
Tells them all her stories
And hopes they'll never know

Don't be anybody else
Forget about the rest
You'll always be Talulah
You'll always be yourself

Talulah Gosh was a present story day
Talulah Gosh was a pop celebrity
You can lie to everyone
But please, please don't lie to me

Talulah Gosh was a present story day
Talulah Gosh was a pop celebrity
You can lie to everyone
But please, please don't lie to me
