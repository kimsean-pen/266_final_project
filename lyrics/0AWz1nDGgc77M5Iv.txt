24 hours awake
Intertwined with the smoke in the hospital
24 hours awake
A ghost walking through the halls like a ritual
Kill the king, abuse the queen,
take the successors, but keep me awake
24 hours awake
Don't let me sleep for god's sake

24 hours awake
Increasingly far from you
24 hours awake
Increasingly far from you
24 hours awake, 24 hours awake
1440 minutes

24 hours awake
Clock hands as dripping needles
don't hold the time
24 hours awake
Running the fastest that I can, don't ask me why
Intertwined with the smoke that rises
from the manholes under the cold ground
24 hours awake
Don't let me fall when it starts the day

24 hours awake
Increasingly far from you
24 hours awake
Increasingly far from you
24 hours awake, 24 hours awake
86400 seconds
