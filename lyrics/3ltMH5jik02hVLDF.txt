Oh, it's raining again
Oh no, my love's at an end
Oh no, it's raining again
And you know it's hard to pretend

Oh no, it's raining again
Too bad I'm losing a friend
Oh no, it's raining again
Oh will my heart ever mend

You're old enough some people say
To read the signs and walk away
It's only time that heals the pain
And makes the sun come out again

It's raining again
Oh no, my love's at an end
Oh no, it's raining again
Too bad I'm losing a friend

Na na na na na na
Na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na

Come on you little fighter
No need to get uptighter
Come on you little fighter
And get back up again

It's raining again
Oh no, my love's at an end
Oh no, it's raining again
Too bad I'm losing a friend

Na na na na na na
Na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na

Come on you little fighter
No need to get uptighter
Come on you little fighter
And get back up again
Oh, get back up again
Oh, fill your heart again

It's raining, it's pouring
The old man is snoring
He went to bed and bumped his head
And he couldn't get up in the morning
