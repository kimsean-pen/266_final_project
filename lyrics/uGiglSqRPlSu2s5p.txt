Oh, pretty woman
sure's the rising sun.
Says all your cheap paint and powder
ain't gonna help you none.

'Cause she's a pretty woman
right down to her bone.
So you might as well
leave your skin alone.

Pretty woman,
what's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do.

Oh, pretty woman,
whatcha gonna do?
You kept on foolin' around
till I got stuck on you.

So you can drop your mess
and come down off your throne,
stop using my poor heart
as just a stepping stone.

Pretty woman,
what's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do.

Oh, pretty woman
that's all right for you.
Now you just go on doing
what you wanna do.

But someday when you think
that you've got it made,
you're gettin' water deep enough
so you can't wade.

Pretty woman,
what's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do.

Oh, pretty woman.
Oh, pretty woman.
Oh, pretty woman.
Oh, pretty woman.
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do. No!

Can't make you love me
no matter what I do. No!
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do.

Oh, pretty woman,
I just can't make you love me.
Oh, no.
