Be kind, baby, be kind
Be kind, baby, be kind
The light of this might
Aligns your legs to time

They give me up as I got mine
And that's too many times
Baby, be kind
And my eyelids are fine

Don't let your eyes pop out, boy
You may drop your black, candy apple
From the fright of having your eyes pop out
And someone else buys seeing double

So, be kind, baby, be kind
Won't cha be kind? Baby, be kind

Now, the way if he drops
The ants will cover him up like a black seed eye
I said you'd get 'em back, dear
But don't you try to puff 'em all up
But, baby, dear, don't you try

To be kind, baby, be kind
Be kind, baby, be kind
You know the light of this whole world and mine
Aligns your legs to time

The lake, it ain't your fire
And that is all I've had
Too many had done, these eyelids mine
Don't let your eyes pop out
You might drop them on your stove
And they'll wiggle on home
