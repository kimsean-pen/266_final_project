No hope of rescue
I'm trapped here alone
If I don't dig my own way out I'll die here

Gave my loyalty too soon
Now the fork-tongued viper's dead
... Is dead yeah yeah

Weather is shiftin'
So cold goin' up
Through a pinhole of light I see vultures circlin'

Bottom feeders dig my skin
Winner bring a parasite
With him

Weak or pulverized
No better medicine
Angels have been advised
Don't want no requiem

I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb

Gonna wear you like a second skin
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb

(Solo)

Every new second
Getting harder to break
No matter which side I end up on
This ain't over

My regrets are very true
Still so much was lies (again?)...
By you

Weak or pulverized
No better medicine
Angels have been advised
Don't want no requiem

I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb

Gonna wear you like a second skin
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb
