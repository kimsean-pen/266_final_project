Something wrong something right something missing
Something black something light something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way

Something black something light something different
Something wrong something right something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way

All this noise in my head bringing through a nickelling
Simple things just take too long long long

It's not like I am not listening but you just keep on flipping in
Maybe one day I'll be gone gone gone

Something wrong something right something missing
Something black something light something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way

Something black something light something different
Something wrong something right something missing
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
To me that way

Trying leave a past behind me
Could you just keep reminding me and through it in my face so wrong wrong wrong

I trying see things your way but something changes everything
And every question way to long long long

Something wrong something right something missing
Something black something light something different
Don't you ever feel you need to

Speak to me that way
Something black something light something different
Something wrong something right something missing
Don't you even feel you need to speak to me that way
To me that way
To me that way
I'll be missing yesterday taking me so far away
Far where I belong taking me someone I never known
Something wrong something right something missing
Something black something light something different
Don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way
Something black something light something different
Something wrong something right something missing
Don't you even feel you need to speak to me that way
To me that way
To me that way
