Felt sure you felt something
Felt sure I know you were sleeping
You felt you're only kissing
They're only feelings, baby, they're only feelings

Felt I'd left you hanging
Felt sure the silence of killing
You felt but I saw you leaving
They're only feelings, baby, they're only feelings

What's real is real inside
What's real is real inside
What's real is real inside
What is real
I still get you, do you still get me

Felt icy on my skin
Felt sure sensational clinging
You felt your electrical thinking
They're only feelings, baby, they're only feelings
