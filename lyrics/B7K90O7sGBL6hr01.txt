(I totally saw him
Last week)
(I'm like
"OMG, this is terrible")
(Do you think, OMG, that Grace could come back today?)
(Gonna be mad)
(I know)

Hugs and kisses
Best friends forever, you tell me
Pinky swears and bracelets
Always telling secrets
At slumber parties

Not trying to point any fingers
But I've heard the whispers going around
Not trying to point you out here
Just making the facts clear
That I have found

That you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in the gossip, girl

We were closer than sisters
I was the miss to your mister
You were the light to my fixture
I was the frame to your picture
We were closer than sisters
I was the miss to your mister
You were the light to my fixture
I was the frame to your picture

But you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in the
Gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in the

Gossip girls they always seem to
Talk the talk about you
Gossip girls they always seem to
Talk the talk but never say the truth

That you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in the
Gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in the gossip girl
