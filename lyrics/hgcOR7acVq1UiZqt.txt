I got her happy on my sheets when I wake up
I got her cute little logo printed on my makeup, oh
And when I shop I look for her face like every time
And when I see her, I just got to make her mine
Hold on, hey what's that?
Girly, is that new? Where'd you get that at?
'Cause I've got to have you
It just looks so pretty, I've got to have you
Got to have you, got to have you, got to have you

Gorgeous, girly cute
Yeah, I just wanna wear the shit that all the girlies do
And I swear, swear it to the God above
That no one else compares to the way I love
She's so gorgeous, girly cute
Yeah, I just wanna wear the shit that all the girlies do
And I swear, swear it to the God above
That no one else compares to the way I love

Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty

Got her cute pink toaster making all my breakfast
Got her face on my clothes every time I go and get dressed, oh
Got her bling on my phone 'cause I like to make it shine
When I see her I just got to make her mine

So much stuff, I hardly can keep track
Girl, is it cool if I borrow that?
I'm obsessed with everything in pink
Head to toe in Hello Kitty things

Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, Hello Kitty

She's so gorgeous, girly cute
Yeah, I just wanna wear the shit that all the girlies do
And I swear, swear it to the God above
That no one else compares to the way I love

Hello Kitty, kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty
Hello Kitty, kitty
