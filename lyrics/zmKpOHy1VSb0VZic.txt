Three, two, one

What a lowlife spend on a four, five
Pedal to the metal 'cause
I never wanna take it slow
Went on with the rebels, weed in the kettle
Time it all back in crash kid row
I'm bleeding, screaming, threaten my demons
Something I shoulda done years ago
Eye dilation, no motivation
Thinking 'bout how I've hit an all-time low

Take a look and see what you find
Time is our enemy
Grab a pill and leave it all behind
Better living through chemistry

Yeah, we've all been running blind
You can't stand the casualties
Your vision's not sustainable
Better living through chemistry

Take a nosedive, pop it into overdrive
Eighty milly 'cause I'm illy, then I hit the floor
Check my level, bass drum and treble
Meet me up at the liquor store
And the season's reasons, thinking 'bout Jesus
The shrine in and out the door
Education, nation, standing ovation
Better step back 'cause I'm wanted for

Take a look and see what you find
Time is our enemy
Grab a pill and leave it all behind
Better living through chemistry

We've all been running blind
You can't stand the casualties
Your vision's not sustainable
Better living through chemistry

(This rear side)
Because our science is defiance
The vibrant book of compliance
When you're giving, you're a riot
That ain't me, can't tell me who to be
Reverse psychology
I'd rather come in last than first

Take a look and see what you find
Time is our enemy
Grab a pill and leave it all behind
Better living through chemistry

We've all been running blind
You can't stand the casualties
Your vision's not sustainable
Better living through chemistry
