It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I don't really care where he's been
It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I won't turn him around this time
No, no, no

I'll be your cliff
(You can fall down from me)
I'll be your ledge
(You can lean upon me)
I'll be your bridge
(Your flowering tree)
You can still depend on me
And I'll be
(The ticking of your clock)
And I'll be
(The numbers on your watch)
And I'll be
(Your hands to stop the time)
I'll even be your danger sign

It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I don't really care where he's been
It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I won't turn him around this time
No

And I'll be
(Your grace, your dignity)
And I'll be
(Your night, your destiny)
And I'll be
(Your comfort and your ease)
I will be your storm at seas
And I'll be
(Your sharp intake of breath)
And I'll be
(Your work, I'll take no rest)
And when the world falls to decline
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I don't really care where he's been

I'll be
(You can fall down from me)
I'll be
(You can lean upon me)
I'll be
(Your bridge, your flowering tree)
You can still depend on me
And I'll be
(The ticking of your clock)
And I'll be
(The numbers on your watch)
And I'll be
(Your hands to stop the time)
I'll even be your danger sign
Woo ahh haa woo ooo

It's alright, baby's comin' back
(Ahh haa hai)
And I won't turn him around this time
(Woo no no no no no no)

It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I don't really care where he's been
It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I won't turn him around this time
It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I don't really care where he's been
It's alright, baby's comin' back
And I won't turn him around this time
