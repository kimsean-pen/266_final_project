In the arms of another
Who doesn't mean anything to you
There's nothing much to discover

Does he shake, does he shiver
As he sidles up to you
Like I did in my time?

As you wake
Does he smother you in kisses
Long and true?
Does he even think to bother?

And at night, under-covered
As he sliding into you
Does it set your sweat on fire?

Want you so bad I can taste it
But you're nowhere to be found
Now take a drug to replace it
Or put me in the ground

In the arms of another
Who doesn't mean anything to you
Do you lose yourself in wonder?
If I could I would hover
While he's makin' love to you,
Making rain as I cry

Want you so bad I can taste it
But you're nowhere to be found
Now take a drug to replace it
Or put me in the ground

Put me in the ground
