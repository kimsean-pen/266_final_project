Haven't felt right in a week
And I'm thinning out
And it hurts bad
I gotta get back
Hot head and dreamless sleep
I could just slip down
And on the wrong track
I gotta get back
I wanna spend the entire year
Just face down
And on my own time
I wanna waste mine
And spend the rest of it asking myself
"Is this who you are?"
And I don't know
It just feels gross
I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
Sunlight on the back of my arms
Just thins me out
To a different time
I wanna waste mine
