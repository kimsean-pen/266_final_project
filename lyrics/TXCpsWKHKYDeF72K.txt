We had too much to drink
Forgot that we overthink
You showed me how to be
Told me that I flee
When things are new to me
I don't even smoke weed
It gives me anxiety
But when I'm with you
I'm too careless to
Care what people think

I'm in the palm of your hand
Eating out the palm of your hand
I don't always know what to say
But you always understand

I'm in the palm of your hand
Eating out the palm of your hand
I don't always know what to say
But you always understand

Shock
Shock

We have nowhere to be
We lost track obsessively
I miss you when you're gone
Although is never long
It's still a marathon

I fuck up everything
Find myself embarrassing
You don't seem to mind
Just as long as I'm
Honest everytime

I'm in the palm of your hand
Eating out the palm of your hand
I don't always know what to say
But you always understand

I'm in the palm of your hand
Eating out the palm of your hand
I don't always know what to say
But you always understand

Shock

Shock

Shock

Shock
