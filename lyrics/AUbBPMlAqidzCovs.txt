Talk of circles, punching out
Looking in, drawing circles down
Falling off the south
Marking ground

Talking out of turn
Drawing circles down

Like Pilate, I have a dog
Like Pilate, I have a dog

Walks me out of town
Still one's a crowd

Making angels in the dirt
Looking up, looking all around
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog

(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)

Stunned by my own reflection
It's looking back
Sees me too clearly
And I swore I'd never go there again
Not unlike a friend that
Politely drags you down
You down, you down, you down
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
