Everything changed that day I saw the great white light
And passed through to the other side.
In a moment of madness when time stood still,
All that was wrong, felt perfectly fine.
I was never a saint, more like a sinner.
But I knew my rights from my wrongs.
That living for the sake of loving,
Was where my heart always belonged.

You'll always have a place in my heart,
Even after death pulls us apart.

I am the ghost that haunts this place.
The cold that always touches your face.
The thought that sends her weak at the knees.
I sing the songs that get lost in the breeze.

I am the ghost that haunts this place.
The cold that always touches your face.
The thought that sends her weak at the knees.
I sing the songs that get lost in the breeze.

I am the entity.

Oh what I'd do to let you see me smiling down at you.
I'll be the light to guide you from harms way
And fight to keep your demons at bay.

If you need me, just pray.

I am the ghost that haunts this place.
The cold that always touches your face.
The thought that sends her weak at the knees.
I sing the songs that get lost in the breeze.

You'll always have a place in my heart,
Even after death pulls us apart.

I am the entity.
