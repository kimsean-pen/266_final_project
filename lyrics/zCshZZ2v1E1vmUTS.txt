Who would've thought in my loneliness

You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad, baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah

We fall fast, we smoke gas
Staying with the fear trying to keep it on the tracks
Cop coming and dash
Back on relapse
Tryna survive tonight where the fuck I am
Two bars in my mouth looking like a slushi
You always wanna chill but you love me for my money
I don't really know her but she really love me
Baby I'm a stoner, you ain't getting nothing

You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad, baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah

You can pop off, hop off
You're not gonna talk bout why you're so down
I can hear no sound
Lynch me, burn me
Lynch me, burn me yeah
I can never find her
She's always hiding
Never met the girl I love, so blinded
Yeah, yeah you're so blinded

I don't want you, you don't want me
Fallingt for you, I'm bleeding
You know what to do, this isn't guaranteed
I walk in a pretty hell for you yeah

You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad, baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah

Bought a little drugs, that's money well spent
I ain't stumble on a problem when it's all in my head
Bought a little drugs, that's money well spent
I ain't stumble on a problem when it's all in my head

You could be mad cause baby I'm a loner yeah
You could be sad, baby I'm a loner
