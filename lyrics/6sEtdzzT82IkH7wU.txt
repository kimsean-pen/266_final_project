Are you lying on your bed alone tonight
while he watches TV?
Can you hear it coming through the floor boards
while you're thinking of me
Everybody told you baby
you got married to young
But you didn't wanna listen, did you?
Thought you're right and they're wrong, oh
Jenifer, I know we were young
and God only knows what we could have become
but I hate the thing about you lonely
I'm stretched out saying someone hold me tonight

I only left six months ago now
and you're wearing his ring
Like it all never happened, like it didn't mean a thing
Do you remember the kiss done by the river
that ended up your door?
Then a swift invitation to
come up to the second floor, oh
Jenifer you know where I am
if you can't see me, I'll understand that you don't need someone to talk to
you just want my arms around you
for one more night, of us together
one more night, just you and me
one more night, to hold you closely
one more night, to hear you scream

Oh, Jenifer, I know we were young
and God only knows what we could have become
but I hate the thing about you lonely
I'm stretched out saying someone hold me
going one more night, of us together
one more night, just you and me
one more night, to hold you closely
one more night, to hear you scream
One more night, of us together
one more night, just you and me
one more night, to hold you closely
one more night, to hear you scream
