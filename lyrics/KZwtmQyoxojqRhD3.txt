Pleasant feeling
With a pair of sneakers
It looks like my backseat is leaving.
Along the wind
My heart also depends
My afternoon showers

A fragrant wine and a piece of sweet cake
Tired day lonely comforts my heart
Along the wind
My heart also depends
My afternoon showers

Pleasant feeling
With a pair of sneakers
It looks like my backseat is leaving.
Along the wind
My heart also depends
My afternoon showers
