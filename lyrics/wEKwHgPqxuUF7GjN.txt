Save us
If you thought
You knew it all
Don't shift your view,
You might slip and fall
A long way down and down this rabbit hole
If the tunnel runs any deeper
You might come out the other side of the world
Maybe upside down you'll be able to see
This isn't what it seems
We are far from free
We're caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper
Into the unknown

We're caught in the undertow
Follow the leader
Down with the undertow
Action floats in limbo
Like driftwood in the sea
Under CCTV, so dig down deep
The more you uncover,
The more you disbelieve
The more you will discover
We are far from free
Heroes exposing

Corruption in who we obey
Blow the whistle from a burning stake

The whistle blows from a burning stake
Corruption won't keep revolution at bay
We're caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper
Into the unknown
We're caught in the undertow
Follow the leader
Down with the undertow
Spied on,
Lifelong,
Collection 24/7
Archives of all we've done
Satellites track our lives beyond the skies
Not even your mind can hide
From big brother's eyes

It's time to take back our home
