I made the news today
Because I hurt my friends
They scribbled down my name
Tied both my hands behind my head

They made me meditate
To analyze my mental state
They looked inside my brain
It turns out I'm not okay

Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
That I bought for fun
Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun

I don't give a fuck about myself
All they do is analyze my mental health
I don't give a fuck about myself
You're making us famous
You're making us famous

I drank some bleach today
Because they forced me to
Hide it with lemonade
Round about 10 to two
I ate a razor blade
Just for attentions sake
I'm just wired up that way
If you're not watching me

Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
That I bought for fun
Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun

I don't give a fuck about myself
All they do is analyse my mental health
I don't give a fuck about myself
You're making us famous
You're making us famous

I don't give a fuck about myself
All they do is analyse my mental health
I don't give a fuck about myself
You're making us famous
You're making us famous

Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun (My machine gun)
That I bought for fun
Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun (My machine-)

Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
That I bought for fun
Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
You better fuckin' run

Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
That I bought for fun
Wanna see my machine gun
Wanna see my machine gun
My new machine gun
You better fuckin' run
