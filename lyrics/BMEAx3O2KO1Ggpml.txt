It was the morning of october 6th, 1960
I was wearing my brown suit
Preparing to leave the house of d.
Shook some hands then adios brooklyn amigos
Maybe some of them had hopes of seeing me again
Some even said that my judge-judge gerald culkin-
Wouldn't play it by the book
Maybe let us off the hook
But, woh-oo-woh, I knew better.

Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood

The blancos and the nigger gangs
Well, they'd kill you if they could.

Angel of mercy, people are suffering
All over the world
Spanish children are taught on their knees to believe
Angel of mercy, people are suffering
All over the island tonight,
Mothers weep

Sisters grieve

Well, I entered the courtroom, state of new york
County of new york, just some spic
They scrubbed off the sidewalk
Guilty by my dress
Guilty in the press
Let the capeman burn for the murder
Well the 'spanish boys' had their day in court
And now it was time for some fuckin' law and order
The electric chair
For the greasy pair
Said the judge to the court reporter

Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood

The newspapers and the t.v. crews
Well, they'd kill you if they could

Angel of mercy, people are suffering
All over the world
A spanish boy could be killed every night of the week

But just let some white boy die
And the world goes crazy for blood-latin blood.
I don't lie when I speak.

Well they shackled my hands

A heavy belt around my waist to restrain me

And they shackled my legs

Hernandez, the 'umbrella man,' chained beside me
Then we rode that black maria
Through the streets of spanish harlem
Calling old friends on the corners

Just to lay our prayers upon them

Crying
Adios hermanos, adios

Adios hermanos, adios
