When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stay strong
(yeah yeah)
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

(bu dum du dum du dum)

When she walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle
Say
(yeah yeah)
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She (gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
Right there, Right there when I need her
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
Right there, Right there when I need her
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
Right there, Right there when I need her
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
Right there, Right there when I need her
(gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention)
Right there, Right there when I need her

O oh oh para para para

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
