Gonna have myself a beer and maybe I'll feel better
Gonna have myself a beer and maybe I'll feel alright
Gonna have myself a beer and then I will forget her
Gonna have myself a beer, I'm gonna be drinkin' all night

And if I pass out on the floor, please don't bother me
If I pass out on the floor, well just leave me where I lie
If I pass out on the floor, just step over me
If I pass out on the floor, she won't bother me no more

Gonna have myself a beer and maybe I'll feel better
Gonna have myself a beer and maybe I'll feel alright
Gonna have myself a beer and then I will forget her
Gonna have myself a beer, I'm gonna be drinkin' all night

If I pass out on the floor, please don't bother me
If I pass out on the floor, well just leave me where I lie
If I pass out on the floor, then just step over me
If I pass out on the floor, she won't bother me no more
