We're only flesh and blood
Under the fading sun
Two hearts that beat as one
Raised on the battlegrounds

Call on me, call on me
Set me free, set me free
This is your destiny

There's a bad moon on the rise
I will fight for you
I'll go through fire and ice
There's nothing I won't do
And the winds will paint the sky
Hear them call my name
Stormbringer, stormbringer
Stormbringer

My road is an open field
I follow the northern star
Your soul is your only shield
The way of the warrior

Come with me, come with me
Let it be, let it be
This is your destiny

There's a bad moon on the rise
I will fight for you
I'll go through fire and ice
There's nothing I won't do
And the winds will paint the sky
Hear them call my name
Stormbringer, stormbringer
Stormbringer

And the tears will ease your pain
Fall like rain
Stormbringer
Let the lightning lead the way

There's a bad moon on the rise
I will fight for you
And the winds will paint the sky
Hear them call my name
Stormbringer, stormbringer
There's a bad moon on the rise
I will fight for you
I'll go through fire and ice
There's nothing I won't do
And the winds will paint the sky
Hear them call my name
Stormbringer, stormbringer
Stormbringer
Stormbringer
