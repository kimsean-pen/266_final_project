In the life of a Mack
In the life of a Mack

(I) swear a bitch will always want some mo'
Take a piss, wash my dick, then I'm out the fuckin' do'

Stiff one, arm hug, nothin' mushy
Gotta jet dick still smellin' like pussy

Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up

Now I'm lookin' through my nigga' dash tryna find a cigarette
Breakfast date with Nicolette, but she got a ho because a nigga blew his last one, I gotta cop and pack some

It took a two ... to mack that bitch
Nigga, watch and observe my mack antics

She ain't, she ain't never seen nothin' like this
Two braids, west coast, straight bumpin' like this

It was almost 2, I had to go anyway
But before I left there was somethin' I had to say

Ya daddy rich, huh? Tell 'em that you mess with me
Tell 'em that I'm next up, he needa come invest in me

Straight makin' that money, straight makin' that money
Young playas gettin' raised out here
'N all the chicken-head bitches want to braid my hair

Straight takin' that money, straight takin' that money
It's all good, no sweat off my back
Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack

It's almost 3, and I had her waitin' for nothin'
So now she cryin' 'n fussin', she think I'm fuckin' 'er cousin

I say, "Hold up, can you prove that?
Bitch, are you sure? The last time I saw that bitch was back in 2004."

She was bad, you can't blame it on shit-since back when
Freak-A-Leek was on the radio, 'n shit

If I remember correctly, don't ever sweat me
Don't think I won't turn yo broken heart into confetti

Round 6, got a call from an unknown
Musta been some ancient bitches playin' up on my phone

Hit the sto' and got a bottle of rum
They gave it to me cause they know me, motherfucker, I ain't 21

Had to kill it, feelin' made right now
Then went on a drunk mission to my main bitch' house

Got some pussy then I passed out
Woke up and hit (it) again cause she was sleepy wit her ass out

Straight makin' that money, straight makin' that money
Young playas gettin' raised out here
'N all the chicken-head bitches want to braid my hair

Straight takin' that money, straight takin' that money
It's all good, no sweat off my back
Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack
