We don't want them, we want everything
And we've chosen, to want everything
We don't want them, who want everything
And we've stolen in this suffering
And we've told them to want everything

But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
When they're broken and lost everything

They're so much easier to lead
Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing

Left inside
When your own have died, when there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken a thousand times

With every moment, is that enough?
(Without warning, we take everything)
Without warning, we take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
The dark forces surround everything

Make it impossible to see
Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing

Left inside
When your own have died, when there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken a thousand times

With every moment, is that enough?
Haven't they suffered enough?
Haven't we suffered enough?
Haven't they suffered enough?

They're damage more then they can bear
Haven't they suffered enough?
Haven't we suffered enough?
Haven't they suffered enough?

They're damage more then I can BEAR!
Did they even have a reason why
Countless sons and daughters had to die?
Can you even comprehend the pain?

Tell me when your
Own have died, when there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken a thousand times
With every moment, is that enough?
When your own have died (Own have died)
When there's no more pride (No more pride)
When your soul is frozen, is that enough? (Is that enough?)
When your heart is broken a thousand times (A thousand times)
With every moment, is that enough?
