Lincoln, here's a song for you
I've been twisting in the vapors and the fumes
There is nothing that I can say to you now
That you have not already heard

Lincoln, you cheated me again
From the highways, I had visions and the shakes
There is no one who can take me from this land
More than once, I was captured in your lens

Fall back, let the sunshine blind your eyes
Hear the voices of your lovers be your guide
There are many windows open in the house
They are letting out our secrets with the heat

There is nothing to hide
There is nothing to hide
There is nothing, nothing left to hide

Dear shipwrecked, I, too, am waiting to be saved
I had my prayers and praises all sent back
Heaven is full of people who belong
Heaven is full of people who belong

There is nothing to hide
There is nothing to hide
There is nothing, nothing left to hide
