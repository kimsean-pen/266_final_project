I know that the bridges that I've burned along the way
Have left me with these walls and these scars that won't go away
And opening up has always been the hardest thing
Until you came
So lay here beside me... just hold me and don't let go
This feeling, I'm feeling is something I've never known

And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you
I love when you tell me that I'm pretty when I just wake up
And I love how you tease me when I'm moody, but it's never too much

I'm falling fast but the truth is I'm not scared at all
You climbed my walls
So lay here beside me... just hold me and don't let go
This feeling, I'm feeling is something I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you

Off you... off you
So lay here beside me... just hold me and don't let go
This feeling, I'm feeling is something I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you
