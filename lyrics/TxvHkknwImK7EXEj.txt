Shakin' on string, you know

You make me feel like dancin'
Dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
Every night and every day
You make feel like dancin'

Dance the night away

I'm right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancin'
I want to dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
Every night and every day
You make feel like dancin'

I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away

All this perpetual motion
You gotta give me some more

Dance that night away
You make me feel like dancin'
Every night and every day
You make me feel like dancin'
