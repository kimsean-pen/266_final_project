on the day of my silence
the galling past broadens
my thoughts
a shred of hope in my skin
the consuming cave must be filled

idle seashore of the mind
the bad moon rises
and I close my eyes

when received the cursed scorn
these flaws are deemed

the howling wind blows
and the lucent lands are glowing

glow below me
glow you give me

idle seashore of the mind
the bad moon rises and I close my eyes

the vulture sings my last song

the lucent moon
glows now tonight
the hounds howl
their goodbyes tonight
and i am nearly there
