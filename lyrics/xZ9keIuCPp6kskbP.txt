This isn't easy, but it's what I believe
Something is broken, twisted, pushes away
No one is listening, what have we done?
I've heard it in here, the darkness, and lonely again

I don't know how this is going to end
I don't know how this is going to change
I don't know how this is going to feel
But everything comes down to this

Nothing is easy, no one has come
Love is a stranger it hides in a corner of things
So much unspoken, words left for dead
All I can hear is the screams of someone to blame

I don't know how we let this go so far
I don't know how we let love turn to hate
I don't know how we let things fall apart
But everything comes down to this

I don't know how this is going to end
I don't know how this is going to change
I don't know how this is going to feel
But everything comes down to this

I don't know how we let this go so far
I don't know how we let love turn to hate
I don't know how we let things fall apart
But everything comes down to this
