Bottle up the pain,
Let it rain and wash away.
Let it carry you to a better place,
Don't forget my name.

My mind often wonders back
To the kids that we used to be.
What's left?
Nothing but memories,
A shell of who you used to be.

Is this a consequence of never chasing dreams?
Slowly you're sinking.
Locked in a cage, no way to breathe.

You bottle up the pain,
Did it have to be this way?
Let it rain and wash away,
I'm reaching out and its all for you.

Bottle up the pain,
Let it rain and wash away.
Let it carry you to a better place,
Don't forget my name.

I'm wishing for a change that never came,
I'll rewrite the past so you will never be replaced.
And I know your hands were tied,
Your fate was set, put on your bravest smile.
Now do we have to look back?
I'm reaching out and its all for you.

I still remember,
I remember the night you called (it's all for you)
I felt the warmth in your voice,
You were happy, I was happy for you (it's all for you)

I've come to terms with letting go,
Had time to think things through.
Dear friend, I'll live this life for two,
And I'll sing this song for you.

(All for you) I'm reaching out and it's all for you
(All for you) I'm reaching out and it's all for you

Bottle up the pain,
Let it rain and wash away,
Let it carry you to a better place
Don't forget my name.
