I see that nothing's changed, insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are and you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch, I've got to make a switch
You'll find some other John, I know what's going on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh, too late, too late

I thought you were for real, just one more rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap, I just escaped your trap
You think you see the joke but you're just chasing smoke
'Cause now the thrill is gone, I know what's going on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh, too late, too late, oh

Misunderstanding me, the way you felt so free
I'm gonna jump the gun, I'm gonna cut and run
Your credibility don't cut no ice with me
You're just a feeble con, I know what's going on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh, oh, oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late
