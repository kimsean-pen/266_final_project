I been telling my friends I'm cool
I finally got you out my head
And if I gotta walk by your house
I take the long way home instead
'Cause I guess if I see you outside and you look all cute
And I won't let myself forget
'Cause every time, every time, every time
I see you I know I'm not ready yet

No, I don't want somebody else
Feels like I'm going through hell
So I just lie to myself just to prove

I'm not thinkin' bout you, you
I'm not thinkin' bout you, you
I don't wanna think about

You got me feeling things I swear that I have never felt
And you have a way with saying words that always stick around
And if I saw you outside hanging out with another guy
Like you're better off without
No I would try, I would try, I would try
To look away till I convince myself

No, I don't want somebody else
Feels like I'm going through hell
So I just lie to myself just to prove

I'm not thinkin' bout you, you
I'm not thinkin' bout you, you
No, I don't wanna think about
No, I don't wanna think about you no

Suddenly I'm thinking bout
All the times we had
Keep on rushing back
Get out of my head
I don't wanna think about
What I'm feeling now
I wanna push it down
I wanna block it out

No, I don't wanna think about you, you
No, I don't wanna think about you
No, I don't wanna think about
No, I don't wanna think about you
No, I don't wanna think about
