Everyone is walking on the edge of life
Like the ghosts of a shadow, barely alive
Even time's in a rush
But it's going nowhere
Everyone's connected but no one is connecting
The human element has long been missing
Tell me, have you seen it?
Have you seen it?
Or are we alone?
I need something to believe in
Tell me, are we alone?
Where is the love? Where is the feeling?
Is anybody out there?
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone left in this whole world?
Or are we alone?
Alone...
Where is the feeling?
Everybody needs to know somebody who cares
Just a friendly face
You can trust who'll be there.
Are you afraid to be known
And not be a stranger?
'Cause everyones connected but no one is connecting
The human element has long been missing
Tell me, have you seen it?
Have you seen it?
Or are we alone?
I need something to believe in
Tell me, are we alone?
Alone...
Where is the love? Where is the feeling?
Is anybody out there?
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone left in this whole world?
Or are we alone?
Alone...
Is anyone left in this whole world?
Or are we alone?
Alone...
