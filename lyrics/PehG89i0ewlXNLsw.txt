Heart in my stomach
Throat blocked by air tonight
Twisted intestines
Reminding me that it's not alright

And you have hold on me
And my arms are locked by my side
A two-word apology
And I'm paralysed
I'm paralysed
I'm paralysed

Nobody can slit my throat
Nobody can leave me lying by the side of the road like you can
Nobody can slit my throat
Nobody can leave me lying by the side of the road like you can
Nobody can slit my throat
Nobody can leave me lying by the side of the road like you can
Like you can
Like you can...
Nobody...
Can do it like you can
Nobody...
