If I could
Hug my love
Could I try
For your wings
To cover me

And let them fold
Half alive
I heard the most

Brilliant lie
Sleepless eyes
Close the light

And dust the mind
While I burn
...
You can't stutter

When you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue
You save face

Or feeding on the blood
That's running from a black day
...
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain

Cry on black rain
...
If I could
Hug my love
Could I try
Fold your wings
To cover me
Unless I fall
Sleepless eyes
Close the light
And dust the mind
While i burn
...
You can't stutter
When you're talking with your eyes
Like cutting out your tongue
To save face
Or feeding on the blood
That's running from a black day
