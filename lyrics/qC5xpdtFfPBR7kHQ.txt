B-1 bombers in flight
MX missiles underground

Trident missiles in the air
Protect us till we're dead
CHORUS
Memories of tomorrow-too late for sorrow

Kiss goodbye the nuclear arsenal
A-bombs flying off their ramps
Push the button
Nuclear bombs explode

CHORUS
Radioactive people

Kill for food
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter

CHORUS
Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed cities
Mutilated bodies

CHORUS
I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
You'd know why

If you could see in the future
Memories of tomorrow
