It? s all right to take me down
Between the hook and the line I took
It? s all right to drag the lake
And find the things you love

They won? t wait in line to see me float
Asleep above the waves
They don? t wait in line to bring me up
I? ve seen enough today

All my dreams stroll by unclothed
All my dreams roll by unknown

It? s all right to kill the dream
You live for though it? s not
Not enough to save you from yourself
The world she loved too much

No, this deeper instead, even people
And I believe there? s a air when you love
All I see is a dream
That lies beneath the love

There? s a way about her
She can make me do things I? m not to do
Cut the line and count to three
And morph into another

Start the wheel turning
Only bring me some things I? ve not seen
Hope from ragged mothers screaming
Born into another world

All my dreams stroll by unclothed
All my dreams roll by unknown

It? s all right to take me out
It? s all right to take me out
It? s all right to take me out
