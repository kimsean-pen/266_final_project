Fading into blue,
Waves crashing under you.
Waves crashing under you.
Nothing will change it.
I knew you,
I felt, sometimes,
The air so light.

You were never meant to wander
Far away from cold air.
Are you tempted by the colors
Far away?

You were never meant to wander
Far away from cold air.
Are you tempted by the colors
Far away?

Always out of touch.
The patterns change so much.
The patterns change so much.
So hard to follow.
You choose to
Fly out into the air at night.

You were never meant to wander
Far away from home.
Watching the passing time,
Everything is frozen.

You were never meant to wander
Far away from home.
Watching the passing time,
Everything is frozen.
