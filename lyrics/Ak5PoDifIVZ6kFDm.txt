Hahaha
Let the sparks fly
Hahaha

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's tainted
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like you're racing
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
But two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light
There's no where to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause Heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's tainted
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like you're racing
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one good reason
Two more to believe it
Three shots why should I wait
'Cause I got one more match
Two strikes left
You got 'till three to get out of my way

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light
There's no where to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
'Cause Heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's tainted
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like you're racing
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Hahaha

Let me take you into the light
There's no where to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
