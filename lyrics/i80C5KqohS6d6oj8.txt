These seven words
I say to you
one by one
I love you
and you have to know

if I could change
how I'm insane
if I could
learn to leave
my troubles behind
it's starting to hurt
and I know you've moved on
tellin everyone
how I done you so wrong

cat scratch a beast
my words that
made you bleed
now I face tomorrow
now I face tomorrow

In time we'll both
be free
from this ball and chain
hangin on to things
I want you mostly
in the morning
when my soul
is weak
from dreaming

when the dust has cleared
and you forget that I'm here
hangin on
I've been hangin
who had the last word
I'm tellin you first
who had the last word
I'm tellin you first

these seven words
are no longer mine
who am I
but a stranger
who took you down
it's starting to burn
and I wanna go home
only home I've known
lost in the storm

it had to be
seven words to set us free
now I face tomorrow
now I face tomorrow
now I face tomorrow
