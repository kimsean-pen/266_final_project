Haven't been wasted in a long time
But tonight it feels just fine
Riding home with the windows up
Alone with a plastic cup of real good wine

If I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There's a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering
There ain't no one from here that will follow me there
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

She said there's nothing left to talk about
At my age I should've figured out
Which drawer to put the good knives in
And the wars between the weekend store and the playhouse town

Kept her close but way too close to me
She never lived up to my memory
Driving fast with the windows down
A past I don't belong to now
A mystery

I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There's a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of spring and then Summer is blistering
So there ain't no one from here that will follow me there
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There's a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of spring and then summer is blistering
There ain't no one from here that will follow me there
Well there ain't no one from here that will follow me there
