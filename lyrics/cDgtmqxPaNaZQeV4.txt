I miss the sand on the concrete floor
I miss the way it was before
no one even knew me
your eyes looked right through me
And I'm taking off your clothes
And you bloom like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I, I, I

And where the ocean meets the land
Is like the sliding of your hand
Prickles up my skin
And I can feel the changing weather
Ride alone along that coast
Sense memories of your ghost

Away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I, I, I

Deliver me, shut me up
Deliver me
Give into me, Release
Deliver me, deliver me

Through the airport corridors
In magazines in stores
If I see your face once more
Cause you know I can't ignore it
I recognize that pose
When you bloomed like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you

The jeep gets broke on a blown out road
And I'm a tourist with a real light load
Will the government hold another month away
Missed our places where we always stay
(I can't get away from you)
Funny how we always pick these spots
Feeling like a have in the land of have nots
Sleeping on cots
Wishing that I had some tater-tots

And there's postcards written
I know I'll never send
The moment is gone and won't come again
I ride with souls who find no peace
Still I look to you to find release, find release, fine release

And the travelers return
Through the panic doors
(I can't get away from you)
Walking through the airport corridors
(I can't get away from you)
Welcome back now from the foreign shores
(I can't get away from you)
And I walk alone
And the ghost that I carry is yours
Tiger shark is azure blue
I hope the vision you had returns to you
