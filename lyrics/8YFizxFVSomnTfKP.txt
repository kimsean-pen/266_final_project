I'm gonna be a mighty king so enemies beware
(Well I've never seen a king or beast with quite so little hair)
I'm gonna be the main event like no king was before,
I'm brushin up, on lookin down, I'm workin' on my ROAR!

(Thus far a rather uninspiring thing)
Oh, I just can't wait to be KING!
(Well you have a long way to go young master if you think...)
No one sayin do this... (now when I said that)

No one sayin be there... (now what I meant was...)
No one sayin stop that... (now what you don't realize...)

No one sayin see here... (NOW SEE HERE!...)
Free to run around all day (well that's definetly out of the...)
Free to do it all my way!

I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advise from little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarcy is headed count me out
Out of service, out of Africa, I wouldn't hang about

This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh I just can't wait to be KING!

Everybody look left,
Everybody look right, every where you look I'm
Standin spot light (not yet)
Back ground singers: (let every creature go for broke and sing,
Lets hear it on the herd and on the wing,
It's gonna be King Simbas finest fling)
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
