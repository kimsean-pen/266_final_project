Ooh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You left me like a broken toy

Well, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

Oh, take me, take me
Take me to the dreamer's ball
I'll be right on time
And I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me, I won't have to worry

Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me 'til it's morning
And it's all been through

Way down, down, downtown, dreamer's town
So, take me, take me
Take me, I'm your play thing now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with the barely perceptible whisper

Gently, take me
Remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball
Oh, take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'll meet me at the dreamer's ball
Oh, meet you at the dreamer's ball
