Leeches
We are creatures
We leave her as we trust

If you say this way
I will take that way
'Til for the fire will it die
Fry

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns
It rips
It hurts

Leeches
They preach to us
Where's the wisdom from the crowd

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns
It rips
It hurts
They made you believe
Your turn
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive

Let's hear it for the bullet
That can't be heard
Pray to yours that I steal

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns
It rips
It hurts
They made you believe
Your turn (It hurts)
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive
