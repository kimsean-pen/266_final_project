A child dies at birth
Window of life is shut
For what my time was worth
Time ticks another cut

Resist the urge to perfect thee
Create the curse you live to see
Swallow the boy's ejected seed
You're not the one I wish to be

Tell your friends that I'm gone
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To find me

Tell your friends that I'm dead
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To mourn me

A woman cries alone
Her child just a stain
Mind of eroding stone
She will get hurt again

Resist the urge to perfect thee
Create the curse you live to see
Swallow the boy's ejected seed
You're not the one I wish to be

Tell your friends that I'm gone
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To find me

Tell your friends that I'm dead
They won't even care
They won't even stop
To mourn me
