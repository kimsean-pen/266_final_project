My guns are all ready to go
I'll turn up, put on a show
God these feelings gotta go
Listen up want you to know that

Baby even though I'm not over you
I'm down to take control if that's the only way
I'll fortify my mind and apprehend what I'm dealing

Come now, abuse your authority
Over me, can't see that I know you and you like it, babe?
He don't love you like I love you, babe

Burned out at the cost of my sanity
Funny how the tables turned
Oh, what a shame you're on your knees for me
Cuz in the morning you'll be dead to me

You reside in me
Then trade me as a weapon
For your remedy
And reducing me to nothing but an item
Or a trophy, but you never want to know me
You just want to hold me, baby

Boy, you think I like it that way?
Turn me round on tables you can fuck me that way
Why'd you gotta sell me that way
Why'd you gotta do that to my name

Come now, abuse your authority
Over me, can't see that I know you and you like it, babe?
He don't love you like I love you, babe

Burned out at the cost of my sanity
Funny how the tables turned
Oh, what a shame you're on your knees for me
Cuz in the morning you'll be dead to me
