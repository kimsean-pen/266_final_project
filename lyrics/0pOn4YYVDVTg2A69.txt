There's a black cloud over this house
That's been around for three years now
There's a thunderstorm inside
And it won't go away
No it won't go away

That's why they call it a union
That's why they call it a union
So both of you please forgive me tonight
That's why they call it a union
So please forgive me tonight

I remember him turning around
He said, 'Son, I'll be leaving now,
I can't be the person that you want me to be'
And then she said, 'So things are finally ending now,
yeah, I knew you'd be walking out,
You can't be the person that you want me to be.'
want me to be

Three years of all the arguments
Three years of all this silence
Has been enough, to last me a lifetime
Three years of all the arguments
Three years of all this pain

That's why they call it a union
That's why they call it a union
So both of you please forgive me tonight
That's why they call it a union
So please forgive me tonight

I remember him turning around
He said, 'Son, I'll be leaving now,
I can't be the person that you want me to be'
And then she said, 'So things are finally ending now,

You can't be the person that you want me to be.'
want me to be

Three years of all the arguments
Three years of all this silence
Has been enough, to last me a lifetime
Three years of all the arguments
Three years of all this pain

That's why they call it a union
That's why they call it a union
So both of you please forgive me tonight
That's why they call it a union
So please forgive me tonight

I can't look at the pictures anymore
Because I know how it's run it's course
And I know how the story ends
I know it ends

There's a black cloud over this house
That's been around for three years now
There's a thunderstorm inside
And another fight tonight

There's a black cloud over this house
That's been around for three years now
There's a thunderstorm tonight
And it won't go away; no it won't go away

That's why they call it a union
That's why they call it a union
So both of you please forgive me tonight
That's why they call it a union
So please forgive me tonight
So please forgive me tonight
So please forgive me goodnight
