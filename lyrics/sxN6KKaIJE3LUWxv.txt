She has done so many things it's so surreal
She has seen so many things it's so unreal
She has been almost everywhere and tasted everything
She has been a dream since birth who could conquer everything
No
Anything

Night after night after every single night
She never gave up
Fight after fight after motherfucking fight
She came out on top
One rule, one way of life
Only the strong survive

Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything
Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything

Blood all the blood every single drop of blood
She sucks it up
Breath every breath every single damn breath
She screams with love
One rule, one way of life
Only the strong survive

Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything
Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything

Nobody in this world will ever stop her
Nobody in this world can even touch her
Everybody in this world will want to be her
Everybody in this world just needs to see her (just needs to see her)
She's everything
And she'll destroy the world

Never back down, never back down
Never back down, never back down
Never back down, never back down
Never back down, never back down
Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything
Never back down, never back down
Destroying everything
