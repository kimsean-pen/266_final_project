Where it began, I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growin' strong
Was in the spring, and spring became the summer
Who'd've believed you'd come along?

Hands, touching hands
Reaching out
Touching me, touching you

Oh, sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined
To believe it never would

Oh, sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
Oh, I've been inclined
To believe it never would
Oh, no, no...
