Bring the Heat! Bring the Heat!
Doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man,
So I can treat you better

No I-I can't feel the Heat
Yet don't let it catch you,
No, I-I can't feel the Heat
I know I can't catch you alone
I know I can't catch you alone

No, I can't finish my workout
I knew that the moment I run, honey
Won't help it make you better
Still I I can't feel the Heat
Yeah, don't let it catch you
Don't, I I can't feel the Heat
I know I can't catch you alone, no

Keep together
Stand on together
I know I can't catch you alone
I know I can't catch you alone
I I can't feel the Heat
Yeah,
I know I can't catch you alone
Doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man, honey
So I can treat you better
