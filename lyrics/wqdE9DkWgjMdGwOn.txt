Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted

You're taking my heart now
They're taking my heart now
And I don't know why (got 'em)
And I don't know why (fuck, spotted, running)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright (ay, ay, ay)
The demons told me everything
They whisper in the night (ay, ay, ay)

This is not a threat, I promise (nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning baby
I just want you to know

That's when the summer caved in
And I've fallen in a trench, I'm behaving
I'm behaving myself (running)
I'm behaving myself (look, look, look, look)

We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for you (for you, for you)
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for (shh, quiet)

This is not a threat, I promise (nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning baby
I just want you to know

Please just let me go
Let me go
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
(That sounds good)
