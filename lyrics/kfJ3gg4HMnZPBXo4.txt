Sweet lord I know
I hate this lonely life so
Lord I know
Time goes slow
I feel so alone
Sweet lord
Sweet lord is this my fate
To live my life in this state
Lord I pray

I long for a change
But it still remains
Sweet lord

Sweet lord it's a sin
To live this life sufferin'
I feel so sad (9 times)
Sweet lord
