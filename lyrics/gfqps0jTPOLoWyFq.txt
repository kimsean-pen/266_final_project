It's been a very long time since I felt like I do tonight.
For the first time it feels right that I'm in love with you.
I never looked at you this way until I saw you today, in every line in your face, I'm in love with you.
It's not fair to you what I put you through.
It keeps coming back, feels like a heart attack, I don't know how to act but I know that I'm in love with you.
So go tell your boyfriend, it doesn't matter in the end, no this ain't pretend you know that I'm in love with you.
Don't tell the truth, don't say if you love me too.
