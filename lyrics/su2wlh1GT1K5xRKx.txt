I'm done fighting
I was losing
I kept discovering the chance of you
And what I'd give to live that second again

Just a chance to feel that skin
Feel that skin
Feel that skin
Feel that skin

Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me

Memories replaying
Like a movie
If I could recite the words to you
And what I'd give to live that second again

Just a chance to feel that skin
Feel that skin
Feel that skin
Feel that skin

Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
Oh you left me
