I woke up this mornin' with a buzz rollin' 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinkin' but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious, looks like it's goin' around

It's cool once you catch it, you can't keep your feet on the ground
Oh now, come on, come on, let's get somethin' started
(let's get somethin' started now)
Oh yeah, come on, come on, let's start somethin' now
(let's start somethin' now)

We gonna rock this country
We gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really do si do give it a whirl
We gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na

From Utah to Texas, Minnesota, Mississippi too (that's right)
Or Nevada, no matter where you live, this buzz is for you (that's right)
Oh come on, come on, let's get somethin' started
(let's get somethin' started now)
Oh come on, come on, let's start somethin' now (let's start somethin' now)
Here we go

We gonna rock this country
We gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really do si do, give it a whirl
We gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Let's go

We're pluggin' in the power, crankin' up the sound
It's comin' your direction, it's headed to your town
We're kickin' up dust, blowin' off steam
Let's get nuts now, everybody scream

We gonna rock this country
We gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really do si do give it a whirl
We gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Get ready, we're comin'
