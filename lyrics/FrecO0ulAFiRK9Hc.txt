Love is a fire
Burns down all that it sees
Burns down everything

Everything you think burns down everything you say

She blew me her death-kiss and the mouth-marks bled down my eyes
Like her dying on my windshield
I can already feel her worms eating my spine
So how can it be this lonely?
Is this all we get for our lives?
Love sweeter when one of us dies?

Then I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away
I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away
I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away
I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away

Love is a fire
Burns down all that it sees
Burns down everything

Everything you think burns down everything you say

Love is a fire
Burns down all that it sees
Burns down everything

Everything you think burns down everything you say

Love is a fire
Burns down all that it sees
Burns down everything

Everything you think burns down everything you say

I knew that our love was
Just a car crash away
Knew that our love was
Just a car crash away
Just a car crash away

Everything you think
Everything you say
Everything you think
Burns Down
Everything you say

Love is a fire
Burns down all that it sees
Burns down everything

Everything you think burns down everything you say
