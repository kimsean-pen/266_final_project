Searched the hole
Found I can't compare

(But we're here, cause we're here
We're here cause we're here
And there's nothing to fear
No, there's nothing to fear) [2x]

Searched the hole my love
Found out I've been going wrong

(All that I see
All that I feel
All like a dream
What's happened to me?) [3x]

Time is right
Body will leave
But if we live
It's like a dream
Please believe
Let it wash your agony
Let life reveal what I feel, what I feel, what I feel

(...Watch it burning and dancing in your dream, in your life
Don't be afraid of yourself, don't be afraid) [4x]

Searched the hole
Found I can't compare
Searched the hole my love
Found I've been going wrong

(All that I see
All that I feel
All like a dream
What's happened to me?) [3x]

Time is right
Body will leave
But if we live
It's like a dream
Please believe
Let it wash your agony
Let life reveal what I feel, what I feel, what I feel
