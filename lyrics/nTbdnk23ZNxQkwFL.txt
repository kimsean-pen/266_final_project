Looks like I'm 'a do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want something done right
You gotta do it yourself

Maybe life is up and down
But my life's been "what" till now
I crawled up your butt somehow
And that's when things got turned around

I used to be alive and now I feel pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you?
Why do you have to go and hurt somebody like me?
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back

Depending on you is done
Giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just what giving to you and I'm done
