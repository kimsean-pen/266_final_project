We started good
Crossed our hearts, we made a promise
Misunderstood
'Cause all my friends say you're dishonest
You had me questioning what I was worth
They know and I know, now
(Say) what you want but I know that it's only
(Words) that you use to anyone anybody
(My) self and I we were done with your sorrys'
Get out my face
It's safe to say

When I was your girlfriend
You said it'd be different
You wanted other girls
Then you wanted commitment
But you couldn't get it
To-to-together
I'm sending you this
Love, love, love letter
Oh I was your girlfriend
I thought you were different
I tried to make it work
Gave a million chances
But I know I can
Do, do, do better
I'm sending you this
Love, love, love letter

You'd sit at home
Too keen on that marijuana
Pick up your clothes
Like you forgot I'm not your mother
Yeah you were getting way too comfortable
Yeah you know and I know now
(Say) what you want but I know that it's only
(Words) that you use to anyone anybody
(My) self and I we were done with your sorrys'
You'll be replaced
It's safe to say

When I was your girlfriend
You said it'd be different
You wanted other girls
Then you wanted commitment
But you couldn't get it
To-to-together
I'm sending you this
Love, love, love letter
Oh I was your girlfriend
I thought you were different
I tried to make it work
Gave a million chances
But I know I can
Do, do, do better
I'm sending you this
Love, love, love letter
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm sending you this
Love, love, love letter
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

By the time you get it
I'll be out on the road
'Cause I packed up all my things
Put your name on a note
Yeah you thought you were clever
But you didn't know
That my heart left you about two months ago
By the time you get it
I'll be out on the road
'Cause I packed up all my things
Put your name on a note
Yeah you thought you were clever
But you didn't know
That my heart left you about two months ago

When I was your girlfriend
You said it'd be different
You wanted other girls

But you couldn't get it
