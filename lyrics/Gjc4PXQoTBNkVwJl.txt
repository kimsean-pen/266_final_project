You're always on my mind
I want you all the time
The pain of tenderness is
A wound of love
I can't control it
What I'm trying to say
I wanna be the one you want
I've gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave
I'm gonna be the one
Devastated by lust
I'm gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave

My heart is heavy
We're never ready
If you're the sacred script
I am the Hierophant
You're never ready

What I'm trying to say
I wanna be the one you want
I've gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave
I'm gonna be the one
Devastated by lust
I've gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave

What I'm trying to say
I wanna be the one you want
I've gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave
I'm gonna be the one
Devastated by lust
I've gotta be your lover
I've gotta be the only one you crave
