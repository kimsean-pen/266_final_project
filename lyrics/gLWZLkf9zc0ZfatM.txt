So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Wanna play to win tonight?
So you wanna be a bigshot?
Got to play your cards right
So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Just stick by my side
Are you looking for the loose slots?

Big winner
Sin City, I'm a big sinner
Take you out for a very nice dinner
Cirque du Soleil seats, front and center
You hang on my arm, Louis Vuitton, all that you want it's yours
As long as I win we'll do it again, again and again

So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Wanna play to win tonight?
So you wanna be a bigshot?
Got to play your cards right
So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Just stick by my side
Are you looking for the loose slots?
I can take you there tonight

High Roller
Pit boss lookin' over your shoulder
I can teach how to play the rules
And when you bend 'em then you really can't lose
You're my lucky charm, hang on my arm, baby let's roll the dice
No superstition, but I keep wishing that you'll be mine

Jackpot
Put your arms around me
It's time for you to get lucky
Jackpot
Just stick by my side
Loose slots
I can take you there tonight

Life is ruled by chance
Everything by happenstance
The winning number where the wheel will land
Random circumstance
The universe began like that
All life on earth, an accident
No gods or saviors just odds in your favor
So don't stop, so don't stop
Till you hit the jackpot

So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Wanna play to win tonight?
So you wanna be a bigshot?
Got to play your cards right
So you wanna hit the jackpot?
Just stick by my side
Are you looking for the loose slots?
I can take you there tonight
