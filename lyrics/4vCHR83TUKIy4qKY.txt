The pebbles you've arranged, in the sand they're strange
They speak to me like constellations as we lie here
There's a magic I can't hold, your smile of honey gold
And that you never seem to be in short supply of
Ooh, so baby, let's get it on

Drinkin' wine and killin' time, sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?
Lazy days, crazy dolls
You said we'd been friends too long

Seven days in sunny June but long enough to bloom
The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one and then you dropped the bomb
That I've know you too long for us to have a thing
Ooh, so baby, let's get it on

Drinkin' wine and killin' time, sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?
Ooh, so baby, let's get it on

Drinkin' wine and killin' time, sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?

Could it be this? The stories in your eyes
Tell of silent wings you fly away on
Seven days in sunny June but long enough to bloom
Flowers on that sun beam dress you wore in spring
Yeah yeah, the way we laughed as one

Why did you drop that bomb on me?
Ooh, so baby, let's get it on
Drinkin' wine and killin' time, sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long

Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me? (Could it be this?)
The honeysuckle blessings seem to show me (Could it be this?)
For seven days in June, I wasn't lonely (Could it be this?)
You never gave me time to say, "I love you" (Could it be this?)

I know you don't believe me but it's so true
Don't walk away from me, girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me
I read the stories in your eyes

And you've been telling me we've been friends for too long, yeah
I think I love you, I think I love you
Why'd you wanna drop the bomb? Oooh
