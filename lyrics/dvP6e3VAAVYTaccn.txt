Laying here, wrapped in white just tryin' to not fight again
'Cause I've been holding on too long just to let it end
Ohh, I must be walking on eggshells
Tryin' not to sell myself out
I bet that's what she's thinkin'
That's when she said
That's when she said

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah, she said, baby, do ya?
Or are you just comfortable?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah, she said, baby, do ya?
Or are you just comfortable?

Tryin' my best to show appreciation (ahh, yeah)
But all apologies are just a miscommunication
Now it's like I'm walking on eggshells
Tryin' not to burn the hell out
It's like pulling magic from my mouth
That's when she said
That's when she said

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah, she said, baby, do ya?
Or are you just comfortable?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah, she said, baby, do ya?
Or are you just comfortable?

Could I ever do enough to make this coffee more than bitter water?
Could I ever do enough to make you wear this love not like a collar?
Could I ever do enough to make you feel the way you want to feel?
So the next time that you're sad, tell me that...

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Oh, yeah, baby, do ya?
Or are you just comfortable?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah, she said, baby, do ya?
(Want it bad, want it bad, want it bad)
Or are you just comfortable?
(Want it bad, want it bad, want it bad)

Are you just comfortable?
