am i listening when you tell me baby
"i hate to see you doing like this"
cause these things they take some time to realise
the other ways to exist

but maybe its the time i said
"you're doing just fine, really"
maybe i'm making poor decisions

is this really what you wanted for the kids
a perfect life with success
am i typing in the stereo or am i sick of trying like this

to make a little chime that rings
maybe then you'll take a listen
in your mind
you can't hear the difference
