I shot this glance to you
In a minute I'll be gone
But not because I didn't want to

No one wants to dance
So I'm standing on my feet
Nobody takes the chance
To break the law to start the beat

So I'm sitting this one out
I'm planning on my own
I'm staying put for now
But not forever

I'll save this dance for you
In the morning I'll be gone
But not because I didn't want to

I tried so hard to stay
Stay in love with you and me
I'm moving on because I have to

You say it's too late
I was wrong, you can't wait
I'll try now if you stay, stay with me

I'll still fight for what's right
I still dream every night
I still want to believe
You're saving one last dance for me
