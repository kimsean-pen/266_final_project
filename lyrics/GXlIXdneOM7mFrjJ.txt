Even the highs feel like lows
I'm sick of all of my clothes
I'm getting tired of the same conversations
I can't accept the feelings of elation

I'm flying high but am I self sabotaging
I'm leaning further in than ever
Let you in but now I need to be guarded
Every day's a revelation

Sometimes I feel like my heart has been split open
You see everything I'm hoping
I'm a river running high
Sometimes I feel like there's a freeway running down my neck
There's traffic passing through my chest and through my mind
Sometimes I feel like my heart has been split open
You see everything I'm hoping
I'm a river running high
Sometimes I feel like there's traffic
passing through my chest and through my mind

I'm burning faster than ever
I'm burning out to my ends
I'm running out of time to spend with my friends
And when I do it's with eyes wide
Building and breaking my pride
I'm getting big in my bubble
Losing perspective, think I could be in trouble
Every day's a revelation
Every day's a revelation
I'm learning things about myself

Sometimes I feel like my heart has been split open
You see everything I'm hoping
I'm a river running high
Sometimes I feel like there's a freeway running down my neck
There's traffic passing through my chest and through my mind
Sometimes I feel like my heart has been split open
You see everything I'm hoping
I'm a river running high
Sometimes I feel like there's a freeway running down my neck
There's traffic passing through my chest and through my mind
