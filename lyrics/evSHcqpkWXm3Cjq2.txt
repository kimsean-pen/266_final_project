We'll count to three
Spotlight shines on me
Aching to see
Me fall to my knees
Read and weep (Hah!)

Watch me as I hang out to dry
Get your money's worth then
Slay me and I ask myself why
I can see you come in
Do you hate me, want to break me
Pick up your sticks and stones
Target practice on me
I'm not going anywhere

(Hey!)

Words I can speak
Constrain in your knees
Inside of me
They're beating, they're boiling, inside me

Watch me as I hang out to dry
Get your money's worth then
Slay me and I ask myself why
I can see you come in
Do you hate me, want to break me
Pick up your sticks and stones
Target practice on me
I'm not going anywhere
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
