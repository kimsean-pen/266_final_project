And head up dear,
You're shallow and blind

And head up dear,
The rabbit may die

'Cause I'm putting the boot in tonight

Head up dear,
You're shallow and blind

And head up dear
The rabbit may die

And you say Hi
And you say Hi

Because i'm putting up with your constant whine
And I won't last too long

And friendly faces with put on smiles
A drunken mind gets past

Because I'm putting the boot in tonight

Head up dear,
You're shallow and blind

And head up dear
The rabbit may die

And you say Hi
And you say Hi

Because i'm putting up with your constant whine
And I won't last too long

And friendly faces with put on smiles
A drunken mind gets past

'Cause I'm putting the boot in tonight
