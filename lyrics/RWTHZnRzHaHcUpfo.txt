Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me
I don't know they somehow saved me
And I know I'm making something out of this life they called nothing
I take what I want, take what I need
They say it's wrong but it's right for me
I won't look down, won't say I'm sorry
I know that only God can judge me

And if I make it thru today
Will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
An' if I stumble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on
Or will it all just be the same?

'Cause I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world and I don't care
I don't care

An' no one in this industry understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past it's not a gimmick not an act
These critics and these trust fund kids
Try to tell me what punk is
But when I see them on the street they got nothing to say

And if I make it thru today
Will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
An' if I stumble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on
Or will it all just be the same?

'Cause I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world and I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Now
I don't care

I'm young and I'm hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
That I'm troublesome, I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world and I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
