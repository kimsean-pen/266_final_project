And with these humble Tools

We can trigger any Emotion we choose

But we'll Just settle to Pump out Repeated Relics Diluted with Time

You see the Airways are clogged up

But the Fickle they lap it up, lap it up

They Need to be drowned in Condiments

And left to Ponder Sense

Warm Smiles, they do not make you welcome here
Warm Smiles, they do not make you welcome here

Snap back to Reality
The Turbulence is blowing us from Side to Side
But no matter how hard you try
Surrounded by cannon fodder inundated with
Stagnant sounds

You see the Airways are clogged up
But the Fickle they lap it up, lap it up
They Need to be drowned in Condiments
And left to Ponder Sense

Warm Smiles, they do not make you welcome here
Warm Smiles, they do not make you welcome here

Transformation in progress
Transformation complete

Lightning Strikes
A Flash Flood of Colour
I can't stand the Heat
