I got ten toes down
I must be floating
My emotions like
In and out now I ain't got ne feel (No feel)
They talk a lot
Talk a lot about us in a bad light (Bad light, bad light)
My heart is an angel
Twisted and tangled
My have me unstable
Love me from any angle
Tell me that you can when you're able
Shut me down when I'm fatal
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm
I got ten toes down
I'm goin in a little loud
You need my bod like a Mophie
Give you hours just to hold me
They talk a lot
Talk a lot about us in a bad light (Bad light)
My heart is an angel
Twisted and tangled
My have me unstable
Love me from any angle
Tell me that you can when you're able
Shut me down when I'm fatal
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm--Got-got you and I'm
My emotions like
My emotions like
My emotions like
My emotions like
(If I say so)
I want you and I need you and I got you and I'm gonna have you
If I say so
