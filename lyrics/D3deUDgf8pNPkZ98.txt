Ain't no love (baby) like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, oh shut up in my bones
(I got to say it)
Ain't no lonely days (Lonely days)
Ain't no lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Every thing that she does
You know the girl's alright (You know the girl's alright)

(I got to say it)
I ain't never, never found me a girl
(I wouldn't lie about it, baby)
Never, never found me a girl
(To squeeze me tight at night)
Never, never found me a girl
Nobody to love me like you do
(I ain't lying about it, baby)
Love me like you do

(Sweet baby baby, what I'm sayin' is that)
Ain't no man got a sweet woman like me
She's everything in the world
One man could claim
(Let me say that)
She's every poor boy's dream (Every poor boys dream)
She's every very rich man's prayer (Every rich man's prayer)
I don't need no money, honey
Because (you know) she's always there

Never, never found me a girl
(Somebody to keep me walking in my shoes)
Never, never found me a girl
(She always brings me good news)
Never, never found me a girl
I never found me a girl to love me like you do
Ah-ha baby
Love me like you do (baby)

(And here I stand with)
Never, never found me a girl (tears in my eyes)
(And I'm caught by total surprise) Never, never found me a girl
(Ah-ha baby) Never, never found me a girl
To love me like you do
(Oh, sweet baby)
To love me like you do (baby)

(I never found a girl, he-he baby)
You do
(You squeeze me tight, love me right baby)
You do
(Got me walking in my shoes ah-ha)
You do
(Make me feel good oh)
You do
(Make me feel good, he-he baby)
You do
I never, never, never, never, never
You do
Never found a girl
