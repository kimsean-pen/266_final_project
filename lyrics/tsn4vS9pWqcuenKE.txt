When the fever's gone
And the roads to dust
I touchdown Sunday
To tie the loose ends up
With a pocket full of
That gypsy stuff
I heard you calling me, calling me, calling me
Through the dissonance
I've been known to run
Just to feel the rush
But the dying sun
Has illuminate so much

It's hard to see beyond what's in sight
But when you tilt the light I realize

For 1000 nights
I've been a restless soul
Just wasting time
Digging up fool's gold
It took a 1000 lives
Being on my own
For me to find
It was all fool's gold

without you oooo
oooooooo
I felt the fever on
But couldn't taste the fruit

There's a bulletproof bond
Between meaning and you

It's hard to see beyond what's in sight
But when you tilt the light I realize
For 1000 nights
I've been a restless soul
Just wasting time
Digging up fool's gold
It took a 1000 lives
Being on my own

For me to find
It was all fool's gold

without you oooooo
you ooooo

without you oooo
you oooooo
It was all dead end roads, heaven knows
It was all dead end roads, heaven knows
It's hard to see beyond what's in sight
but when you tilt the light I realize
For 1000 nights
I've been a restless soul
Just wasting time
Digging up fool's gold
It took a 1000 lives
Being on my own
For me to find
It was all fool's gold
without you oooooo
you oooooo
without you oooooo
you ooooooo
oh oh
ooooo oh
