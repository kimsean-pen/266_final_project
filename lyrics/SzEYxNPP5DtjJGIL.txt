So many nights
So many days
To all of the fights
Cause I never behave

And I'm putting it right
Hope it isn't too late
And I know
You know
I know we can't let it end this way
Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you

And the one thing that I regret is
I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
You're still running through my head
So hold on, baby
I know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy, oh

Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Shit, you made me happy
So many nights
We're staying up late
Scratches and bites

You screamin my name
Is he loving you right
Or am I too late
Cause I know

You know
I know we can't let it end this way
Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
Girl you're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
I know you drive me crazy
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy, oh

Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Shit, you made me happy
Shit, you made me happy
Ain't always cool
But it's alright

It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Hold on

Hold on
It's not a sad song
Sad song, yeah
Hold on

Hold on
It's not a sad song
Sad song, baby
Hold on

Hold on
It's not a sad song
Sad song, yeah

Hold on
Hold on
It's not a sad song
Sad song, baby
So hold on baby

I know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Hold on

It's not a sad song
Sad song, yeah
