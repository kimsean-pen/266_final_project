Down in Bowery
They lose their ball-eyes and their lipped-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the street they say
"Sir, do you got a light?"
And if you do, then you're my friend
And if you don't, then you're my foe

And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah Ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas

Down on Lexington they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet
And close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past

Then won't you stay the night?
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ooh ooh ooh ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
A-a-ah
Down in Bronxy Bronx
The kids go sledding down snow-covered slopes

And frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow
And yes, they know that it'll melt
And yes, they know New York will thaw
But if you are a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas

Ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ooh ooh ooh ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
Ah ah ah ne me quitte pas, mon chere, ne me quitte pas
A-a-ah
I love Paris in the rain I love, I love in the rain o-o-oh
I love Paris in the rain I love, I love in the rain o-o-oh Oh oh oh (dum da-da-dum)
