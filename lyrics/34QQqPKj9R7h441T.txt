In your life, you seem to have it all
You seem to have control
But deep within your soul, you're losing it
You never took the time, assume that you're to blame
You think that you're insane? Won't you spare me

Chorus:
I know the breakdown
Everything is gonna shake now, someday
I know the breakdown
Tell me again am I awake now, maybe
You can find the reason that
No one else is living this way
Living this way

Yeah, your lies, your world is built around
Two faces of a clown
The voices in your head think there's four pawns down
Well, in this unity, faith has found the need
You better check yourself before you check out

Chorus

If you find yourself, then you might believe
Then within yourself you just might conceive

Chorus

You can find the reason that
(you can find the reason that way)
No one else is living this way
(you can find the reason that, you can find the reason that way)
You can find the reason that
(you can find the reason that way)
No one else is living this way
(you can find the reason that...)
Yeah.
