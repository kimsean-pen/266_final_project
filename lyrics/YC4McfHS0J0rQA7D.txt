You know there are times when I don't need you
But you seem to think it means
Don't love you but I do
But sometimes I want to be alone
Somewhere on my own

I don't know why it is but I sometimes feel
That I have to get away yet I know I love you
But sometimes I want to be alone
Somewhere on my own

Don't make me stay to walk aimlessly
Hand in hand
Just today set me free
Let me be alone

Tomorrow I may feel that I can't go through
Even one more lonely hour
Without you, yet its true
That sometimes I have to be alone
Let me be alone
