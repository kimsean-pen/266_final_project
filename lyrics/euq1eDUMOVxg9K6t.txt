I am a run away
Makeup upon my face
I find a place to hide
Inside a stranger's mind
I play a crying game
I do not speak my name
When you open your chest
This is what she said

I am a run away, a road to any place
I show you the inside, worn like a tiger's eye
I can not escape this, my song will never rest
When you open your chest
This is what she said

We're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run
Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run

I am a run away
Make up upon my face
I find a place to hide
Inside a stranger's mind
I can not escape this
My song will never rest
When you open your chest
This is what she said

We're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run
Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run

Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run
Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run

Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run
Oh, we're taking the backstreets where no one can find us
Oh, where do we go when there's no place to run
