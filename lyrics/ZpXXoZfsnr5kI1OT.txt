She's a good girl, loves her mama
loves Jesus, and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too

It's a long day livin' in Reseda
there's a free-way runnin' through the yard
He's a bad boy, cause he doesn't even miss her
He's a bad boy for breakin' her heart

I'm free, free fallin'
I'm free, free fallin'

All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Blvd.
All the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

I'm free, free fallin'
I'm free, free fallin'

I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write your name in the sky
I wanna free fall out into nothin'
I wanna leave this world for awhile

Free fallin', yes I'm free fallin'
Free fallin', I'm a free fallin'
Free fallin', now I'm free fallin'
Free fallin'

Oh I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write your name in the sky
I wanna free fall, free fall out into nothin'
I wanna leave this, I'm gonna leave this

I'm free, free fallin'
I'm free, free fallin'
I'm free, (see the bad boys dancin' in the shadows) free fallin'
I'm free, (see the vampires walkin' throught the valley) free fallin'

I wanna free fall out into nothin'
I wanna glide down over Mulholland
