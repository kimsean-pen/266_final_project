Oh no
I'm not the one
You can ignore
I'm not like those you had before

Oh, hell no
I'm not a toy just here for fun
I won't be tossed aside and down
I'm the one
I'm the one

Oh, hey you
Come over here
I'm not the one you can refuse
I'm not your plaything
I'm not your muse

Oh, hey you
Get over here, oh
If you should ruin what I've become
You'll be sorry that you thought I was the one

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Take me higher
I'm on fire

Oh, hey you
Get out of here, oh
I'm not the one to go insane
Said I'm amazed
Oh, come and tell me that you know you do

Get out of here
Oh, I'm not the one you can dismiss
I'm here forever
I found my bliss

Oh, I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

Oh, hey
Get over here
Just a little bit
(I'm on fire, I'm on fire)
Just a little bit
(I'm on fire)
Just a little bit
(I'm on fire)

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Take me higher
Take me higher

I'm on fire
I'm on fire

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
