JOSS STONE
Verse:
You don't have to make your mind up
I just want to take my time with you
If that's alright
It's alright, It's alright
Forgive me if I get too shy but
Maybe you're the reason why, love,
I'm feeling butterflies.

Something about the look in your eys (oooh)
Oh, it just makes me feel so right

CHORUS:
Oh, when my mind's void
You're my joy
You're the dream
when I sleep.
Hey I'm for ya
I adore ya
You're everything
that I need
And I love
how you love me
If I'm made for you
and you're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now
Yeah tell me what we're gonna do now

Verse:
It's funny how my world keeps spinning
Sometimes you can be so silly,
you know just how to make me laugh
Ooh, your skin is so lovely
it moves me when you touch me
I know that you got my back

I feel so safe when you hold me,
it's always like you know me

CHORUS:
Oh, when my mind's void
You're my joy
You're the dream
when I sleep.
Hey I'm for ya
I adore ya
You're everything
that I need
And I love
how you love me
If I'm made for you
and you're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now
Yeah tell me what we're gonna do now

Oh, oh
Right now (right now, right now)
See baby I love how you make me smile (you make me smile)
Don't leave, please stay a while
Let's make this happen
I don't care how

COMMON
Right now, let's stay in the present
Can't worry about tomorrow cause today is a blessing
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you
I see my mom in you
It's like a feelin' in ya stomach
when you want it so bad
If we keep keeping it fresh
it ain't gonna go bad
I've been through the valley of love
Rode through the shores of Cali
just to find peace of mind
Looking to the sky
asking for at least a sign
Beautiful you came at such a decent time
When we combine it's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined
You remind me of the divine
So easy
Love can be lost and then found, like Stevie
I just love having you around
you wearing the gown
I'm wearing the crown
pound for pound
we the freshest couple in town

JOSS STONE
Oh, when my mind's void
You're my joy,
the my dream
Hey I'm for ya
I adore ya
You're everything
that I need.
I love how you love me
I'm made for you
oooh, you're made for me

Oh, tell me what we're gonna do
tell me what we're gonna do now
