Everybody told me
Keep on going
But I can't go without you
People keep telling me to keep on looking
But I can't see without you
I don't wanna die while my mamma alive
Because she can't be alone
I just want to tell you the way I feel
But now I can't cause you gone
We was so young
In a world so cold
Why do some die young
While the rest grow old?
I would trade my life
If it meant you'd return
To send you to heaven
In hell I would burn for you
The tears grow long
While I write this song
Never thought I month would feel this long
My friend
Will I ever find peace again?
I don't know
Show me a sign if you can
I'm holding on to the memory that I have
When we were young
They were the best times I ever had
