Why do cupids and angels
continually haunt her dreams like memories
Of another life
is painted on her shirt in capitals

Out on the free, free way,
there's only she
and the they represented by the lights.

We went to the store and bought something great
which samples this song from Washington State.

Go, little record, go
it is named by some guy named Joe,
And the words are the letters of the words said,
Electrically played
for outer space and those of they who paid.

This song is twice occurred,
and now it's time to go away on holiday.
