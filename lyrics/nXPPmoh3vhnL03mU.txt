Can you warn me off this night,
Because there's something I can't demonstrate with words.
It's a place I've seen before,
It's a place you learn in little steps
My bones they ache from holding for resolve.

Is it ever worth the wait?
Will it feel like I was never there?
As I cannot live with what I'd say to you.
If I save me, will you heal yourself,
As my bones grow old from needing a resolve.

If I've never shown remorse,
Please know that it was always kept,
And now my bones are cold from feeling a resolve.

Am I ever worth the wait?
Will it feel like I was never there?
As I cannot live with what I'd say to you.
If I save me, will you heal yourself,
As my bones grow old from needing a resolve.
