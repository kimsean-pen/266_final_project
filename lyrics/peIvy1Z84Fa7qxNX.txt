All this time
I felt another way and I didn't know why
Deep inside
I wanna let go of this feeling tonight

It's alright, I'm ready
Won't try to hide it, I'm gonna be myself this time
Not gonna fight it, I let it all come pouring out
Before I get up, I gotta let it all come down
The sky is open, I just wanna cry everything

Cry everything
I just wanna cry everything
And you don't ever have to worry
I just wanna cry everything

Well, the last time
I gave it all away and I didn't know why
Too much pride
I wanna let go of this feeling tonight

It's alright, it's over
Won't try and fight it, I feel things coming back to life
I'm optimistic, I feel the reason deep inside
This time my tears feel like progress
Don't think it's heartbreak

I just wanna cry everything
Cry everything
I just wanna cry everything
And you don't ever have to worry, baby
I just wanna cry everything

It ain't heartache
I just wanna cry everything

'Cause I don't want this yet
You're just wishing I'll feel alright
There's nothing to say, to say
