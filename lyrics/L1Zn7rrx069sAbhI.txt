the strength of your convictions
keep the path long and true
it's up to you
you know what to do
the clarity of pure thoughts
ideas form in your mind
it's up to you
you know what to do
turn the tides of time
you know it is not easy
when the stormy clouds surrounding you
are freezing cold
you have found you're still alive
for your dreams are still beside you
face your fears
and watch the shadows fade
