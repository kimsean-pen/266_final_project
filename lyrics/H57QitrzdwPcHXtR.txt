Notorious, so notorious
So notorious

They call me notorious for livin' it up
And not givin' a fuck
Like a lion in the a land of sheep
Feel my teeth as they sink in deep

They say I'm a rebell soul
Bad to the bone
Always ready to go
Everybody wants to wear the crown
I keep lining 'em up I keep knocking 'em down

Notorious, so notorious

I am exactly what they say I am
I stand for everything that they can't stand
I can't help it I was born this way
But when I'm gone you'll remember my name

I am exactly who they say I am
Notorious, so notorious

I'm too fast, too furious
You're pushin' your luck and that's dangerous
I told you once so you better believe
You never met a motherfucker quite like me

Notorious
Notorious

I am exactly what they say I am
I stand for everything that they can't stand
I can't help it I was born this way
But when I'm gone you'll remember my name

I am exactly who they say I am

Notorious, notorious
Notorious

I am exactly what they say I am
So notorious
Notorious

I am exactly what they say I am
I stand for everything that they can't stand
I can't help it I was born this way
But when I'm gone you'll remember my name

I am exactly who they say I am
Notorious, notorious
