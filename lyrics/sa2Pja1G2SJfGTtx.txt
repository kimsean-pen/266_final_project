Survival
Survival
One more goddamn day when I know what I want
And my want will be considered tonight

Ah ah
Considered tonight
Ah ah
Just another day when all that I want
Will mark me as a sinner tonight
Ah ah
I'm a sinner tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember
The night you were struck by the sight of

Ten thousand fists in the air
Power unrestrained
Dead on the mark
Is what we will deliver tonight
Ah ah
Deliver tonight
Ah ah
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul will make you shiver tonight
Ah ah
Will make you shiver tonight, yeah
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember
The night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember
The night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air
Air
Ten thousand fists in the air
Air
Ten thousand fists in the air
