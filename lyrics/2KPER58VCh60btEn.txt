Did I beat myself to the punchline of my life?
Following my mother's footsteps, I fall in and out of time
We search for games, playing the ones in which
Our love feels more profound
I'll be the heroine waiting for my boy to knock me down

I'll hide the paper and radio tonight
So come the morning, my milk won't sour
And you'll be on my mind
It's not forever
But baby, I can make it feel alright
I hope the heavens give us time
Before they rain on our delight

You are my swimming pool
I close my eyes and pinch my nose
You are the only one
Who goes with me there
I see the pink and blue
And I love this fun, I never knew
But life still waits for me
I swear, I heard it's true

Finding out
Everything shining out loud
Am I just a foolish girl?
I wanna sing you a song
How frivolous I become
But I've never had more fun

You are my swimming pool
I close my eyes and pinch my nose
You are the only one
Who goes with me there
I see the pink and blue
And I love this fun, I never knew
But life still waits for me
I swear, I heard it's true

You are my swimming pool
I close my eyes and pinch my nose
You are the only one
Who goes with me there
I see the pink and blue
And I love this fun, I never knew
But life still waits for me
I swear, I heard it's true
