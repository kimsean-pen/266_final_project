See me running
It's a race
through the sunlight of the mind
See me running
towards that sunny
often muddy crowded side
there is laughter some disaster
my step brother
his blonde hair
his blood father
he's a bother
when the coast is clear
I will find a way
I will leave this place
Always sneaking
lonely peaking
at what is not his to share
So I push him
off a cushion
firmly put he starts to swear
There is laughter
some disaster
My step brother
on the stairs
Touch me so young
make it seem fun
take everything
you don't care
I will find a way
I will leave this place
I will find a way
I will leave this place
See me running
It's a race
sunlight cast upon my face
See me running
from the place
where I thought I could hide
See me running
It's a race
all our friends see our disgrace
See me running
It's a race
through the sunlight of the mind
