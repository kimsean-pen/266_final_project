Writings on the wall she's not there at all she
walked out the door down the stairs and throught the hall

No one saw her go no one saw her at all think
they saw a ghost 'cause they met one in the hall

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
With the granite city girl

Saw her in a dream
place I've never been
face just seemed familiar
when she turns, she's facing me
I wonder what she knows
I wonder where she goes
she might see the faces and the places down the road
and I'm not moving on
my mind is not my own
you'll be soon when i get better, better

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl

Ooh ahh
watching the world
watching the world
with the granite city girl
