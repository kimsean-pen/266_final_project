Midnight love
So strange, so new
Me and you
In this body bag build for two
I may be walking into the unknown
But at least with you I am not alone

You are the King of the castle
Insatiable fiend
Hearin' death rattle
You know what I mean
Your tongue as a sharp as a widow's peak
You're going in deep

A taste of your lips
And I am paralyzed
You're casting your spell
And I am hypnotized

You're a hellhound coming for me
Treat me like a piece of meat
Once bitten, twice shy
Be my Bela Lugosi

Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
You're my Draculalalalala

Impale by the kiss of death
Our first Ah was my last breath
Set in stone under your control
I almost think I have a soul

You are the king of the castle
Insatiable fiend
Hearin' death rattle
You know what I mean
Your tongue as a sharp as a widow's peak
You're going in deep

Forever young
Forever night
Rebel of dawn
Come take a bite

You're a hellhound coming for me
Treat me like a piece of meat
Once bitten, twice shy
Be my Bela Lugosi

Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
You're my Draculalalalala

Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
Dra-Cu-La (la-la-la)
You're my Draculalalalala
