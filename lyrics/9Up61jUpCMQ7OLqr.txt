Got no one to call
Got no one to call home
Got no where to stop
Got no place to go
Bahia

Leave your name behind
You're a stranger now
Jump into the fire
There's no danger now
Bahia

Whatchoo got in your hands?
- Got nothing to show
Is that red some blood?
- Got nothing to know
Bahia

If you want to fall in love
If you want to fall in love
Oh, if you want to fall in love
You must know
Give it up
