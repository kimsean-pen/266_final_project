We were the monsters and fire-breathers
We were the quiet sunrise leavers
You were a good girl, what could I do?
I was a lost boy when I met you

Hold me til I'm not lonely anymore
It's only the crashing of the ocean to the shore

Because in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all

We were the rebels, lone survivors
We were the cult of deep sea divers
We were young once then we grew old
We were shining, we were fool's gold

Hold me till I'm not lonely anymore
It's only the crashing of the ocean to the shore

Because in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all

Because in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
Because in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
'Cause in the dark there are no strangers,
There are no strangers at all
