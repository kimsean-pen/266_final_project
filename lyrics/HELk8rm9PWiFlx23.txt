If I compiled all my crimes and my lies into amnesty
Would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me
But I don't hear my own soul scream

I'll read your lips, watch your scarf play at your hips
And I know it's true
But I don't hear him come to you

Don't blame yourself
Don't change yourself
I just want to be over you, see, and feel numb
Don't hate yourself

If I compiled all my crimes and my lies into amnesty
Would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me
And I don't hear my own soul scream

Don't blame yourself
(Don't blame yourself)
Don't change yourself
(Don't change yourself)
I just want to be over you, see, and feel numb
(Don't hate yourself)
Don't hate yourself
