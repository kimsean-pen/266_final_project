I've got a hatful of love for you
So why are you waiting so long
Oh my love for you babe
Is going so strong

Oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as I'm here

I've got a hatful of love for you
So why are you waiting so long
Oh my love for you
Well it is going so strong

But oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as I'm here

Oh and I care for you
So why are you waiting so long
You carry on, I'll marry you
But why is it taking so long?

But oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as I'm here
But oh honey please, don't shed no tears
As long as I'm here
