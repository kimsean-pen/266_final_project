The first time that I saw you
Looking like you did
We were young
We were restless
Just two clueless kids
But if I knew then
What I know now
I'd fall in love

You're on a bus in Chicago
Three rows to the left
You know my heart is racing for you
But we never even met
If I knew then
What I know now
I'd fall in love

'cause love only comes
Once in a while
And knocks on your door
And throws you a smile
And takes every breath
Leaves every scar
Speaks through your soul
And sings to your heart
But if I knew then
What I know now
I'd fall in love

You're on a summer night in August
In the backseat of my car
Said I'm trying to get to know you
I took it way to far
But if I knew then
What I know now
I'd fall in love

(Wooaahh)
'cause love only comes
Once in a while
And knocks on your door
And throws you a smile
And takes every breath
Leaves every scar
Speaks through your soul
And sings to your heart
But if I knew then
What I know now
I'd fall in love

(Woah)
I used up
A lot of chances
But you give them back
But if again
It comes crawling
Im gonna make it last

'cause love only comes
Once in a while
And knocks on your door
And throws you a smile
It takes every breath
Leaves every scar
Speaks through your soul
And sings to your heart
But if I knew then
What I know now

(Woah)
If I knew then
What I know now

I'd fall in love
