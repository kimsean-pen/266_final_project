VERSE 1
(Don't turn your back) danger surrounds you
(Don't turn your back) to the dogs who hound you
(Don't turn your back) don't show your profile
You'll never know (you'll never know) when it's your turn to go

(Don't turn your back) on intuition
(Don't turn your back) on superstition
(Don't turn your back) to your jealous neighbor
He just might blow (he just might blow) and spoil the show

(Don't turn your back) one chance to save her
(Don't turn your back) keep her out of danger
(Don't turn your back) she'll return the favor
She wants you so (she wants you so) don't say no

Things are not always what they seem
She will always say what she means
You'll never know who your friends really are
You'll use that special option in your car
