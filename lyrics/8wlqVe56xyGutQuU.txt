Well, are you ready, Ray?
Yeah!
How about you, Frank?
Oh, I'm there, baby
How about you, Mikey?
Fuckin' ready!
Well, I think I'm alright!

1, 2, 3, 4!

3, 2, 1, we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the mornin' sun
And get a parkin' violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Give me, give me some of that vampire money
Come on!

Oh, you look like somebody I used to love

Well, 3, 2, 1, we got the bomb
Everybody hurry 'til the taxman comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the mornin' sun
And get your finger on the trigger, tap the barrel of the a gun

Hair back, motherfucker! Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Give me, give me some of that vampire money
Come on!

Ah, fuck yeah
That's right
1, 2, 3, 4!

Well, 3, 2, 1, we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the mornin' sun
And get a parkin' violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on!) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Give me, give me some of that vampire money
Come on!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
On! On!
On! On!

The music is way too loud
You're gonna have to turn it down a little
Sorry
