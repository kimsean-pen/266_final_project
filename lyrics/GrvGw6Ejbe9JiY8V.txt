He crossed the sea when he was 14
Just coins in a pocket and a place to sleep
Nothing but his hopes and dreams
And a whole lot ahead of him!

He found some work on the hull
Send money home when he could

He said he won't be here too long
One day soon he'll return!

Days turn into months turn into years
People come and and go but your still here
You still dream of going home some day
One day you'll spread your wings and fly away!

He saw the sights of london town
With a wave at his back and a shovel in hand
Earning money here and there
But never enough for a boat fare!

He settled down and found a wife
Before you know it, kids arrived
They grew up quick and so did he
Now going home is just a dream!

Days turn into months turn into years
People come and and go but your still here
You still dream of going home some day
One day you'll spread your wings and fly away!
