I just can't believe it
You left me here alone
When you coming back now?
Looking in the mirror
For all I used to know
I just can't believe it
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
Stay home
It's never like the first time
Where did it go wrong?
It's always in your head now
I always had to wonder
Why you're letting go
It's never like the first time
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
(Stay home, stay home, stay home)
(Stay home, stay home, stay home)
Been lonely since you left me
When you coming home?
Please come back to bed now
I always had to wonder
Why you're letting go
You drive me into madness
Leila, why did you leave again?
Leila, can you believe again?
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
