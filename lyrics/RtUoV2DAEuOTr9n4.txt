Last night I slept with a stranger for the first time since you've gone
Regretfully lying naked I reflect on what I've done
Her leg still forced in between mine, sticking to my skin
Stroking my chest and my hair, head resting below my chin

I'm a fox trapped in the headlights
Oh, and I'm waiting for the tires to spin over me

'Cause everything I love has gone away
Oh, 'cause everything I love has gone away

Oh, the dark night is moving slower, oh, and sleep won't rescue me
Leaving me here to suffer, this shameful misery
So I long for a taste of freedom or at least freedom from this bed
Silently picking up my clothes, I turned on my heels and I fled

And the dark of the street is no solace to me
Oh, and I don't believe my conscience will ever be clear again

'Cause everything I love has gone away
Oh, 'cause everything I love has gone away

You know in a year it's gonna be better
You know in a year I'm gonna be happy
You know in a year it's gonna be better
You know in a year I'm gonna be happy

You know in a year it's gonna be better
You know in a year I'm gonna be happy
You know in a year it's gonna be better
You know in a year I'm gonna be happy

You know in a year it's gonna be better
You know in a year I'm gonna be happy
