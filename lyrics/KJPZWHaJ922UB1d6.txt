Find me the captain
Tell him i want to know
Just who is steering and who's merely holding on
And when the next wave is the last wave
I'll drag him downwards to the engine room
And never let go
Oh nicole
From the moment we met we let it get out of control
The universal dance
The black romance of running prey
The slowing down
The giving in
The final give away
I cry for mercy
You stare back blankly
I want to jump but if you're pushing me
I'll hold on tightly
