As dark as dark sky and earth, dizzily mind
As sore as sore the back of the gullet, dizziness

You can't catch me, can't catch me
Can blind birds fly? They can't

I go up the blind stairs intently

Ladies and gentleman, time is over
Ladies and gentleman, please die

排水溝に流れてゆく俺の子供は無能な欠片
俺の手じゃ何も掴めない

Like a garbage I go back to doing

Whatever I may wish, it's weed life

Night and day at the end of the day, all day and so every day
夢さえも叫ぶさ I want to become happy

薔薇色真っ赤な口笑う俺の子供は無能な欠片
自虐... 虐待... 死ね... 忘れたい... 大嫌い...
花びらゲームの数え歌
