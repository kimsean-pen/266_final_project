Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

The disrespected, the angry at heart,
I feel your pain, I feel your hurt
Hatred; it comes in waves
Tear me apart, then whats left to save?

Monster, I see your face when I close my eyes
Monster, I see your face and there's nowhere left to hide

Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

The disrespected, the angry at heart,
I feel your pain, I feel your hurt
Hatred; it comes in waves
Tear me apart, then whats left to save?

Monster, I see your face when I close my eyes
Monster, I see your face and there's nowhere left to hide

Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

Rage
The feeling flows through me
Pain
It keeps my heart beating
Hopeless
There's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight
