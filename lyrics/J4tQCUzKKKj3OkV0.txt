No we ain't gonna take it unless it's from a Doberman Pinshcer
Ladies and gentlemen, for your listening pleasure, blink
Passively one day as the sun rose out of it's house
So did this little old guy as he whistled out of his mouth
And happily and gay
Well, I guessed exactly that
Because he found a special girl
That put him in a special trance
He fell in love so quickly
What the hell was he to expect
That the girl under his arm wasn't the same
As any other girl
That he had thought that he once met
I guess you could only blame fate
Things started getting weird as they started to kiss
She often felt his beard and remembered how her father she missed
And then quietly one day
He sang a song from deep within his heart
Causing some ingestion
He finished with a great big fart and
She knew at that one moment
That song was something she heard before
So she asked him to do that again
Then out the door they hurried
She was gonna find out for sure
So she analyzed his rear end
She said, "When I was a little girl
My dad left my mom
He used to always fart and sing this special song
Now I wasn't quite so sure until your pants did fall
'Cause now I know that your my dad
Because you use Ben Wah balls"
I said a wah, wah, wah-wah-wah
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah
Ben Wah balls
Wah, wah, wah-wah-wah
Wah, wah-wah-wah, wah
Ben Wah balls
