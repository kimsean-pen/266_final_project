These are my hands
But what can they give me?
These are my eyes
But they cannot see

These are my arms but they
Don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I
Am usually drawn to sadness

And loneliness has never been
A stranger to me but

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips
But they whisper sorrow
This is my voice
But it's telling lies

I know how to laugh
But I don't know happiness
And I must confess
Instead of spring, it's always winter

And my heart has always been
A lonely hunter but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

And I must confess
Instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been
A lonely hunter but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was, guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
(I was covered with dust, covered with sorrow, covered)
Love tried to take me in

Still, love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
(Covered with dust and sin)
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

Love tried to welcome me
(Love tried to welcome me)
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
(But my soul drew back)
Love tried to take me in
(I was covered with sadness)

Love tried to welcome me
