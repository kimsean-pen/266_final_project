The city's saving grace
But whoever knows, nobody knows
Why she rolled the eyes back?
Why he rolled those eyes? Those heartless eyes

Well, I won't pretend to lie once more
Protect my mind aside
You say goodbye, I'll keep all the things
You mark the place where I exist

Our world is calling so I'm crawling back to sea
Against the surge of waves that
Held us with that ancient grip beneath
Retreat to safer waters

Still learning what chaos kills
But whoever cares, nobody cares like you do
Why we don't bend in time? Just shut the door
Why we come to the wall? Claim less is more

Well, I won't pretend to lie once more
Protect my mind aside
You say goodbye, I'll keep all the things
You mark the place where I exist

Our world is calling so I'm crawling back to sea
Against the surge of waves that
Held us with that ancient grip beneath
Retreat to safer waters

Our world is calling so I'm crawling back to sea
Against the surge of waves that
Held us with that ancient grip beneath
Retreat to safer waters

The city's saving grace
But whoever knows, nobody knows
