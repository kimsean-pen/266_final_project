Cold morning
I was looking out, it was a cold day
Songbird was drinking from a table
But songbird, you just flew away

Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
So let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
And let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind

It's not a sign of weakness
When you're searching for the places where the memories flow
There may come a time when you rearrange and may leave those memories
You've gotta let them go

Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind

Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind

Stay strong
Move on
Keep on

Stay strong
Move on
Keep on
