I am the key of dark passion
I drink my blood, I eat my flesh
A serpent kiss I give to woman
A voyage through vortex scapes

Serpent of Eve
Now there is an acid taste of life
Abhorrent christendom - inside burning
Proclaim the fall of Seraphs
Noli Tangere Me

Ad modium muscorum in marimo numero
Abyssmally distorted human morals
A serpent christ holy smile
Seven planetary demons

Serpent of Eve
