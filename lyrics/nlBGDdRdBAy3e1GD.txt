I
I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you
Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me

Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

But where do you belong
Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy
Under the pale moon

Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong

I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now
Living without you
I've left you

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
