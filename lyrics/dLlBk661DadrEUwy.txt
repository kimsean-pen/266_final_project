I am alone in this place
Don't you be fooled by [?]
It's a fantasy oh, but everything is so real
Is this a part of the game
A friendly exchange of blame, if you please
We talk of the things that we hate in ourselves [?]

I won't change and let's see
How far it can take us before it forsakes us

It pleases you to say you're sorry

If it pleases you to see me struggling, I will
Talk of the things I hate in myself as if I
I will change and let's try
How far can it take us before it forsakes us
How far can it take us before it forsakes us

Is this a part of the game
A friendly exchange of blame, if you please
It's a fantasy oh but everything is too real

It pleases you to say you're sorry when you're not
It's a dangerous slip of the tongue

If it pleases you to see me struggling, I will

If it pleases you to say you're sorry, well I'm not
It's a dangerous slip of tongue

And if it pleases you to see me struggling, I will

I don't know I was coming for you

I will change and let's oooooh

How far it can take me before it forsakes me
