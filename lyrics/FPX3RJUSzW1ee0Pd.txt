Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Thank you for all the joy and pain
Picture show, second balcony, was the place we'd meet
Second seat, gold dutch treat, you were sweet

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Save those lies, darling don't explain
I recall Central Park in fall
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess
That's not all

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane
I can see, hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined, for all time
Yours and mine, that was fine

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Thank you for seeing me again
Though we go on our separate ways
Still the memory stays, for always
My heart says, "Danke schoen"

Danke schoen, oh darling, danke schoen
I said, thank you for seeing me again
Though we go on our separate ways
Still the memory stays, for always
My heart says, "Danke schoen"
Danke schoen
I'll be the same
Danke schoen
