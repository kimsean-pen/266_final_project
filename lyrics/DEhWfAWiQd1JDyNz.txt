There is nothing in the air
Chase the waves into the cooler breeze
What is lapping in the wave
What is waiting at the water's edge

We will sink into the earth
Leave the stars a final show
Nothing is as easy as this
Nothing else is quite so beautiful

It is rolling like the fog
It is buried in the sound
It is screaming like a dog
It is sleeping in the ground

Now put him down
You know I had to
You know I did
You know I had to

I put him down
You know I had to
You know I did
You know I had to
You know I did
You know I had to
