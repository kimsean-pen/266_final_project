Second night in Paris, I
I can't help but think about our rendezvous
I miss you in the crowd
I seem to never learn my ways with you

But I just feel
We're arguin' what's in my heart (sing to)
I never knew, no, no
All of these feels

I almost missed my flight
I couldn't sleep at all, I was tossin' turnin' all night
I miss you by my side
Don't think that I'd survive this world without you
Baby I never seen, never seen
Seen so many, seen so many things that I believe
Like I believe in me and you

'Cause I just feel
We're arguin' what's in my heart (Sing to)
I never knew, no, no
All of these feels

Second night in Paris, I
I can't help but think about our rendezvous
I miss you in the crowd (Yes I do)
I seem to never learn my ways with you

But I just feel
We're arguin' what's in my heart (Sing for you)
I never knew, no, baby, no, no
All of these feels

I never knew, no, baby, no, no
All of these feels
I never knew, no, baby
All of these feels

I never knew, baby
How you make me feel
I never knew, knew
How you make me feel

I never knew, my love

I never knew, boy
How you make me feel

Oh, my love
Oh, my love, yes
Oh my love
