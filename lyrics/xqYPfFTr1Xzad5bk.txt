When I look at where I'm coming from
I know I'm blessed, and I close my eyes and smile
Sometimes I feel like
The richest man in Babylon
And I've done my best
So everything's alright inside

Oh every morning, Oh every morning
I rise, I stare at the sun
I know it is a blessing
So when the evening comes I
Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed, oh man
With my two hands in the air as far as I can
As far as I can
I can, yeah
My two hands in the air as far as I can

Oh every morning
I rise, I stare at the sun
I know it is a blessing, yeah
Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed oh man
Ooh

Sometimes I'm lost and far from home
But I'll find my way
Follow my heart and know I'll be found, someday
While I'm lost I learn and live
What do you say?
Let's have a good time until that day

Oh every morning, oh every morning
I rise, I stare at the sun
I know it is a blessing
So when the evening comes, I
Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed, oh man
With my two hands in the air as far as I can
As far as I can
I can
My two hands in the air as far as I can

Oh every morning
I rise, I stare at the sun
I know it is a blessing, yeah
Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed, oh man
With my two hands in the air as far as I can
As far as I can
I can
My two hands in the air as far as I can

With my two hands in the air as far as I can
Yeah
As far as I can
I can, yeah
My two hands in the air as far as I can
