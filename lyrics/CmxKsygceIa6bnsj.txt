The bowling alley burnt down
They said it was a cigarette
& I almost believed it
There were burns in the carpet
But everyone knows that
It was for the insurance
This is where you pick up the bus
The most famous person to come out of here was
The guy that played Leatherface in all those Chainsaw Massacres
Every business on Main Street collapsed except
Morgan's mom's place
& the whole town feels dead
The whole town feels dead
& the whole town, the whole town feels dead
I can't blame it
