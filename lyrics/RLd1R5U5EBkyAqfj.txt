Hello, is this thing on?
Excuse us for our absence
we are out in the cold
We're sick to death of hearing shots in the night
And the hate that you keep preaching
and your words full of spite
It's time 'cos we've had enough
You bring your guns, we bring our hearts
and our weapons of love
I hope you watch as we take to the streets
because together we are stronger
and as one we bring peace
I'll label myself as a voice of a people who feels
Disenfranchised and fcked off again
'Cos every time that we think we make progress you come and
destroy what we fought to rebuild
And nothing was born out of nothing
It's time to unite
and just show them our strenght
The enemy can be defeated
as long as we stand up together and sing
Let us Live
Let us Love
Let us show you
That enough is enough
March on,
keep pounding your feet
I know there's anger in your blood
but you remember to keep the love that
Those cunts tried to put out
because their violence and murder is not
what we're about
I'll label myself as a voice of a people who feels
Disenfranchised and fcked off again
'Cos every time that we think we make progress you come and
destroy what we fought to rebuild
And nothing was born out of nothing
It's time to unite
and just show them our strenght
The enemy can be defeated
as long as we stand up together and sing
Let us Live
Let us Love
Let us show you
That enough is enough
(Let us Live)
(Let us Love)
(Let us Live)
(Let us Love)
(Let us Live)
(Let us Love)
(Let us Live)
(Let us Love)
Let us Live
Let us Love
Let us show you
That enough is enough
Let us Live
Let us Love
Let us show you
That enough is enough.
