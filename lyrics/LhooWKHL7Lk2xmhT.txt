Hey, if we can solve any problem, then why do we lose so many tears
Oh and so you go again, when the leading man appears
Always the same thing, can't you see
We've got everything goin' on and on and on

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah, maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move, it doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on sayin' the same thing, just can't you see
We've got everything, baby even know, you know

Everytime you go away, yeah
You take a piece of me with you, oh
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause baby, can't you see
We've got everything goin' on and on and on

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
