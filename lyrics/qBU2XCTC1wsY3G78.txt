And I came back here, for this hole
Stupid enough to lose control

And I sing to find me in pain
And I dance to have you again

And I'm back to be only one
I turned my back, now I just run

And I feel colors in your soul
And I hope one day I go home

Sky, bring the love back into my heart

And I wonder: why so much trouble
I thought it was all so simple

And I will try to find my way
But today I'm not okay

Sky, bring the love back into my heart
