Reckless - Ms Mr
Burn through beats that pulse through the day, oh
A sober awakening
Only when we're lost, can we find ourselves again
A ritual that can't be explained
Burn through beats that pulse through the day, oh
A sober awakening
Only when we're lost, can we find ourselves again
A ritual that can't be explained
Of the unknown and the set strange
Wreck the room, tactical tool
Lined in step, we're par-paralyzed fools
Fools, fools, fools
Higher than heaven, carless
Dancing in the dark, being reckless
Reckless
Burn through beats that pulse through the day, oh
A sober awakening
Only when we're lost, can we find ourselves again
A ritual that can't be explained
Of the unknown and the set strange
Broken hearts, so can't you know where?
Privilege pavement, can be broken here
Higher than heaven, a harmless crush
Dancing in the dark, I'm living for your touch
Your touch
Hunt or be hunted
On the ground beneath the bus
Grew up careless really got the best of us
Want and be wanted
On the ground beneath the bus
Cruel complexity that got the best of us
There's no one left to receive
There's nothing more to dismiss
Burn through beats that pulse through the day, oh
A sober awakening
Only when we're lost, can we find ourselves again
A ritual that can't be explained
Burn through beats that pulse through the day, oh
A sober awakening
Only when we're lost, can we find ourselves again
A ritual that can't be explained
Of the unknown and the set strange
