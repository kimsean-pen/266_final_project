Please, please, Lindsay please!

Set the scene, I think I'm in love now
Your eyes are green, you come from above now
Easy girl, I think we're alone now
Let's get the motion in the ocean, so turn off your phone now

I want to put my hands on your skin
Underneath the clothes that you're in
So kick off your shoes, let the fun begin

Sun sets the colour of fire
Red hair you're taking me higher

If you were a god then I would believe
You love yourself more than you love me - oh!
