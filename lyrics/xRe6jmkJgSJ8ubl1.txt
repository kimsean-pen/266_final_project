You've got a cute way of talkin'
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walkin'
Like a dog hangin' on your lead

I'm in a spin, you know
Shakin' on string, you know

You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancin'

I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
I feel like dancin', dancin', ah

Quarter to four in the mornin'
I ain't feeling tired no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home

You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancin'
I want to dance the night away
You make me feel like dancin'
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancin'

I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away

I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
I feel like dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away, ah

And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lives away

You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away

(I feel like dancin')
You make me feel like dancin'
I wanna dance my life away
(I feel just like dancin')
You make me feel like dancin'
