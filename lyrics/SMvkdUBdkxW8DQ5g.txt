Hey!
C'mon

You soft girls
Trying to be hard girls
You know that nothing changes
Just be yourself

Never got a lot of empathy
Wearing my insides here on the outside
Could've got a little temporary relief
Peeling the broadside, getting the thrill
But it was just a distraction
To keep me up when I wasn't awake

Oh, well you soft girls
Trying to be hard girls
You know that nothing changes (Nothing changes)
Just be yourself
(Nothing changes)
(Just be yourself)

Following the path that I should
Baby, legacy leaving was completely deceiving
And I'd never gotten where I wanted to be
I didn't notice it was all just a show
I understand the attraction
Of wearing all the time

Oh, well you soft girls
Trying to be hard girls
You know that nothing changes (Nothing changes)
'Cause your hair's in your face
And all you good boys
Trying to be bad boys
You know that nothing changes (Nothing changes)
Just be yourself

Hey!
Turn it up!
Hey!
You can do it!
C'mon
Let's go!

Oh, oh, you soft girls
Trying to be hard girls
You know that nothing changes (Nothing changes)
'Cause your hair's in your face
And all you good boys
Trying to be bad boys
You know that nothing changes (Nothing changes)
Just be yourself
Hey!
