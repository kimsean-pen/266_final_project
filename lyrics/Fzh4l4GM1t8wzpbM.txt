When you were cold and shaking
You stared into my hazy eyes
I was holding steady
You were laying in my arms
As I watched you drift away

I saved you with a lie

Even though this isn't what you wanted
And even though the time is standing still
I will never let you be forgotten
I will sing this lullaby until
Until we meet again

When you were sick and restless
You told me that you felt alright
You were so addicted
To the poison in your blood
And I watched you drift away

I saved you with a lie
Singing my lullaby

Even though this isn't what you wanted
And even though the time is standing still
I will never let you be forgotten
I will sing this lullaby until
Until we meet again

I saved you with a lie
I saved you with a lie

Even though this isn't what you wanted
And even though the time is standing still
I will never let you be forgotten
I will sing this lullaby until
Until we meet again
