Lately I, I've been rolling with the tide
It swept me wet to another place
Lord knows you ain't seen enough of me
Why did I fall asleep on a love so deep?

I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me

Our love is like a fading melody
A song I should've sang, a note I should've reached
A loneliness that I find hard to describe
Stand up so many nights I couldn't been by your side

I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me

Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?
You live this life
'Cause You live this life
You live this life

I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Cheating on me, yeah

I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
I was cheating on me
Cheating on, cheating on, cheating on, cheating on me
