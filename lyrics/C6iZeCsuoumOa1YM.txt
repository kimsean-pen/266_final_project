Constant quick fixes
They make no sense

Hop on bandwagons
You make me sick
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)

I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)

Distant loud chuckles
They keep me awake
Awkward instances

Won't make you hip
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight

(When you're livin' in the shadows)
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight

(When you're livin' in the shadows)
We've said this all before
Your shadow's at the door
We've said this all before

Your shadow's at the door
There's darkness in the hall
And we won't take the fall
And we won't take the fall
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
Oh, don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
Don't you tell me, what you think is right
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
(When you're livin' in the shadows)
