All I need is to have you here
You make me flow, so sweet too see
All I know is that you make me numb
It's always cool and lives through

Many streams that turn into rivers
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
I even stared at the sky hoping to get closer
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
In the morning walk I walk near the edge

All I need is to have you here
You make me flow, so sweet too see
All I know is that you make me numb
It's always cool and lives through

I can't decide what is the best thing
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
And time will take you
And time will take you so slowly and too far
And everyone at his own speed but I will take any
Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
And everyone at his own speed but I'll take any
But I'll take any

If is life that we spend day after day
It's all I need again
If is time that we spend losing all my sense
It's all I need again
It's all I need again to bring you close to my heart
In my mind you have a taste taking all my senses
It's all I need again

All I need is to have you here
You make me flow, so sweet too see
All I know is that you make me numb
It's always cool and lives through

Many streams that turn into rivers
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
I even stared at the sky hoping to get closer
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
In the morning walk I walk near the edge
