By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion

Then the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord song in a strange land?

Then the wicked carried us away in captivity
Requiring of us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord song in a strange land?

Let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight, here tonight

Let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight, here tonight

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion

By the rivers of Babylon (dark tears of Babylon)
There we sat down (you got to sing a song)
Yeah, yeah, we wept (sing a song of love)
When we remembered Zion
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

By the rivers of Babylon (rough bits of Babylon)
There we sat down (you hear the people cry)
Yeah, yeah, we wept (they need their God)
When we remember Zion (who have the pow-)
