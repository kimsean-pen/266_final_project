Why you so damn hard to talk to?
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Ain't no fire I won't walk through
Still you act so cold to me

I won't waste no more time
Waiting for a sign
It's already clear
That you got issues
And I got questions
My one request 'fore I leave

Tell me
What it's like to have someone who's always there for you
Tell me
What it's like to love someone who gives a damn 'bout you

'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no, yeah

Am I the only one who's trying
To have a little sympathy
I would hold you while you're crying
You wouldn't dry a tear for me

I won't waste no more time
Waiting for a sign
It's already clear

Tell me
What it's like to have someone who's always there for you
Tell me
What it's like to love someone who gives a damn 'bout you

'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no, yeah
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no, yeah

What it's like to love someone who gives a damn 'bout you

'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh no, yeah
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no
'Cause I wouldn't know
Oh, no, yeah
I wouldn't know
