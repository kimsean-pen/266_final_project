Hey, hey! Just one more and i'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
And i forget how to move when my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky
Oh, it was sweet, it was wild and, oh, how we...
I trembled stuck in honey, honey, cling to me
So just one more, just one more go...
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home

Oh, just one more and i'll walk away...
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
So just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
To never go home
