Stewart

As the sun goes down
My silent little room is growing dim
And the man next door
Is saying what a lousy day it's been
And the clock on th wall
I'd like to put its ticking to an end
In the room below
The girl is crying for her guy again

After the lights go out
What will I do?
After the lights go out
Facing the night without you

There's a pidgeon that's
Been sittin' on my window-sill all day
I guess he's lonely too
I wonder if his love has flown away
When I get upon my feet
I need a cup of coffee anyway
Someone called for you
But I hung up the 'phone - what could I say?

After the lights go out
What will I do?
After the lights go out
Facing the night without you

I don't look for her
I find her in the shadow of my mind
For she's just a girl
Who's memory will be wiped away with time
Any second now
The lamp down the street will show its light
And I just can't seem
To tear away her kisses from the night

After the lights go out
What will I do?
After the lights go out
Facing the night without you

Facing the night without you
Facing the night without you
Facing the night without you
Facing the night without you...
