I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better
I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better

I won't leave you for a money man
No matter what we go through
I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better

I don't know why you always think that I
Always think I'm unsatisfied
That I'm tempted by kings with the finest of things
But you know that ain't got no truth

I don't know why you always think that I'm
Unhappy with our paradise
That I'm wanting the trees that are growing the green
But you know all that I want is you

I thought you know me better babe
Than to think that I would do you that way
I don't need a house in the hills and I
I don't need a man like Midas

I thought you knew me better, babe
Than to think that I would do you that way
I don't need a house and a Benz, I just
I just want your love

I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better
I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better

I won't leave you for a money man
No matter what we go through
I'm not gonna leave you now
Oh, I know it's gon' get better

I don't know why you always think that I
Always think I'm unsatisfied
That I'm tempted by kings with the finest of things
But you know that ain't got no truth

I don't know why you always think that I'm
Unhappy with our paradise
That I'm wanting the trees that are growing the green
But you know all that I want is you

I thought you know me better babe
Than to think that I would do you that way
I don't need a house in the hills and I
I don't want man like Midas

I thought you knew me better, babe
Than to think that I would do you that way
