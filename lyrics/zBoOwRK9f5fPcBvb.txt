Can you find my angel?
She crawled under the bed
I thought I saw her breathing
But found out she was dead
It is too late
It's over
Can't you feel these dreams (it's over)
Message to the queen (it's over)
The baby stops breathing (it's over)
Can't you feel these dreams?
It's over

Could you call a doctor who can stop by at nine?
Well I planned this day for dying
But now I'm feeling fine... its too late(its over)
Can't you feel these dreams (it's over)
Message to the queen (it's over)
The Baby stops breathing (it's over)
Can't you feel these dreams?
It's over

The Creature is walking
The Creature is.

I've got to find a new passage way
I've got to get home by Saturday
Queen to Castle, Church to Nun
What a wicked web I've spun
I've go to get home by Saturday
So I have to find a new passage way
I've got a car with no place to go
"How bout a little fire scarecrow?"

Wake yourself up
You've been dreaming again
About having new friends in a ghost town

Can't you feel these dreams (it's over)
The Baby stops breathing (it's over)
Message to the Queen (it's over)
Can't you feel these dreams (it's over)
It's over
