Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
Violence is spread worldwide and theres families on the street
We sell drugs to children now, oh why can't we just see?
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay
But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

I've been seeing Lisa now, for a little over a year
She says she's never been so happy, but Lisa lives in fear
That one day Daddy's gonna find out that she's in love
With a Nigger from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then, but she's still here with me
Cuz she believes that love will see it through
One day he'll understand
He'll see me as a person, not just a black man
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find a way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way
Love will find the way
