I heard what you said and I can tell you it's true
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you
Turn in my sleep, a bad dream is over
Think of you and shall I ever recover?

Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

I stood at the kitchen sink, my radio played
songs like 'Tainted Love' and 'Love Is Strange'
As I listened and the words hit my ears
I cried sudden tears

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

It's mad, to be in love with someone else
when you're in love with he
she's in love with me
but you know as well as I do
I can never think of anyone but you
all my life
Play with fire, play with guns
It's easy to impress someone
Turning in my sleep, you called me a fool
To fall in love, is it so uncool?

Now I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Now I want to wake up

I want to wake up with you
