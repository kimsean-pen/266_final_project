Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Over you, over you

Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Over you, over you

I gotta cookie for ya
Gotta cook it for ya, baby
Too soon out the oven
Ain't good for nobody but lately

You keep on leaving too fast
How do we make it all last?
Give me a replay
Let's get a relay
Hand me over, won't you throw me a bone

I want us out the door
Want a walk in the park (mmm, so much, yeah)
I mean, I'm missing you so much
That's what it's all about

I never get to talking like this (no)
Only to myself in private (I swear)
But ooo you make me ooze subconscious (yeah)
Boy you know how to wreak havoc
In my mind

Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Over you, over you

Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Don't make me lose my mind
Over you, over you
