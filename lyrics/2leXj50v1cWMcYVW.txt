Well I can see you standing there like you know what to do
You all think you know me but you haven't got a clue
Well I can see you looking but you're looking at the floor
But I don't think I really care 'cause you've paid at the door

And it's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to like
And if you'd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to see well I might let you stay

I know that you want something and you want it from me
Everyone says we're the same but I just can not see
And I know what you're asking for 'cause I've just read the tie
Would paying once or maybe twice be really such a crime?

And it's not that I'm not the romantic type
It's just that I like what I choose to like
And if you'd only take the time to look my way
If you would only take the time to see well I might let you stay
