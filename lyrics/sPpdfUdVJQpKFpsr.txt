You say this will be alright
Just put my faith in you
Let you have another try
And show me all that you can do
But now here we go again
Back down a dead-end street
I'm hoping maybe this time though
The truth and the lies might meet
But I don't think they'll get along

If I didn't know that look
In your eyes so well
Then maybe I could play your game
And believe the lies you tell
You say this is for my good
Well my good could use some help
You promised me my heaven
But I'm living in your hell

Maybe in another life
And maybe I can find you there
Or maybe we can make this right
Or maybe I just wouldn't care
I've taken this long enough
And I can't go on this way
So I guess it's over now
There's only one thing left to say

It's time to be moving on

If I didn't know that look
In your eyes so well
Then maybe I could play your game
And believe the lies you tell
You say this is for my good
Well my good could use some help
You promised me my heaven
But I'm living in your hell

You only want someone to blame
But that's just who you are
Well all I wanted to find was something beautiful
I thought that I had found something to last forever
But all there was to find is you're no better
You're no better

You're no better
You're no better
If I didn't know that look
In your eyes so well
Then maybe I could play your game
And believe the lies you tell
You say this is for my good
Well my good could use some help
You promised me my heaven
But you know this song too well
You say this is for my good
Well my good could use some help
You promised me my heaven
But I'm living in your hell
