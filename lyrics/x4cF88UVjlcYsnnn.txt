Drove downtown in the rain
Nine thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late night
Record shop
Call it impulsive
Call it compulsive
Call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop
It's a matter of instinct
It's a matter of conditioning
Matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov, dog

Ring a bell and I'll salivate
And how'd you like that?
Dr.Landy tell me
You're not just a pedagogue

Cause right now I'm
Lyin' in bed, just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
I'm lyin' in bed just like Brian Wilson did ohh

So I'm lyin' here
Just starin' at the ceilin' tiles
And I'm thinkin' about
What to think about
Just listenin' and relistenin'
To smiley smile
And I'm wonderin' if this is
Some kind of creative drought because

I'm lyin' in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
I'm lyin' in bed just like Brian Wilson did ohh

And if you wanna find me I'll be
Out in the sandbox
Just wonderin' where the hell all the
Love is gone
I'm playin' my guitar and buildin'
Castles in the sun, woh wo woh
And singin', "Fun, fun, fun"

I'm lyin' in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
I'm lyin' in bed just like Brian Wilson did ohh

I had a dream
That I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground, ohh
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
Couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me

Because I'm
I'm lyin' in bed
Just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
I'm lyin' in bed just like Brian Wilson did, ooh yea

Drove downtown in the rain
Nine thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late night
Record shop
(Late night record shop)
Call it impulsive
You can call it compulsive
And you can call it insane, ohh ohh
But when I'm surrounded I just can't
Stop
