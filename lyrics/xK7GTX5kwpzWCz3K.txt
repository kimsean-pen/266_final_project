You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're always right behind me

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a faze

Or will this be around forever

Don't you know it's going too fast

Racing so hard you know it won't last

Don't you know, what can't you see

Slow it down, read the sign, so you know just where you are going

Stop right Now

Thank you very much

I need somebody with the human touch

Hey you you always on the run

Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Do Do Do Do Do

Do Do Do Do Do

Do Do Do Do Do
Always be together

Ba da Ba Ba
Ba da Ba Ba
Ba da Ba Ba
Stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turnaround
Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know what can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign, so you know just where you are going
Stop right Now
Thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Gotta keep it down honey, lay your backs on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face
Stop right now
Thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Stop right Now
Thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Stop right Now, we wanna thank you
Stop right Now(Hey you you always on the run,gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun) thank you very much(thank you very much)
