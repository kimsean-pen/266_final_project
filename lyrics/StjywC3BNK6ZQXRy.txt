Lonely.
But not when you hold me.
Your beauty weighs on me,
This feeling is too good.
(hey, listen)
Lonely,
But not when you hold me.
But not when you- me.
But not when you hold me.
You-you-yo- lonely (Philo).
Not when you hold me.
But not when you- me.
But not when you hold me.
(hey, listen)
Lonely,
But not when you hold me.
But not when you- lonely.
But not when you hold me.
(not when you...)
