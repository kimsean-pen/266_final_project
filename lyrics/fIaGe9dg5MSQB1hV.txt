You had me at the time
You didn't want me, want me
I tried to give it up

Is it all because of love
That it hurts me, that it hurts me
Is it all because of trust

Up to you it's just a game(?)
Time to make my great escape
Up to you it's just a game(?)
Time to make a great mistake

You had me at the time
You didn't want me, want me
I tried to give it up

Up to you it's just a game(?)
Time to make a great escape

One thing all my life
Time to get control
One thing all my life
Time to get control

Up to you it's just a game(?)
Time to make a great escape
