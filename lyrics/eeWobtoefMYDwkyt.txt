Now, listen, Julie baby
It ain't natural for you to cry in the midnight
It ain't natural for you to cry way into midnight through
Until the wee small hours, long 'fore the break of dawn
Oh, Lord

Now, Julie, an' there ain't nothin' on my mind
More further 'way than what you're lookin' for
I see the way you jumped at me, Lord, from behind the door
And looked into my eyes

Your little star struck innuendos, inadequacies an' foreign bodies
And the sunlight shining through the crack in the window pane
Numbs my brain
And the sunlight shining through the crack in the window pane
Numbs my brain, oh, Lord

So, open up the window and let me breathe
I said, open up the window and let me breathe
I'm looking down to the street below, Lord, I cried for you
I cried, I cried for you, oh Lord

The cool room, Lord, is a fool's room
The cool room, Lord, is a fool's room
And I can almost smell your T.B. sheets
And I can almost smell your T.B. sheets
On your sick bed

I gotta go, I gotta go
And you said, "Please, stay I wanna, I wanna
I want a drink of water, I want a drink of water
Go in the kitchen, get me a drink of water"

I said, "I gotta go, I gotta go, baby"
I said, "I'll send, I'll send somebody around, later
You know we got John comin' around here later
With a bottle of wine for you, baby, but I gotta go"

The cool room, Lord, is a fool's room
The cool room, Lord, Lord, is a fool's room
And I can almost smell your T.B. sheets
I can almost smell your T.B. sheets, T.B.

I gotta go, I'll send around, send around one that grumbles later on, babe
See what I can pick up for you, you know that
Yeah, I got a few things going too
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it, don't worry

Go, go, go, go, gotta go
Gotta, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
All right all right

I turned on the radio, wanna hear a few tunes
Turn on the radio for you
There you go, there you go
There you go, baby, there you go

You'll be all right too, yeah
I know it ain't funny, it ain't runny at all, baby
You laying in the cool room, man
You laying in the cool room, in the cool room
