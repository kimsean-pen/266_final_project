She kisses him on Bermondsey Street and
Rises high on the balls of her feet
Declares this the greatest love of the century

He fumbles for a wedding ring
She's no, no clone from Vogue magazines
She is complex in all her complexion
Love is here to heal

And I'm so proud of you
Now you must too
Take pride with what
This love you do

He kisses him on Bermondsey Street
Standing brave on the balls of his feet
Declares this the greatest love of the century

He fumbles for a wedding ring
He's no, no clone from Colt magazines
He is complex in all his complexion
Love is here to heal

And I'm so proud of you
Now you must too
Take pride with what
This love you do

Now you know
Love knows no boundaries
Sees beyond sexuality
And holds the sun in the palm of its hand
Laughs down on the cynical man
Here in what I say
Here in what I see
In two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street

Regardless of religion
Braver than any faith
No fear of society
Evolves you and me

Love

In two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street
Two kisses sweet
Two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street

In two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street
In two kisses sweet on Bermondsey Street
