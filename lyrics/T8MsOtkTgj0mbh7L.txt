Thought I wouldn't last a minute
Now you wanna make the minutes last
If that's not amiss what do we call that?
Maybe I messed up a little
Or maybe I'm a little messed up
We've been walking on ice but is it strong enough?

With everything that's burning up inside of me
Here's something for your diary
You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all was frozen after all

You say that I was way too different
Now you know me in a different way
So let me cross it off, I haven't lost enough
I think it's safe to say
I tripped up now that I'm still standing
And I won't be standing still
We're not thawing out, don't think we ever will

With everything that's burning up inside of me
Here's something for your diary
You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all was frozen after all

You know I tried my best
I asked for your heart but you asked for a breather
Now I'm feeling in my chest
I wasn't ready for this but you weren't either

With everything that's burning up inside of me
Here's something for your diary
You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all

You had the opportunity
To find out just what we could be but all was frozen after all
