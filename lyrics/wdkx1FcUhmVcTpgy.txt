Don't worry sweet baby!
Don't you ever worry about the thing
Put your worries on the shelf
And love, love yourself
Dont be your worst enemy

Hang Loose, hang Loose
Let the ocean worry about being blue
Hang Loose, hang Loose

Hang loose, hang loose
Flow with the tide and I'ma take care of you

Come with me, sweet darling
I got a ticket for the plane
We gonna fly to Wakiki
but just be you and me
And we'll let the sun melt our cares away

Hang loose, hang loose... blue
Hang loose, hang loose
Let the ocean worry about being blue
Flow with the time and I'mma think at you!
Alright, we gonna be alright
Alright, you gonna be alright!
I hang loose
I hang loose
Hang loose
I hang loose
