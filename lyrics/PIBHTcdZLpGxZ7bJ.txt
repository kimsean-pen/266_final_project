Were they anything at all
The signs that you would run
Were they painted on the wall

You don't have to
You don't have to be a stranger
It takes a lonely heart to disappear

You don't have to
You don't have to be a stranger
It takes a lonely heart to disappear

It takes a lonely heart to disappear
It takes a lonely heart to disappear
It takes a lonely heart to disappear

The lines that we had drawn
They got easier to cross
Sometimes the times are gone
Did the feeling just get lost

You don't have to be a stranger
It takes a lonely heart to disappear

You got to get it all out
You got to get it out
It takes a lonely heart to disappear

You got to get it all out

It takes a lonely heart to disappear

You don't have to
You don't have to be a stranger
