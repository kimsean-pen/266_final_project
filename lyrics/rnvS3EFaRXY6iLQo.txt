I don't need you,
I can't see you
I don't love you,
oh, where are you?

You don't seem to understand what I'm saying
You don't seem to understand that I'm going
You don't seem to understand what I'm saying
You don't seem to understand that I'm going, going home alone
On my own, on my own, on my own

I don't need you,
I can't see you
I don't love you, oh,
where are you?
On my own, on my own, on my own
On my own,
on my own,
on my own...
