I don't wanna change my face in any way
I won't fit your frame
I've seen enough to know your games
Cast yourself in the brightest sunlight
Drag me down until you feel alright

I don't wanna change my face in any way
I won't fit your frame
I've seen enough to know your games
Cast yourself in the brightest sunlight
Drag me down until you feel alright

Tell me there's a way to be
Another victim of conformity
Tell me there's a way to be
Victim of conformity

I don't wanna change my face in any way
I won't fit your frame
I've seen enough to know your games
Cast yourself in the brightest sunlight
Drag me down until you feel alright

Tired of your life
Stand in line
Take it all out on me
Try to divide
Make up your mind
Take it all out on me

Tired of your life
Stand in line
Take it all out on me
Try to divide
Make up your mind
Take it all out on me
