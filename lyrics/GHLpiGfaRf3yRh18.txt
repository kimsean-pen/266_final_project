Never ever knew that this could be
My reality, oh whoa
All my years expecting tragedy
Crashing down on me, oh whoa
Within you there's a light I could not fight
Even if I tried, oh whoa
Forever by my side in this ride
We'll never let this die, oh whoa

I will follow you til there's no
Beat left within me
There's no need for dreaming
You share the insides of what I hide
Brought me to life
Conquered all of my strife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's no need for dreaming

Hope was drifting far away from me
Furthur out to sea, oh whoa
Comfortable with being
Only worries me, oh whoa
I know where I put my sorrow
So I hollowed all my happiness
We pulled deep and pulled out the beast
Love was released, oh whoa

I will follow you til there's no
Beat left within me
There's no need for dreaming
You share the insides of what I hide
Brought me to life
Conquered all of my strife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's no need for dreaming
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's no need for dreaming

No halt on the days that we spent wasting away
You let me in
Without ever seeking praise
You overflowed my soul
And made all good things grow
And no I know I'm not made for sorrow

I will follow you til there's no
Beat left within me
There's no need for dreaming
You share the insides of what I hide
Brought me to life
Conquered all of my strife
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's no need for dreaming
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's no need for dreaming
