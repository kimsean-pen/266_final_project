Feels like there's nothing left
I'm on my own
And the road ahead, I must walk alone
They're all leaving me
Don't be leaving me

No, they can't take away my mind
Where I go, they will never find

I feel stronger, bigger
I feel taller, so much higher
Feel enlightened
Can't be frightened anymore
I can run now so much faster
And if he won't be my master
And to conquer the demons
I won't have to wait much longer
I am stronger

Through the darkest place
The faintest light
Oh, it gave me hope to face my fight
Pain delivered me
I don't need that sympathy

No, they can't take away my pride
Where I go, they will never find

I feel stronger, bigger
I feel taller, so much higher
Feel enlightened
Can't be frightened anymore
I can run now so much faster
And if he won't be my master
And to conquer the demons
I won't have to wait much longer
I am stronger

You'll see in time I will survive
Too soon to run, too late to hide
It's my destiny
Every pace, every stride

I feel stronger (tell me no tonight)
I feel stronger (tell me no tonight)
I feel stronger (I'm gonna show you why)
I feel stronger (tell me no tonight)
I feel stronger (tell me no tonight)
I feel stronger (I'm gonna show you why)
I can run now so much faster
And if he won't be my master
And to conquer the demons
I won't have to wait much longer
I am stronger
I am stronger

I've got to be stronger
I need to be stronger
I've got to feel stronger
I've got to be stronger
I've got to be stronger
I need to be stronger
I've got to feel stronger
I need to be stronger
