In a dream, on a wave.
I could tunnel underground, or I could float away.
From it all, on a holiday.
Bon voyage, I want to get away from all I know.

I could shoot into the sun.
I could be the bullet of a gatling gun.
Disappear, another dilanger on the run.
I want to get away from everything, and everyone.

We gotta get away from it all.
We gotta get away from everything we've come to know.
We gotta get gone, like on a holiday but for longer.
Away from all the silly things that are us.

I could explode.
Oh what I'd give to be a Supernova.
Oh if I could be blown to bits I would.
Yea.

We gotta get away from it all.
We gotta get away from everything we've come to know.
We gotta get gone, like on a holiday but for longer.
Away from all the silly things that are us.

And if you run from it, darling.
Baby, would you think about taking me?

We gotta get away from it all.
We gotta get away from it all.
We gotta get away from it all.
We gotta get away from it all.
