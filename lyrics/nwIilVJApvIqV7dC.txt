Two people livin' on the edge of life
Are people runnin' out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can' t let go

Two people gotta stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people gotta stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people livin' in the way we do
Are people tryin' to keep a love anew
What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feelin' fit

Two people gotta stick together
Love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people gotta stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

I? ll come runnin' to your rescue
You gotta stand by me
There? s a lot of love between us
And we should never let go, oh

Two people gotta stick together
Love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people gotta stay whatever
Give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people, stick together
Love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
One another shelter on a rainy day

Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
One another shelter on a rainy day
Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
