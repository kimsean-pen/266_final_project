All I ever wanted
Was to understand the poet in the sky
Figure out the hidden truths
He laced together and wrote in the night
And all I ever wanted
Was to find a way to express the things I feel
There's so much I don't get but
Times like this just make sense
I breathe deep and soak it all in

I'm high off you
I'm high off you
You take me
You take me home

I think too much, I dive too deep
The more I see the less I know
I live for this clarity
When you're louder than the thoughts that keep me low
And just for some turns of the hand
It all seems good, all seems fair
Right now the sun's looking me
Dead in the eyes it's
Kissing my cheek and I'm lost

I'm high off you
I'm high off you
You take me
You take me home

I'm so high in your light
When the sun stands still
I'm so high in your lights
When the sun stands still

I'm high off you
I'm high off you
You take me
You take me home
