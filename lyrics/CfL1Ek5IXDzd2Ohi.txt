Give me give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
I'll catch my hand I've been fighting for, yeah

Let me it. Yeah let me get closer
Keep me running wild, I can feel it all over
I'll catch my hand I've been fighting for, yeah
All this time been tripping and slipping around
You got me now, I'm swimming, swimming in clouds

Give me give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
'll catch my hand I've been fighting for, yeah

And I'm finding out that all and all is right at home
But telling the man my plan to never feel alone
Let me it. Yeah let me get closer
Got my hands high like I ride a rollercoaster
Cannot be yeah cannot be lonely
Looking like I love yeah we're living the moment
You got me now, I'm swimming, swimming in clouds

Give me give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
I'll catch my hand I've been fighting for, yeah

Holding my breath till there's nothing left
Hold your breath now there's nothing left
Give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
And I'm finding out that all and all is right at home
So I'm telling the man my plan to never feel alone

Give me give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
I'll catch my hand I've been fighting for, yeah

Holding my breath till there's nothing left
Hold your breath now there's nothing left
Give me that love I've been waiting for, yeah
