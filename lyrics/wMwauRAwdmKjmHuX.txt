She left her clothes in Kansas
Ever since we stepped on campus
Ever since she left her classes
So she could fill some glasses

She want a photograph
8 by 11 dreams
She's got that self worth
She learned at 17

And I could work with that
Been working all week
She's been flirtin' all night
Wishing she could own me

But I come with a lot of baggage
And a lot of ego and a lot of fashion
Just drop that 'Prada' bag
And we could probably make tonight pop
And she said

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

She left her cares on the bedpost
Next to the lipstick and the Mentos
Evian' and a candy necklace
She goes to places her friends won't

She's in the backyard
Under a starry scene
I'm thinking backseat
She's looking for the keys

And I could work with that
Been working all month
She's been flirting all night
Lady, I'm the wrong one
And she said

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight, tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

She was like, who was that singing?
I was off in the back room drinking
Savin' something, thinkin' nothing
When I heard my phone start ringin'

She was like, 'don't pick it up
'Cause tonight I ain't in love
And I just can't be here with nobody's trust'

She left her friends in high school
She's thinking, why do I like you?
If I just make do with a nice dude
I could make it to the white picket fence crew

But it just won't work like that
When I wake it's on the road
You could take me in your room
But you can't take me home
And she said

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight, tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight
Say you don't need me
But say it's all right

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight, tonight
