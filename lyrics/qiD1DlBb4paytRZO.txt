Moral man, a soldier of virtue.
Master of my life, a warrior of righteous
Thought everything would turn out like I wanted,
How could I fall victim to this sickening cancer?

Forces advancing but time crushes all.
You're losing the battle. Death, cold.
Give me the time! Death has the final say
In all that we do.

Autumn leaves, the summer is dying.
Sun upon your face, the last time I would see you.
What I would trade to remain for a moment.
Ripped away from mortal ties, thrust into eternity.

Forces advancing but time crushes all.
You're losing the battle. Death, cold.
Give me the time! Death has the final say
In all that we do.
