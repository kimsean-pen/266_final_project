What's that sound, it's the sound of the truth in us,
Reaching highs that we won't in the future.

Can't say I didn't warn yah,
It makes me want to scream,
Let's create our own fire,
Blame boys in the shape of a girl.

We, whatever you want from us,
What are you starring at,
Is it our souls?

We, embrace all the violence,
With the sparkles of happiness.
Is it us?

Are we alive, because God, saved us or
Is life is a juggernaut?
Are we alive, because God, tricked his hand,
This is all just a joke on us.

Stamp my heart, it won't stop beating on
Cage my mind, it won't stop tripping in

Can't say I didn't warn yah,
It makes me want to cream,
Let's move to California,
Find ourselves a new world.

We, embrace all the violence,
With a small dose of happiness.
Is it us?

Are we alive, because God, saved us or
Is life is a juggernaut

Are we alive, because God, tricked his hand.
This is all just a joke on us.

I want to take it back, x2

I want to live in the dark, x2

I'll end up with somebody else x4

Are we alive, because God, saved us or
Is life is a juggernaut
Are we alive, because God, tricked his hand.
This is all just a joke on us.
