Oh, maybe I just wasn't good enough
To blow your mind, you know I've tried.
Them silver lines they cut like blades of glass
Not worth the blood we've she'd for love.
So give it up, start heating, hearts have gone cold
Had enough bleed-bleeding, it's all been done before.
Give it up, start heating, hearts have gone cold
Hey now, when we gonna wake up?
But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but baby we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
So maybe I just wasn't strong enough
To tow the line, make true the lies.
The fortune found, now it's all locked away
We've lost the key, how to believe.
So give it up, start heating, hearts have gone cold
Had enough bleed-bleeding, it's all been done before.
Give it up, start heating, hearts have gone cold
Hey now, when we gonna wake up?
But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but baby we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
Oh baby I just wasn't good enough
Cause baby I just wasn't strong enough
But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but baby we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
But fools gold shines like diamonds in our eyes
Thought we had a million, but baby we got nothing
But fools gold shines like words that make us cry
We just keep on digging, find us something better
For the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
Something better for the next time, next time
