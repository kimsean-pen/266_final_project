If I see you again
Will you remember me?
If I see you again
Will you paint memories?

Three long years never fly away
Three small words speak again

Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie
Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie

If I see you again
Will you understand?
If I see you again
This was not my plan

Three long years never fly away
Three small words speak again

Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie
Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie

Three long years never fly away
Three small words please speak again

Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie
Out of sight out of mind
What a sweet lie what a sweet lie

If I see you again
Will you remember me?
