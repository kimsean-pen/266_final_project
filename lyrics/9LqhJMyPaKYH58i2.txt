Feel it rushing in
under your skin
as it takes you high
and it brings you low

You go you go and
row row row your boat

As you drift away
and feel astray
from the life you used to call your own

Then you go you go and
row row row your boat

And now we're going
against the stream
Climbing the highest tree
Running as far as we can see

Row and row your boat
until you're safe and sound
Up the river
we're going going going now

Oh and we don't know
where we're gonna end
up the river
we're going going going now
You got to row

As you leave the shore
with a human roar
and the wind beneath our wings
we will soar

as you go you go and
row row row your boat

And now we're going
against the stream.
Climbing the highest tree
Running as far as we can see

Row and row your boat
until you're safe and sound
Up the river
we're going going going now

Oh and we don't know
where we're going to end
up the river
we're going going going now
You got to row

Up we're going to go
oh and row your boat

Row and row your boat
Row and row your boat

Row and row your boat
until you're safe and sound
Up the river
we're going going going now

Oh and we don't know
where we're going to end
up the river
we're going going going now
You got to row
