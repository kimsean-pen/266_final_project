(There is no beginning)
(There is no beginning)
(There is no beginning)
(There is no beginning)

Summer is coming
Drive to the ocean
And dive into the waves
(There is no beginning)

Into the open
All these emotions
Will drift away
(There is no beginning)

Forget the fear, forget the pain
Forget heartache and shame
Forget the world and lose that ball and chain

I believe in you, I believe in me
I believe there's so much left to see
And I don't know yet who I want to be
So I'll stay free
Yeah, I'll stay free

Woke in the dead of night
I felt so scared of life and what
Will happen now
(There is no beginning)
So bandage every scar
Silence all the noise
And see
The sky is full of stars
Forget the fear, forget the pain
Forget heartache and shame
Forget the world and lose that ball and chain

I believe in you, I believe in me
I believe there's so much left to see
And I don't know yet who I want to be
So I'll stay free
Yeah, I'll stay free

(There is no beginning)
(There is no beginning)
(There is no beginning)
(So I'll stay free)

Forget the fear, forget the pain
Stay free
(There is no beginning)

Forget fear, forget pain
Live your life
Lose your chains
Lift that weight
Carry on
Always, forever

Yeah, I'll stay free
Yeah, I'll stay free
Yeah, I'll stay free
(There is no beginning)
Yeah, I'll stay free
