Time, dissolving me
Forget, forget about the pain
Just long enough for your shadowplay
And we're all wrapped up
Passing through the grain

Compose, you know
Feel it out but never let it show
Compose, you know
You'll never find enough to fill the hole

Enough to fill the hole
Enough to fill the hole

Climb up to see nothing
Throw everything away
Open up, shed yourself of shame
Anything to get your skin in the game

Compose, you know
Feel it out but never let it show
Compose, you know
You'll never find enough to fill the hole

Come around to find it
Feel it out, never let it show

You'll never fill the hole
You'll never fill the hole

Compose, you know
Feel it out but never let it show
Compose, you know
You'll never find enough to fill the hole
