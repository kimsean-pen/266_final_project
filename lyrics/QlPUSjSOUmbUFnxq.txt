tick tock im watching the clock
i cant wait til we get to rock
i wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
is that okay?
tonight is me and you alone
wont make a call, wont even write a song
see ive been waiting and waiting for the time to say
now listen babe

when youre down and its hard
and you feel like youve given your all
baby our love will always keep it real and true
cause baby its a primetime for our love
aint nobody peekin but the stars above
its a primetime for our love
and heaven is bettin on us
bang, bang, im callin your name
youre like a fire the world cant tame
i wanna riot til the stars come out and play
is that okay? okay.
tonight is me and you alone
wont take a call, wont even write a song
this'll be a personal private dance
listen baby

when youre down and its hard
and you feel like youre given your all
baby my love is always right here for you

cause baby its a primetime, for our love
aint nobody peekin' but the stars above

and heaven is bettin' on us

its a primetime for our love
and heaven is bettin on us

cause baby its a primetime for our love
aint nobody peekin but the stars above
