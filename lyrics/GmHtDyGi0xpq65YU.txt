How could the one I gave my heart to
break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me
so I can understand?
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
throw my world away?
How could the one who said "I love you"
say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to
just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
break this heart of mine?
Tell me...

How could you be so cold to me
when I gave you everything?
All my love... All I had inside.
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever!

I can't understand!

How could the one I shared my dreams with
take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me?
Somebody tell me please!
If you love me

How could you do that to me?
