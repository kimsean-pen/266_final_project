Someone out there loves you
Someone out there is lonely too
They may not know it, they may be trying to tell you
And you may not know 'til you pass on a street
Your heads turn and your eyes lock and you feel complete
Someone out there loves you

When the world's got you down and there's no end in sight
Do you give up? Keep your eyes shut?
When the days are drawn out
Feels like nothing is going your way
Do you give up? Keep your eyes shut?

You can rest assured you're not the only one

Someone out there loves you
Someone out there is lonely too
They may not know it, they may be trying to tell you
And you may not know 'til you pass on a street
Your heads turn and your eyes lock and you feel complete
Someone out there loves you

When the pages don't turn and the words are all blurred
Don't you give up, don't you give up
When you reach out a hand and courageously ask me to dance
But the music stops, keep your head up

You can rest assured you're not the only one

Someone out there loves you
Someone out there is lonely too
They may not know it, they may be trying to tell you
And you may not know 'til you pass on a street
Your heads turn and your eyes lock and you feel complete
Someone out there loves you
Someone, somewhere, out there loves you

You can rest assured you're not the only one
You can rest assured you're not the only one
You can rest assured you're not the only one
You can rest assured you're not the only one
