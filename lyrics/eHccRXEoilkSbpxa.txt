She comes into my mind
twisting thru my nerves
I don't understand
a word she says
she's on my side
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time

She comes into my mind
twisting thru my nerves
I don't understand
a word she says
she's on my side
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
