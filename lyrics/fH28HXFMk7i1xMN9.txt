You give something
When I give nothing
You give something
When I give nothing

You're the reason why
I melt away slow
I don't wanna lose my mind
That's why I keep you so close
When I'm on my own
I could give up the ghost
Cuz I don't wanna lose my mind
That's why I keep you so close

You give something
When I give nothing
