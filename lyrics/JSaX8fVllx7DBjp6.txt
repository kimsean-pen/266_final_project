Oh my God, I'm missing you
Oh my God, I'm missing you

Out my window, now the world is painted perfectly in blue
Time is moving slowly and my heart searches only for you
In the reflections on the water, in the movement of the leaves
Under the stones by the river, in the shade beneath the trees

My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you

Oh my God, I'm missing you

The miles stretched between us, they're getting hard to bear
And more and more I find myself lost in melancholy stare

My heart will keep on searching
I heard your name sail on the breeze
I turned my head to catch your shadow
But there was nothing there for me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you

Do I surrender to the blue? Because I'm drowning without you
Spend my time staring at the sun, just waiting to come undone
The sound of static in my head, my heart is heavy, limbs are lead
Sick of living in a world so cold, I can, I will, I still stay gold
I know I'm doing the right thing, this is where I'm meant to be
I've been gone far too long now, I just want you here with me

My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
I've been searching out the window in my world of pallid blue
And I keep checking my shadow in an empty room
My heart is breaking slowly, oh my God, I'm missing you
Oh my God, I'm missing you

"Hello? It's me, again; I know I shouldn't have called
But I really didn't know who else to turn to
Remember the last time we talked? You said we were both fucked up
You said you understood because you were fucked up too
I just, I just wanted to speak to you before
Well, I think you know what I'm saying
If you're there, please, pick up, please
Just for a minute, please"
