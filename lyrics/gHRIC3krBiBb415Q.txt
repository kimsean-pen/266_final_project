That's the way it goes
This city is so cold
And I'm, I'm so sold
That's why I know

I said hit it
Born to lose
We're born to lose
We're born to lose
Oh baby, I'm born to lose, oh

Nothing to do
Nothing to say
Only one thing that I want
It's the only way

I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
Oh baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose, oh

Livin' in a jungle
It ain't so hard
Livin' in a city
It will eat out, eat out your heart

I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
Oh baby, I'm born to lose

Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to

I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Oh Baby, I'm born to lose

I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
I said hit it, born to lose
Oh baby, I'm born to lose

Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
Baby, I'm born to lose
