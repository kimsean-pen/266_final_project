Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens

Hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens
More and more in this here town

Let me catch my breath to breathe
And reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe
I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light
And I can see you clear
Have to take your hand
And feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care, before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change
Let this remain

Hear the sirens

Covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer
Will they come for me next time

For every choice mistake I've made
It's not my plan
Or to send you in the arms of
Another man
And if you choose to stay I'll wait
I'll understand
It's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get
Over
Whelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know
That should I go I always loved you
Held you high above, true
I study your face
And the fear goes away

It's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get over
Whelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives
With death over our shoulder
Want you to know
That should I go I always loved you
Held you high above, true
I study your face
And the fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away
Aah ah, oh oh
Aah ah, oh oh
