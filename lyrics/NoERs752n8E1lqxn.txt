Show your face,
Pull down the sheets
Engulfed in confliction,
Once again.

The gold curtain,
Is no longer,
Considered a shelter.
The gold curtain,
Is no longer,
Considered a shelter,

CONSIDERED A SHELTER!
MOVE!

Roll out the red carpet,
For what we call the mainstay
Roll out the red carpet,
For what we call the main-

Bury yourself
With accomplishments,

You kept them all from me,
Expected to lead the way,
You'll take my dignity,
And the kingdom came,

Goodbye!

Goodbye!

Show your face!

Show your face!

Goodbye!
