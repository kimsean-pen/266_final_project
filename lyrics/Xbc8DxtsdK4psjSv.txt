Everybody told me
Everybody told me that this would happen
I didn't wanna believe
Didn't wanna believe that you were right

I was so caught up
Caught up in a world that I cut you out of
Now I'm hating myself, I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
I'll cover your eyes, I'll cover your eyes
I'll cover the truth and you'll realize

We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead

It might take some time
But I really think we could start things over
Take a look at our lives
Take a look at how fucked up we've become

In your blood-shot eyes
All I see is pain and devastation
And now I'm hating myself, I'm hating myself
I never should've shut you out

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
I'll your eyes, I'll cover your eyes
I'll cover the truth and you'll realize

We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead

Can anything bring us back to life?
Will anything make us right
Can anything bring us back to life?
Or will it make us right
'Cause i'm finding that we're falling apart
The more than it breaks my heart

We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
I'll cover your eyes, I'll cover your eyes
I'll cover the truth and you'll realize

We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
I'll cover your eyes, I'll cover your eyes
I'll cover the truth and you'll realize
We are the walking dead
Swallow the lies we're fed
I'll cover your eyes, I'll cover your eyes
I'll cover the truth and you'll realize
We're hanging by a thread
We are the walking dead
We are the walking dead
