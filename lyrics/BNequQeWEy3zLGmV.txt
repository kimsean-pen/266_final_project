I know a ghost
And when doubted his truth reveals incredible vengeance
Vanity is a sepulcher

Do as you please, shame will follow
Do as you please and shame will follow
Languages rot and insects lose interest
Mountains of plastic
Melting away

As long as these struggles are aimless
We will all be standing still
(Standing still)

When worded correctly
Truth is never a cliche
This is because so many
Are attached to their deaf ears

Collect the leaves, count them
Name them
Study each and every single one of them

As long as these struggles are aimless
We will all be standing still
(Standing still)

When worded correctly
Truth is never a cliche
This is because so many
Are attached to their deaf ears

All mistakes can be marked by borders
All of love can be traced to a maker
It's seems as if what is most important
Isn't noticed when forgotten

Do as you please, shame will follow
Do as you please and shame will follow

The sun and the moon:
You'll always take them for granted
What's delicate is lost
(Is lost)
As the selfish
Foorgot what is sacred
The humble forget themselves

When worded correctly
Truth is never a cliche
This is because so many
Are attached to their deaf ears
