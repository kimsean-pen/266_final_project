Distractions from the ordinary
Real life just not good enough
Explanations hard to come by
Living life outside the institutions
Waking in awkward situations
I wouldn't have it any other way

I can't recall a better time
Each day felt like the next would never come
I realise I couldn't get enough
Alternatives all felt like death
I wish I could safely say
All the right decisions were always made
Yeah, we were young but we're still here
Happy to starve for another year

It seems so right for one to assume
That whatwe are is what we see
What we buy, who we do
I would've ended up that way, if not for those miles
Those endless days
I know it's not for everyone
Empty halls, empty stomachs, empty hopes
In retroscpect we had it all

We didn't choose this life, this life chose us long ago
A web of friends and moments impossible to let go
Though we surrendered what others want to treasure
We ended up with so much more

We didn't choose this life, this life chose us long ago
