When things just aren't going your way
Like a problem hair you pluck or shave?
But shaving got to be such a bore
and you deserve so much more
and happyness is just a purchace away

Angelina it'll fix your hunchback
Angelina it'll help your time pass
Angelina here's a forcast
Angelina it's science we never laugh

Here's something that is automatic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life is nothing less than tragic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life has lost all it's magic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life can't promise the fantastic
It's Wax Ecstatic

Throw all your troubles away
you'll nothing left that you want to save
With this circus you'll need nothing more
and all your troubles walk out the door
and it's all just a phone call away

Angelina it'll fix your hunchback
Angelina it'll help your time pass
Angelina here's a forcast
Angelina it's science we never laugh

Here's something that is automatic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life is nothing less than tragic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life has lost all it's magic
It's Wax Ecstatic
When life can't promise the fantastic
It's Wax Ecstatic
