Ooooh wow, you're looking dirty, need a champagne shower now
Lay down, let's see if we can get the lipstick to come out

I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just, the just the song to play
Free your mind from, the from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute

Cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care I'm in it
Cracked out, snap out of it
Mo blow, wow

We tried, no luck, it's alright
Trust me honey, you look fine
I'll just walk around the city
Telling chickens that I'm pretty
And I'd love for them to meet my wife

I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just, the just the song to play
Free your mind from, the from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute

Cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care I'm in it
Cracked out, snap out of it
Mo blow, wow

And if we move too slow
Let it rot, decay, and decompose
If we just let it flow
The fairy dust could tapout
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
Never been tied down in one place too long
King of the lonely road
It's all I've ever known

Make your move tonight
Close your eyes, don't fight it anymore
And when the sun comes up we won't be wondering what, could've been, should've been
Make your move tonight, make your move tonight
