I heard the sound of your bike as your wheels hit the gravel
Then your engine in the driveway cutting off
And I pushed through the screen door and I stood out on the porch
Thinking fight, fight, fight at all costs

But instead I let you in just like I've always done
I sat you down and offered you a beer
And across the kitchen table, I fired several rounds
But you were still sitting here when the smoke cleared

And you came crawling back
To say that you wanna make good in the end
And oh, oh let me count the ways that I abhore you

And you were never a good lay
And you were never a good friend
But, oh, oh, oh what can I say
I adore you, oh

All I need is my leather, one t-shirt and two socks
I'll keep my hands warm in your pockets and use the engine block
And we'll ride out to California with my arms around your chest
And I'll pretend that this is real 'cuz this is what I like best

And you've been juggling two women like a stupid circus clown
Telling us both we are the one
And maybe you can keep me from ever being happy
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun

So let's go before I change my mind
I'll leave the luggage of all your lives behind
'Cuz I am bigger than everything that came before

And you were never very kind
And you let me way down every time
But oh, oh, oh what can I say
I adore you

I heard the sound of your bike
As your wheels hit the gravel
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off

Oh
Hey oh
Hey oh
Hey oh
