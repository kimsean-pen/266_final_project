Every feeling subsides- you drown in me
We lie in wait - oh - It lies in wait
this storm that did not break - It lies in wait - oh

And the streaming winter splinters Like a child
Stuck in the wheels inside - cut up to dry
It splinters like this heart Of mine, mine, mine
Hung out to die - oh
We save souls so fast - We've come here to defile
And if you need me to spark, just - rise
We save souls so fast - We've come here to deny
Tradition and their heart of - lies

We save souls so fast - We've come here to defy
Are you afraid of the dark inside - you?
We save souls so fast - We've come here to defile
To drain and to spiritualize - you
