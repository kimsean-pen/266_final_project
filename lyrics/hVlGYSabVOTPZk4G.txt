I don't know much about you, can you tell me your name
If you tell me yours, you'll get mine in exchange
Now, we can talk about anything

We don't remember the past like we used to
The things that we had and the things that we used to do
It didn't seem to matter

We can jump over fences and cut up our knees
Run through the forest and get beat by the trees
Break all our bones in colliding cars
But the memories will last with our healing scars

You only talked of your everyday problems
You never took action or tried to solve them
I guess it's all a game

My thoughts are drifting I'm beginning to fade
I wonder what would happen if I thought the same
Would I become a part of your game

We can jump over fences and cut up our knees
Run through the forest and get beat by the trees
Break all our bones in colliding cars
But the memories will last with our healing scars

You can't help the ones you hurt
I can't save you from yourself
(Repeat x 2)

We can jump over fences and cut up our knees
Run through the forest and get beat by the trees
Break all our bones in colliding cars
But the memories will last with our healing scars

We can jump over fences and cut up our knees
Run through the forest and get beat by the trees
I know all of this might sound sad
But the scars will remind us of the fun that we've had

You can't help the ones you hurt
I can't save you from yourself
(Repeat x 2)
