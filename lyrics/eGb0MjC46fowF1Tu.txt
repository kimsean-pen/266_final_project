We're crashing cars we used to share
With summer girls with summer hair
We're driving around, chasing the stars
But the party's busted up before it ever starts

I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young

Stop making plans, start making sense
Don't you believe any word they said
Sparked up, sparked up like a book of matches
Falling through the night and rising from the ashes

I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young

Don't come any closer, don't tell me it's over
Don't kiss me goodbye
Here we are
Am I taking this too hard?
Don't say that it's easy, the hardest part is leaving
Don't you wonder why
Suddenly we're all running out of time?

I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young
We're forever young
We're forever young
