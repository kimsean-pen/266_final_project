Freeze frame, tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now?
Forget your current lover
Remember me that one July?
Lay in bed, black under oaths
Watching the planes at night
I knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

Buy low, sell high kind of guy
Invest your time in what's worthwhile
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud?

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

You've been around the world and back
Always return to the ones you love
You've got a sense of adventure
An adventure for comfort that keeps you at home

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

Releasing, years of senseless waiting
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
