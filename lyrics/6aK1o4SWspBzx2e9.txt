Runnin' with all of my brothers
I always wondered how far we could go
If we could break through the ceiling above us
There'd be no point of us looking below

We could be free
We could be free
Finally
We could be free

I've been through the darkest of caves and suffered
One hundred steps off the end of the road
Painted with passion, my favorite color
Hope I'm alive when this story gets old

We could be free
We could be free
Finally
We could be free

I ain't at home
Home's where I'm going
I close my eyes to see
I'll take my throne, lay it on a mountain
And make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king

Lost in a world full of none believers
Searching for smoke in a still water pond
A nothing king, they called a dreamer
This is my life and I call it a song

We could be free
We could be free
Finally
We could be free

I ain't at home
Home's where I'm going
I close my eyes to see
I'll take my throne, lay it on a mountain
And make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king

Kicked through the shackles
Broke through the chains
There's no oppression
There's no one to blame but you

Kicked through the shackles
Broke through the chains
There's no oppression
There's no one to blame but you

I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king

I ain't at home
Home's where I'm going
I close my eyes to see
I'll take my throne, lay it on a mountain
And make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king
I said whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Make myself a king

Make myself a king
