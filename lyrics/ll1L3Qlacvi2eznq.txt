Can't feel the pain that I expected
I still place keys in the ignition
I know what will be
One thought is stopping me from sleeping
I saw the future and it's breeding
I know what will be

Could be a last resort
Could go against us all

There are three things that I would die for
But I am sure you're not one of them
I know what will be

Could be a last resort
Could go against us all

You think you've guarded all at dark now
You stole them off someone suspecting
I know what will be
I hold your birth control to ransom
The cells divided grow inside you
I know what will be
