Get a fucking proper pant,
Lurking shadow start to show.
Caught up with these evil grim,
Looking at your drooping pants,
Darkness starts to fucking grow,
Blasphemous endless glow,
Goddamn it pull them up,
I don't need to see all of this.
Why the fuck
Aren't you pulling it up,
Exposing more than enough,
is your ass fucking numb?
Leaving the whole humanity
to fucking barf
Hypnotizing
You self claimed
To be the most evil
Worshipping the Satan
And all that retarded believes,
Well I got a fucking news for you,
The only thing that is showing
Is your crack and
Pink boxes briefs.
Sucked in and consume us all,
Feeding until its fucking strong,
Gorging on the human race
And in the end you pull it up
But with few seconds
The immortal butt krieg is showing
Again and again, oh not again!
