I wait, nervously muddle through
You found me here alone
I followed empty dreams for you
I wait, out of the folly fields
Don't try to save me now
I wonder how it feels to be free
And I pray, I pray that I would sleep
Sleep for a thousand years there in your arms
Won't you let my soul shine like the morning sun?
Another day has come, so let me be

And if I fall, let me fall
And if I fall, let me fall

I wait, nervously muddle through
You found me here alone
I followed empty dreams for years and I
And I wait, out of the folly fields
Don't try to save me now; I
I wonder how it feels to be free

And if I fall, let me fall
And if I fall, let me fall
And if I fall, let me fall
And if I fall, let me fall

I can see a fallen angel
as she's turned to flowers and the miracle of time
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back when hope is pushing forward
Hand in the sky will lead us out of the darkness
No looking back, no looking back
