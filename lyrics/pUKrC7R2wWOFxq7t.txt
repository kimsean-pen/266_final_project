Didi, I just saw the wildest thing
Watched the sun just walk into the ocean
Nothing I could do
Gone before I knew

It's a game
I can't wait to see you
It's a game
I can't wait to see you

Didi, I belong in California
I came out here to disappear
And disconnect the dots

Knuckles on the dime
High all the time

It's a game
I can't wait to see you
It's a game
I can't wait to see you

I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Until I was today

Didi, I just heard the latest from Tall John
Couldn't turn the sound around
A ticking down the clock

There's nothing I could do
Gone before I knew
It's a game
I can't wait to see you

It's a game
I can't wait to see you
It's a game

I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Til I read that the Minutemen were dead
I'd never been so alone
Until I was today
