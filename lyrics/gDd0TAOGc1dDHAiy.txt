Let your long hair down
Lay back by my side
You know we can make it
If we can make it through the night
Don't be afraid
Don't think twice
We will find our way
To Paradise

Can't you see us now
Swaying like the sea
Loving in slow motion
Eyes closed here with me
Disco of love
Connect the dots
We'll never stray
From Paradise
