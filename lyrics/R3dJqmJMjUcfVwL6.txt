Warm days fill my head
Like beautiful lilies
And the sun casts a shadow on the clouds

And I'm dreaming...
Something to hold
Something to feel
Someone to love
Someone to need...
On down the dusty path
Goodbye! Goodbye!
I'll miss you!
And the sky puts on his grey cloak
And the day blows fear into all the lonely souls

As they wander lost along the way
Asking...
Where am I? Where am I?
And oh - those rainbows are long gone
And mud lies where those days once shone
And now there's just a space...
Something to hold
Something to feel
Someone to love
Someone to need

As they wander lost along the way
Asking...
Where am I? Where am I?
And oh - those rainbows are long gone
And mud lies where those days once shone
And now there's just a space...
Something to hold
Something to feel
Someone to love
Someone to need
