I'm not going to participate
This stupid cliche has a man to make
In the same sense, same reason twice
In the same life, just the same two lies

I love you man
I love you man

I'm not in the mood for a hole to bend
I've only got ten sheets to the wind
I've gotta spread myself in a fifth of it
Just like a Mexican blanket in the center

I love you man
I love you man

I'm not goin' crazy, I don't have babies
I just want to hurt a few people lately
I'm gonna scope this scale, then I say get well
Don't be a hero when you get to hell

I love you man
I love you man

When it's on, check 'em off with the citrus
And once that's over, it's deliberate
Gonna lie to the people that I love
I'm gonna talk shit to everyone
With emotion

I love you man
I love you man
I love you man
I love you man
