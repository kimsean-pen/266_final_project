Coming through the cracks
Of a visionary sign
You can take it if you like
It is a wonder in the black

I have all these strange visions come to me at night
Hear with satisfaction as they sing the words I like
They say do it again, take it in stride
Do it again, you'll never know

These city streets keep me bowed up and alone
Well here's some medication
You can get it through the phone

Disaffection is holy, it makes me feel alive
And I'll do it again, I'll run a mile

I lay here
I lay here
High

Give me a ring, I've got a plan
Myriad things, here in my hand

I feel my feet in the fire
I fade away from the light

It takes me far away from here
Baby sings to baby
You're safe in wings of love
Hear with satisfaction
As they circle you like doves
Feel it again
Then run a mile
Knock at the door
Feeling your smile

These city streets keep me hold up in my mind
Well here's some liberation, you can order it online
Disaffection is holy
It makes me feel alive
And I'll do it again, take it in stride
I lay here
I lay here

Why?
Disaffection is holy
It makes me feel alive
And I'll do it agin
I don't know why
I feel my feet in the fire
I feel fire in my ears
It lifts me higher and higher
It takes me far away from here
