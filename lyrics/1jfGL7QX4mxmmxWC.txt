All week I've been confined in bed
Coughing hard and I'm dripping with sweat
Nothing going on in my head
So sick and I want it to end
Taken all my medicine and I'm drinking plenty of water
I'm getting lots of rest
Following all of the doctor's orders
Yet I'm still crook as a dog
Paracetamol and vitamin C just seem to do fuck all for me
I just need a remedy
Something that'll make me better
I need something to make me go outside
I need to get it together
