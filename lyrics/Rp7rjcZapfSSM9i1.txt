Behave yourself
You need to behave yourself boy

She's built for speed like a back castrum Deloris
Good for the needy like Nietzsche, Freud and Horus

But I'm skin flint broke making no money, making jokes
But baby I won't joke with you

My feet are burning like Roman hypocaust but the
Romans are gone, they changed their names because they lost

She writes letters like a jack chick comic
Just a bunch of propaganda make my fingers histrionic

Like this

I mean, she's my baby but she makes me get avancular
And when my monkey's jumpin', I got no time to make it up to her

I fantasize about the hospital
The army, asylum, confinement prison
Any place where there's a cot to clear my vision

I spit it out
Whatever's in my mouth
Just like that black bat licorice
Yeah that black bat licorice
That black bat licorice
That black bat licorice

I want to
Cut out my tongue and let you hold on to it for me
Cause without my skull to amplify my sounds it might get boring

I've got the
Wit of the staircase with atomic clock precision
And the phases of the moon directing all of my decisions
Like this

When I need to know
I play dumb like Columbo
And get my feelings hurt
And move to New York like I'm Dumbo

Don't you want to lose the part of the brain that has opinions?
To not even know what you are doing?
Or care about yourself
Or your species in the billions?

Yeah I have to spit it out
Whatever's in my mouth
I have to spit it out
(behave yourself)
Just like that black bat licorice
That black bat licorice
That black bat licorice

I never liked it
I never will
Now say the same damn thing with the violin!

Whatever you feed me
I feed you right back
But it won't do, no good
