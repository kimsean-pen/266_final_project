No matter what I say or do
No I can't get enough of you
Oh maybe it's love and now I've seen the light
I won't go back to lonely nights

Do you believe?
This is once in a lifetime
Its time to believe
Baby make no mistake

You've been ruling my world since I found you
You got me like I can't explain
You've been ruling my world since I found you
And now I don't feel any pain
I won't feel any pain

I feel it when you call my name
Without you know I'd go insane
Can't give it up
I won't move too fast
A love like this was built to last

Do you believe?
This is once in a lifetime
Its time to believe
Baby make no mistake

You've been ruling my world since I found you
You got me like I can't explain
You've been ruling my world since I found you
And now I don't feel any pain
I won't feel any pain

You've been ruling my world since I found you
You got me like I can't explain
You've been ruling my world since I found you
And now I don't feel any pain
I won't feel any pain

You've been ruling my world since I found you
You got me like I can't explain
You've been ruling my world since I found you
And now I don't feel any pain
I won't feel any pain

No no no I won't
Feel any pain
No no no I won't
Feel any pain
No no no I won't
Feel any pain
No no no I won't
Feel any pain
