I had no reason to let her go
But I can't undo what has been done.
And for a long time, I kept believing
I'd be glad the day she found someone.
Someone again who would hold her close,
Someone again who would hold her tight,
Someone who'll know how to love and treat her right.

Ain't a man who loved you right when I was wrong
(Right when I was, right when I was wrong)
I've been trying to make you happy for so long

I had no reason to let you know
about the things I feel inside
but I can't capture in my thoughts again

I had no reason to let you know
About the things I feel inside
But I can't capture in my thoughts with you.
It didn't hurt when I was leaving.
It twisted when you cried only to break when you found somebody new

Ain't a man who loved you right when I was wrong
(Right when I was, right when I was wrong)
I've been trying to make you happy for so long
(Happy for so long, happy for so, happy for so long)

Ain't a man who loved you right when I was wrong
(Right when I was, right when I was wrong)
I've been trying to make you happy for so long
(Happy for so long, happy for so, happy for so long)

In my head I hear your whisper
asking me to come
I know I must be fantasising
with my back against the wall
I can hear it in your voice
and it is begging me to come
I thought I'd find somebody else
But now I know you are the one

Maybe there's a chance
Maybe there is a possibility
Maybe there's a way that you could learn to forgive me
Maybe it's not too late for me to show you I was wrong
Maybe I can bring you back to where you have always belonged

Ain't a man who loved you right when I was wrong
And ever since that day it's been so hard to carry on
I've been trying to make you happy for so long
But maybe our love can live to see another dawn
