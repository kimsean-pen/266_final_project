Ooh, I'm overdue

Gimme some room

Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room

Let's get dirrty (that's my chance)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are pumpin' (oh)

Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashin' (oh)
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (can you feel it)

'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Wanna get rowdy

Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Ah, heat is up

So ladies, fellas drop your cups
Body's hot front to back
Now move your ass, (ah), I like that
Tight hip huggers (low for sure)

Shake a little somethin' (on the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n til my clothes come off
Let's get open, cause a commotion (ooh oh)

We're still going, eight in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping (oh)
hot rockin', everyone's talking
Give all you got (give it to me)

Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Rowdy

Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party

Giving just what you love
