The sun is up and here we are
We try to catch a shooting star
For ever after for a day
We came together, fell apart

Pick me up
My mind and my body is ready
I'm so scared of the thought of going steady
I don't want to leave cause I like you
I really like you

Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
Diamond in the rough
In the rough
Diamond in the rough

I've played it out a million times
I've left a million valentines
For ever after for a day
I wonder if you will be mine

Pick me up
My mind and my body is ready
I'm so scared of the thought of going steady
I don't want to leave cause I like you
I really like you

Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
Diamond in the rough
In the rough
Diamond in the rough

Diamond in the rough
Diamond in the rough

I'll be leaving soon
No matter what I do
I'll be leaving soon
No matter what I do

Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough
Looking for a diamond
A diamond in the rough

In the rough
Diamond in the rough
In the rough
Diamond in the rough
