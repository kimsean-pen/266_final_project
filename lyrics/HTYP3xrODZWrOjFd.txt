I woke up with the sun in my chest.
New kicks on, shining Sunday Best.
Blanket homes, and tight rope trees.
Dark roads will cool these warm bodies.

Push that Bad down.
Wring that wash out.
Dreading the day that we begin to read into self-doubt.
Steal that gut feel,
and every cold thrill,
Let the salt sink in when everything is downhill.

Snap back to the youth in you,
Feel the done days and you're pulling through to the getting good, oh the getting good.
Close gaps in the winter stoop, when everybody lights up another hoop, that's the getting good. oh the getting good.

I broke good with every ounce of 'should'.
The Deep Blue rising underneath my hood.
Your subtle shows, are what I don't need.
I'm watching, I'm feelin'. Make the best of me.

Push that Bad down.
Wring that wash out.
Dreading the day that we begin to read into self-doubt.
Steal that gut feel,
and every cold thrill,
Let the salt sink in when everything is downhill.

Snap back to the youth in you,
Feel the done days and you're pulling through to the getting good, oh the getting good.
Close gaps in the winter stoop, when everybody lights up another hoop, that's the getting good. oh the getting good.
