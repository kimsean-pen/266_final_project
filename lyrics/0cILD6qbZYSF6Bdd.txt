I hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling on the stage
'Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be, no

Baby, I was born to play music
I am a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in a middle of the stage
And in a minute I'll be wearing it all

I don't know another way of living
Baby, I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah, Currie says we're on the edge
He said man you're really graffic
This bands a social wedge

Yeah, we all got hearts made of metal
And our blood is hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal

Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal

So mister D.J. play just one for me
You know the one with the crashin' and the screams
'Cause I like one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal loud as it can be

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal loud as it can be
