See you blowing me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on baby

If you see something in my eye
Let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be, what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just
A little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch

It's just
Some little thing
Not like every thing I do
Depends on you

•••

It's raisin' my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby

Say "That were for ever more"
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is maybe

So let it be, what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do, I'll play the wuss
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just
A little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch

It's just
Some little thing
Not like every thing I do
Depends on you

•••

Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just
A little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch

It's just
Some little thing
Not like every thing I do
Depends on you, It's just
A little crush

It's just a fling away everytime we touch
It's just
