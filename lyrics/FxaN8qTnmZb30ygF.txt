Why you? Why you gotta be so uncool?
I told you, I didn't want us to continue

But it's like it went in your ear
And came out on the other side
I guess you didn't wanna hear
But now it's time for you to get it right

In case you missed it or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Then calling all night, 'cause I won't call back
No I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you

Easy, I tried to make it easy
To leave me, but I guess you don't believe me

Running, telling all your friends
We're going on another date
Something's missing in your head
And now it's time for you to get it straight

In case you missed it or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Then calling all night, 'cause I won't call back
No I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you

I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all

In case you missed it or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Then calling all night, 'cause I won't call back
No I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you

Just in case, you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you
Just in case, you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you, over you
I'm all the way over you, over you, over you
