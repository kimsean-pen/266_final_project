You're so weak
A knife to your throat couldn't get you to speak
With my hand on your soul, I can feel your lack of anything
Now you have nothing to say?
When your fingers couldn't breathe, I took the power away
Actual suffering, primitive pain
Wires in blood. Straight to the vein

Are you the hammer or the nail?
It's a slippery slope from what I can tell
The new reality says you burn in the fire
The new reality says your talks becomes stale

To the secret circle of a dream long dead
Let silence be your offering
To the old guard drowning in it's own tears shed
Let silence be your offering
