Born of the dust
Imbued with freewill
Two souls intertwined

Lured by ophidian tongues
Blaspheming the garden of delight

O, serpent
Bringer of light
Guiding us through the darkness
Let your brilliance shine upon thee
From the depths below

Eat of this fruit forbidden
The promise of enlightenment
You can live as a slave or be rid of those chains
By embracing this serpentine covenant

O, serpent
Bringer of light
Guiding us through the darkness
Let your brilliance shine upon thee
From the depths below

Banished from this utopia
Heavenly father, what have we done?
Cast out in nakedness, ashamed
Heeding the call of this forked tongue
Let Lucifer's torch lead the way
Steering us on towards a new dawn
Feel the warmth of Satan's flame
Reveling in empowerment

Enveloped by wings as black as pitch
Enchanted by the serpent's kiss

(Solo: Davidson)

O, serpent
Bringer of light
Guiding us through the darkness
Let your brilliance shine upon thee
From the depths below
