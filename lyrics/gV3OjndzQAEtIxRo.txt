Saying one thing, thinking another
It's getting harder from time to time
Sometimes it's sad, but it will be fine
A little bit wild from time to time

Kissing the ground
I'm kissing the ground of my sleeping land
Breathing the winds
Of the eastern hills and western fields
Kissing the ground
I'm kissing the ground of my sleeping land
Breathing the winds
Of the eastern hills and western fields

Saying one thing, thinking another
It's getting harder from time to time
Sometimes it's sad, but it will be fine
A little bit wild from time to time

Kissing the ground
I'm kissing the ground of my sleeping land
Breathing the winds
Of the eastern hills and western fields
Kissing the ground
I'm kissing the ground of my sleeping land
Breathing the winds
Of the eastern hills and western fields
