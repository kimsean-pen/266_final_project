Here is a story of hope, and of glory
He's eighteen years old
And well, I fell in love
But after that where have you gone from me?
The one that I loved endlessly
We used to have a life
But now it's all gone
Mystify, mystify, mystify, mystify, mystify, mystify, mystify, mystify

Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?
Does it have to be so cold in Ireland for me?
Are they ready for me?
Are they ready for me?
Are they ready for me?
Yeah-ha...

Where have you gone from me?
The one that I loved endlessly
We were to have a child
Yesterday's gone
Well, I knew the time would come
When I'd have to leave, go on

Look what they've done to me
They've taken my hand
And it's killing me
Killing me, killing me, killing me!

Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?
Does it have to be so cold in Ireland for me?
Are they ready for me?
Are they ready for me?
Are they ready for me?

But I'm afraid, I'm returning to Ireland
I'm afraid, I'm returning to Ireland
I see, that there is nothing for me
There is nothing for me
There is nothing for me
Yeah-ha...
Yeah-ha...

He-he-he-he, he-he-he-he-he-he
He-he-he-he, he-he-he-he-he-he
Yeah-ha...
