sometimes I feel like a bird
in a scott walker song
I press my head against the wall
but sometimes the house looks like
the way I like
I am an angry meteor
under a black sky
you can feel forgotten
by God
so wake up at night
walk across the lawn
fall into my arms
in my arms
you are an angry meteor
you are coming from far away
