Yeah, sometimes I cry, sometimes I die for you
Sometimes I try, sometimes I lie for you
And at the end of the day, I feel broken
'Cause it's been a couple of days since we've spoken
I don't know why, but I'd give my life for you

Put it all on a line, I'd jump in the fire for you
When you're lonely at night, I'm there on a dime for you
And after all that you said, I was hoping
That you'd be here in my bed, but I'm coping
I don't know why, but I'd give my life for you

You said, you would care
You said, you'd be there
(Matter fact) you said, you'd be here
So, how come you're not here?

Lonely again
So lonely again
How'd I get so lonely again?
How'd I get so lonely again?

I said, I'm lonely again (I'm so lonely)
How'd I get so lonely again? (I'm so lonely)
I think I'm lonely again (I'm so lonely)
Would you come hold me again?
