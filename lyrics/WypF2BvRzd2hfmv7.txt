Honey I'm rare and you know it,
but I see you're special too!
Been along for a minute, and I could get used to you
Tell me how you want it baby,
You know you need a JUNGLE LADY
Make me go wild & crazy,
So let's move into the dark
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a JUNGLE LADY,
You know you should stay
'Cause I'm never gonna take away MY LOVE
Uuh uuh ooh oh ye

Feeling hot but you already know,
I can't hide,
I wanna show you,
Uuh ooh uh oh oooh uh oh
Don't be shy, let's go and fall in love
and hold each other close, watch the stars above
Believe me, baby
Tell me how you want it baby,
You know you need a JUNGLE LADY
Make me go wild & crazy,
So let's move into the dark
Tell me how you want it baby
You know you need a JUNGLE LADY,
JUNGLE LADY, JUNGLE LADY
Don't be shy, let's go and fall in love
and running through the dark and touch the Moon above
Believe me, baby
I want you! and I'd sink for you!
Honey I'm rare and you know it,
but I see you're special too!
Been along for a minute,
Been along for a minute,
You know you need a jungle lady!
