Mmmmm

If you wanna know real feeling
Take the time for healing
A moment in the morning for prayer
Begin anew with sunrise
Wipe the dust from your eyes
Be rid of your disguises again

A little for your father, a little for your mother
A little for your sister, a little for your brother
A little love for your soul will make you whole

If you're looking for protection
Learn to read directions
Written in the depths of your soul
Remember in the noon day
Sit in peace, meditate
Stillness takes you farther than you know

A little for your father, a little for your mother
A little for your sister, a little for your brother
A little love for your soul will make you whole

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da

If you wanna walk in power
Dedicate an hour
An hour for the shower of love
Do it in the evening
You will be receiving
The piece that you've
Been leaving behind

A little for your father, a little for your mother
A little for your sister, a little for your brother
A little love for your soul will make you whole, oh

Be rid of your disguises again
Be rid of your disguises again
Be rid of your disguises again
Be rid of your disguises again
Be rid of your disguises again
Be rid of your disguises again
