Someway, sometime
I hope you'll realize
i wish you could
see this through my eyes
and that know that life is wonderful
And know that it's a dream

I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
I just wanna show everyone that I know
This is what I'm feeling all the time
