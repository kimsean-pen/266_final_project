You started crying right in front of me
So then i embraced you and i swore i'd never let you go.
I would never let you hurt yourself, like i do
Then i pulled you tighter and i never wanted to let go.

Try to see it through my eyes - for the first time
Understand, it's further from the truth.
Try to see it through my eyes - for the last time
Understand, it's further from the truth.

Just the other day you were standing next to me with tears in your eyes

My eyes are blurring
The colors washes out
I need to see it with my own eyes

I've started... I've started to fade out
I just wish i could believe in what i see.

Don't show the tears in your eyes
Don't show what i'm becoming.
