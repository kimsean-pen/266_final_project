I am sick of being not alright
I've been like this all the time
I've been like this all the time
Kiss your feelings all goodbye
Someday you're gonna die
Someday we're all going to die
But not tonight

Shed a little light
You were everything, you were everything
I cared a little too much, I cared a little too much
Lock the doors swallow the key
You were everything
I cared a little too much, I cared a little too much
You said this was it and I believed it

I did, I did, I believed it all
I did, I did, every word I thought

Our hearts would combust
Lovers with our luck
You said this was it and I believed it
I believed

Would you care if I changed?
Would you care?

Every oar will mold
Plus these rain clouds can't cry enough to make it stay afloat
I think you wish I wasn't around anymore
I think you wish I passed in a crash of some sort

The highest rising moment of us was a blur
You cried, we drowned, as I thought we danced on the shore

I think you wish I wasn't around anymore
I think you wish I passed in a crash of some sort
I think you wish I wasn't around anymore
I think you wish I passed in a crash
