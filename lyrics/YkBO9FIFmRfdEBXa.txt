It's a dark road on the other side
Don't you see I'm alone without you
All the walls start coming down
Can't you see I'm alone without you
Spend an eternity
Missing what used to be
I hope you remember me at night
Love has forsaken me
The day you abandoned me
Save you remember me to start

Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you
Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you

Back home
But on the ground
Asking me I'm alone without you
It's a castle call of certain emotions
It seems to me I'm alone without you
Spend an eternity
Missing what used to be
I hope you remember me at night
Love has forsaken me
The day you abandoned me
Save you remember me to start

Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you
Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you

Was it already over
Before the end
Did the door start to close
Once we began
But did you let go
Can't take this type of war
No more more more yeah

Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you (without you)
Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you (without you)
Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you (without you)
Cause I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Without you-ou-ou
Without you-ou-ou
Without you-ou-ou
