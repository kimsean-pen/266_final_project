A bitter revelation is a product of ambition
No matter what you say, I will stray into submission
But what I see before me is an element of passion
In my recognition is the fallout of compassion
Taking life for granted, never struggled just to find
Illusions being planted
Deep inside of my mind

It's an invitation
To the corner of my mind
Act of desperation
To see what I can find
Here's our destination
So come on, step inside
Take my hand and you will
Discover what I hide

Deciphering enigmas is a part of who you are
Identify the secrets of the eagle and the compass star
So let it be proclaimed that I'm a slave to revelation
Show me your compassion, be a part of our creation

One dark obsession, irreversible denials
I read about one's guidance
Once together, never

It's an invitation
To the corner of my mind
Act of desperation
To see what I can find
Here's our destination
So come on, step inside
Take my hand and you will

It's an invitation
To the corner of my mind
Act of desperation
To see what I can find
Here's our destination
So come on, step inside
Take my hand and you will
Discover what I hide

It's an invitation
To the corner of my mind
Act of desperation
To see what I can find
Here's our destination
So come on, step inside
Take my hand and you will
Discover what I hide
