There's got to be someone here tonight
Who can explain to me
How shadows can also shed light

How they can outshadow
What happened between us and outline
The burnt ground beneath us

I need to be explained to
Over and over

How a broken heart is not the end of the world
Because the end of the world is bigger than love

I was in Washington D.C. for the election
And when they announced the results
I left the procession
Content in the world's direction

Tried to call you for an explanation
Of the distance to the star constellations
Or any explanation of

How a broken heart is not the end of the world
Because the end of the world is bigger than love

And it's bigger than an iceberg
Than the plume of a geyser
And it's bigger than the spider
Floating in your cider
And it's bigger than the stock market
Than the loose change in your pocket
And the Flatbush Avenue Target
And their pharmacy department
And it's bigger than our problems
And I our inability to solve them
From Coney Island to Harlem
To the end of the world and back again

A broken heart is not the end of the world
The end of the world is bigger than love
