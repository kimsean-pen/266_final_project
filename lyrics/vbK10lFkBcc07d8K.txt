I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling thru this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my Father
and all my love ones, who've gone on
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way is hard and steep
Yet beauteous fields arise before me

Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
So i'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
