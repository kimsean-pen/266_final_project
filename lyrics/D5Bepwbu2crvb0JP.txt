In yr mouth a wad of cash
Moist roll of hundreds
Fingers thru yr hair
Silver quarters drop
To yr pleated skirt

Cannisters of whipped cream
In yr sweater pockets
A look of space and total life
Ready or not
The plan is to go to dc and hang out
Go see girls rock
How long's the tour?

What time you guys playing?
Where you going next?
What comes first,
The music or the words?
