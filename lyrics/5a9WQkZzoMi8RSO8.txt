Tripping on a tightrope, pulling me far
Holding on a loose game; am I trying too hard?
Ripping at my loose hairs, sweating in dust
Toeing on a bad dream; am I rotting in rust?
Tripping on a tightrope, pulling me far
Holding on a loose game; am I trying too hard?
Ripping at my loose hairs, sweating in dust
Toeing on a bad dream; am I rotting in rust?
I could really love you, babe
But only if you let me stay
Don't let me just walk away
Hearts aren't always made to break
Don't look down
Keeping my eyes wide
And I won't fall
Pavement bound
But not this time
And I'm
Walk the rope
Eat my dust and choke
Tell myself to
Stand up right
Can't hold on tight
And I'm
Tripping on a tightrope, pulling me far
Holding on a loose game; am I trying too hard?
Ticking on a time bomb, spit on the stars
Choking on a fast fade and it's leaving me raw

And I'm
Lately I've had dreams of only you
In all of them we only speak the truth
Don't look down
Keeping my eyes wide
And I won't fall
