Workin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down a road, not a dollar in my pocket
Nighttime falls and I'm ready to rock it

I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream

Night songs, howl into the light, singin'
Night songs, makes the day right
Night songs, raise your glass, take a bite
Night songs

Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day, but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right
Livin' for the moment, time to get it tight

I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream

Night songs, howl into the light, singin'
Night songs, makes the day right
Night songs, raise your glass, take a bite
Night songs, ooh sing it

I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day, cause we're gonna scream

Night songs, night songs, night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songs, night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songs, night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songs, night songs
