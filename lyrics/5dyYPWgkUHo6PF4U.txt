I bask in familiar flesh with no shelter to call my own.
A sacrifice for my sickness, I'll dig a grave for those I love.
I release the teeth from my jaw, knowing that I will miss the pain when you take shelter in the mouth of another.
You live in the back of my throat,
spawning sentences in unison with mine.
Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost.
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough?
I've made a habit out of grinding my bones into a sharper point when I hear your name... and I've named each cut you've
cursed me with.
Though I wish I had the courage to ask for more.
Your spirit suffocates me.
You won't find asylum inside.
I never asked for your blood in my veins.
So haunt me not and disappear.
I am a victim, despite what you've heard.
Forced to dwell inside of endless
withdrawal.
We can never coexist, so I will offer up my heart.
Don't look back and try to find me, I was always doomed to watch you from the dark.
Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost.
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough?
