Bitter winter
Call me a cheater
If you're lonely
Theres nothing sweeter
Bring your things here
Don't be a deciever
She's a keeper
fickle believer
Er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er
When i grow up
It's a very big when
I'm just handing around until then
Kissing strangers
Holding their hands
Still want to go where i can begin
'cause i don't fit it here
You'll never win
With a string so thin
You'll never win
With a string so thin
Why's the sky blue?
Why do we moan?
Why do cats purr under the sun?
I've got a voice made of lithium
I'll blow your house down
If you don't let me in
You'll never win
With a string so thin
Huff and puff but
You'll never get in
Lock the doors, begin again
I was in love with everyone else
And you had your eyes shut
And i did my best
I was in love with everyone else
And you had your eyes shut
And i did my best
I was in love with everyone else
And you had your eyes shut
And i did my best
I was in love with everyone else
And you had your eyes shut
And i did my best
