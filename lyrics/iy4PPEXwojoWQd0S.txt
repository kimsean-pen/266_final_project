When she was young, they gave her a gun
And said, "shoot and run"
It's a job well done
It's a job well done
If you speak its language
It will do the rest
A little too soon she put it to the test
She put it to the test

Oh, she doesn't know much
But she knows this
Life's too short not to take risks
Oh, she steals herself and she goes for luck
She pulls the trigger and lifts it up

Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh, oh, oh, live it up
Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Happy hunter, ripe fresh kill
On to the next one, gotta chase the thrill
You gotta chase the thrill
If you wanna have fun, you gotta shoot and run
Leave it fleeted all behind, behind, behind, behind

Oh, she doesn't know much,
But she knows this
Life's too short not to take risks
Oh, she steals herself and she doesn't give a fuck
She pulls the trigger and lives it up

Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh, oh, oh, live it up
Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh-oh, oh-oh

She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and
She shoots and
She shoots and she

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it

She lives it up
Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh, oh, oh, live it up
Oh, whoa, oh, live it up
Oh-oh, oh-oh

(She lives it up) She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs (Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs

She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
