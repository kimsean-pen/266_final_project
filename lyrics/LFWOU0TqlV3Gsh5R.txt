Chasing the feels
Summer's on the way, sun is shining out
Don't hide away, find the right wine
Take a sip, drink down

Take a longer walk out by the ocean
Drift on, drift on
Deep down, deep down
Deep down you know you'll find a way
You'll find a way
By the way, I kinda like it

It's shining right, it's shining right
We'll never know, we'll never know
What did we find
Out by the ocean
Feels right to me
Drift on, drift on

Don't want to rewind
Come all that may, I'll
Drift on, drift on
Do it all again
Nothing holding us still, we'll
Drift on, drift on

Taking it in, slow it all down
Look around you now at the sundown
Lighter than before
Sit back eyes wide

It's shining right, it's shining right
We'll never know, we'll never know
What did we find
Out by the ocean
Feels right to me
Drift on, drift on

Don't want to rewind
Come all that may, I'll
Drift on, drift on
Do it all again
Nothing holding us still, we'll
Drift on, drift on

In comes the night
Stars bright, right on the sand
All around the fire
In comes the night
Stars bright, right on the sand
All around the fire

Don't want to rewind
Come all that may, I'll
Drift on, drift on
Do it all again
Nothing holding us still, we'll
Drift on, drift on

Out by the ocean
Feels right to me
Drift on, drift on
Out by the ocean
Feels right to me
Drift on, drift on
