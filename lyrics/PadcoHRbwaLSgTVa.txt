Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all ya need
If you won't let me give all of me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love the man
And that's the way it was for me

Give ya all the things I can
If you're tyin' both of my hands

Whoa-ho it ain't no way (ain't no way)

For you me to love you (hoooo)
If you won't let me

Stop tryin' to be someone you're not

Who paid too much for what hes' got

And if you need me to love you
Say, say yeah you do!
then baaby baaby.
Don't you know that I need you

Oooh it ain't no way (oooo-oooo)
