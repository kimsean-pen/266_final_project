Yeah

Cash makes the world go round
Cash makes your girl get down
Cash makes the world go round
Cash makes your girl get down

I'm chopping bricks karate in my invisible Ferrari
My car green like money, your girl calls me papi
So i burned her a copy
Fuck a CD I use floppy's
Tired of skinny I need chubby
Not Hilfiger but still Tommy, ya
I wanna be a millionaire so freaking bad
Get rich or crash trying get the things I never had
Then i wanna d-i-e with dead rock-stars I'm VIP
Get famous at overseas
My girl half mutant, half Japanese (Konichiwa)
Japanese, Japanese
My girl half mutant, half Japanese
Japanese Japanese

Ohh

Mix makes you smell cash
Anything else I smell ass
Time goes fast but my weed burns faster
You be my slave and I'll be your master
This is my time
I'm your favourite rapper
No one to blame
And you never gonna stop me
Changing styles like chamelion
Triple my 0's to the million
Wanna make it rain like shower
Snacks give me power
Been puffin on that sour
Now paralyzed for hours
Too rare like smoke
In the sky I disappear
Never wanna be broke
So I take off like a space ship
I wish my girls were all icy
Clothes i wear so damn pricey
Food I eat so spicy
So spicy
I wish my girls were all icy
Clothes i wear so damn pricey
Food I eat so spicy
