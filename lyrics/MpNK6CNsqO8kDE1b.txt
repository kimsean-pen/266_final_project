Ghost
Ghost, leap from my heart

Leap from my heart and find your way
Your way
Chase the river

Chase the sunlight
Do not stay
Open you on the sky before you
Dance toward a light so gay

Do not waste a thought behind you
Don't pity this useless clay

Snake
Snake, shed your skin
Shed your skin and go away
Away
Leave behind your shadow's memory
Leave me, this is your day
