He got me with a hook
Those big bass notes
Thunder in my chest
Mmm, stuck in my throat
Pulling me down
Like a rumble in the ground
Crawls up from the depths
With a deep down sound

Johnny got a boom boom
Johnny got a bam
He got a...

Big bomb body
Lonely neck
Swear it was a women
That he had in his grip
Big vibrations, yeah
Just one glance
He's gonna blow my mind
He's gonna make me wanna
Make me wanna, ohh

Johnny got a boom boom
Johnny got a bam
He got a...

Watch that man
See what's in his hands
Got no joy
He's a big bad boy

He's gonna freak you out
You're gonna shriek out loud
He's got ya in his hands
He's gonna make ya wanna
Make ya wanna, ohhh

Johnny got a boom boom
Johnny got a bam
He got a...

Watch that man
See what's in his hands
Got no joy
He's a big bad boy

He's gonna freak you out
You're gonna shriek out loud
He's got ya in his hands
Gonna make ya wanna
Make ya wanna, ohh

Johnny got a boom boom, oh yeah
Johnny got a bam
I said that johnny got a boom boom
Ohh yeah, Johnny got a
He got a, he got a, he got a
