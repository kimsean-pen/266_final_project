I've looked a long time to find you
I drifted through the universe, just to lay beside you
Anywhere you want me to take you, I'll go (yeah)
But there's things about me that you just don't know

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh

My heart was born out of the fire
I lost love a thousand years ago
And still, I can't find her
Now I don't love like I used to
But I've got stories I could tell you,
If I want to

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh

Ohh

If I told you where I've been
Would you still call me baby?
And if I told you everything
Would you call me crazy?

Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh
Cause baby I'm a dark star, dark star, ohh

Baby I'm a dark star, dark star ohh
