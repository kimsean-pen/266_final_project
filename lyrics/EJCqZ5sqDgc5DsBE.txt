For God's sake
You got to give more power to the people
For God's sake
Why don't you give more power to the people

There's some people up there
Hoggin' everything
Tellin' lies, givin' alibis
About the people's money and things
And if they gonna throw it away
Might as well give some to me
Yeah they seen and heard it
But never had misery
There are some people who are
Starvin' to death
Never knew but only hate us
And they never had happiness
If you don't have enough to eat
How can you think of love
You don't have the time to care
So it's crime you're guilty of, oh yeah

For God's sake
You got to give more power to the people
For God's sake
Why don't you give more power to the people

Cut this jive
And see who's got the power
When they run out of power
The world's gonna be a ghost
They know we're not satisfied
So we begin to holler
Makin' us a promise and throwin'
A few more dollars
There's no price for happiness
There's no price for love
Up goes the price of livin'
And you're right back where you was
So whatever you got,
Just be glad you got it
Now we're gonna get on up
And get some more of it

For God's sake
You got to give more power to the people
For God's sake
Why don't you give more power to the people

For God's sake
You got to give more

For God's sake
Don't you give too late

For God's sake
You got to give more power to the people

For God's sake
Why don't you give more power to the people

For God's sake
You got to give more power to the people

You got to give more power to the people
For God's sake

Give more power to the people
