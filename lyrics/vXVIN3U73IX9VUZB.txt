Take me outside, sit in the green garden
Nobody out there, but it's okay now
Bathe in the sunlight, don't mind if rain falls
Take me outside, sit in the green garden

And I'll fly on the wings of a butterfly
High as a tree tall and down again
Put my back down, taking my shoes off
Walk on the carpet, a green velvet

Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to

Take me outside, sit in the green garden
Nobody out there, but it's okay now
Bathe in the sunlight, don't mind if rain falls
Take me outside, sit in the green garden

And I'll fly on the wings of a butterfly
High as a tree tall and down again
Put my back down, taking my shoes off,
Walk on the carpet, a green velvet

Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to

Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to
Dance in my garden like we used to
