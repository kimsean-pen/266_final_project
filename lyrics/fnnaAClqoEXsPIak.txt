Keep making promises
Don't mean I'll love you less
I still wanna give you the world

You've heard it all before
But I know I'll give you more
Trust me, don't you know you're my girl

We're loving life in heaven
You and me for seven
Days are gonna pass
But it's you and me
We're dancing till the sundown
Everything is us now
We can fall in love, like back in the day

Ohhhh,
No you're never gonna walk alone
You and me we're gonna be so strong
We can die or we can take this home

Ohhhh,
Now or never when they all say no
Come an ride along the open road
We can die or we can take this home

You ain't like the other ones
Underneath that summer sun
Come and spend another with me

Girl you can ask your friends L.O.V.E.
An' ill pretend
It's like the start of a dream

We're loving life in heaven
You and me for seven
Days are gonna pass
But it's you and me
We're dancing till the sundown
Everything is us now
We can fall in love, like back in the day

Ohhhh,
No you're never gonna walk alone
You and me we're gonna be so strong
We can die or we can take this home

Ohhhh,
Now or never when they all say no
Come an ride along the open road
We can die or we can take this home
