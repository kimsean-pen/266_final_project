We've all been born
To live our lives in security
How do we know if we'll die
Or if we will recover?

From day to day
We live our lives the same way
No money to hold in our hands
And no time to spend it

So I chose the easy way out
To do my body some harm
Cut my throat and slashed my wrist
I even tried electricity
Cut my throat, slashed my wrist
It was the easy way out
