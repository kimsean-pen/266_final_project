Death lurks behind every door
Always there, awaiting my fall

Like a serpent he waits in silence
For the moment of full compliance
He yearns for my soul

My anxiety burns inside of me
I know what's in store
'Cause death awaits behind every door

Death lurks behind every face
He lingers in each and every place

His attendance so guile and vile
Behind every deceitful smile
He yearns for my soul

My anxiety burns inside of me
I know what's in store
'Cause death awaits behind every door

I yearn to be free
All that I wish for is to rest in peace
If l could be strong
I'd never ever come to this
I would be the chosen one

My anxiety burns inside of me
I know what's in store
'Cause death awaits behind every door
