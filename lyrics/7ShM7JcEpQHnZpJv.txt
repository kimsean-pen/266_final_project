She says these drugs are a lullaby
For her soul
For her soul

One of these days
She'll live her life
With full control
Full control

She'll learn
To forgive herself
She'll love me
And no one else

She'll learn
To forgive herself
She'll love me
And no one else
No one

I will roam this land
This phantom land
I will roam this land
That binds her

I will roam this land
With heart in hand
I will roam this land
To find her

It's windy through the alleys
Drenched in rain when you see me
Warm eyes but not so many words
Don't show me where your heart hurts

I will roam this land
This phantom land
I will roam this land
That binds her

I will roam this land
With heart in hand
I will roam this land
To find her

Where time goes
Only she knows
And waits
Patiently

She says these drugs are a lullaby for her soul
If I would have known she'd taken her life I would have stopped
Long ago
