The toll of the warning bell
My boots sink in bullet shells
I have become an outlaw
Nightmare of the damned
The hangman left the scaffold
I took him out, still blindfold
I made this place a ghost town
Painted the lanes red

I'll find you
I'll hunt you down
I'll be your final nightmare

I am the Gunman
I bring salvation on this day
Here comes the Gunman
You know that Vengeance is my name

When shadows hide at high noon
I kneel down by her tombstone
And from the earth she'll rise
To pass her site to you
You will beg for forgiveness
I'll make you plead and confess
Find absolution with a
Bullet in your head

I'll find you
I'll hunt you down
I'll be your final nightmare

I am the Gunman
I bring salvation on this day
Here comes the Gunman
You know that Vengeance is my name
