My Feet are on The Ground I Swear
But I'm Not Moving Anywhere
My Lungs Say That I'm Breathing
But When Will My Heart Stop Beating

I Don't Know Who I Am
Or Who I Used To Be Before
You Broke Me In A Thousand Pieces
Now Tell Me How We Might Have Fixed This

Don't You Try And Help Me 'Cause I Know
I Know
Only Time Can Heal But It's Running Out
Running Out

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My Hearts Grave

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My Hearts Grave

Dug Dug My Heart's Grave
Du-Du-Dug My Hearts
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug

My Empty Heart Is Fused
Broke Down My Walls Because of You
And Although I'm Six Feet Under
My Anxiety's Taking Over

Don't You Try And Help Me 'Cause I Know
I Know
Only Time Can Heal But It's Running Out

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My Hearts Grave

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My Hearts Grave

Dug Dug My Heart's Grave
Du-Du-Dug My Hearts
Although I'm Six Feet Under
My Anxiety's Taking Over

Grave
Dug Dug My Hearts Grave
Du-Du-Dug My Hearts
I Feel Like Such A Fool I Put My Trust In You

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My
Grave

Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
Tell Me How To Feel I Feel OK
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug My Hearts Grave

Dug Dug My Heart's Grave
Du-Du-Dug My Hearts
'Cause I Don't Know I've Been Feeling Pretty Alone
Ever Since The Day You Dug
