What if you're here when I'm not ready?
What if I'm not willing to listen?
I hope these devils never leave me
'Cos I keep taking what they're giving

Right now it feels like killing time
I'm running from the shadow of my former shadow's life
Sometimes I wonder if I was ever really there?
Right now it feels like killing time

Lately I've been thinking about
Just who I'm supposed to be
There are lines forming on my hands and face
Before today I have never seen

But right now it feels like killing time
I'm running from the shadow of my former shadow's life
Sometimes I wonder if I was ever really there?
Right now it feels like killing time

Killing time, oh
Killing time, oh
Oh

Right now it feels like killing time
I'm running from the shadow of my former shadow's life
Sometimes I think that I was never really there
Right now it feels like killing time
