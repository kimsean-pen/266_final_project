Ahhhhahah, wonder where you are

I see you go again to escape from the pain
Shouldn't left you alone (no)
But baby listen to me I can't help how I feel
theres an end of my love

You can run you can cry but look deep in my eyes
Our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all I don't want you to fall
So take my hand and tell me were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you

I wonder were you are (ohhh, yeahh)

You went away from it all couldn't take it no more
I fear you are gone
Would like to see you again say I never walk away
But I know it's to late (and I know it's to late)
You can run you can cry but look deep in my eyes
Our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all I don't want you to fall
So take my hand and tell me were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are

I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
(Wonder were you are)

Maybe you're walking in my dreams maybe I just wanna hold you
I need to find the love I once had for you

I wonder were you are
I wanna know were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are

I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are
I need to know (I really need to know who you are)
I wonder were you are
I need to know, I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you (I need you love)
I wonder were you are
