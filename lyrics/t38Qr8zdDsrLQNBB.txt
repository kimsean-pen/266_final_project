Here in the dark I can see where you are
I see so clearly
The beat of my heart just stops and starts
Whenever you're near me
I just gotta thank you, all the love I gave you
Came and you took it all away
And now there is no pain, there's everything to gain here
Now that I'm lost I think I'll stay

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
become a stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger...

I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

Here in the dark I can see where you are
I see so clearly
The beat of my heart just stops and starts
Whenever you're near me
I just gotta thank you, all the love I gave you
Came and you took it all away
And now there is no pain, there's everything to gain here
Now that I'm lost I think I'll stay

Stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger
stranger...

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger
