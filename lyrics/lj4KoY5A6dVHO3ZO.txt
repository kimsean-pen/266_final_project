I dreamt that I was dreaming
I was wired to a clock
I tinkle by the minute, hey
Tick tock, tick tick tock
I dream I'm on a train
And it is making music
I don't remember getting off
Klickity klick, klickity klick
I dreamt that I was very tall
I was bigger than King Kong
I heard the bell, the bells
A ringing a ding dong, a ding dong
I dreamt that I am sitting
In the Devil's company
He made a solemn promise
Fee fi fo fun, for me
I dreamt that I was chasing
The Monster out of me
I got him in a corner
A ha ha, hee hee hee hee
I dream I'm in a tunnel
Between here and now
Scooby Dooby
A where would you be?
Bow wow wow wow
I dream I'm at a crossroads
No place left to go
I look in each direction
A iney, a meeny, a miney moe
I dreamt that I expired
If you aren't looking dead
There's a knocking at the window
A rat tat tat tat, a rat tat tat
I dream I am an ostrich
Head deep in the sand
There's a rhythm that's a playin'
Fantastic elastic band
Na na na
I dreamt that the boogie man
Went down on Mr. Spock
Sugar was'a flowin'
Shock it to 'em sock
I dreamt I saw a moo cow
Jump across the moon
Just to fly the fan says
Zoom, zoom, zoom
I dreamt I meet a space man
He took me to his ship
Ya know he cut my hair off
Snip, snip, snip
I dreamt that I was sleeping
Asleep for heaven's sake
I dreamt I was a dreaming
It cause me to awake
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
I dreamt I was way up
I was standing on the top
With the feeling I was falling
Floppy flop
I dreamt that I'm jumping
In the circus through a hoop
Some one shut the lights off
Shopp dee doo
I dreamt that I was fast
I was never shuttin' up
I was goin' in a hurry
I was giddy yup, giddy yup
I dream I'm in the park
I'm standing in the nudie
Getting what I want
Tutti fruity, tutti fruity
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me, fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
Fee fi foe, fun for me
Fun for me
