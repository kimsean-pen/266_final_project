Live by the sword and help to contain the helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood, clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims, children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve only the words of the Lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Satan watches all of us, smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand, and your life will no longer exist
Hear our cry, save us from the Hell in which we live
We turn our heads toward the sky and listen for the steel

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay on the cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards is only a nurtured lie
Black knights of Hell's domain walk upon the dead
Satanas sits upon the blood on which he feeds

Die by the sword
Die by the sword
