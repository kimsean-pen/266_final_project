You say you don't know what you're gonna do
Without the good old days that you once knew
It's getting harder and harder, every day
To live without those times
That have gone away
Now if you had told me that in '95
That those were the best days of my life
I would've told you you're crazy, but look at me now
I would give anything at all to get back there

But I know
Some day
These will be the good old days
Some day
This will be far away
Some day
I'll look at now and wish I could go back there somehow

Well, I spent too much time just lookin' back
And wishing for the things that I used to have
And every moment that goes by, they're slippin' away
All the good good things that I had today

There's one thing I know
Some day
These will be the good old days
Some day
This will be far away
Some day
I'll look at now and wish I could go back there somehow

Some day
These will be the good old days
Some day
This will be far away
Some day
I'll look at now and wish I could go back there somehow
Some day
These will be the good old days
Some day
This will be far away
Some day
I'll look at now and wish I could go back there somehow
