It was a hard time living in the city
Broke my mind, I was trying hard to fit in
Somehow I tried to belong
They were always telling me that I was wrong
I was running around, I was chasing a dream
They had their eyes on the dirty limousine
I had to decide, I was coming along
And then it changed when you sang me that song

Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll

It was a rough time, running out of money
Had a guitar and my jacket on my shoulder
Somehow I tried to be strong
But everyone just told me that I tried for too long
When you come to the room, well you have to decide
I tell you not to fight it and it will be alright
I've got chains deep inside now I can't live without it
And yes you are right, they are playing my song

Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll

Woo-oo, everybody come along
We're together for one night and together we belong
Woo-oo, the best is yet to come
There's no reason why we can't keep singing that song

Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
Oh-oh, sing me that song
At least there's some song bringing me home
Oh-oh, same old song
I left my soul sold, play me rock and roll
