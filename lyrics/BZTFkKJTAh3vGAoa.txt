Drowning myself every night
Me versus me has always been my biggest fight
I've been so confused for so long
And the answer always seems so far out of sight
So I fill it up, fill it up one more time
so when everything is wrong at least I still feel right.
I'm in the tunnel but I can't see the light
I just wanna feel whole again
So I can let you in
I just wanna feel whole again
I just wanna feel whole
Where is my self control?
Where is my self control?
And I've been thinking this could be the end of me
Who is this person in the mirror I see?
And I have come so far, thought I was so strong
The truth is I've just fed myself a lie for too long
I never thought this would be me
But now, I'm on a verge of self destruction
How could this happen to me?
I've never been the type to run from anything
Run from anything
So sick and tired of wondering
Where my morals have gone
My father didn't raise me to become this
Where did I go wrong?
There is not much left of me
I can't feel the ground beneath my feet
There is not much left of me
I let everyone around me down
And now I'm headed to the bottom of the bottle
Just to block out the sound
God I need you now
I've been thinking this could be the end of me
Who is this person in the mirror I see?
And I have come so far, thought I was so strong
The truth is I've just fed myself a lie for too long
This is my Vice, this is me weak
I need your love to erase this doubt
I need your hand to pull me out
Sometimes I feel like I will never learn
Because the bottles always there when I have nowhere else to turn
Will I ever learn?
Will I ever learn?
I take another sip
The dark room that I'm in becomes dimly lit
This can't be all there is
And I've been thinking this could be the end of me
Who is this person in the mirror I see?
And I have come so far, thought I was so strong
The truth is I just fed myself a lie for too long
And the only one to blame is me
Who have I become?
This is my desperate shout
Pull me out! Pull me out!
God I need you now.
