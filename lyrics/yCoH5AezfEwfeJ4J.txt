Cruising, my old body's screaming for
Throwing fits, my tongue is sore
Stuck in '09 summer school, for
Tasting all I could, d'Or
Lips and candy, no more

I'm so obsessed with someone else
I can't forget where you put your mouth in
Still curious, but can't leave the couch and
So alive but so left out until now, I'm cruising

My old body's screaming for
Throwing fits, my tongue is sore
Stuck in '09 summer school, for
Tasting all I could, d'Or
Lips and candy, no more (please)

I'm so obsessed with someone else
I can't forget where you put your mouth in
Still curious, but can't leave the couch and
So alive but so left out until now, I'm cruising
