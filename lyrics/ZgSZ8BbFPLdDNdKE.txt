Don't you make me smile if you don't intend to
Only make me try if you can pretend to
Well here is my mission, my reason, my statement
My complaint

Hardly pushed your luck, focused on intention
Don't you think I lied when you said you meant it
Open up the blinds more and go to the window
Run Away

You and I (keep with me life, pretend to)
You and I (keep with me love, I'll recover)
You and I (we have seduced each other)
You-ah-da-da-da-da
You and I (and many lives sought to fought us)
You and I (except for it'd never recover)
You and I (and then we're clawing at each other's air supply)

Girls who spend their lives in disgusting gestures
Always seeking boys to relieve the tension
Maybe you know better, you know something, you know me?
Come and play
Baby if you tried, you're still not contented
Anybody else you know would cross your temple
Girl you are the reason, my mission, my lover
My complaint

You and I (keep with me life, pretend to)
You and I (keep with me love, I'll recover)
You and I (we have seduced each other)
You-ah-da-da-da-da
You and I (and many lives sought to fought us)
You and I (except for it'd never recover)
You and I (and then we're clawing at each other's air supply)
