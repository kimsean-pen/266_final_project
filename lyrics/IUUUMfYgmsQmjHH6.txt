Would you be surprised if I say I feel lonely everyday getting loner, loner
And how would you feel if I tell you that's ok
It's easier, easier this way
I've got my friends, I've got my folks, I've got my boys
I've got them all around
Don't need anyone else
I'm not a hater, not unhappy, I'm just the same
Just tired of the people, people
People talking, people lying, people living, people crying, people dieing
So many people, many people, many people, many people, many people
Would you be surprised if I say I feel lonely everyday, getting loner everyday
And how would you feel if I tell you that's ok
It's easier this way, so much easier this way
This way, this way, this way
I've got my house, I've got my space, I've got my needs
I think I've got enough, don't need anything else
I'm not a hater, not unhappy, I'm just the same
Just tired of the world, the world
Crazy world, nasty world, dirty world, filthy world, so many people in the world
We've ruined it all
Would you be surprised if I say I feel lonely everyday getting loner everyday
And how would you feel if I tell you that's ok
It's easier this way, so much easier this way
This way, this way, this way
