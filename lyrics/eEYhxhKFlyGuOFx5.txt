I'm in need of no superman
You've been around my dreams of murder in the night
Feelings born in the light
Blood in gutters and you make it right

Find your weakness and kill it
Carry on and passion flies

And I have no fear to die today
Morphine angels on their way
And the tears and the wrong stair falls away
I wish I could say I'd stay

Find your weakness and kill it
Carry on and passion flies

I'm leaving this life and my love behind
It's time to go, say'n goodbye
Take your dreams and run into the sun
Take your dreams and run

Find your weakness and kill it
Carry on and passion flies
Find your weakness and kill it
Carry on and passion flies
