Well they say that punk rock has died away,
I don\'t believe a word they say.
Sing for tomorrow sing for today,
we all need a little punk rock and roll.
The world needs a little punk rock and roll!
We all need a little punk rock and roll,
The kind that makes you wanna break some bones.
It doesnt really matter what the singer says,
As long as punk rock is beating in those heads.
I want a good feeling,
Push and shove.
I want a good feeling,
Running in my blood.
I want a good feeling,
on the open road.
I want a good feeling,
Yeah lose control.
Stay up all night,
Got my friends and my music and we're feeling all right.
Gonna stay up all night,
Gonna live before we die.
We all need a little punk rock and roll,
Tonight we gonna drink...
Forget about our problems and put the world on hold,
We all need a little punk rock and roll.
I want a good feeling,
Push and shove.
I want a good feeling,
Running in my blood.
I want a good feeling,
on the open road.
I want a good feeling,
Yeah lose control.
Stay up all night,
Got my friends and my music and we're feeling all right.
Gonna stay up all night,
Gonna live before we die.
Feel it (Feel it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Feel it (Woaaah)
(Guitar Solo)
Yeah just forget about life on a Saturday night.
Dont care about the worlds going down and ends the night.
Soon as you go and mention punk, makes me feel alright.
Stop!
Stay up all night,
Got my friends and my music and we're feeling all right.
Gonna stay up all night,
Gonna live before we die.
Stay up all night,
Got my friends and my music and we're feeling all right.
Gonna stay up all night,
Gonna live like we ain't ever gonna die.
(There you go Mickey)
