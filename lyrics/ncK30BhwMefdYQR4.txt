Touch, lying on the floor
Wishing this could last
Knowing that it can't
Soon you will leave
And I'll be on the floor
Watching the TV
Trying hard to find
A reason to move
I'm frozen in one place
Staring at the screen
Listening to the rain
Falling on the street
Some days go on too long
To know, no one can hang out tonight
Here, where the carpet's cool and soft
Underneath the clock
I feel my weary heart is put to rest
You gather around your friends
The connection that you feel
When the night has not yet died
You are new
With a promise of a love
You'll probably never find
A touch that you can really feel
The brokenness inside
As hope and less collide
And nothing is real
Love, there's nothing more I want
Than just one night
That's free of doubt and sadness
One night, one night, one night
One night that I can really feel
