Yo

There's no way you can tell man that I can't do what I want to
(I do what I want)
There's popstars that I've been with and I've got a few that I'm on to
(I'mma grab who I want)
I ain't got time to watch man that chat when it's untrue
(I don't listen to the chat)
I've worked too hard and God knows the things that I've gone tru
(On my life)

Now I gotta house in the west (I'm doing it)
Now I put the ice on my chest (I'm doing it)
Now I got plaques on the wall (I'm doing it)
Now I never answer a call (I'm doing it)
Now I gotta house in the west (I'm doing it)
Now I put the ice on my chest (I'm doing it)

It's AJ can you say it for my quickly? (AJ!)
Big man living like a pygmy (Like a wah?)
I might Bob Marley if I can't sleep (bow-bow)
But I don't love Bobby like I'm Whitney (On God)
G-Trace-oh brudda, I'm a big G (Trace!)
My young G move scratchy he's itchy (scratch-scratch)
I'm not a court or proposal
Never am I Ã–zil or a tent so you can't pitch me
I'm legit so these jakes wanna shift me (woo-woo!)
Like a keyboard broskis will shift-key (shift-shift)
I'm the Undertaker doing graveyard shifts
Put a paigon in a crypt no nipsey (coffin)
Spin a dumb yout like whiskey
Remix, spin a dumb yout man's tipsy (woo!)
Manna vexed cah I got their girl tomfooled
Then she sprayed their shit to come lips me (Ha-ha!)

I like good girls 'cause I was a bad yout (sweet gyal)
In the west end clubbing in a tracksuit (on my life)
I thought my ends were police wanna put you in a cage
These secondary school kids wanna stab you (mind out)
Don't mention my name I'll slap you (on god)
Any riddim any vibe I'll adapt to (spin it)
I see bruddas online tryna diss what I done
But I'm doing pretty well for a black yout (for a brown lad)
I'm the actual best (uh)
Gang ting I'm from actual west (Grove!)
Bros active, can't be acting all blessed (nah)
If a man speak up with actual chest (chest)
Ksubi on my jeans
Or I've got palm angel on my tee (swag)
I'm gonna make mans girlfriend come to me (me)
And I'll run man's city like Kompany (true)
