You remember that night
When I hit a red light and you pulled up next to me?
We were two young kids feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

It felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you've been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

Yeah, I always took so right
Take your tunes outside
Like you're walking in a magazine
Well you hold my hand, say you are my man
And you only have eyes for me

Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you've been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go go go go

I think I've been here before
It doesn't matter
Hurry back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I've been here before
It doesn't matter
Hurry back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

You remember that night
When I hit a red light and you pulled up next to me?
We were two young kids feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you've been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

I think I've been here before
It doesn't matter
Hurry back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I've been here before
It doesn't matter
Hurry back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

Oh, remember that night
Yeah, remember that night
Oh, remember that night
Yeah, remember that night

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
