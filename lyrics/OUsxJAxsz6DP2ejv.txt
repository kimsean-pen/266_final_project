Can't you hear the wise one say:
"What is sin? What is this thing...?"
Can't we see the ones who play
They say: "This is our day!"

You are loving it
You are leaving it
You are seeding it
You are killing it

From sunrise to sunrise
Our love reigns supreme
Mightier than any tide
Anytime

First and last thing on the mind
Is how to fly and how to die
You are truly one of a kind
Yet aligned

Killing it

From sunrise to sunrise
Our love reigns supreme
Mightier than any tide
Anytime

You are awake now
Shining somehow

Can't you hear yourself say

From sunrise to sunrise
Our love reigns supreme
Mightier than any tide
Anytime
