Coin in every pocket
More mouths to fill
So weak in the land
Strong in the will (need)
I'll be your beast of burden
I'll be the seed
I bring you the healer
Feel your disease
I bring dirty water
And make it clean (young)
And you are the cure
I am the drug

And we settle for
A little bit more than everything
We're not elected, But we will speak
We're not the chosen, But we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything

Bullets, guns and missiles
A stone and a sling
A motherless country
Of thee I sing (song)
You are the tank and rockets
I am the bomb
I teach you a lesson
Sword for a pen
Reading turn the pages
A history of man (look)
You are tabula rasa
I am the book

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected, But we will speak
We're not the chosen, But we believe
And we settle for
A little bit more than everything

I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state
I'm a non-state actor

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected but we will speak
We're not the chosen but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
