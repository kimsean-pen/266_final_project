you were talking to her
you were talking to me
everything was a blur
you were talking on me

you were lying to her
you were running alone
saw you tryin' to maker her eat all your lies
lies
i don't want to hear you
You were making a mess
You would blame it on me
You would take off your dress
And we would drop the whole thing
you were lying to her
you were running your mouth
saw you tryin' to maker her eat all your lies
lies
i don't want to hear you
