The only way, I was being hot as fire
Loving me, only gave a hug so deep can't stop me
On the road is where I go to run from the doubts of,
Oh, my dear, feel that
I will go rest my pace
Rest my pace

But darling you came my way and you saved my soul
you saved my soul
you saved my soul
But darling you came my way and you gave me hope
you gave me hope
you gave me hope

two, three, four

Was always told that salvation comes to the wrongs
Hold me close, cause I ain't neva' felt so wrong out in the cold,
And if I'm gone, the sorrow that this life holds
Will not have last the good Lord everyday
Save me from myself
Save me from myself
But...

But you darling came my way and you saved my soul
you saved my soul
you saved my soul
Darling you came my way and you gave me hope
you gave me hope
you gave me hope
Darling you came my way and you saved my soul
you saved my soul
you saved my soul
you saved my...

two, three, four
Soul
Oh, you came my way and you saved my soul
Oh, you came my way
Oh, you came my
Oh, you came my way and you gave me hope
Oh, you came my way
Oh, you came my
Oh, you came my way and you saved my soul
You came my way and you gave me hope
