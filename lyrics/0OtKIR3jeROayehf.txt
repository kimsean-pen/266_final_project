Don't be swept away
The tide has come to claim its own
It's the end and I'm drowning
Is it too late for me to run

It hates me
It mocks me
And everyday I curse
The sunrise

There's nothing in the shadows
And you will be the one to die alone
Forgive me when I fall
And I will be the one to die alone
And I will be the one to die alone

Don't be swept away
The tide has come to claim its own
Can you wash the rain away
I can see the afterlife

It wants me
It haunts me
And every day I fear
The sunrise

There's nothing in the shadows
And you will be the one to die alone
Forgive me when I fall
And I will be the one to die alone

For every broken soul
For every broken face
Fore everything that's died inside me

There's nothing in the shadows
And you will be the one to die alone
Forgive me when I fall
And I will be the one to die alone

There's nothing in the shadows
And you will be the one to die alone
Forgive me when I fall
And I will be the one to die alone

Yeah!
For every broken face
For everything that's died inside me
