Seventeen runnin' from innocence like it's a lion
Nippin' at my heels but I'm young so I out run 'em
Jailbait baby huntin' men in their 20's
Cupid's shootin' arrows but I'm cold so I out gun 'em
Bad boy talkin' fast, talkin' dirty
He tells me that I'm hot, so I tell him that I love him

And he says "girls your age never mean what they say"
I've got a renegade heart
And it's screamin' his name
But then it beats like—you've got time to kill, baby
Don't go jump the gun
Live fast while you're young, honey
Don't go chasin' love, chasin' love

Twenty one thrown back revelry, like it's morphine
Thought I knew what I wanted, I never saw you comin'
Black suit lookin' sharp with your dark eyes
He loves my imperfection so I tell him that I love him
Bad boy talkin' fast, talkin' dirty
He tells me that I'm hot so I tell him that I love him

And he says "girls your age never mean what they say"
I've got a renegade heart
And it's screamin' his name
But then it beats like—you've got time to kill, baby
Don't go jump the gun
Live fast while you're young, honey
Don't go chasin' love, chasin' love

And he says "girls your age never mean what they say"
I've got a renegade heart
And it's screamin' his name
But then it beats like— you've got time to kill, baby
Don't go jump the gun
Live fast while you're young, honey
Don't go chasin' love, chasin' love
Chasin' love
Chasin' love
Chasin' love
Chasin' love
