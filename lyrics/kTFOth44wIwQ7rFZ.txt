You tried
Yeah, I know we tried
But you still made me cry
You still made me cry

And I tried
To close my eyes
But I still saw you cry
I still saw you cry

I didn't think you had the guts
Then you really showed up
But now I'm here in our room
I'm not waiting for you

Now once again
I'm really glad you're my friend
We could do it all again
It doesn't mean it's the end

And I tried
Yeah, I know we tried
But I still made you cry
I still made you cry

And you tried
To close your eyes
But you still saw me cry
You still saw me cry
