And it makes sense
And I'll figure out where my time's gone
'Cause it's 2, in the afternoon

And I'll wake up with shoes on
And it's cold out, and you're gone
And I'll go home, and I'll sleep alone again

You miss how my beard was then

Because you and I sing so compulsively
You and I scream so compulsively

You and I sing so compulsively
