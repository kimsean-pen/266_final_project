I'm restless in our bedroom
And I'm restless with my faith
No old sins and old ways
But I fear the reaper
So when it's my time I'll find the way
To take me down and when all that remains
Is the way to take my doubt

It's suddenly haunting
It's suddenly scaring me that I'm still drowning
And pulling you down underneath
I'm starting to panic and I'm starting to feel it sink
The world is what you want but
You're better off beneath it with me

And I failed to make amends
Isn't it a shame you say all my sins and taste
What I've done wrong
But when I find my peace
Of mind I'll take you along
To take me down and when all that remains
Is the way to take my doubt

It's suddenly haunting
It's suddenly scaring me that I'm still drowning
And pulling you down underneath
I'm starting to panic and I'm starting to feel it sink
The world is what you want but you're better
Off beneath it with me

So you take the bad way
Bad state better no
Take off the lies
Never say never stay awake
To say you're wrong
Always in a state that I don't know
Taking up your lovers' time
So why are you alone?

It's suddenly haunting
It's suddenly scaring me that I'm
Still drowning and pulling you down underneath
I'm starting to panic
And I'm starting to feel it sink
The world is what you want
But you're better off beneath it with me
