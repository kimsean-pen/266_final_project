I am the fly on the wall
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer
I just came flying through your door
You didn't notice that your number had been called

I see the mother beating the babe
I see the money, the pennies you save
Stored on computers from birth to the grave

I'm telling you, fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all

I am the fly upon the wall
You're in the index of the files that stand so tall
Although your health is rather poor
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure

I know your income, your daily crust
I know your pleasures, your passion, your lust
I know when you're living, and I know when you're dust

I tell you, fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all

One is born and one will die, it's all understood
The bit that's in the middle doesn't count, no, no, no, don't count

I am the fly on the wall
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer
I just came flying through your door
You didn't notice that your number had been called

I see the mother beating the babe
I see the money, the pennies you save
Stored on computers from birth to the grave

I'm telling you, fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all
I'm telling you, fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all, woo
Fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all
Fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all
Fly on the wall
See, see, see, seeing it all
