he was from up north
part of? the North Academy?
it could have been anywhere
let's say it was... wants
imagine living n goin' nuts
sitting caught in the void
imagine days without numbers attached
drinking of course
i wrote him a letter
said "i'll never come home!"
but he never sent it
but he wrote it again n again
stacked up to the ceiling
then another stack
burn them all winter
for heat
picture a chair
and the way that he sits in it(it)
he looks out the window
i think he believes in it
