Just one birthday card sent to me
I missed my own surprise party
It's me, I'm only twenty-one years old
And now I'm drinking alone

I use my phone until it dies
Just like my plants, can't keep anything alive
Alive

And I'm sick of being my own best friend
Will you be there in the end?

Who said I
Was a nice guy?
Not I

And I'll tell you just what I want
I'll tell you just what I want

I just wanna have ice cream on my birthday
Blow the candles out and wish all of my pain away
I just wanna have ice cream on my birthday
Blow the candles out and wish all of my pain away
Away
Away
Away

I just wanna have ice cream on my birthday
(Will you be my)
I know that you're sorry, I just don't care
(My birthday date?)
Blow the candles out and wish all of my pain away
(Will you be my)
I know you're sorry, I don't care
(My birthday date?)

I just wanna have ice cream on my birthday
(Will you be my)
I know that you're sorry I just don't care
(My birthday date?)
Blow the candles out and wish all of my pain away
(Will you be my)
I know that you're sorry, I just don't care
(My birthday date?)

I know that you're sorry
I know that you're sorry
