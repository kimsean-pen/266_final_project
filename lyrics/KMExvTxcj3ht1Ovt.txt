Repeating words until they're true
It slows the breathing
Pretend they never came from you
It kills the feeling

I'm not what you want
You said what I never could
We're falling apart
You said that we never would

It's not what I want, it's wearing you down
We're back where we started, no turning around
We're falling apart, I'm tearing you down
It's not what I want now

Before you walk, you'll learn to fall
We'll stop and count to ten
We'll take these pictures off the wall
We'll stop and start again

I'm not what you want
You said what I never could
We're falling apart
You said that we never would

It's not what I want, it's wearing you down
We're back where we started, no turning around
We're falling apart, I'm tearing you down
It's not what I want
For always, always
In all ways always

(Always)
We only go so far
It's not what I want for
(Always)
We only go so far
It's not what I want now
You're not in my heart, I'm wearing you down
I'm back where I started, no turning around
You're falling apart, I'm tearing you down
It's not what I want
For always, always
In all ways always
