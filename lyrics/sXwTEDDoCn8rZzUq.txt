I looked up to the sky and wondered where to go
I heard the ringing bells and know just where to go
I picked it up and I had to let her know

The road is winding long I listen to my head
The road is winding long the sun is burning red
I picked it up and had to let her know

Woo, my tangerine dream
Woo, my tangerine dream

I rode the wind and listen to my head
I'll tell you everything I noticed what they said
I sat and listened to a man named Dr Joe

And all the while I sit and listen everyday
They tell me everything I go on my merry way
I sat and listened to a man name Dr Joe

Woo, my tangerine dream
Woo, my tangerine dream

Woo, my tangerine dream
Woo, my tangerine dream
