I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand what you put me through
Your life's a lie, that you'll hide
Is it that terrible being you inside?

I can't stand all the thought of you
I can't stand all the things you do
Why do you try to justify?
You are just too scared to be you inside

Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go

Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be

I can't stand what you put me through
I can't stand even the thought of you
Your secret lies, that you hide
Is it that terrible being you inside?

Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go

Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be
Look at you, all I see is a man too afraid to really be

You try so hard to be wanted
False emotions tells you fronted
I think being a person relies on one thing
Be yourself, let you come through

You're too afraid to really be
Someone who isn't false and doesn't care to be
You're too afraid to really be
Someone who isn't false and doesn't care to be

Fake
Fake
Fake
Fake

Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it
Fake, you will get it when we hit it

Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
