I know where they build em
i know where they're selling longs
wider than the worst ones
wider than the one i know

smoke machine begins to blow
by the water on the floor
indifferent to the written wall
lost in the wood on another hunt
if they rattle then they rattle on
do it without me, do it when i'm gone
right as I want you
right as you run
you duck

i know you watch em
i know that you want no more
maybe in the factory
maybe in the actual world
by the leaves out in the snow
my beliefs have yet to go

indifferent to the written wall
lost in the wood on another hunt
if they rattle then they rattle on

do it without me, do it when i'm gone
right i want you
right as you run
you duck

do it without me, do it when it's wrong
right as i want you
right as you run
you duck
