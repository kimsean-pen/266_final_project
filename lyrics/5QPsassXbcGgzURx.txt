No Words
I Can't Speak
The Tongue It Just Dies

And The Throat
And My Throat...

It Becomes A Tomb
A Dry Vault
Of Emptiness

Yes In This Void
In My Void
In Our Void Of Words

Echoes
They Shatter
Before They Speak

And The Throat
And My Throat...

It Becomes A Tomb
A Vessel
Of The Unsung

Yes In This Void
In My Void
In Our Void Of Words

And As We Stand Side By Side
We Still Seem To Divide
Current From Past Lives

Still I Look For You To Hide
Beneath Those Raging Eyes
No Current - No Past Lives
