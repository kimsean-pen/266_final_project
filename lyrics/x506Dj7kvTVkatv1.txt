Remember when I had to choose if I should keep you in my head or heart, now we're apart
I spend my days erasing you and everything you brought into my life, alright
My head is trying to keep up and I don't know, it's like it's hard to do when she's with you
I take a step away and throw myself onto another empty page, OK

I wanna keep you in my pocket for another day to take you out, if that's alright
We're gonna take a little trip into the woods and kill some precious time, OK
I dig a hole, I throw you in and put a stone on top to make it nice, goodnight
You'll have a good time in the dark and I'll be moving on into the light, alright

Beating on a better drum
Dancing right above you
Raving 'til my body pop
Shakin' up another one
Moving on without you
Come on make my body pop
Trying to keep it together
Through the heartache
'Til the wall breaks
Beating on another drum
Better of without you

I wanna keep you to myself, a hidden place where no one else could come, deep under ground
If I can't have you no one else should ever touch you like I used to do
And every week I will be stopping by to tell you all about my life, my perfect life
And you'll be listening, wishing you could keep me in your pocket, head and heart, too late

Beating on a better drum
Dancing right above you
Raving 'til my body pop
Shakin' up another one
Moving on without you
Come on make my body pop
Trying to keep it together
Through the heartache
'Til the wall breaks
Beating on another drum
Better of without you
