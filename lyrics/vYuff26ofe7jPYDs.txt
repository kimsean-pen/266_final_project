It's 3am and you still look gorgeous
My morning-after feeling's kicking in
I hate to say but I'm feeling nauseous
I put that down to too much gin

I'm cool until reality
Hits me in the face and drops the phone in the tea and
You left no number
Left your wedding ring
There's nothing left to do but kick back and sing

I've seen it before
I'll see it again
A never ending story of
Deadlines, diets, and devious men

Now just when things are going groovy
I see the rain clouds coming in
Wham-bam my life's a disaster movie
But as I'm going down I'll grin

I'm cool until reality
Hits me in the face and drops a phone in the tea and
You left no number
Left your wedding ring
There's nothing left to do but kick back and sing

I've seen it before
I'll see it again
A never ending story of
Deadlines, diets, and devious men

I've seen it before (yeah)
I'll see it again
A never ending story of
Deadlines, diets, and devious men

I'm cool until reality
Hits me in the face and drops the phone in the tea and
You left no number
Left your wedding ring
