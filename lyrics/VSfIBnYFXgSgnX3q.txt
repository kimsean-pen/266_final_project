When I wake up, I hope
You're gone. Said I'd love you
But not for long

I'm not breathing in
Your air. I feel
Nothing. I feel nothing

Don't be mad because
It's not your fault. You wanted
The ocean but, I'm just the
Salt. Drying out your mouth
(tiring you out)

I don't want to see
The sunlight
Gliding down your back
In the morning;
And there's no need to
Warn me that you don't
Ever get close to

The ones you lie down with
I'm already absent;
My chest is a basement
Where my heart is all boxed up

Don't be mad because
It's not your fault. You wanted
The ocean but, I'm just the
Salt. Drying out your mouth
(tiring you out)

And what we had might have
Burned real slow, but I blew it out
So we'll never know

And as the light
Starts to leave the room
I'm not in love with the afterglow

Don't be mad because
It's just for fun. We'll stay the night
But never see the sun

...When I wake up, I hope you're gone...

Don't be mad because
It's not your fault. You wanted
The ocean but, I'm just the
Salt. Drying out your mouth
(tiring you out)

And what we had might have
Burned real slow, but I blew it out
So we'll never know

And as the light
Starts to leave the room
I'm not in love with the afterglow
