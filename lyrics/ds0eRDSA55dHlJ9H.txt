The sun came up and pushed away the clouds.
Stumbled back to my room, really don't know how.
I won't wake up 'til this afternoon,
Been out walkin' all night again.
Stranger here try'n' to have fun;
Far from home, it's just begun.

Give out the warm; it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

The coffee's cold, it's gonna have to do.
My feet are shot, feelin' hungry too.
People don't have a thing to say,
Feel your dignity slip away.
Won't wake up 'til this afternoon
To waste a time, 'cause there's nothing new.

Give out the warm; it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

Give out the warm; it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

A city nice as this one should be kind.
It pushed me down, really don't know why.
When I wake up this afternoon,
Another day to make it through,
Might get lucky and find a dime,
Things don't change, gonna give up tryin'.

Give out the warm; it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

Give out the warm; it comes back cold.
Oh, God, I need someone to hold.

Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
Give out the warm, it comes back cold.
Give out the warm, it comes back cold...
