Look out upon the myriad harbour.
Look out upon the myriad harbour.
Look out upon the myriad harbour.

All the boys with their homemade microphones have very interesting sounds.
All the girls fall into ruin, droppin' out of school,
Breakin' Daddies' hearts just to hang around.

Stranded at Bleecker and Broadway, and looking for something to do.

Look out upon the Myriad Harbour.
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour.
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour.
Look out upon the Myriad Harbour.
