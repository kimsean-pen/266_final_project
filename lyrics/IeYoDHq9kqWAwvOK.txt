Am I meant to be something?
Is this the song I'm supposed to sing?
These questions need answers
Is my life already scripted?
Fighting still cannot change the words
These questions need answers

Can we choose to play a different role?
Can we change the grave that was dug for us?
Or is this the only path to take?

Are we meant to fall in love?
Are we supposed to find the one?
These questions need answers
Are there choices around me
Or am I stuck on a one-way road?
These questions need answers

Are we alone? Are we in control?
Can we choose to play a different role?
Can we change the grave that was dug for us?
Or is this the only path to take?

Can we change the grave
The grave that was dug for us?
Or is there another path to take?
Another path to take?

Are we alone? Are we in control?
Can we choose to play a different role?
Can we change the grave that was dug for us?
Or is this the only path to take?

Can we change the grave
The grave that was dug for us?
