Each night I go out
And forget
Monk's orders
And head straight to her!

Through the thick
And lovely smoke
Full of guts
But so shy

Tell me what you want
She says
Tell me what you want now

Let it go Let it go Let it die
Let it go Let it go Let it die

You haven't shown
You haven't shown
The proper spirit!
The proper spirit!

She takes me out
To the heart of it
Lost in the swell of the street

It can hit all the notes
We agree
But the city itself
Needs to breathe

Let it go Let it go Let it die
Let it go Let it go Let it die

You haven't shown
You haven't shown
The proper spirit!
The proper spirit!
The proper spirit!

Let it go Let it go Let it die
Let it go Let it go Let it die
