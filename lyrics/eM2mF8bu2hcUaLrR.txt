There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see
Left with nothing
At the end of this war
Eternally

You claim me as the living dead
You better aim for my head
You better aim for my head
Consumed the flesh, made my amends
Into the earth we descend
Into the earth we descend

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you made
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see
Left with nothing
At the end of this war
Eternally

A battle with no end in sight
How can you kill without life?
You cannot kill without life
We have brought the fall of man
The blood, it covers our hands
It is all over our hands

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you made
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see
Left with nothing
At the end of this war
Eternally

There is no life

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see
Left with nothing
At the end of this war
Eternally
There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see
Left with nothing
At the end of this war (at the end of this war)
Eternally
