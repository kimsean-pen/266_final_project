Oh no so beautiful
So beautiful

I'd give my flesh for yours
I'd sacrifice everything
You are my door to a new beginning
A lucky charm potato pie
So sweet you make me cry
I can't deny
The way you make me feel inside oh

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Have mercy on me
I'm crazy 'bout you
Look at all the things your lift make me do
You are my soul when there's no music to play
Oh i wanna marry someone like you someday

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go

Can't you hear the bells ringing,
Doves crying in the air
With this ring i promise to always be right there
Through the good and the bad times forever yours
I will remain, with your love baby in my life

You know we can stop the rain, yeah

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Me baby, with me baby
Oh baby yeah
Don't you, don't you
Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, you leave, no, oh

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go

You are the beautiful one
And i love to hold you until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go

Yeah, oh don't go
So beautiful
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
