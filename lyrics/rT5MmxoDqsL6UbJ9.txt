Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence and broken pride
Make my conclusions fail
Send me a sign, heal this broken melody
Cause each night I die in hell

My god has shown his sympathy for all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation and peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze, inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive

Somehow I wasted all
They sealed my voice and wisdom
But my soul was born on the battleground
Justice in blood... long awaited victory
And tonight you die in hell

My god has shown his sympathy for all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation and peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive

Somebody hides inside my mind
We're bound together
But this is my confession

Soulmate or enemy
A thorn in my religion
Release my heart, unfold my tongue

Save a place for me in heaven we'll meet another day
I found forgiveness and the meaning of it all
My fear is gone
Gone

My god has shown his sympathy for all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation and peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive
