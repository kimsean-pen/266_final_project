Out in the shed because the signal is better
You dial in because we're happy together
You seem suprised that I would call you at all
Out on the road while you were still on your own

It's so strange that anybody thinks there's a reason
Well you like tuning in to talk and listen

Remember the time I said i'd be yours forever
