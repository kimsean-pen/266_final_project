You're going away
And I'm feeling the same
Thing day after day
I can't let it go

Everyone in this room
They've got troubles too
And secret stories and
Lies that we never knew

Xavia... who will save us?
Your smile's on fire
And still my heart
Won't let you down... the sound

I don't wanna be
Your favorite enemy
Not when I can be loving you, alright
Why can't it be?
No two people feel
The same way at the same time

Xavia... who will save us?
Your smile's on fire
And still my heart
Won't let you down

Everyone in this room
They've got troubles too
Secret stories and
Lies that we never knew

You're going away (I don't wanna be)
And I'm feeling the same (your favorite enemy)
Thing day after day (I don't wanna be)
I can't let it go (your favorite enemy)

Xavia... who will save us?
Your smile's on fire
And still my heart
Won't let you down

Xavia... who will save us?
Your smile's on fire
And still my heart
Won't let you down... the sound

One heart to break, one heart
One heart to break, one heart
One heart to break, my heart
One heart to break, my heart
