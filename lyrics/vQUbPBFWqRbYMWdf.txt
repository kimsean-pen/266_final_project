There are signs on the Ring
Which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all Rings
To find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound

Three for the Kings
Of the Elves, high in light
Nine to the mortal which cry

I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow
I'll keep the Ring till I die
I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow
I'll keep the Ring till I die

Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill

And there's no way out
Mordor!

Dark Land under Sauron's spell
Threatened for a long time
Threatened for a long time

Seven Rings to the Dwarfes
In their hearts made of stone
Into the valley
Into the valley
I feel down

One Ring for the Dark Lord's hand
Sitting on his throne
In the land so dark where I have to go

I'll keep the Ring
I'll keep the Ring
I'll keep the Ring
I'll keep the Ring
Till I die

Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Lord of the Rings
