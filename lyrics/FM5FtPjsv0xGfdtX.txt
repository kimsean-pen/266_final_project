Stop banging away on my kaleidoscope
Stop draining the colour out of my scene
Just play me something I can dance to
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

So lock me up in a studio
Fill it up with sound and scenarios
Stop blocking the driveway with your car
Put the butterfly in the bill jar

It's the first time
That I worry
of a bad dream
Of a journey
On a highway
Through the valley
It's a long road
Through the night
It's a long road

There are strangers forcing the front yard
Let the arrows tick past the deadline
Get another stamp in your passport
Wash your breakfast down with some red wine
To leave the progress on your game
Try to fall asleep while your ears ring
From the loudest songs on your mixtape
I can dance to anything you wanna sing

No reason
No action
No silence
No help here
Nobody
Came running
Up by my side
It's the first time
That I worry
Of a bad dream
Of a journey

On a highway
Through the valley
It's a long road
Through the night

It's the first time
That I worry
Of a bad dream
Of a journey
On a highway
Through the valley
It's a long road
Through the night
It's a long road
To get it right

It's the first time
That I worry
Of a bad dream
Of a journey
On a highway
Through the valley
It's a long road
Through the night

It's the first time
That I worry
Of a bad dream
Of a journey
On a highway
Through the valley
It's a long road
Through the night
It's a long road

T-to get it right
T-get t-get t-get it right
T-get t-to get it right
T-t,
T-get t-get it right
