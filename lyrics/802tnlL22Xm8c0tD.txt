Up town another endless night
Hearts break in early morning light
(Yeah)
I take my time

Downtown a lonesome boy at home
Don't know what's really going on
(Yeah)
I take my time

But underneath it all I know it feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy but I won't cry tonight

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know I never meant to break I promise
(Woah)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

If I could start it all again
I'd know you're more than just a friend
(Yeah)
I turn back time

But underneath it all I know it feels so right
I feel I'm going crazy but I won't cry tonight

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know I never meant to break I promise
(Woah)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

Come take my hand, lets break away
Don't stop, don't be afraid
Cuz I know
Who will be forever

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you
Now I know I never meant to break I promise
(Woah)
I never meant to say goodbye
Don't turn away
I wanna stay
As long as I can be with you

Don't turn away
I need to say
You are the one who leaves me breathless
Don't run away
I wanna stay
You're the one who leaves me breathless
