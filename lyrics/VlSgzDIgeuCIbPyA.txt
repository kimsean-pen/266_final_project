Tell me your name
I don't ever wanna let you down
No, I just want to kiss your lips in the rain
You know I'll pull you closer if you start to drown, drown

And then my hand meets your thighs
With that look in your eyes, I can never forget
And then it's back to my room
What a wonderful view, love
And that's when I said

Roxanne
Why'd you wanna leave me on my own now, Roxanne?
I think we should go but I'm not sure enough, Roxanne

I'm driving somewhere far away from out of town
No, I'm falling deep within your eyes like cocaine
I'm hoping that you'll be there when I'm coming down, down
And you know that you've got to believe me
No, no
And I know that we have to try
So I say

Roxanne
Why'd you wanna leave me on my own now, Roxanne?
I think we should go but I'm not sure enough

And now it's burning my mind
That you left me inside
With your lips and your thighs
You pull them closer to mine
Roxanne
Why'd you wanna leave me, leave me, Roxanne?

Roxanne
Roxanne
Why'd you wanna leave me, leave me
On my own
Leave me, leave me, Roxanne?

And now it's burning my mind
That you left me inside
With your lips and your thighs
You pull them closer to mine
Roxanne
I think we should go but I'm not sure enough, Roxanne
