Too dark to see in there
Fools took you in: beware!
Your armour in the air
You got hooked now: I'll be damned!
Keep notes with a photograph
I walk with peace and darkness
Instead of rolling over
Aching, you stay below here

Go on,
Get off
The ground

I would win if I reeled it in
The land, calm reasoning
How luck can be so grim
You need a lift, my friend!
Now, look me in the eyes
Swimming backwards, feet denied
Almost home, then I lose it all
I think you know that I belong here

Get off
The ground
Oh muse, you
