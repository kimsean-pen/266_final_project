I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer
Eyes are open the mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer

I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

Oh, how I try
I leave the TV on and the radio
Oh, how I try
I leave the TV on and the radio

I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm
