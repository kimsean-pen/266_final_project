It's high time you have set your sails
Make peace with god, and accept the fail
The gavel took your life away
Chained down, now you're here to stay

Locked up away for murder
Kill after kill was your vice
Here for the one who got away
Now you pay the price of life

Blood lust is what put you here
Craving to watch them cower in fear
Muster up all you can conjure
Freedom stripped as fast as you stripped her

Behind, the iron
Behind, behind the iron
Locked away
Kill the siren

The cage will break you down
Nothing more can be said now
Inside you will stand tall
But man, I've seen the toughest fall
