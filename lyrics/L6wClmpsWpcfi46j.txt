I just met you
It seems like yesterday
You opened up your eyes
And I recognised your face
You know that you're the one that we've been waiting for
We're gonna keep you safe
First I held you in my arms
I knew I'd love you all the way

I tuck you in at night, another day has passed
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
It wasn't so long ago
We walked together and you held my hand
And now you're getting too big to want to

But I hope you'll always understand
That I'm always gonna lift you up
And I'm never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now

Through your ears I hear it, through your eyes I see
A world full of magic, full of possibilities
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be
But you've got so much strength inside you
A strength I pray you'll never need

And I'm always gonna lift you up
And I'm never gonna let you down
Time flies by
I hope you realise that I
Love you forever now

I'm always gonna be right here
Always gonna cheer you up
I'm always gonna have your back
You're never gonna be alone

And I'm always gonna lift you up
No I'm never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now

I love you forever now
