Howling the lost summer night
Everyone wants to dance with the fireflies
The night is long as we like
All the innocents and the fireflies
No moon rays catch a

Heads tonight, a thousand lights
Moments like these burn in the fireflies
The days are long as we like
Days of our years lost in the fireflies
No moon rays catch a
Everyone wants to fly with the fireflies x 3
