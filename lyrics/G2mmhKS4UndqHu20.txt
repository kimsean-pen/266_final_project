Ate four Double-Doubles last night
'Cause Kris said I had to be even with him
My stomach's cramping and we're camping out
In sleeping bags and I miss falling asleep next to you

Turn off the tv
I'm always sleeping
Because that's all I need to do to have fun these days
Because whenever I leave my house
I want to go back inside

Keep feeling nauseous every time I watch the news
Everything makes me sad except spending time with you
There's all these feelings
Building in me
But it's not my place to ever say exactly what I think about
The things I've only ever read about
So I'll stay quiet
Each and every time

I want to be the one you depend on
When you are broken and confused
I want to be the one you rest your head on
When you are tired from walking one too many miles

It's just too windy outside
For me to light this shit
I'm over it again
I want to go back inside with my friends
I'm not too sober
To listen to your stories everyday
I'm just hoping that you'll stay
Because I like you
