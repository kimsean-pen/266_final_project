Nothing ever seems to change
I'm so alone
Waiting for someone to come, to come along
Then I saw you from the sea
I can hardly believe my eyes

I just want to be in love, but I don't want to try
I'm preouccpied with you

Fantasize about the day that you'll know
You are all the mistery, dont know to solve

When I want to be in love
Would you please believe my lies
I just want to be in love, but I dont want to try
I'm preoccupied with you
