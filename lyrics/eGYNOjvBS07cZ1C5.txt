This morning I was broken
That was heavy, a lot of words spoken
And I didn't know what to think at all
'Cause right now I could do without
But I know I had to talk with you
By that time, I'd had a few
I've got to work out what I said
I need a painkiller
Sugarcoated 'cause it tastes much better
And though I can't remember
Know I would say it again
Every time I leave without your touch
Every time I think that you'd had enough
Every time I'm drunk and say too much
I know that I would say it again
Every time I think we're worlds apart
Every time I drink, I pour out my heart
Every time I think I've gone too far
I know that I would say it again
This evening I'm still broken
Can't believe we haven't even spoken
It's not that hard to text or call
Do you not even care at all?
Give me a painkiller
Sugarcoated 'cause it tastes much better
And though I can't remember
Know I would say it again
Every time I leave without your touch
Every time I think that you'd had enough
Every time I'm drunk and say too much
I know that I would say it again
Every time I think we're worlds apart
Every time I drink, I pour out my heart
Every time I think I've gone too far
I know that I would say it again
Give me a painkiller
Sugarcoated 'cause it tastes much better
And though I can't remember
Know I would say it again
Every time I leave without your touch
Every time I think that you'd had enough
Every time I'm drunk and say too much
I know that I would say it again
Every time I think we're worlds apart
Every time I drink, I pour out my heart
Every time I think I've gone too far
I know that I would say it again
