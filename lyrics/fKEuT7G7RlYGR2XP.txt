Seize the darkened day, there's only hell to pay
And no one left to see this prodigal return
Sweet apathy's black toll
You'll mourn the traded soul
I'll dig a deeper hole, sanctity a breath away
Just a breath away

Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow

A tragedy on display
A sickness for all to see
I will kill this part of myself that I hate and that I see in you

It was always mine anyway
There's some things you can't take away
I choose not to feel a thing
Sanctity a breath away
Just a breath away
Away
Just a breath away

Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow

Blacken the cursed sun
Blacken what's yet to be done
Blacken because now you know
There is no tomorrow

You're just a breath away
You're just a breath away

Better to die quick
Fighting on your feet
Then to live forever
Begging on your knees

Begging on your
Begging on your
Begging on your knees

Can we still be saved? (Hell no!)
Does your God hold a place for us? (Hell no!)
Is there time to repent? (Hell no!)
Will we rise from the dead? (Hell no!)
Can these sins even be forgiven? (Hell no!)
Is there still hope for us? (Hell no!)
Were we ever even alive? (Hell no!)
Is any of this even real?
Hell no!
