My thought process is constant rat race
A battle of emotions between numb and a bad place
I don't think I'll ever learn
No I'll probably never learn
The novel worth of text you wrote to try and explain
Was full of bad excuses mostly written in vain
It's not something I think I've earned
And that's probably none of your concern now.
It's not your fault
I'm a wreck, a mess, I'm broken
I tend to give my all to end up confused and hoping for a change.

And I don't think that I'll ever learn.
No I'll probably never learn.
