Child of the wilderness,
Born into emptiness,
Learn to be lonely,
Learn to find your way in darkness.

Who will be there for you,
Comfort and care for you?
Learn to be lonely,
Learn to be your one companion.

Never dream that out in the world there are arms to hold you.
You've always known: Your heart was on it's own.
So laugh in your lonelyness,
Child of the wilderness.
Learn to be lonely,
Learn how to love life that is lived alone,

Learn to be lonely.
Life can be lived, life can be loved alone
