Sitting here on the front porch
Loving on you loving on me
Watching fireflies in the dark oh
Sparking on you sparking oh how they fly
How they fall
Oh how we fly
How I...

Fall oh like a sparrow
To the ground I'm upside down
I sing like a thunderstorm
My notes are rolling out
Up and down I'm
On the ground

As we walk I start to ignite
You don't seem to mind, it's alright
People stop to stare at how we scorch the pavement
We burn so bright
How we...

Fall oh like a sparrow
To the ground I'm upside down
I sing like a thunderstorm
My notes are rolling out
Up and down I'm on the ground

Sparks in my hair
Now I explode
Kindly, you gather the shreds of my soul
And as we burn
Watch daylight return
As you scatter me far from the world
As I...

Fall oh like a sparrow
To the ground I'm upside down
I sing like a thunderstorm
My notes are rolling out
Up and down I'm on the ground
