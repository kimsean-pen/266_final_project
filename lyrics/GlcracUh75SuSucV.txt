Where is your love, my boy?
Do you hear my voice decay?
What are you hiding now?
Why do you still keep secrets?
I'm tired to pull your heart back
While she still comes to rip you up
Is there anything left inside you
Or just the will to chase her?
Do you keep my name safe
Or have you been draining it?
Is there anything left inside you
Or just the will to chase her?
Do you keep my name safe
Or have you been draining it?
How many words does it take?
To let you know you tear us apart
I never want to stop having you close
I'm not ready to let you go
If you let me we could burn it up
I'm just trying to get you back
Get you back
Is there anything left inside you
Or just the will to chase her?
Do you keep my name safe
Or have you been draining it?
Is there anything left inside you
Or just the will to chase her?
Do you keep my name safe
Or have you been draining it?
Or have you been draining it?
Or have you been draining it?
Or have you been draining it?
Or have you been draining it?
