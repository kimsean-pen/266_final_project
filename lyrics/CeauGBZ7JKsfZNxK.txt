The light that fills my lonely cell is blocked out by the key
That locks the door to this hell, the place they wanted me
Time's racing like the wind, execution's near
Oh, Lord, I wait for death, and yes, I have no fear

I recall that night, my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes, walking as danger paved the way
The Devil and the darkness, let her evil wander free
Here on Devils Island, the final stop for me

Devils Island
Devils Island

Oh, there is no escape, the sea is full of sharks
Tide takes you away and smashes you on the rocks
The sun is shining, but feel not today
Its warmth, it's dying and fading away

Devil's Island
Here I stay
Devil's Island

Oh, hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh, so pernicious, her soul it creates song
As there is no man that is here upon the Earth
Able to terminate our noisome will since birth

The priest that reads the sermon is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request, to have her burn with me
But, so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall
The final judgment came and was spread before you all!

Final judgment...

Old, weak, and feeble, and the lesson taught to me
Stay away from evil, she doesn't care for me
She haunts me in my sleep, though I tore that page away
Here on Devils Island, I'll always have to stay

Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Here I am
