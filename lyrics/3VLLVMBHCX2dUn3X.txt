Heaven,
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven,
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window
Gone underground
There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time

And Heaven,
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart

There's a song on the air with a
'love you' line
And a face in a glass and it
looks like mine
And I'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools wanna jump my train

And Heaven
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven
is the whole of ours hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window gone
underground
And I'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools wanna jump my train

And Heaven
is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven
don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven
is the whole of ours hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven
Ah, Heaven
Yeah, Heaven
Ah, Heaven
