You can't feel those arms of mine
You made me feel so dead tonight
Can't dissolve your noxious mind
I'll treat you right
Can't resolve this toxic plight
From my line of sight

You forgot what love was like
Your hatred tastes like cyanide
I'm digging for a hopeless sign
Or something of the like
I can't find the reason why you're treating me this way

You wanna keep me in the lobby
It's the room that you go tonight to take me away
You wanna keep me in the foyer
No room for a broken man anyway

You forgot what love was like
Your last name tastes like cyanide
Searching for a hopeless sign
Something of the like
Oh, I can't find the reason why youre killing me this way
