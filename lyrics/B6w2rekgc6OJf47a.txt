Looking up
There's always sky
Rest your headI'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness
Why worry now?
You'll be safe
Hold my hand
Just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
This world can seem
Cold and grey
But you and I
Are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear
But fear itself
We'll be ok
Just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Whoah Whoah, fade into darkness
Whoah Whoah, fade into darkness
Whoah
And we won't fade into darkness (whoah)
Fade into darkness (whoah)
No, we won't fade into darkness (whoah)
Fade into darkness (whoah)
Whoah
Fade into darkness
