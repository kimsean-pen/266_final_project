Sweet summer days
When I was feeling so fine
Just you and me girl
Was a beautiful time
Oh yeah
Said I felt so happy
My my my

I was through with doubt and pain
All the love I felt hadn't been in vain
Got damaged
I got damaged
I got damaged
I lost myself in you
I'd wake up beside you
You'd hold me in your arms
Nothing and nobody's gonna do me
Any harm oh yeah
Said I felt so happy
My my my

And the way I felt inside
Made me feel so glad to be alive
Got damaged
I got damaged
I got damaged
I lost myself in you

Do do doo
I'd never felt so happy
Do do doo
I'd never felt so happy
Do do doo
I'd never felt so happy
I'll never feel that way again
No, no, no, no, no, no

My my my
People can be precious
But they ain't for keeping
I got too possessive
But souls ain't for stealing
You were my addiction
I got strung out and crazy
Hit me like a fever
When you left me baby

Stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you

(Repeat to end)
