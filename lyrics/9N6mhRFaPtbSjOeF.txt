I close my eyes and bend below, or imagine that I can't.
In that song I'm such a friend.
And it goes on and on and on and on like that.
I check myself into the inn.
Fall is it night, it's conceding ways of etching to the street trying to shut down the stop lights.
Is it real?
Oh, it feels real. Into an empty mess, knowing nothing at all.
feeling I know I know myself.
Take this body straight on.
Cause I'll never know.
You're weak and I stay inside out there.
Cannot rest until I take this place straight on.
