How come, girl was there when I needed one
How come, girl was there when the song is done
Some say, open your eyes to a brighter light
Okay, open my arms
They were right
She was my soul one
Lord, she felt she was the only one
She was the sun, the sky blue eyes
She was my soul one

Inside, pain in my heart often made her cry
Outside, I cursed the birds and the sugar sky
How long take to realize she's the one
How long until I find my lost and lonely soul one
She was my soul one
Lord you know she felt like the only one
She was the sun, the sky blue eyes
She was my soul one

Should've never taken the time
'Cause I found myself living a lonely lie
You said, you left to find yourself
But I never, no I never got a chance to say good-bye
She was my soul one
No I doubt she was the only one
No doubt she was
