Just wait it out love
The fears of you dying
That's what is takes sometimes to feel alive
Does it seem like heaven's on it's way?
Don't look down from here the devil could wait in death

Shout!

I used to spend my time alone
At the bottom of the bottle
Where I thought I could find a friend
And that was me there in your brother's room
I heard your sister she was calling out too

Just wait it out love
The fears of you dying
That's what is takes sometimes to feel alive
Does it seem like heaven's on it's way?
If it's only down from here, tell the devil to wait in death

Shout!

Stop, step step
It's all over

I could've been your lover
Soon you'll just be another
After all, I was just a lie
Pretty soon I will never have to try

Just wait it out love
The fears of you dying
That's what is takes sometimes to feel alive
It doesn't seem like heaven's on it's way
If this is all we have now, the devil could wait it out

Shout!

Stop, step step
It's all over

Stop, step step
It's all over
