She's just 16 years old
Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart
And I would wait till the end
Of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Oh, if I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Oh, if I could fly
I'd pick you up
And take you into the night
Oh (Into the night)
(Fly to the night)
(Fly to the night)
My babe
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
And into the night (Into the night)
(Into the night)
Babe, babe, babe...
I'd pick you up
(Fly to the night)
(Into the night)
