We are all swollen
From hiding his affairs
Let's put it all on the table
Let it all out

It is time
He mustn't steal our light

Clean plate
Tabula rasa for my children
Clean plate
Not repeating the fuckups of the fathers

My deepest wish is that
You're immersed in grace and dignity
But you will have to deal with shit soon enough
I hoped to give you the least amount of luggage
You got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
And not repeat other's failures

Clean plate
Tabula rasa for my children
Let's clean up
Break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
It is time
For us women to rise, and not just take it lying down
It is time
The world, it is listening

Oh how I love you
Embarrassed to pass this mess over to you
But he led two lives
Thought ours was the only ones

You are strong
You are strong
You are strong
You are strong
You are strong
