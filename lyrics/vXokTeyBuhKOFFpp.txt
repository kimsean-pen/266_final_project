One step at a time
out of the darkness
one foot in front of the other
One step at a time
into the distance
a new path I need to uncover
I'm letting go
Go
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
try putting them back together
till I'm unbroken
Unbroken
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever
One step at a time
and I got a feeling
it's either now or never
I'm letting go
Go
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
try putting them back together
till I'm unbroken
Unbroken
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever
I'm letting go
Go
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever.
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
try putting them back together
till I'm unbroken
Unbroken
One step at a time
get out of the darkness
and into the light forever
