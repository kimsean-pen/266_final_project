Baby, i know that you're lonely
Things are moving slowly
Only you and me
Show me something you've been doing
Talk to me so stupid
Like I wasn't here

Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Living round
Living nice and slow

She will change the way I feel
Cut me of the wheel
And she comes at nights
Unlike had to really loved her
Trying to keep it bitter
Every single night

Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Living round
Living nice and slow
