How come me, madam maid?
Soaking plead, scented faces
Perfect moon through my veins
Cutting heat, wolf remainin'

Peel it off my hands
Erased
Peel it off my hands
It's clean

Deep inside, madam maid
Leave behind outer spaces
Grounded birth through my need
Psychic fate profit feedin'

Peel it off my hands
Erased
Peel it off my hands
It's clean
Clean clean clean clean

How come me, madam maid?
Soaking plead, scented faces
Perfect moon through my veins
Cutting heat, wolf remainin'

Peel it off my hands
Erased
Peel it off my hands
It's clean
Clean clean clean clean
