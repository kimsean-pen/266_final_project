This place reminds me of a time that's way too old
These thoughts have gathered up the memories unfold
But for now I don't see what's so wrong with pretending
It's true, I thought you knew

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her, it's all she's got, it's all she's got
It's all she's got, it's all she's got

These days keep getting worse, I'm wasting all my time
Thought I'd come in first, instead I fell behind
I don't know, I don't know if I can keep this up to long
It seems all every time my motives are all wrong
But for now I don't see what's so wrong with pretending
It's true, I thought you knew

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her, it's all she's got, it's all she's got

It's times like this, my time's run out
It's times like this, my time's run out
It's times like this, my time's run out
It's times like this, I want to

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her, it's all she's got, it's all she's got
