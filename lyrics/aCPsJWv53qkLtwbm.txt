Lemme tell you what love is
It's when you meet each other halfway
I'm en route

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Look in your own mirror and know who you are
Live your life accordingly, the truth is on your arm
And it's good, baby
You've done good, baby

Be just who you are, make no apologies
And when it's said and done, who's really sorry?
You're okay, baby
It's okay, baby

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Dare to be a better you each chance you get
We're all human and fall short and nothing's over yet
It's up to you, baby
Give 'em you, baby

Life's too short to waste your time, do what you love
Don't be a sheep, it's better, have peace, fly it like a dove
Give 'em you, baby
Give 'em room, baby

Like the Phoenix from the ashes
Or a sunrise off in the distance
I'll try again, I'll try again
I'll try again, we'll try again

Like the Phoenix from the ashes
Or a sunrise off in the distance
I'll try again, I'll try again
I'll try again, we'll try again

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself

Emancipate yourself
Emancipate yourself
