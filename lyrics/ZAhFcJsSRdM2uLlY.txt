Your skin reflects
Your past regrets
Face death, free again
Last breath, you're free again

Warmer words from better days
The blood on your teeth has faded away
You're in infinite pain
That's the risk that you know you take

There is hope beyond the scars on your skin
Open your lungs and let me in

I'm fighting all of the weakness in me
Something I'll fight until the end of my days
She's begging to stay in chains
Ones only I can break

Are you afraid of what the mirror reflects?
Do happiness and hope fail to connect
You're facing death and you're free gain
There is hope beyond the scars on your skin

Your skin reflects
Your past regrets

There's a darkness inside of you
I know because it's in me too
Warmer words from better days
Those days have faded away
Faded away

Scar Queen
