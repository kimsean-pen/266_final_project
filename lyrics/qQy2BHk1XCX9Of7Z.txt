I've been smoking too much in my room
Barely moved since I thought to call you
I've been choking on my, I've been choking
It's my own fault too

Do you mind if we go driving?
Like we're running away or something
Feel at home when we're, feel at home
When we're at hiding

Tell your friends you're fine
This could take a few nights
Meet me half a mile past the town line

Tracing street light constellations
Gravity, I escape it
Windows down, I am weightless, weightless
Face it, half my life I've been waiting
Other half went and wasted
But with you I am weightless, weightless

(Weightless, weightless)
(Weightless, weightless)

Do you mind if we go no phone?
Just you and me we won't show no one
Got my hand in yours, one hand in yours
And the other out the window

This could take a few nights
Meet me half a mile past the town line

Tracing street light constellations
Gravity, I escape it
Windows down, I am weightless, weightless
Face it, half my life I've been waiting
Other half went and wasted
But with you I am weightless, weightless

(Weightless, weightless)
(Weightless, weightless)

Tracing all the lines on your face and
In this moment we're ageless
Finally I am weightless, weightless, weightless

Tracing street light constellations
Gravity, I escape it
Windows down, I am weightless, weightless
Face it, half my life I've been waiting
Other half went and wasted
But with you I am weightless, weightless

(Weightless, weightless)
(Weightless, weightless)
