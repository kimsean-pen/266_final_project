Give me the drink of the fluid that disentegrates
And lend me the sweet balm and blessing
Of forgetfulness, empty and strong
Lethe

Oh, Lethe
Hold me near, unravel the stars
As I speed through the heavens
I speed through the night
For you are my blade and my rope
You are my, you are my
Lethe
You are my all

In currents of cobalt you storm through my heart
To sever, to puncture the memories that burn
Let sweep through the arteries in sharp stabs of pain
Your talon-like fingers to kill me again

In currents of cobalt you storm through my heart
To sever, to puncture the memories that burn
Let sweep through the arteries in sharp stabs of pain
Your talon-like fingers to kill me again
And again, and again, and again
Steal me, invade me, and charge me again

And again, and again, and again
For I burn and I shudder
Burn with each movement of
So cleansed through a floodlight
I appear, renewed and reforged
Caressed by the sweet balm and blessing

Of forgetfulness, empty and strong
Lethe
Hold me near, my one friend and guide
As I drown through your fingers

Drown through your love
For you are the life that I hate
You are my, you are my...
Drag me down in passionate sighs
With the ocean above me and flames in my eyes
And grant my a life I can live
Without...
Take me away...
Take me away...
From the life that I hate
