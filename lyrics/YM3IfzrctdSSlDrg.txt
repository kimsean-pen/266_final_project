Strange feeling in your stomach
Like a pressure from beneath
Stench of vomit - what a feeling
Like pungent ecstasy

Almost flying to the toilet
Trying to puke something green
But your stomach wants to get inside your mouth with large
Intestine

You see your bowels in the air
Approaching the ceiling like tentacles
Dying like your father when he was young
Flying out of this world to another land...
