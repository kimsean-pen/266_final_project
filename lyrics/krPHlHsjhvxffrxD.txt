Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?*

If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh

I'm here alone didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move it's incomplete
If there was a way that I could make you understand

But how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air

I walk, I ran, I jump, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
WIth no gravity to hold me down forreal

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breathe but I survived
I don't how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
No more
It's no air, no air

OH

Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, no air

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
cause my world revolves around you it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed 2 breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air

No air
