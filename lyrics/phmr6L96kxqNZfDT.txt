A song to play when I'm lonely
Win and never play a game again
No one to face when I'm falling
Holding tight to dreams that never end

I'll be you
I do
I'll be you
No one's afraid to be called by another name
No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
Nowhere's anyone reason
Everything dying and leaving
Out with these faults and you make me baby
Faking a movement but no one's seeing it
No one always finds peace flung

No one chooses to beat my pride down

Symbols pierce right through me
People fail to be drawn up

Sunlight to fate accumalates
Loving pain to be clung to

Luminous bodies
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong
And true to us
Out of place in my own time
Drowning thinking that I'm dry
Holding onto facts that'll never be proven
Faking an action cuz no one's looking
Hello when I'm crashing
Feel nothing when my life's flashing before my eyes
You should've threw me down
