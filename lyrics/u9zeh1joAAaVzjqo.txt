wake me on the softer side of heaven
in a land of healty minds
light, carry me high
float me down west of the lazy river
before these heavy stones sink our soaring heads

breathless morning put your head in my hands
night grows stele by the break of the dawn

take me where you're eyes are always blooming
the golden leaves, the red pine trees
what dreams may come
i wonder where we'll wind up when its over
falling like the stars right out of heavens mouth

breatless morning put your head in my hands
night grows stale by the break of the dawn

fever, fever, fever, flood the door
shiny, shiny, shiny, crack of light
outside flushs white
warmer tones than before outline flushes free
free of light, free of me
