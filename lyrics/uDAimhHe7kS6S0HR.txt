Oh my lord, you could drive a Ford
Or you could drive a Chevy
Or a Jimmy if you really like
A mountain of fun, the USA 1
A Motor City Steel
You gotta give the power to the people

Travis and Ricky relationship is tricky
But Ricky is a girl who wants to see the world
But Travis is a boy, boys like a toy
The ram with a straight axle way off the board
Singin'

Oh my lord, you could drive a Ford
Or you could drive a Chevy
Or a Jimmy if you really like
A mountain of fun, the USA 1
A Motor City Steel
You gotta give the power to the people

At the country dance, wearin' tiny pants
Ricky's tellin' everyone how they was made in France
And Travis thinks it's funny, dancin' with his honey
Talkin' 'bout how tiny French pants cost so much money

Alright, now this here's a sad and bleedin' part of the story
'Cause, well, Ricky's a good girl
She worked hard, she saved up her money
She bought herself a stack of American Express Travelers Cheques
And a one-way ticket to Charlie de Gaulle Paris International Airport
And then she told Travis
"Honey, I ain't goin' for good, I'm just goin"'
Day she had to fly, said she wouldn't cry
Travis cried a little, he was caught in the middle
Of a girl with a dream since she was a teen
A boy and a truck
"Darlin', good luck"

Oh my lord, you could drive a Ford
Or you could drive a Chevy
Or a Jimmy if you really like
A mountain of fun, a USA 1
A Motor City Steel
You gotta give the power to the

Oh my lord, you could drive a Ford
