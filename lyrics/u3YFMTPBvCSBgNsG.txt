You go for a walk in the park 'cause you don't need anything
Your hand that you sometimes hold doesn't do anything
The face that you see in the door isn't standing there anymore

In a matter of time, it would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

The face that you saw in the door isn't looking at you anymore
The name that you call in it's place isn't waiting for your embrace
The world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore

In a matter of time, it would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

More, you want more
More, you want more

More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
