I heard the TV and it told me
I shouldn't grieve
There is something more
If you believe in god's love

But I've seen too many scenes
In which the people are lawful to their needs

So as I am without faith
Tell me, what should I dream of?
Oh tell me, why should I do anything at all?
'Cause I'm caught up in a race
I don't know what I'm running from or to

Breathe in, breathe out
Take note, take count
Tell me honestly, my friend
What did you live for?
Did you make amends?

'Cause I once lived to believe
That I can see the
And it's dark long before
Yours, I won't be anymore
Then you're gone, an honest god
Meditations on loss
