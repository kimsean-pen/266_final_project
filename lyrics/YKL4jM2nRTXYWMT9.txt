Oh come on
She pretty pretty
She pretty witty, my kitty is pretty
My Molly's in the city
Oh come on

She's in the city
And it's a pity
My kitty is pretty
A pity 'cause she's livin' in the city
Oh come on

It's such a pity
She's in the city
My pretty, my pretty, my Molly
My Molly in the city
Oh come on
Ha!

I will...
I want you in my arms
I will hold you in my arms tonight
I want you in my arms
Again, again
And again for the first time
And again...
