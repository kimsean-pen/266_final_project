Let's drive tonight
Out on the road
Don't know where we're goin'
But it feels so right
In every turn
Feel the heat from the ground
Like we're high tide, tonight
I swear the world stops spinnin'
When you're pressed up
Against me tight, tonight
Don't know where we're goin'
But it feels so right

All the things you've said and done
Will fade away

Starin' at your reflection
Thinkin' of the things that you've done
You're hopin' for a change of direction
Or maybe just a place in the sun
All the things you'd do
All the things you'd say
Never dull the pain, the price of redemption
Hey, come on
Get your big love on
Get your big love

She said let's get high
Whispered I love you
Spoken like a true believer
My favorite kind
Followin' blind
Are you even listenin'
'Cause we'll keep tryin' tonight
I'm done with excuses
Let's see where the truth is
Fine, tonight
Don't know where we're goin'
But it feels so right

All the things you've said and done
Will fade away

Starin' at your reflection
Thinkin' of the things that you've done
You're hopin' for a change of direction
Or maybe just a place in the sun
All the things you'd do
All the things you'd say
Never dull the pain, the price of redemption
Hey, come on
Get your big love on
Get your big love

How does it feel to make it day by day?
How does it feel to make it day by day?
How does it feel to be
Beaten down till you're on your knees

Starin' at your reflection
Thinkin' of the things that you've done
You're hopin' for a change of direction
Or maybe just a place in the sun
All the things you'd do
All the things you'd say
Never dull the pain, the price of redemption
Hey, come on
Get your big love on
Get your big love
