Comin' down| comin' down | comin' down
Yes i'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, down, down, down, down, Comin' down with a heartache.

I ain't sick but i got a fever
blood pressure's runnin' high
pulse ain't right, i can't sleep at night
and here's the reason why
you ain't been around for a week or two
said i ain't seen the hide nor half of you
i'm comin' down, down, down
i'm coming down, down down, down down, comin' down with a heartache.

when in a counter condition
a doctor can diagnose
but when our hearts starts to fall apart
you can't hear the stethoscope
what's wrong with me? i said it's a simple fact
i don't believe you're ever comin' back
i'm comin' down, down, down
i'm coming down, down down, down down, comin' down with a heartache.

what's wrong with me? i said it's a simple fact
honey i don't believe that you're ever comin' back
i'm comin' down, comin' down comin' down comin' down
i'm coming down, down down, down down, comin' down with a heartache.

yeah comin' down (yeah) comin' down
yeah i'm comin' down (comin' down down down)
said i'm coming down (comin' down down down)
