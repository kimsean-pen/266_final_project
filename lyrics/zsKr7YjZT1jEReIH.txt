See through the eyes
Of the dead ones walking
Experience the flesh and bone
The fabric of humanity is decomposing
Oh my god I feeel the ground is crumbuling
Under my feet within the darkness
Fires burning blood on the streets
But all I know
Is I gotta let go
Of the life I remember
Let go
Let go
Let go
Let go
I'll be your guardian angel
I will hold you till we fall
Held in the arms of a stranger
As we lose it all
Everything is burning down now
Everything is turning black now
Once Human
Now blood thirsty mindless parasites
Cannibalistic maggots
Eat the corpse from inside
Oh my got it was alive
We are at war with the world
But the world has won how does it survive?
Its digests us one by one
And starts again with none
It's done
It's done
It's done
It's done
I'll be your guardian angel
I will hold you till we fall
Held in the arms of a stranger
As we lose it all
Everything is burning down now
Everything is turning black now
It's done
It's done
Let go
Of the life I remember
It's done
Let go
It's done
Let go
Of the life I remember
I'll be your guardian angel
I will hold you till we fall
Held in the arms of a stranger
As we lose it all
Everything is burning down now
Everything is turning black now
