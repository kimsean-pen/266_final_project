When it's cold out
When the night is still and you're standin' alone
I'll be racin' when the lights go out
And you're losin' control

Oh, higher, higher, higher we go tell me, tell me
We're close enough to touch the Sun, the Sun
Higher, higher, higher we go tell me, tell me
The journey's only just begun, begun

I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the rest are fallin', the rest are fallin'
The rest are fallin'
I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the best are fallin', the best are fallin'
The best are fallin', you say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the clouds
I'm neva comin' down say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise watch me rise!

Now paranoia's settin' in and I'm fallin' from these stars again
While every part of me screams, hold on
Cuz if you can't learn to bend then you break
Oh, my God, how long does it take?!
Every lesson we learned took so long but it made us strong

I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the rest are fallin', the rest are fallin'
The rest are fallin'
I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the best are fallin', the best are fallin'
The best are fallin', you say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the clouds
I'm neva comin' down say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise watch me rise!

Higher, higher, higher we go
Right into the fire we go

I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the rest are fallin', the rest are fallin'
The rest are fallin'
I I I I'm still standin', I I I I'm still climbin'
Even when the best are fallin', the best are fallin'
The best are fallin', you say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the clouds
I'm neva comin' down say, say my name
Cuz once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
