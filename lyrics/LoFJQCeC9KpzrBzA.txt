I never knew what I was missing
Love with no passion in the kissing

I can't explain it, how you made me open up
And you showed me things I never thought I'd do
I'd hate to think of ever losing you
? Cause there is no one that makes me feel the way you do

You're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover
Make me feel, oh, so real

Hold me and tell me that you love me
Only with you is where I wanna be

We'll light a candle as a symbol of our love
Then we'll move real close like in a perfect fantasy
I wish these moments could go on and on and on
But before you leave I want you to know

You're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover, yeah
Make me feel, oh, so real

Yeah, you're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover, yeah
Make me feel, oh, so real

You're some kind of lover, yeah, yeah
You're some kind of lover
Turn me on, turn me out
You're some kind of lover, yeah
You make me feel, oh, so real

You're some kind of lover
