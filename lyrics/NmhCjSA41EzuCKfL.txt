When you wish upon your star
Don't let yourself fall... fall in too hard

I fell into you now I'm on my back,
An insect decaying in your little trap
I squirm into you now I'm in your gut
I fell into you now I'm in a rut

Lift you up like the sweetest angel,
I tear you down like a whore
I will bury your god in my warm spit,
You'll be deformed in your porn

(rock star... you're such a)
ROCK STAR, YEAH (you're such a dirty, dirty)
ROCK STAR, YEAH (you're such a dirty, dirty)
ROCK STAR, YEAH (you're such a dirty, dirty)
ROCK STAR, YEAH (dirty, dirty, dirty)

You eat up my heart and all the little parts
Your star is so sharp it leaves me jagged holes
I make myself sick just to poison you
If i can't have you then no one will

You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal

I'm such a dirty rock star yeah
(I am the one you want and what you want is so unreal)
