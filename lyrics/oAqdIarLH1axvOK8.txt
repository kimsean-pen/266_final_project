I am the Time Lord
I can take you to places you'd never dream
Freedom is my world
Through time and space where no man has been
Climb aboard with me
And together we'll fly in my astral machine
We'll conquer infinity
With ten times the speed of a laser beam
Across the universe we'll scream
Yes, at ten times the speed of a laser beam

We'll journey through space
To the end of the furthest galaxy
To the time and the place
Of future dreams, forgotten reality
No distance is too far
Out in the stars we can make it with ease
Time can hold no bars
To someone who's free as a cosmic breeze
Barriers crumble, we go where we please
Rocketing free as a cosmic breeze
