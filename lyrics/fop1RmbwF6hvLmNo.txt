Tell me you love me
Tell me you care.
I know you won't be there
No oh oh

I'm fragile and sleeping
Do you feel the same?
No I bet you can't complain
About that at all.

So give me it all
And I'll give it right back.
Show me the bottom of this bottle
We can pick up where we left off tomorrow.

She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say how much
I miss your touch.
She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close amongst it all
So just let's fall.

They'll tell you it's easy
But you can't deny
That we'd still stay up all night.
What a waste of time.

So give me it all
And I'll give it right back.
Show me the bottom of this bottle
We can pick up where we left off tomorrow.

She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say how much
I miss your touch.
She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close amongst it all
So just let's fall.

Tell me it'll be okay
And tell me it'll all fade away.

I've walked for miles
And I haven't even got that far.
Told you my secrets
Promise you won't leave the scars.
Now I got nothing
Nothing but a broken heart
No oh.

Never thought it would happen
And I beg.
Second guessing
Girl I got led astray.
Would you come back to me one day?
She was the one who got away
She was the one who I never got to say how much
I miss your touch.
She was the one who meant the most
She was the one who I kept close amongst it all
So just let's fall.
One day
