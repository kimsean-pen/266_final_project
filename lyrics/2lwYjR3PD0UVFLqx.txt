A permanent kind of blue
Takes host inside of you
It grips the spine and twists
And nests where it sees fit
The tears will only feed
Your delirium machine
As your god falls fast asleep
And dies in the dream

Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again

Angel grounded by the storm
Contemplating her life's work
Antiseptic answers ring
Esoterically in key
The synthetic everything
That breeds and comes to be
Are the perils of the deep
In the opiate sea

Passivity will only lead you
To the mouth of tragedy
Pasivity will only lead you
To the mouth of tragedy

Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again

Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again
