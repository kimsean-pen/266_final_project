There were days of no surprise on the way
When Nobody cared but you
Out I retried to feel the salvation
The proof of your words always coo, Boo

If these ties should signify, my mistakes
Please give me power
They are all of my creations
Leaving me disavowed

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard

I rely on fewer lines to let you in
Become my lover
Somewhere all of my relations
One thing's in all the other

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard

All those nights of many lights, fall away
Like they're beautiful, Ours
These are all of my creations
Leaning me now towards you

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard
