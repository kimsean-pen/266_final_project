Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watchin' the ships roll in
And then I'll watch 'em roll away again
I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time, ooh ooh
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
'Cause I've got nothing to live for
And nothing's gonna come my way
I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time
Looks like nothing's gonna change, no no
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'm gonna stay the same, ooh
Sittin' here restin' my bones
This loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home, yeah
I'm gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'ma sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time
I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay!
Wastin' time, wastin' time, wastin' time
