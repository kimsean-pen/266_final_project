I done been in trouble, 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me, but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools
I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project, baby
A free lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me, I set fire to the buildin'
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealin'
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond, ain't no luck or surprises
I am tannin' on an island
I can feel the pressure but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas gettin' stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the Southside with Xan bars and gun play
Niggas on that "someday..."
If you shootin' for the stars, you only headed one way
