Finished with my women
She couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Cause I am frowning all the time

All the time
All the time

All day long I think these things
But nothing seems to satisfy
I think I'll loose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

Can you help him feel love?
Cause he's not made of steel
Oh no, no
Can't you help him feel love?
'Cause he's not made of steel

I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things
That make true happiness I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
And she will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

So unreal
So unreal

And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late

Can you help me feel love, love
Cause I'm not made of steel
Oh no, no
Can you help him feel love, love
'Cause I'm not made of steel
Oh no, no

Can you help me feel love, love
Cause I'm not made of steel
Oh no, no
Can you help me feel love, love
'Cause I'm not made of steel
Oh no, no

('Cause he's not made of steel)
