I lie still at the border
But my visions are broken
Head caught in the torment
Cruel as the ocean
Dreams are made in the distance
I will not be among them
Silence is killing me
And I can hardly touch the ground

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Help with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Help with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Help with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end
