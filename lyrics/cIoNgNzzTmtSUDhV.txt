I wanna have you 'cause you're all I've got
Don't wanna lose you 'cause it means a lot
All the joy this world can bring
Doesn't give me anything, when you're not here

Idiot me, stupid fool
How could you be, so uncool?
To fall in love with someone who
Doesn't really care for you, it's so obscure

But I feel, wonderful
Yes I feel
Don't you know I feel, wonderful?

God it makes me feel so blue, every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire smokin' like some crazy fire
Come on here look at me, where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hands?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold baby? Does it feel hot?

I wanna hold you and be so held back
Don't wanna need you but it's where I'm at
Thinkin' 'bout you every day
How come I was made that way? It's so surreal

But I feel, wonderful
Yes I feel
Don't you know I feel, wonderful?

God it makes me feel so blue, every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire smokin' like some crazy fire
Come on here look at me, where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hands?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold baby? Does it feel hot?

It makes me feel so blue, every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire smokin' like some crazy fire
Come on here look at me, where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hands?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold baby? Does it feel hot?
