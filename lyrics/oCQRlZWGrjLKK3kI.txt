You, come and get over here
And give me your hands
Suddenly he is walking around
and this life is what everybody was talking about
this is what makes me special

You, come and get over here
And give me your hands
its a destiny, I don't believe in destiny,
yes you do, you just don't know it yet
its destiny

you come get over here
and give me your hand
you come get over here
and give me your hand
