This is an old folks party
This is an old folks party

Welcome
To Uncle Mother's
Leave your children
In the car

The procedure
In the kitchen
Will remove your
Inmost light
Right!

Though there's smiles there
On placid faces
Something evil
Is thinking the dark:

"Here! It's cold by law"

Old folks party
Old folks party
Mind the decor
Mind the decor

Take care
Take care
Mind the decor

What you are handed
Will consume you
What you are handed
Swallow on the spot

You're welcome
To enter
But if I was you
I would not

"Here! It's cold by law"

So welcome
To Uncle Mother's
Are your children
Still in the car?

The dogs here
They are singing
What they're singing
Is quite bizarre

The horizon opens up and what do I see?
There's something in the center that is calling out
Calling out to me
And the things that've been apported
Look like organs all diseased

And the sun the sun the sun the sun
Will never shine again
