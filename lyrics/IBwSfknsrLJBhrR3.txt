"Good morning, Marshall" Morning, doc
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
Uh, anxious
"Anxiety?"
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world, nervous...
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now"
"Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this"
"You found a sponsor yet?"
Uhm, not yet but I mean... when I get back
"Well, if you find one, you find one, if you don't, you don't"
Well... yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and... wait, what?
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings, y'know"
"It's not like like a requirement"
"That they fit into your shedule, we know you're a busy person"
But I thought sobriety was the most important thing
"So what else are you thinking?"
Uhm... well, I know I gotta start practising the steps, and...
I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them
"Steps?"
Yeah, steps
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?"
Well, twelve
"Christ, I don't even know them all"
Really?
"Anything else?"
Uhm, well, I mean, the only other question I have is like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
"Take a drink"
What?
"Take a drink and, y'know, take the edge off"
Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to
"What, you mean these?"
Man, what the fuck!?
"Marshall, what's the matter, darling?"
"Having some doubts already?"
"Marshall, you can't leave me"
"You'll never leave me, Marshall"
"We'll always be together, Marshall?"
"Marshall? Marshall!?!"
