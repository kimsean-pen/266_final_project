Strange days and celebrations
A soft warning, are we drowning?
Late night congratulations
Eyes wide, we're enchanting
Party fears and declarations
I've got something I want to tell you
Lost trails of conversation
I want you to break me out

How does it feel?
This true, true, coming dream
I will hold you tight
My figurine

Party fears and declarations
Heart is pounding, are we surrounded?
Room full of aspirations
True lies, are we dreamers?
All bound to expectations
Cannot help it, the lucky ones
Strange days and celebrations
I want you to break me out

How does it feel?
This true, true, coming dream
I will hold you tight, my figurine
True coming dream
Dreams for protection
Blow those candles out, another year

How does it feel?
This true, true, coming dream
I will hold you tight, my figurine
True coming dream
Dreams for protection
Blow those candles out, another year
How does it feel?
This true coming dream?
There's no place for me
Me without you
