Damned, these vultures
with glistening eyes
menacly roving
The dreams and the pain
And your worn out name

Something has gone wrong
And it chafes me
And enslaves me
No matter what
This is not going to change me

I find myself somewhere
Lying naked in the wildwoods
Along an everflowing stream
With all of my warm desires
And my cold nostalgic dreams

And when they stay
I'll live through
A thousand deaths

If my head was silent
And if my eyes were closed
The visions of reality wouldn't speak
With such a vile, relentless voice

But I have figured out the decline
So the damage is done
What I saw, would not be
But the things I hide is all I see
