Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up

Baby, baby, tell me what's up

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, 'fraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of giving in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'

I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

We were chillin', watchin' your tv
I felt it was coming the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Trying to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting too late
I'm thinkin'

I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (Knowing)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right)
I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby)
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (You're probably thinkin' something's wrong)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right)
I wanna get down, but not the first night

If you want me, you've got to know me (Got to know me)
And if you want my love (my love)
You've gotta wait, my love
Hey baby, that's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me (get to know me)
So we can do this

I should make a move (ohhhhhhh)
I know you're probably thinkin' (I won't, I won't, baby)
Knowing if I do (I won't, I won't, baby)
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (no, no, no)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong (oh no, no, no)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night (I wanna get down, but not the first night)

(to end)
