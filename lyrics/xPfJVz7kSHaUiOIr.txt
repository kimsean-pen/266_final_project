Whether you made this easy
Whether you made it hard
Whether you hurt me deeply
Whether you rocked my heart

Even when you're not around you're never really gone
Yeah, the memories you leave are goin' on and on
Completely, you're written in my stars, star

Hey, now, I never forget you
There's a piece of you that ain't never left
So when the good times come or whether they left
You know you'll always be a part of me

(And now you know)
For everyone that's come with me this far
Don't have to tell you, you know who you are
If you left your fingerprints or left a scar
Want you to know

Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart

Maybe you made me stronger
Maybe you brought me down
Maybe it's what I needed
That's how I see it now, now

Even when you're not around you're never really gone
Yeah, the memories you leave are goin' on and on
Completely, you know there ain't no doubt, yeah

Hey, now, I never forget you
There's a piece of you that ain't never left
So when the good times come or whether they left
You know you'll always be a part of me

(And now you know)
For everyone that's come with me this far
Don't have to tell you, you know who you are
If you left your fingerprints or left a scar
Want you to know
Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart

(Yeah you did, yeah you did)
Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart

(Oh, oh)
If you ever held me close, or if you ever let me go
(Oh, oh)
If you ever built me up, or if you ever told me no, no, no, no
If you ever held me close, or if you ever let me go
If you ever built me up, or if you ever told me no, no, no, no

For everyone that's come with me this far
Don't have to tell you, you know who you are
If you left your fingerprints or left a scar
Want you to know
Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart

(Yeah you did, yeah you did)
Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart
(I know you did, know you did)
Oh, you made a mark, oh you made a mark
Made a mark on my heart
