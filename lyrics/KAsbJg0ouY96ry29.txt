Oh, wanderer
I've been wondering
If your brown eyes still have color
Could I see?

That night, at night with those hands, those hands
That night, at night
Oh, gallium ring
With heart, wild heart,
You'd sing to me
Wasn't that the lady from the altar

Twist of fate would have me sing at your wedding
With a baby on my mind and your soul in between

Wild heart, young man
Goddamn no one to keep
When your goal is ages out for the end of your story
Give my hand to Jesus
When I ran away with you
Oh, wanderer
I've been wondering
