The wrong time, the wrong place
Our smiling face of distrust
Buried the seed deep in all our heads
Prepared ourselves for the fall

The greed killing
The greed killing

Instinct to mistrust
Instinct, the lust
Their butchery of feelings
Geared for a greed killing

Greed killing

Not now, then when?
Not now, then when?
When? When? When? When?

The lust denies need
The lust denies need
Lust denies need
Lust denies need
Lust denies need

Existence is a steady flow
The molded image grows
No care, no faith in what you are
The pressure builds right from the start

Could it be just sour grapes?
Or have we failed to fit their shape?
It's always give and never take
How much more can we give?
How much more can we take?

Not now, then when?
Not now, then when?
When? When? When? When?

The lust denies need
The lust denies need
Lust denies need
Lust denies need
Lust denies need

Existence is a steady flow
The molded image grows
No care, no faith in what you are
The pressure builds right from the start
