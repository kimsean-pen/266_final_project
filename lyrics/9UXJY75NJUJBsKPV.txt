I saw you on a Sunday in a cafe
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been asking about you too
And now we're out here in this room

(I get a little bit nervous around you)
(Get a little bit stressed out)
(When I think about you)
(Get a little excited)
(Baby, when I think about you, yeah)

(Talk a little too much) I talk a little too much, (around you) yeah
(Get a little self conscious) I get a little self conscious
(When I think about you)
(Get a little excited) I get a little excited
(Baby, when I think about you, yeah)
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

We walked in the rain
A couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside
Caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me
Ah, what you're doing to me

(I get a little bit nervous) I get a little bit nervous (around you)
(Get a little bit stressed out) I get a little bit stressed out
(When I think about you)
(Get a little excited) I get a little excited
(Baby, when I think about you)
Yeah, when I think about you, babe (oh yeah)
(Talk a little too much) I talk a little too much, (around you) yeah
(Get a little self conscious) I get a little self conscious
(When I think about you)
(Get a little excited) I get a little excited
(Baby, when I think about you)
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

You got me acting like I've never done this before
I promise I'll be ready when I walk through the door
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Yeah.
