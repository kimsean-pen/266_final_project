I keep on basin'
When I've had enough
Settle down for a while
I'll be your favorite darling
Of love, I
Never felt this way

In love
With you

You know,
I wanna be somebody.
I mean, I am somebody.
I just want to be content.
Comfortable.
You know?
I wanna be somebody... comfortable.
You know?
I wanna be,
I mean,
I am somebody.

Go to the empty lot
Where you said you'd be
Left me feeling empty
A thought I didn't need
Made your way right over
To that empty lot
Told me you'd replace it
Without second thought

Came right over where you said you'd be
Where you said you'd be
