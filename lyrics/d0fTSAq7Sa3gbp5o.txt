I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
but I'll pick you a flower if you'd like
I know I'll never be the stars up in your sky
but I'll pick you a flower if you'd like

She loves me, she loves me not
She says she loves me
Has she forgotten that she loves me
Love me one more time
I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
I can pick you a flower if you'd like

'Cause I'll meet you down by the end of the road
Where the sunset glows and the garden grows
I've got one pair of shoes with 20 holes in the toes
and I would walk 20 miles just to get to those blue eyes
If you would smile for me to my surprise
I would stay for a while to see what comes next
Or we could take off our clothes
and have long conversations in french, aha!

I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
but I'll pick you a flower if you'd like
I know I'll never be the stars up in your sky
but I'll pick you a flower if you'd like

She loves me, she loves me not
She says she loves me
Has she forgotten that she loves me
Love me one more time
I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I'll pick you a flower if you'd like
Let's go!

Roses are red
Violets are blue
But it is true I'd be through
if I don't have you
So I just chill up on the hill picking daffodils
Making wishes, about you Mrs
'Cause I know I'll never be the apple of your eye
But I'll pick you a flower.
