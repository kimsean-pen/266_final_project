Unfurl your gown
A distant fuller skin
I knew you once

My God the sun
The windows bear your bones
Reveal your crime

Beautiful girl
Let the sunrise come again
Beautiful girl

Your sailor eyes
The water in the well
A thirst to fill

Let down your arms
The purging of this dark
The fall to free

Beautiful girl
Let the sunrise come again
Beautiful girl

Beautiful girl
May the weight of world resign
You will get better
You will get better
