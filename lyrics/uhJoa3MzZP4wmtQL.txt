Passing slowly through a vector
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
With my laugh, my lone companion
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon

Woah, we're passing slow, we're passing slow, woah, slow, slow

Drink the colors of the night time
If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time
I'll display my disaffection you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out
Out across the city loud and proud in your direction

Woah, we're passing slow, we're passing slow, woah, slow, slow
Woah, we're passing slow, we're passing slow, woah, slow, slow

But when I get to your apartment I climb the rail outside the building
A band of them were in your apartment they tied you up unwound, unwilling
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
And in I come to lick it up, clean up what is left of you
