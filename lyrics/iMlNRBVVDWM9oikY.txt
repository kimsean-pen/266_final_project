Who's gonna bring the cinnamon
Who's gonna bring the gloves
Who's gonna bring the lavender
Who's gonna bring the torgh
Who's gonna heal the easy girls
Who's gonna heal the nuns
Who's gonna heal the mothers in black
Who's gonna heal their sons

Long live death

Who's gonna bring the vinegar
Who's gonna bring the rod
Who's gonna bring the junipers
Who's gonna bring the wormwood
Who's gonna heal the noblemen
Who's gonna heal the dames
Who's gonna heal the widows in black
Who's gonna ease the pain

Long live death
