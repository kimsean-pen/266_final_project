What more can I do?
You know I'd gladly lose myself to you
But something always holds me back
I wish I knew what it is that stops me
From loving you the way it should be
Oh, oh, oh, oh

What more can I do?
I'm trying hard, I know I could believe in you
But something always keeps a hold on me
And just won't let me go
Such a burning bully inside
While I'm trying to hide that
I want you to own me, own me, own, own
Oh, yeah

What more can I say?
I've said it all now
Got such a love loose, a price to pay
If you ignore me what more can I do?
Oh, what more can I do?
Oh, what more can I do?
