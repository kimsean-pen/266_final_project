If you saw the surface rip and bloom with rot
Some part doing what some other part will not
Maybe that was it

If you saw a shadow rise above the hiss
Iridescent and pretend anonymous
Maybe that was it

If you saw a weapon that so smoothly transfixed
Cylinders of language pounded into bricks
Maybe that was it

If you saw an animal in hard retreat
Hundred parasites all burrowed in deep
Maybe that was it
