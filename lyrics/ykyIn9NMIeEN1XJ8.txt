I look around I see that time ain't changed
Same old faces, Same old names
All the things we thought we knew
You lied to me and I lied to you
(Now) All this time
You never ever sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside
What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where and how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where an d how
Show me the road back home, back home

The pain blew in like a hurricane
Stranger in this town bearing your name
Trapped in the silence with my memories
It's cutting me deep and its tellin' me

All this time
You never ever sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside

Going nowhere and I'm headed there fast and I
Don't mean maybe
The light is getting low and my touch is growing cold
Oh just hold me baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where and how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where and how
Show me the road back home, back home

What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where and how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where and how
Show me the road back home, back home
