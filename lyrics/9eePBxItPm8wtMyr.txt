Breathe!

Corporate causes with self-served denial
The raping of the land
Collapse
The lungs malfunction
They never learned to breathe

Breathe!

Rusted syringes and half-thought disposal
A burial at sea
Waste water graveyard
Swimming in disease

Breathe!

This is the world
It's not working
This is this earth

Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!

Children gasping the second-hand air
Death and desperation
We've got to cut the lies with truth
We breathe

Breathe!

This is the world
The clock's ticking
Is this this earth?

Breathe! Breathe, you fucker!

Hope springs eternal but there's no conviction
Action mistaken for ransom is paid
All this concern is the true contradiction
The world is insane

Breathe!

This is the world
It's got no future
Is this this earth?

Breathe! Breathe, you fucker
