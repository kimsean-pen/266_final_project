Oh, my, what a sweet surprise
I'm so surprised by your heart and your mind
And I spy, somethin' in your eye
That makes me secure about you and I

(I have searched so far and wide
Can't seem to find)
Somebody worth a second glance
(I'm so sick and tired of boys wastin' my time)
And you took my hand

Ooh, you make me feel like a lady, baby
Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Can't forget it, can't forget it, baby
The way, the way, ooh, so nice
Had to get you, now that I got you, baby
Can't, can't, I can't let you go, no, no

(I've been waitin' for a man like you)
To love and treat me right, yeah
(Now I know what I'm supposed to do)
I can't let you go

Ooh, you make me feel
Like a lady, baby, yes you do
Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love
(In love with you, baby)
Ooh, you make me feel
Like a lady, baby yeah
Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love
(In love with you)

Fallin' in love with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you, baby, love you, baby
Love you, baby, I do
