Been really sweet with my baby
I gave good times
Well I've been broken
Going to bring her back
Back to my knees
Knees to my feet
Feet to my toes
Well I'm a soldier of grief
Now you pull me down
You know I need her there
You broke me down
You know I need her there

Let me sleep on my wrong you know
I was running around
I won't let you go
You just running around
I get no sleep
I can't get no release
Put it on a sound
I'm so decreased
Now you broke me down
You know I need her there
Now you broke me down
You know I need her there
