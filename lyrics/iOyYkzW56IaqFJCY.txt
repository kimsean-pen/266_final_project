Don't wake me up
Before the sun goes down
I see better with my eyes closed
Keep the curtains shut
Keep me blind to your un-love
It might be better if I don't know

(Don't wake me)
(Don't wake me)
It's too late forever
(Don't wake me)
(Don't wake me)
It's too late forever

So, don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
It's too late for love
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
It's too late for love
Don't wake me up
Before the sun goes down
I see better with my eyes closed
Keep the curtains shut
Keep me blind to your un-love
It might be better if I don't know
