She stepped into the hall of mirrors
Where she discovered a reflection of herself
Sometimes she saw her real face
And sometimes a stranger at her place
Even the greatest stars discover themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars find their face in the looking glass

She fell in love with the image of herself
And suddenly the picture was distorted
Even the greatest stars dislike themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars dislike themselves in the looking glass

She made up the person she wanted to be
And changed into a new personality
The artist is living in the mirror
With the echoes of himself
Even the greatest stars change themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars fix their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars fix their face in the looking glass

Even the greatest stars live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars live their lives in the looking glass

Even the greatest stars
Fix your face in the looking glass
