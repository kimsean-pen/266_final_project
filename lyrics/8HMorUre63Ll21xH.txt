You just smile at me,
You're just on my knee,
Bring me coffee or tea,
Call me "pretty little bee".

Whisper in my ear, lad,
You're still my parent friend,
Throw me out of my bag,
Ask me "Are you dead?"

I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel,
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel,
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel,
You just smile at me,
You're just on my knee,
Bring me coffee or tea,
Call me "pretty little bee".

Whisper in my ear, lad,
You're still my parent friend,
Throw me out of my bag,
Ask me "Are you dead,
Dead, dead?"

You just smile at me,
You're just on my knee.

I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel,
I feel pretty in the chimney, I feel,
I feel pretty in the chimney, yes, I'm again,
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again,
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again,
Oh!

Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again.

Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again,
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again,
Yes, I'm again, yes, I'm again,
Yes, I'm again.

Yes, I'm again.
