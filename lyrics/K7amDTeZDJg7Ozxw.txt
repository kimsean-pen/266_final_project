Sitting round with some old friends
Feeling sketchy on a park bench
Blown the money that i cant spent
Seven days from the weekend
The music playing doesn't sound right
Am i the only one that's not high?
I'm going walking 'cause i can't drive
Oh i've forgotten what it feels like
It's like i'm the first on earth to discover
One foot in front of the other
It's like i'm the first on earth to discover
One foot in front of the other x5
Hanging round like a blank space
Mother handed me a suitcase
Said i've got to learn some new tricks
Now i watch the whole of Netflix
And she won't let me do a retake
Get out the door and get a job Jake
Now i'm stranded on the outside
Oh i've forgotten what it feels like
It's like i'm the first on earth to discover
One foot in front of the other
It's like i'm the first on earth to discover
One foot in front of the other x5
Till we work out running
This will have to do
Thinking that i'm onto something
Get us somewhere new
Watch out everybody
Cause i just learnt how to move
One foot in front of the other x3
