She comes along, she gets inside
She makes you better than anything you've tried
It's in her kiss, black as sea
And it runs deeper than you dared to dream it could be

With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

Wave goodbye to what you were
The rules have changed, the lines begin to blur
She makes you hard, it comes on strong
You finally found, the place where you belong

With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again

With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

She will not let you go
Keeps on and on
She will not let you go
Keeps on and on
This time I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
This time I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
