In the wrong time
In the wrong place
In the wrong mind

Can't find the time
Can't find the thoughts
Can't find the signs

Everything seems just as it seems
Just as it seems

Losing the feel
Lost all the feel
Of real things

Close your eyes
Not a pretty sight
And i'll tell you what
It's not gonna be alright
This time

What not to see
What not to hear
What not to be

When you begin
Seeing your sins
Seeing your sins

Everything missing

Lost all the feel
Losing the need for real things

Close your eyes
It's not a pretty sight
And i'll tell you what
It's not gonna be alright
This time
