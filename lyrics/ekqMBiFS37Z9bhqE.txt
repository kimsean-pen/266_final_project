I've been walking in the moonlight looking for you
I got nobody but my shadow to give me through
So put your lips on my scars and teach me to love
Give my slow heart the rhythm of a blood drum

I don't want you to go
I need more of you in my life
Nobody should be alone
Please let me take you home tonight

Oh, don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
And every night I call for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
I'd do anything to touch you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know that I'm going mad
And in the moment I fall for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad (so bad)
I'd do anything to love you

Take a look at these mountains I'm moving for you
I'm gonna light the dynamite, I'm gonna break through
'Cause I know all the ways to appreciate your design
I'm a damn good lover, shivers up your spine

I don't want you to go
I need more of you in my life
Nobody should be alone (be alone)
Please let me take you home tonight

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
And every night I call for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
I'd do anything

Don't you know that I
Don't you know that I'm going mad (going mad)
And in the moment I fall for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
I'd do anything to love you

Oh
Oh, don't make me beg you please
Oh, oh, oh
When I know you are meant for me

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
I would fight in a war for you
Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad

Oh, don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
And every night I call for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad
I'd do anything to touch you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know that I'm going mad (going mad)
And in the moment I fall for you

Don't you know that I
Don't you know I want you so bad (so bad)
I'd do anything to love you

Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
