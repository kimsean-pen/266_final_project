I liked her face those eyes
She left today, oh goodbye
And lookin' at you I'm drained outright
And isolated in the light
(Ooo ooo)
And I resigned everyone
Ever since I was young
I'm starting to understand
What's going on and how it's planned
I like love but I don't know
All these girls they come and go
Always nothin' left to say
(Ooo ooo)
And I resigned everyone
Ever since I was young
I'm starting to understand
What's going on and how it's planned
Oh now, oh now
Oh now, oh now
Oh now, oh now
(Oh now)
Oh now
(Oh now)
Oh now
(Oh now)
Oh now
(Oh now)
Oh now
