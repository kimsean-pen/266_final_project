On Christmas morning
On Christmas day
Kris Kringle's driving
A Chevrolet
He left his reindeer
He went down south
He just had to see what it's all about
Wrapping
Presents
Out in the sun
Stuffing
Stockings
Having some fun
Reading
Writing
Christmas is here
Cali
Fornia
Yuletide cheer
All the little children and all the big children it's Christmas
In L.A.
All the ladies and all the little babies it's Christmas
In L.A.
Even the gentlemen every single one of them
Christmas
In L.A.
In L.A.
Everyone around the world
Every boy and girl
It's time to say
It's time to say
It's time to say out loud
All the little children and all the big children it's Christmas
In L.A.
All the ladies and all the little babies
They were singing in the round
In L.A.
Even the gentlemen every single one of them
Christmas
In L.A.
In L.A.
All the big children and all the little children it's Christmas
In L.A.
All the ladies and all the little babies it's Christmas
In L.A.
Even the gentlemen every single one of them
Christmas
In L.A.
