Well I've seen you before
On that discotheque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
Oh But I could've sworn that
I saw something more in your eyes
Oh though you were surrounded
By beauty unbounded
Your glances intended for me
And though I tried to hide it
I found myself looking to see
So then you took your chances you made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say
If you can't give me love honey that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
And if you can give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
Well you may be a king of this discotheque thing
But honey I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man not some sort of aristocrat
Oh if only you'd waited or just hesitated
Or maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know why I don't want to go
Baby that's why we don't stand a chance
If you can't give me love honey that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
And if you can give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love
If you can't give me love honey that ain't enough
