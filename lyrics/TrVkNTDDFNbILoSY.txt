Honey it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know I'm the one
Unchain your back door, invite me around

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Let her go

Honey it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back, no where, no way, no place to hide

Bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter
Bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter
Bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter to the slaughter
Bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter
Bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter
Bring me your daughter, fetch your daughter to the slaughter

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring me your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
I'm coming to getcha!
