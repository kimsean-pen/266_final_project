Coleus Dominus Sanctus Animus
Coleus Dominus Sanctus Animus

Awake to live when carnal battle calls
bring up the force behind the Iron balls,
strong and bound the pale injection,
the rise of life and lust above the soul,
the mind of instinct gone beyond control,
praise the saints for this erection

Coleus Sanctus, in the heart of the night,
Coleus Sanctus, mighty arm in the fight,
Coleus Sanctus, holy sanctum of men,
Ave Maria

Coleus Sanctus, in the heart of the night,
Coleus Sanctus, mighty arm in the fight,
Coleus Sanctus, holy sanctum of men,
Ave Maria

I pray to Father, Son, Testosterone
In darkest Night,
don't leave my mind alone
Stand!
Forever be my demon
the resurrection of the carnivore
the mind of maleness turned to whitened stone
come and sanctify the seamen

Coleus Dominus Sanctus Animus
Coleus Dominus Sanctus Animus

And in the night, when hormones rise with lust,
when out of silence we are slaves to lust
Coleus Sanctus, be my saviour for all time.

Coleus Dominus!
