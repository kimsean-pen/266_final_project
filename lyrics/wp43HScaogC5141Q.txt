I was holding on to a branch in the river
So scared of letting go
And praying only that someone would stop the flow
I heard a voice like the sound of an ocean
Above the river's rush
A song as old as the world,
And my heart was hushed
And I could hear it calling to me

Let go now, it'll be ok
Let go, and let yourself be carried away
Carried away
Let go of all your uncertainty
Let go, and let yourself be carried to me
Carried to me

Still I clung to that branch in the river
White-knuckled, terrified
All of my life I'd been warned that the waters lied
Something changed as the flood rose around me
And washed away my fear
An echo rose from within
It was crystal clear
And I could hear it calling to me

Let go now, it'll be ok
Let go, and let yourself be carried away
Carried away
Let go of all your uncertainty
Let go, and let yourself be carried to me
Carried to me

So I let go

You're holding on to that branch in the river
So scared of letting go
You're praying only that someone would stop the flow
But hear the voice, it's a chorus in motion - conflate the I and we
Weaving along with the song of the endless sea
The song that's always calling to you

Let go now, it'll be ok
Let go, and let yourself be carried away
Carried away
Let go of all your uncertainty
Let go, and let yourself be carried to me
Carried to me
