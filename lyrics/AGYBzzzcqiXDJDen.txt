I had a dream
I held a palm tree
In the palm of my hand
I'm on a coral sand beach
Where pelicans fly
I'm layin' in the cool breeze
Doing what I please

I had a dream
I held a palm tree
In the palm of my hand
I'm on a coral sand beach
Where pelicans fly
I'm layin' in the cool breeze
Doing what I please

La da da dee
It's raining diamonds
Over the seas
The seas of Saturn
In Neptune's skies
It's raining diamonds
In Jupiter's clouds
Yeah raining diamonds
Over you and me

La da da dee
It's raining diamonds
Over the seas
The seas of Saturn
In Neptune's skies
It's raining diamonds
In Jupiter's clouds
Raining diamonds
Over you and me

Green leaves, gold flowers, red sunset
Green leaves, gold flowers and a red sunset
Green leaves, gold flowers, red sunset
Green leaves, gold flowers, red sunset
