Nothing ever ends the way you thought it would when you started
This song's not gonna be what it seems to me now
And no one ever is what my instinct told me when I first met them
Except for you, maybe, I thought you were the strangest thing
Except for you, darling
And have my feet ever led my mouth to water?
Was it the (??????) lead me to you?
And have my eyes ever feasted so fully?
Just on you, I think you're the strangest thing
Just on you, darling
I want you, will I want you for good?
Will I want you by the end of this word?
I think my feelings are made of Play-Doh
'Cause they're malleable at first
But they're sure to crack when they dry
But I didn't have to mold myself to you
No, I didn't even have to try
I just stood by you
I think you're the strangest thing
So I stood by you, darling
I want you, will I want you for long?
Will I want you by the end of this song?
