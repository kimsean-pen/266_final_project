I'll be the one at the foot of the mountain
Shouting upwards: Will you remember my name?
Attending your birth on the dark of a Tuesday
I'll tell you something, I'll never be quite the same
Welcome to the world
It's a pretty funky mess love
Where boys think they are gods but they are nothing of the sort
So rise and fight and punch till their ears hear the truth love
Or get your beds together and just build a massive fort

Throw the fear, throw the fear
Let the day become the year
You're alive, I'm alive, we're a-la-la-la-live
If you go, if you go, take all the heart with you
History, it's all gone
Make the new, make the new

Under your skin is an unknown power
There's not a man who can match a mighty dame
You won't solve your problems in the minutes or the hours
Build your own castle, and build it in your name
The importance of just keeping going
Perseverance will be your greatest friend
Don't die before your dead, keep watering the plants love
In the end the end is just the end

Throw the fear, throw the fear
Let the day become the year
You're alive, I'm alive, we're a-la-la-la-live
If you go, if you go, take all the heart with you
History, it's all gone
Make the new, make the new

I'll be the one at the base of the tall tree
Loving you for all my lonely life
A burst of the light in the heart of the darkness
Take it on, enjoy the big surprise

Throw the fear, throw the fear
Let the day become the year
You're alive, I'm alive, we're a-la-la-la-live
If you go, if you go, take all the heart with you
History, it's all gone
Make the new, make the new
