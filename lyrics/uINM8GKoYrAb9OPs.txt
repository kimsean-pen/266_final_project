Don't be afraid if you hear voices
Or feel the sweet air spoken upon you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words
Of hope will reassure, show me the future

We'll see us joined together
If the oceans fled or the mountains sigh
Then I will keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Don't be afraid if you're descending
The deepest despair without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words
Can confuse, but when you're sleeping

They shift and slide together
Bring meaning to the canyon's cry
Oh, I... I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispers are where
You live a little fear, but feel the future
Well I feel us dream together
I feel no fear, I feel no fire
Oh, I... I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream
