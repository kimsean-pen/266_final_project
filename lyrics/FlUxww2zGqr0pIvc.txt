You were made to shine under Southern stars
Pure as the mountain rain
You're the love songs pouring out of this guitar
Sweeter than sugarcane

You've got my heart wrapped up like it's down in the holler
Covered in kudzu vines
When the night feels right I'm gonna come a-callin'
I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

Gonna take you slow dancing by the water
I just wanna hold you tight
I'm in love with you so, miner's daughter
And I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine

You're hallelujah, Sunday morning
All I've ever needed, wanted
Underneath this pale moon sky
I'm gonna make you mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make you mine

You were made to shine under Southern stars
In my arms tonight
I can feel the beating of your heart
I'm gonna make you mine
