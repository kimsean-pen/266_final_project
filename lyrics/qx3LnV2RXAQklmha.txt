Someone sucked the life out of the room
When that someone said goodbye much too soon
I'd hate for you to love me 'cause you saw me out
With someone who you read about in the news

But I guess that's what this world is coming to

I watched as your wrists began to bruise
Threading ribbons weaving patterns, beautiful and blue
All your late nights came to life, and then died upon just one dislike
Never mind all the people that you moved

But I guess that's what this world is coming to

So let's get high here in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I think I'm gonna shine in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead

So let's get high in the moonlight
Even the stars go right over our head
I know I'm gonna shine here in the afterlife
Leaving the fight for peace of mind instead

You know that I can't stop thinkin' bout you
You're the source of everything I do
You brought faith to songs I sing, so I went and bought a diamond ring
I wanna spend each night here with you

Yeah, you took everything I was
And you turned it into something I've become
Good God, what's a boy to do?

But I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world
Oh, I guess that's what this world is, is coming to
No, I guess that's what my life is, is coming to
