Little like the colors fade away.
Right under
Blind beginning of decay
broad under
Blind beginning of decay

Little like the flowers of debate
stood by me in trials
Of moving into place
stood by me in trials
From gloom to grace.

Straight up right now
Is so wonderful
Way beyond believe and dreams.
Your voice is so beautiful.
like the voice of quiet spring.

Little like the hours castaway.
Why wonder
Time ain't either here to stay
why wonder
Time will always pass away

Little like the sewers that you made
Run blindly through piles
Off something disobeyed
Run blindly through piles
Off disgrace

Straight up right now
Is so wonderful
Way beyond believe and dreams
your voice is so beautiful
Like the voice of summer breeze.
