Who are you? Who am I to you?
I am the antichrist to you
fallen from the sky with grace
into your arms race

Lucid lovers me and you
a deal of matchless value
I was always quick to admit defeat
empty statements of bones and meat

And my heart it shook with fear
I'm a coward behind a shield and spear
Take this sword and throw it far
Let it shine under the morning star

Who are you? Who am I to you?
I am the antichrist to you
fallen from the sky with grace
into your arms race

One for my heart and two for show
three tears for all the souls below

One day we made them into figurines
burned them all with all my favorite things

Who are you? Who am I to you?
I am the antichrist to you
fallen from the sky with grace
into your arms race

Who are you? Who am I to you?
I am the antichrist to you
fallen from the sky with grace
into your arms...
