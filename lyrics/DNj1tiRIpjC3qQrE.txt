I lost my faith, made my mistakes
Couldn't find a way to make it easy
I'll be better on my own, believe me
Pain I hold back, can't live like that
Yeah, I made my peace with all of the sorrow
And now I'm livin' for tomorrow

I'm a girl with a new face
And a life that's been changed
You know, you know, you know?

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
It's alright now, baby, I've got the cure

Now it's me and myself, don't need no one else
This happiness was always inside me
But Lord, it took a minute to find me
And this freedom I found is worth a million o' you now
And I'm puttin' all my troubles behind me
I only need my heart to guide me (Yeah)

I'm a girl with a new face
And a life that's been changed
You know, you know, you know? (No, no, no, no)

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore (Little bit, oh)
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore (Little bit, oh)
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
(Tears fell down, na, na)
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
(Tears fell down, na, na)
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
(Tears fell down, na, na)
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
It's alright now, baby, I've got the cure
