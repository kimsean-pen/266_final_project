Laying in the bed that I made all alone
Guess I'm not surprised honestly
Praying in my head that you stayed and I hope
You'll miss me eventually

People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear
Really they don't know what I'm made of
People keep on walking so far away from here
Clearly I'm the one they're afraid of

One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm a monster that's been here all along
They're dropping like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

Bending 'till you break and you can't take anymore
I'm not worth the trouble it seems
I would say you're wrong, but I've been here before
You won't be the last one to leave

People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear
Really they don't know what I'm made of
People keep on walking so far away from here
Clearly I'm the one they're afraid of

One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm a monster that's been here all along
They're dropping like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

You're safe here
No need to run and hide
Underneath your cover now
Don't be scared
There's nothing left inside
Since you ate my heart out

One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm a monster that's been here all along
They're dropping like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along
