We could bring a blanket for the grass
Cover up your eyes so you don't see
If you let me go, I'll run out fast
1 2 3 count 1 2 3
We could watch the blackbirds cross the skies
We could count the leaves left on the trees
We could count the teardrops in our eyes
1 2 3 yeah 1 2 3
1 2 3 yeah 1 2 3
Now you know, now you know how I feel
And I won't back down

Prick your finger on a spinning wheel
But don't make a sound
A drop of blood and now you're taken for all time
With a kiss you will awaken and you'll be mine

You'll be mine.
You'll be mine.

I could always stay and work it out
Wondering if you still wanted me
But there are so many things to doubt
1 2 3 count 1 2 3
Think that for a moment you were mine
I know that you saw what we could be
But then you went and changed your mind
1 2 3 yeah 1 2 3
1 2 3 yeah 1 2 3

Now you know, now you know how I feel
And I won't back down

Prick your finger on a spinning wheel
But don't make a sound
A drop of blood and now you're taken for all time
With a kiss you will awaken and you'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You'll be mine
