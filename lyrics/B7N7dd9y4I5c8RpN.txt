I'm done, I'm done, I don't care how you feel
I'm done, I'm done for now
And I see, I see with every glance that I steal
I'm done, I'm done for now
You say you're used to playin with fire
You say you're heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well that ain't showin through to me

And I see, I see that I could do no wrong
In my old mans eyes
And I swear, I swear that I would try it on
Before the day I die

You say you're used to playin with fire
You say you're heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well that ain't showin through to me

And I guess I knew it
This whole time
But these old feelings
They make me blind

You say you're used to playin with fire
You say you're heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well that ain't showin through to me
You say you're used to playin with fire
You say you're heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well that ain't showin through to me
