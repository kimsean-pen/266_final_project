Well I know
We used to have a good time
Yeah I know
We always had a good time
And I know
It's gonna go away
And I know
They gotta take you away

Well I know
We used to have a good time
Yeah I know
We always had a good time
And I know
It's gonna go away
And I know
You gotta take it away

It's time to let go
You're turning white
It's time to say no
Oh, I might cry
Blame me all night [?]
Things like this remind me I'm alive

If I accepted this as truth
Why would I take good care of you?
Would I hand the golden key to you, once my everything?
My love is so strong and bright
I bathe you well with all my might
My light goes out, you ran away
I'll turn it off and think about that day
