None of them
Some of us
Heard what you said
With the dust

In your lungs
And we hush
Show you my face

Each of us could respond to
Calls from great beyond

Our love must return
All has undone
Our love must return now
Back into the sun

Overnight
With restrain
Whispering strange
Still remains

Mispronounced
Each of us
Screaming with pride
In our hearts

In our hearts
And our hearts could soon response to
Show much anyone

Our love must return
All has undone
Our love must return now
Back into the sun

Our love must return
All has undone
Our love must return now
All has undone
Our love must return now
Back into the sun
