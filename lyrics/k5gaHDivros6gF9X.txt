You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid, then, to try

I'm living in a lie
I'm in a fantasy world
But the hero won't win this time
Cause my pipe dream gets flushed away

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize
You've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face, but I'm already gone

You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid, then, to try

There was something in the way
Something in the way
Something in the way that you shut the door
I couldn't get enough when you blow me off
I just keep dragging myself back for more

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize
You've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face, but I'm already gone

One day you're going to see
The life sentence you gave to me
But I swear one day we will share this cell
I know it's cold but I will keep us warm
With all the hate I radiate
We'll be walking hand in hand in hell

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize
You've permanently changed

And it's all thanks to me
I was wrong for coming here
You wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face, but I'm already gone.
