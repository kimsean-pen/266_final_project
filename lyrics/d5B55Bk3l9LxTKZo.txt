Talk to God about me
How you feel about me
Look Him in His eyes
Ask Him why I'm fly
Talk to God about me
How you feel inside
Let him confirm those lies
Ask him why, oh why, why?

They be like
That bitch fake and lately I heard she been bleaching, yeah
I just look at these hoes like "Y'all still reachin'?," yeah
And I admit that maybe I give them a reason, yeah
They always screaming "Next year gon' be they season," nah!
And if you really knew the bitches that you look up to
Them hoes faker than the silicone in these boobs
Man, fuck a red carpet, gimme my just due
'Cause my numbers don't lie, but the industry do!

Spendin' so much time talkin' crazy 'bout
Somethin' y'all hoes don't know shit about
Livin' out your life on the Internet
While I spend my time gettin' to the checks!

Talk to God about me
How you feel about me
Look Him in His eyes
Ask Him why I'm fly
Talk to God about me
How you feel inside
Let him confirm those lies
Ask him why, oh why, why, oh why?

Bet you wanna see the tears fall
From my eyes
Ain't my doin', it ain't my fault
Talk to God
Talk to God
God!

Why you mad, with ya ugly ass starting something?
I slick my baby hairs down, so I ain't stressing nothing
Always tryin' to make me be the girl that I used to be
I done outdid all dem' hoes you seen on TV with me!
Throwin' shots when you know your chin ain't strong
Standin' taller than you bitches with no heels on
They make it hard when you do this at this level
I put in time to spend that million on that bezel!

Spendin' so much time talkin' crazy 'bout
Somethin' y'all hoes don't know shit about
Livin' out your life on the Internet
While I spend my time gettin' to the checks!

All them Tweets and IG's acusing me
You will never really seen what they did to me
How you gon' like me when you don't like yourselves?
Y'all need some help, help
If this was church I would take it to the alter
A few years ago I probably woulda' faught ya
