To get up and walk away would be too easy
So stay and stand your ground just watch your mouth with me
On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming
So here you and I should tread as soft
As these razorblades for boots will let be

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

(thought!)Unabashed honesty would be ideal
But a prophet did once say, that honesty's a lonely word
So where do we go from here? Abandon ship now!
My problem is you make me melt and I don't want to be frozen anymore

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

Ooh oooh no oh no

Have you ever, have you ever tried to, I have never, I have never tried to!

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem

Ooh oooh no oh no
