Whatever you do don't forget about me
Don't forget about me, don't forget about me
I want more adventure
I've been bored forever my dear
This town drags me under
There's just nothing left for me here
Drew blood in rebellion
I'm no longer welcome alright
It's both middle fingers
It's my revolution tonight
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
I'm leaving don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leaving, I'm leaving here (I'm leaving)
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here i'm gonna have a good time
Feels good starting over
Why don't you come with me believe
You'd be good for something
I'll be Thelma, you be Louise
Either way I just can't stay here
New day, different players I know
I'll walk if I have to
Goodbye it's time for me to get the hell out
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
I'm leaving don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leaving, I'm leaving here (I'm leaving)
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here i'm gonna have a good time
What ever you do just don't forget about me
What ever you do just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Bringing me into the future
I wanna be tight
Don't loosen me up with a mesopotamian life
Like I love you to death but I want you to know that you're wrong
Wherever the wild ones are going is where we belong
And even if everyone waves us, and money enslaves us
I know we will go hard to the end, like Magellen behaves us
And even if nothing can save us, well I still prefer brave us
Let's work till they the grave us
No limit to where this fire can take us
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
I'm leaving don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leaving, I'm leaving here (I'm leaving)
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not taking, no suitcase
Anywhere but here I'm gonna have a good time
Whatever you do just do just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
