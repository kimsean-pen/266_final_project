If we tear the clock in half
Would the hands tuck behind your back?

I know you know
If I leave you alone
When you don't feel right
I know we'll sink for sure
I'll play your game once more
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right

Sweetheart, listen
Make up your mind
What if it helps you sleep
In the night?
Pieces fold in back together
That's a sheet
You shave at parts of me I must erase

Cause I know you know
I know
If I leave you alone
When you don't feel right
I know we'll sink for sure
I'll play your game once more
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right

If you don't feel right
