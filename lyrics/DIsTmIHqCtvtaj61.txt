It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow and the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried and I saw a light
And I wondered where and I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead and they're drunk again
By the tavern door
And a baby cried and I saw a light
And I wondered where and I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway
