Headed west now
From the blighted plain
It's kind of gorgeous in a georgic way
Staring outside
Watching every change

I think it's just a type of way to explain
How I miss you
How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing Lichtensteins with my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out
Cause the world's not right
At this time

At the drive-thru
With the headlights on
And now I'm feeling like I'm Roquentin
In a streetcar
Near Corrine Marchand
I'll go Michel Legrand and set it to song

How I miss you
How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing Lichtensteins with my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out

Back in New York
In the August sun
Wandering Greenpoint
While the L still runs
And I run back
To a different day
In the meantime
You can dance, you can hit replay
