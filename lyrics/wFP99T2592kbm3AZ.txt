Oh god
I already forgot your name
But a name's just a string of letters
Put together - so clever

Oh god
I thought that I've forgotten your name
It's upsetting
But the setting won't change
We're never gonna be the same

If you look, everybody here's trying on new faces
And the ones that fit are surprisingly contagious
With a shiny new beginning
We cordially invite you so into the dressing room
Into the dressing room
Into the dressing room

Oh god
It seems that I misplaced your secret
But I can see what it does, how it lights you up

Oh god
This season has seen better days
Keep it steady 'cause you're losing the place
We're never gonna be the same

If you look, everybody here's trying on new faces
And the ones that fit are surprisingly contagious
With a shiny new beginning
We cordially invite you so into the dressing room
Into the dressing room
Into the dressing room

Don't spill your guts 'cause that's
a mess that no one wants to clean up
Is that enough? My heart is stuck? This feeling's breaking me up...
Don't spill your guts 'cause that's
