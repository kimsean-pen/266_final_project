I, I never would hurt you
But even if I did you
You never would tell me
Ooh, we are finished
As of a long time ago
As of a long time ago
But let's stop

I don't enjoy you anymore
Well I guess I just don't enjoy you anymore
Well I guess it's all laid out in black and white
You don't like it at all

Love, love is the answer
To the question
But thanks for
All the suggestions
I know I don't care at all
Yea, I know I don't know anything at all
But let's stop

I don't enjoy you anymore
Well I guess I just don't enjoy you anymore
Well I guess it's all laid out in black and white
You don't like it at all
You don't like it at all
You don't like it at all
