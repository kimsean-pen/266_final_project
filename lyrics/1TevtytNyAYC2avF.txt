It was the heat of the night I think
Or it could've been the effect of the drink
But I had to brush away the flies
That started to collect around your eyes
I've still the taste of the sweat and the dust
You're still playing games and abusing my trust

In the heat of the night, in the glow of the light
It's the back and the bite, that's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego, do you need them for sex?

In the heat of the night, in the glow of the light
It's the back and the bite, that's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego, do you need them for sex?

It was a bite of a night gone wrong
And the effect of listening to negative songs
Stuck in a love scene from blood and sand
And the way the room keeps spinning around
Now I know what they mean by looks can kill
And they're having a strange effect on the way I feel

In the heat of the night, in the glow of the light
It's the back and the bite, that's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego, do you need them for sex?

In the heat of the night, in the glow of the light
It's the back and the bite, that's feeling alright
Do you use up bodies like cigarettes
Do you need them for ego, do you need them for sex?

Oh, and you're moaning about your wasted life
Lying there listening to "Spanish Eyes"
With the cups on the floor, and the plates in the sink
And the room full of smoke, and then you full of drink

You skin's going dry and the color of sand
Ignore the cigarette burning your hand
You skin's going dry and the color of sand
Ignore the cigarette burning your hand

Now I know what they mean by looks can kill
And they're having a strange effect on the way I feel
Now I know what they mean by looks can kill
And they're having a strange effect on the way I
On the way I, on the way I feel

Now I know, now I know what they mean
Now I know what they mean by
By looks can, by looks can kill, kill

Now I know, now I know what they mean by looks can kill
