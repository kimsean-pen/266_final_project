Hey vanity, this vial's empty
So are you
Hey glamorous this vial's not God
Anymore, yeah

Speak! (speak)
I don't get it,
Should I ignore the fashion
Or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back, oh
Coming back around the fur

Prostitute climb back down from the floor
Please don't fuck around and die like this
'Cause I love her

Speak! (speak)
I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion
Or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back, oh
Coming back around the fur

Speak! (speak)
We're so sad you're bad
I don't want to get dressed over anyway
Come on
Testify
I'm here to say
Don't want your fad, come on
You're a liar, you're a liar
I don't care about
Yeah!
Yeah!
