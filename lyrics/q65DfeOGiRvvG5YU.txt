Another circumstance to blame
We're all reluctantly engaged
Fending off the less
Desirable embraces
Slashing so weakly
So close to exhaustion
But hopelessly holding our breath

Upped and upped, a humanizing way
But you can't feel happy every day
Cease and desist all the things that you insist
To be in a complete state of consciousness
Is completely intolerable

Come up at will
Sleepwalkers out
Of the Zodiac
Retake your form
From the solemn days
Focusing on
The task at hand

You're an impossibility
Fading into obscurity
We have the facilities at our disposal
Ask me at the lowest swing of the pendulum
While hopefully holding our breath

Come up at will
Sleepwalkers out
Of the Zodiac
Retake your form
From the solemn days
Focusing on
The task at hand
