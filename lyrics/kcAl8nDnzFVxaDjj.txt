All night, straight ahead at the headlights
Scream at me baby, yellin' like I ruined your life
All night with my back against the wall
Push me, push me, I'll never fall

Baby
This mistrust is contagious
I'm going crazy
Lookin' for somethin' to save us

You can try and bend my heart, but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far, but I won't break

Disappear in the middle of the night
Shame, baby, when it's good, it's so right
I'm tired of it, now, start buildin' all these walls
Hitch 'em now hitch it, then we fall off, oh

Baby
This mistrust is contagious
I'm going crazy
Lookin' for somethin' to save us

You can try and bend my heart, but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far, but I won't break

You hold on to my heart so hard
And I just follow, just spin me around
You fill me up with fear so far
That I can't swallow, I can't make a sound

You can try and bend my heart, but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far, but I won't break
You can try and bend my heart, but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far, but I won't break
