The wind carries us home
Tin cans, recycled air, end the minstrels' roam
Reunite body and mind
The walls left broken and crumbling
But oh, what did you expect, gone for seasons at a time
I've closed my eyes to dream
Woken to have only lost the spring
To bags, cases, and hearts on our sleeves
We held them high so we could watch them bleed
Held them high so you could watch them bleed
Held them high so they could watch them bleed

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed

From up here the land, a patchwork quilt
Sewn together by arthritic hands
Pursuit of passion, persistent guilt
Anxious for loving embrace

Dissolve this ache I've felt
Dissolve this ache I've felt

How could you have looked and seen anything but compassion?
Left to watch alone, jealous of false attentions
You'd felt it in my touch, tasted it in my kiss
And still, darling, you screamed my affections were passionless

Despite every example of devotion, every memory made
You still succumbed to boredom, you let the pictures fade
You let the pictures fade
You let the pictures fade

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Oh

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
