What does that mean, I never give you anything?
I gave you a car, I gave you a diamond ring
That wasn't enough, is that what you're telling me?
What's the definition of love if it isn't material things?
Material things

I love automobiles, when drivin' fast my hair blows
In the wind, in the wind
On your car stereo, I'll choose a song
But we disagree no matter what, we disagree

You won't let me
You won't let me win
You won't let me in

Second guess me
You should have a look at yourself instead
Your morals are all backwards, my friend

Oh, oh, oh, oh

This afternoon, while we watched a movie
You wanted to be makin' out instead
All you can do is pleasure and money
The way you view the world is twisted

You never told me that you were as cold as ice
You never told me that you were as cold as ice
We travelled down this road once or twice
Silver or gold will make our love right

Oh, oh, oh, oh

What does that mean, I never give you anything?
I gave you a car, I gave you a diamond ring
What's the definition of love if it isn't material things?
