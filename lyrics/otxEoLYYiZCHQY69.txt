I used to crystal up my dreams
As a teen in my bedroom scene
Playin' the poser
For posers to fanatic like L.A. locusts
My quest, tempestuous, euphonious
Plannin' bombing scripts, turnin' the chips
Flex statuesque

Make record sales spread around like acne
Takin' over like the hover
Uncanny abilities rocking your wig piece
Days of playing air guitar
Now your staring so far at crowds
Open and scoping to a superstar

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Between Scylia and Charybdis
Boredom versus debris
Daily routines make moods vary like parking meters
Feeling hollow like empty bottles
In pieces like jigsaw puzzles

Lack of purpose
Like winos in disillusionment guzzle
When problems operate like vortex on brain cortex
Music could be more sex than porno flicks
With chicks can pack discontinuity
Audience see is attraction
Like a magnet to mic and amp it constantly

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello

Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello

Last city with the baddest ditties got the crowds giddy
This kitty got with me
Swivvy and drippy at the after party
In any land I'm getting more grace than Presley
From legions bigger than hooligans from Chelsea

My voice is considered golden like my Dame Shirley Bassey
My doses attack like tuberculosis from here to Tallahassee
Adrenaline got me spinning in bed reminiscin' at the Marriot
Never end the night period

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand

Built me up to destroy again
You healed me once from the void again
Beyond limits is my action radius
Need your love to feel the poise and stand
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
Hey hello
You all stop and use your head
