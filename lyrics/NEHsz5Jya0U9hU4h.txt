You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna, makes me wanna
Although my heart is closed, my eyes are opened wide
Looking for that magic song to keep me warm inside
I've been so long alone, a wall around my heart
Waiting for that someone
I've been knocked down and out time and time again
So many fools in love who only bring the pain
So many times I thought I'd always be alone
But you're that special someone, someone
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna, makes me wanna

You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna

Wanna give, give it
Makes me wanna give it
Wanna give, give it
Makes me wanna give it

Wanna give, give it
Wanna give, give it
Wanna give, give it

You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna, makes me wanna

You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna give it
You're the special soul who makes me wanna, makes me wanna give it
