Honey, I was so damn blind
Let you in, control my mind
Although I was insane
It's only me to blame

I don't talk about you no more
I don't talk about you anymore

But I still think about you all the time
And I still have you right here on my mind

Tried a trivial disguise
You really weren't the keeping kind
Although I wasn't me
The lives were all so sweet

I don't talk about you no more
I don't talk about you anymore
But I still think about you all the time
And I still have you right here on my mind

And I still think about you all the time
(I don't talk about you no more)
And I still have you right here on my mind
(I don't talk about you no more)

Aah ah
Aah ah
Aah ah

But I still think about you all the
And I still have you right here on my mind
And I still think about you all the time
(I don't talk about you no more)
And I still have you right here on my mind

I don't talk about you no more
I don't talk about you no more
I don't talk about you anymore
I don't talk about you no more
