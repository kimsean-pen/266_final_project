Here in the house
Time is sweet
I hear the children playing in the street
Out where the hot winds blowing gentle breeze

I don't need time
I don't need time
No, I can get by myself

I don't need time
I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell

I scramble online
And I know that I will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the mean time by myself

He's a real winner
Probable to say
Sleeping in a lazy afternoon
A danger to their daughters they assume

I don't need time
I don't need time
No, I can get by myself

I don't need time
I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell

I scramble online
And I know that I will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the mean time by myself

Deal me a crippling blow
Steal me, remember my glow
A crippling blow

I don't need time
I don't need time
No, I can get by myself

I don't need time
I don't know why
The summer wind did not tell

I scramble online
And I know that I will never be calm and well
But I can get by in the mean time by myself
Lord, I can get by in the mean time by myself

Well, I can get by in the mean time by myself
