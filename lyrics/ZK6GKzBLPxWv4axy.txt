In a dream, I was untrue
shot up in sweats and i knew it was you
all the while as i traced her spine
you tore up my head, through my peace of mind

if you breathe in, then I breathe in
and slowly let go
if you need it, then i need it
and only we'll know

Can't be the same as we lie in the light
knowing full well, your virtue's my vice
in the night we are one
till the moment is gone
till my race has been run

If you breathe in, then I breathe in
and slowly let go
if you need it, then i need it
and only we'll know

Your sorry words need not know my mind
so refrain from use

Of you breathe in, then I breathe in
and only we'll know
