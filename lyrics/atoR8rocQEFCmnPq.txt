Shadows dance around me as I race alone
I will never rest until she's in my arms
So close and yet so far away
A simple kiss to bring her back, to make this story end

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem
Come and claim your queen, come and claim your queen
Come and claim your queen, come and claim your queen

The wild beasts are ravenous
They will soon devour you
Dark howls echo bitter cries
But they fall upon deaf ears

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem
Come and claim your queen

You're pathetic, what good do you do
She had faith in me, I was her only escape
A most deep and subtle poison
Welcomes her unblinking eyes to eternal sleep

If I had shown, she would be mine
Who is the fairest of all?
Tell me again, tell me again, you know its me
A simple kiss to bring her back, to make this story end

Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true
He's not quite as charming as he may seem

We'll make your dreams come true
We'll make your dreams come true
Come and claim your queen
