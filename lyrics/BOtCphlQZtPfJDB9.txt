Listen in it isn't when you're talking for your name's sake
Jesus, Mary Magdalene you are, are you okay?
Sitting by the well, Jill, your falling down the hill, Jack
And everybody laughed, Don't you pray? Don't you pray?

To a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater,
got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more, than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

High as hell, feeling fine, nothing bad but nothing kind
Not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind
In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes
Feeling fine, coming down, never back cause we're never out
You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine
In my head, in my head, I get lonely sometimes
When you find an old picture of us, and you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me, would you remember the times,
oh the times that we believed
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater,
got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more, than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

I'm nothing more than a page unwritten on the pavement, blowing in the wind
You win a lot, and lose just a little bit more than you gained in the end
God, I wish that I, was better than I am, but no luck, no love, no Gospel I could understand
I'm nothing that ever wanted to lean on, yea, but even then
When you find an old picture of us, and you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me, would you remember the times,
oh the times that we believed
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater,
got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day, today
I'm just a page unwritten on the pavement, you needed 'til you left
But I'm more than a need or a thing you believe or a word that you leave unsaid
