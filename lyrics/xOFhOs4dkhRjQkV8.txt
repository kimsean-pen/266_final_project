I have something I'm afraid of
The answer to my problems
The reason to not be fucked up anymore
The truth is I don't want to change
I guess I'm happy with my damaged ways
I hate the water but I like the sound when the ice breaks

We are the common folk
We live our lives to die alone
Share our beds when the nights get cold

All I wanted was to be someone
I don't want no empty seats
When they lower me down
And when the camera lights go out

Nicotine sweats and coffee breath
I thought I was so much more than this
When I look back at everything I've touched
I see the lives I've ruined, dirty fingerprints

We are the common folk
We live our lives to die alone
Share our beds when the nights get cold

All I wanted was to be someone
I don't want no empty seats
When they lower me down
When the camera lights go out

We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir
We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir
We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir
We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir
We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir

All I wanted was to be someone
I don't want no empty seats
When they lower me down
(We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir)
(We can't sleep, we can't dream
We are miming in the choir)

I have something I'm afraid of
