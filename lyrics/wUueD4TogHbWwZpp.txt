Talk to strangers
Wonder the woods in the light
Walk the wire
And let it so right

Live in the face clef
Better damager stake your life
Push your luck or let you lie

You be beware
You be beware now
You be beware
May you feel the you need
I recommend that you cross the street
I there will be fire everywhere
You don't want mess with me

Roman darkness
Don't waited your brawl wasting with us
And Come winter
Go on and trappable with lights

Live in the face clef
Better damager stake your life
Push your luck or let you lie

You be beware
You be beware now
You be beware
May you feel the you need
I recommend that you cross the street
I there will be fire everywhere
You don't want to mess with me

That spark is in your I am
It can't deny it
It on your face
The burn the love the danger
No one where to save you

You be beware
You be beware now
You be beware
May you feel the you need
I recommend that you cross the street
I there will be fire everywhere
You don't want to mess with me
