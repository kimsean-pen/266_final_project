They want you to fade
Into the background
Don't stand out
All the valleys are being filled
The hills are being chopped down

Get on your knees
You know you want to
Why don't you get on your knees
Get on your knees
You know you want to

We've become the nation
Of victimization
Why can't we admit
We're hypocrites?

Nobody likes our direction
Yet we don't turn around
Now could it be, that secretly
We like being kept down?

Get on your knees
You know you want to
Why don't you get on your knees
Get on your knees
You know you want to

Tell me (Tell me)
Where does it stop? (Where does it stop?)
This tower of law, this army of cops

Why would God create
Something so weak?
Unless he
Wanted it to suffer
Wanted it to suffer

Why would God create
Something so weak?
Unless he
Wanted it to suffer
