I come to you in a blue blue room
By some abuse and some heart
You raise the blinds say, "Let's have light on life,
Let's watch it fall apart. Let's watch it fall apart."

Night time flowers, evening roses
Bless this garden that never closes
Treat her gently, treat her kind
Tenderloin will last all night

I'm feeling hungry, have another line
So faith is taken up
You raise your eyes say, "That's just like life
There's never quite enough. There's just never quite enough."

Night time flowers, evening roses
Bless this garden that never closes
Treat her gently, treat her kind
Tenderloin will last all night

I come to you in a blue blue room
By some abuse and some heart
You raise the blinds say, "Let's have light on life,
Let's watch it fall apart. Let's watch it fall apart."
