Back to summertime.
It was almost six months to the day.
Eyes clock to his hand.
Liquid crystals on his watch catch rays
of morning peeking through.
Moving the pillows out of the way.
Tries to make the time.
Falls asleep with his watch on again.

He has got
last year's summertime (the one she liked)
on daylight saving time,
Hoping that the world catch up with him
before he catches her.
It happens once a year.
She'd better run.
Was summertime for all.
Alpine retreat off the A40.

Rising out of the slopes.
Plastic snow and wooden trees surround.
She felt they had it all.
Pulling curtains over dreamy face
Sealing off the globe.
Waiting for a spark to start the fire.
