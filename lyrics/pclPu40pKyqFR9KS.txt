Xxxxxxx I have no long term plans for this body
I want to be part of you while I still can
Xxxxxxx My mouth filled up with blood
Let me be part of you while I still can

When am I coming to your school?
You know that I should see you soon
Before something takes me out of here
Or before he takes you away again

(I woke up in the library
And someone was whispering your name directly into my ear
I looked around but I couldn't find them
And when I went outside the sun was out
But soon the sky turned black
And it started to rain
My friends blame ghosts for everything)

Xxxxxxx I worry far too much and I know
That it will ruin us
Just like it ruined so many things before
Let me be part of you while i still can

When am I coming to your school?
You know that I should see you soon
'Cause soon I won't be able to
If things keep going on like this
I stare at myself in the mirror
I make my body bleed sometimes
I don't even dream anymore
Because my dreams are coming true
And I could die in your red hair
I could die in your red hair
I could die in your red hair
I could die in your red hair
