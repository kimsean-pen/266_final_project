All I want right now is the time where we slept on the floor
You said, "Right here right now is all that we're living for"
I got the velocity and all I need now is the mass
I just want you to ask

Can you take me
Into days I never knew?
Let's start a riot (I want a riot)
Let's start a riot, me and you 'cause a riot's overdue

Now these days I wonder why we're holding back on bliss
You blast from me everything you see; I just want to give you a kiss
I want the infidels' head on a pike, riding on my motorbike
Oh you and me are alike

So can you take me
Into days I never knew?
Let's start a riot (I want a riot)
Let's start a riot, me and you 'cause a riot's overdue

Let's get it bigger and wider
I'm the mega collider when I take you

Into days I never knew
Let's start a riot (I want a riot)
Let's start a riot, me and you 'cause a riot's overdue

Bust you out, I've come to bust you out
I've come to bust you out, I've come
Live in doubt, no longer live in doubt
No longer live in doubt, no
Humbly now, oh yes humbly now,
I ask for no resistance, oh no resistance
Maybe now, oh just maybe now we can bridge the distance
'Cause it's so, it's so big, big

So can you take me
Into days I never knew?
Let's start a riot, (I want a riot)
Let's start a riot, me and you 'cause a riot's overdue

Don't back down, don't compromise don't close your eyes
Here it is do or die and you still believe the lie
You still believe the lie and the world is for the meek
Yhis mouse is gonna squeak
I am dying to be freaked yes, I am dying to be freaked
