I put my head against a wall
Cause I feel like I could fall
I step outside to get some air
But I still feel you there

I think about the words you say
I can't get them off my head
Try to understand but I won't get far
Cause I don't know who we are

Vertigo
Vertigo
You give me vertigo
Vertigo
You give me
Vertigo
Vertigo
You give me
Vertigo
Vertigo
You give me
