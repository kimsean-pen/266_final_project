Baby it's candle light
By choice now
Look how far we made it,
Yeah
Talks 'bout traveling
'Round the globe now
We can hardly wait,
Yeah

But baby you ain't
Got fear of nothing
You live always in
Your time again
(time again)
But baby we've been
Working on something
And I will always
Love you till the end

So whether I'm standing
On the corner with
My heart in my hand
Or everybody is listening
To the guitar man
Whether I'm standing on
The corner with my
Heart in my hand
Or everybody is
Listening to the guitar man
I can't do it without you,
Without you
Baby, yeah, yeah

Stamps in my good book now
Baby, we've made it, yeah
I'm sorry I can't take you now
I know how much you hate it

But baby you ain't
Got fear of nothing
(you ain't got fear of nothing)
'Cause I'm drinking
With my boys again
But baby we've been
Working on something
And I will always
Love you till the end

So whether I'm standing
On the corner with my
Heart in my hand, now
Or everybody is listening
To the guitar man
(guitar man)
Whether I'm standing on
The corner with my heart
In my hand, baby, yeah
Or everybody is listening
To the guitar man
(guitar man)
I can't do it without you
(without you),
I can't do it without you
Baby, yeah, yeah

Whether I'm standing on
The corner with my heart
In my hand
(my heart baby),
Baby yeah
Or everybody is listening
To the guitar man
Whether I'm standing on
The corner with my heart
In my hand, baby, yeah
Or everybody is listening
To the guitar man
(guitar man)
I can't do it without you,
Can't do it without you
Baby, yeah

Standing on the corner
With my heart in my hand
In my hand
Standing on the corner
With my heart in my hand
Baby
And everybody is listening
To the guitar man
Without you,
Can't do it without you,
Baby yeah
Standing on the corner
With my heart in my hand
Everybody is listening
To the guitar man, now
Standing on the corner
With my heart in my hand
