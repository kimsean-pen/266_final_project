You told me you were thinking of moving some place warmer
I told you I was thinking of staying right here
My friendships grew too
My friendships moved too

Did you think twice?
Are you going to need more?
Cause I'm halfway through my twenties, and I still can't get it
At what point does it become depressing?
And at what point does it get good again?
Last summer, I went on tour with my best friends, and it didn't help me
It didn't help me get over it
Get over it
And I could walk out through the streets for hours
But I'd still end up in the same bed
Drowning with mine
