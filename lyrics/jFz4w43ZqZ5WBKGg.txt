Hey you, follow with a force-fed plastic hype.
Hey you, shallow like the rest of your empty life.
Hey you, claiming that you're real from back in the day.
Hey you, everybody knows that you're really just fake.

Set it off right with a bright light coming through.
Set it off right with a fist-fight attitude.
Set it off right with a hate you dicipline.
Set it off right when we get the truth back again.

Sinking in the silence,
Living my life through,
Running from the inside,
Suffering you.

Hey you, made it to the top going down on your knees.
Hey you shining so bright with the penniciline.
Hey you wallow in the land of luxury.
Hey you everybody knows that you're really just fake.

Set it off right with a bright light coming through.
Set it off right with a fist-fight attitude.
Set it off right with a hate you dicipline.
Set it off right when we get the truth back again.

Sinking in the silence,
Living my life through,
Running from the inside,
Suffering you.
