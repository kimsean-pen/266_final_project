I can't think about the rain
As the tears fall down your face
And the clouds won't go away
A thousand times I fell
Over and over again
But you were to lift me up
And when I couldn't stand
You were my crotch
'Cause there is nothing more special than love
'Cause what we got is more than enough
We gotta hold on no matter what

Through the rain, through the rain
Through the waves, through the fog
Through the storm
I'll be by your side, right by your side
I can't let you down, won't let you down
'Cause I'm your anchor, anchor,
Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor

Beside me, you were there to guide me
Said I could be anything
Said we can make it through anything
That closed door, that hurricane
No matter what, we still remain
'Cause we've been through worse back to this wall
When no one was there, I'm the one you can call
That's why I'm thanking god for you
'Cause I don't know what I would do without you
'Cause there is nothing more special than love
'Cause what we got is more than enough
We gotta hold on no matter what

Through the rain, through the rain
Through the waves, through the fog
Through the storm
I'll be by your side, right by your side
I can't let you down, won't let you down
'Cause I'm your anchor, anchor,
Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor

I will be there for you, for you, for you
That's what's a friend's supposed to do
For you, for you
In your darkest times I help you see
That's when you'll find your faith and love
In the middle of the storm
I will be there!

Through the rain, through the rain
Through the waves, through the fog
Through the storm
I'll be by your side, right by your side
I can't let you down, won't let you down
'Cause I'm your anchor, anchor,
Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor
