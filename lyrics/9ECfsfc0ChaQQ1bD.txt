(Dear Bobbie, do you remember
When you were young and very pretty? I do
I remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoes
Do you remember dancing that night? I do
I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then)

Do you remember when
How long has it been?
Nineteen forty five
You opened my blue eyes

To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night
That if you're by my side
When everyday begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when

I told you this that night
That I'll be fine
Cause when I die then I'll die loving you
It's alright, I'll be fine
When I die then I'll die loving you

Loving you, loving you
(Do you remember the times
We would give up on each other and get back together
Then we finally was married in nineteen forty nine

We drove the yellow convertible on our honey-moon
Do you remember? I do)
Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds twenty-thousand days

And memories we've saved
Since life has lead us here
And I'll be fine
Cause when I die then I'll die loving you
It's alright, I'll be fine

Cause when I die then I'll die loving you
Loving you, loving you
I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair

I See you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When I lay tonight
When I close my eyes

I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine
Then it's alright, I'll be fine
Cause when I die then I'll die loving you
It's alright, I'll be fine
Cause when I die then I'll die loving you
Loving you, loving you
(You have gray hair now but you're a beautiful women
And the years have been good to both of us
We walk slow now but we still have each other
The glue of love is still bonding us together
Love is what I remember, do you remember?)
