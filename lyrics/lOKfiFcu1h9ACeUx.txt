Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
He knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind

His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping up the Emerald bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone
In his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"

His boss said to him
"Now listen, boy, you're always dreaming
You got no real ambition
You won't get worried for
Sammy, boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar?"

(So, honey) Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
Come on, honey (fly with me)
