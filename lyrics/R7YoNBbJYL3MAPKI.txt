Say, say, what you wanna say, say
Tell it to me every day, day
But if you don't show me
Words, words, all they are is words, words
Stupid poetry and verse, verse
Do you even know me?

That first thing that I saw in your eyes
Did you mean, was it only lies, only lies
'Bout, 'bout, have you ever thought about
How this is supposed to go, yeah
Do, do you know? Do you? Oh

Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me

Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me

You say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand

Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, love, show me, love

Eyes, eyes, open up your eyes
Don't hide what you got inside, side
If you wanna know me
Hey, hey, I'm not gonna stay, stay
Kick it with you night and day, day
No, if you don't show me

Everything hidden in your heart
All your fears every single part
'Bout, 'bout, have you ever thought about
How this is supposed to go, yeah
Do, do, you know? Do you, oh

Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me

Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me

You say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand

Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me, show me
Show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love

Everything you got is everything you need
Everything you want is inside of me

Love is not a gimme, gimme
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me yeah, yeah

Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me

You say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand

Love is not a gimmie, gimmie
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me, show me
Show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
