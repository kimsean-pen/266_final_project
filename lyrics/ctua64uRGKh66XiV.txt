Well, there you go again, acting like it's all about you
And there you go again, acting like it's all about you
Big shot, one take, oh you, yes you

Say I'm not what you wanted
No, what you wanna do
And I love what we started, oh
What I could put you through

There you go, babe, talking, talking, talking, no clue
And there you go again talking, talking, talking, no clue
I'm onto something more than you

Say I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what you wanna do
I love what we started
No, what I could put you through

I'm [?] you, I'm [?]
We'll kill with them with kindness, baby, kill something good
If I said that I want it, baby's [?]
If I told her to [?], my baby's [?]
My baby's the songs now, my baby, you're shook

There you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
And there you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
I'm onto something more than you

Kill me with silence, I'll kill her with words
When her friends are repeating, the kills her the worst
I tell her to [?] my baby's [?]
My baby's the songs now, my baby, you're shook
I'll put you out for real

There you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
And there you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
I'm onto something more than you

Say I'm not what you wanted, no
What you wanna do?
And I love what we started, oh
And what I could put you through
And what I could put you through

And there you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
And there you go again, talking, talking, talking, no clue
I'm onto something more than you
