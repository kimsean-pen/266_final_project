La la la la la
La la la la la

I close my eyes and see you there
You're reaching out to touch me
Is it real? I don't care
I feel you near my body

And I'm watching you, watching me over my shoulder
I'll take the lead, if you dare you will follow

I'll take his hand and then his soul
So we can dance in limbo
He's in my snare, he's on the floor
'Cause all is fair in love and war
La la la la la
La la la la la

Hold on to me
Ever so tightly

And I'm kissing you kissing me, self destruction
Life is a dance, it's a game of seduction

I'll take his hand and then his soul
So we can dance in limbo
He's in my snare, he's on the floor
'Cause all is fair in love and war
La la la la la
