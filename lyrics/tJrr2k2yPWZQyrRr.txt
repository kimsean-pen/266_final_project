It's like asking me
Why don't you
stop looking my way
If you can see me
With your eyes shut anyway?
You run around and
walk along If I walk away
Feel like a child
Lean in and ask you
how to play
Been working hard
Holding back,
putting away
Every perverted things
I've thought of saying
To you, to you, to you you
Instead i am
Asking why don't
we go Mingle with the people?
Cause I don't need
I don't need
I, i, i don't need
To lean on you,
no Even though
That's what
other people do
It's effective though
I haven't gone as far
As swimming in the
poison that we are
It's impossible
as always to forget
Something that hasn't
happened yet
Not yet, not yet
Meanwhile why don't
we go Mingle with the people?
Cause I don't need
I don't need
I, i, i, don't need
To lean on you
no Even though
That's what other people do.
