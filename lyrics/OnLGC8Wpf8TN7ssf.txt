I built a ship with my own hands
to take us to the moon
I took a pen in my own hand
and wrote you a hundred tunes

Now I'm crazy for you but not that crazy
I'm crazy for you but not that crazy.

I pretended you were Jesus
you were just dying to save me
I stood beneath your window
with my ukulele
I made my yard a playground
just in case we had a baby

Now I'm crazy for you but not that crazy
I'm crazy for you but not that crazy.

I treated you like radium
I treated you like God
You were my glass menagerie
Did you not find that odd
I dwelt within and went without
and broke my virgin flesh
I performed acts of devotion
as if you were Ganesh, but

Now I'm crazy for you but not that crazy
I'm crazy for you but not that crazy.
