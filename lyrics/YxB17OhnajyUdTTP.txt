Bending blades on the longest of days
you've encountered in an ice age
keeping time with an old sun
beating down like it's the last one
aren't you so privileged to witness it fall
your observation makes your twice as small

in a day, cut a tall tree in two
build it high in the back by your self
burn it in the afternoon
aren't you so privileged to witness it fall
if you for one moment were moved by it all
but if you're not caught in the moment I won't mind
I won't set my expectations high where they should be
what a slippery slope to climb
when I find my feet I would soon retreat to a tower made of ivory
where I'd contemplate the mess I've made and take comfort in the temporary
