I'm just a pissed off kid from a town that nobody really cares about
And yet I feel like I've got something to say
But when is it enough?
I can't seem to give it up
You find no comfort in the words I say

So we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done

No, it's too much
Put your whole life in a melody and watch it be judged
And I sit there, stare at the mirror and I think like
Ooh, you could never love me
You just love, talking about me
It's because, you were never enough
No no, you were never enough

So hey
You think I care about the shit you say?
You think I sit at home and let it get to me?
Fuck that, I would never run back, I just set the pace
And I bet it kills you that you're not me

So wake up
I can bring your whole world down
And what are you gonna do?
When you can't get away
And they all scream my name
And no one remembers you

No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done

I've got bad luck, and who gives a fuck?
Sick of the pressure you put on my brain, it's enough
What, you think I won't fight back?
You ain't gonna like that
Better watch the words that you say

'Cause with you there comes pain
We'll never be the same
And I don't wanna feel that way
But that's how you left me
And that's how you left me

So wake up, I can bring your whole world down
And what are you gonna do?
When you can't get away
And they all scream my name
And no one remembers you

So don't say, that you never saw this coming
And what are you gonna do?
When you can't get away
And they all scream my name
And no one remembers you
When no one remembers you

So we're done, you could never fix that
All the years, count 'em, we will never get back
It's too long
So we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done

Gonna have to face it
Fucking decade of my life that you wasted
It's too long
So we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done

No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
No, we're done
