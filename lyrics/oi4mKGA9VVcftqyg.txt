Everybody's talking about
You and her together
How could you do that to me

And everybody's talking all the things
You do with her
Like you used to with me

Can you tell
By the look on my face
I still like you that way
Now I can hardly remember why
We ever lost ties
But I can tell
That I love you
I still love you

Long as I live
I'll never get over
Its killing me
I'll never get over

If you can't be with the you really truly love
Don't lose it
With the one you're with

Everybody's talking about
You and her together
How could you to do that to me
Everybody's talking
Everybody's going on about her
Like you used to do with me

I can tell
By the look on your face
You really like her that way
And now I'm trying not to lose my mind
And start crying
But I can tell
That you love her
Really love her

Long as I live
I'll never get over
It's killing me
I'll never get over

Long as I live
I'll never get over
It's killing me
I'll never get over

If you can't be with the one you love
It's okay

Cause if you can't be
With the one you really truly love
Don't lose it
With the one you're with

Long as I live
I'll never get over
It's killing me
I'll never get over

Long as I live
I'll never get over
It's killing me
I'll never get over
