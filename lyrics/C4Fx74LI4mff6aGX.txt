That's a pill and you've got to take it
That's a pill that you've got to take
I won't rest until you take it
That's a heart that you made
That's a heart and the both of you made it
And I won't rest until I break it
It's 'histroic de la famile
It's l'histroic de la femme
And I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
I won't rest until I forget about it
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
That's a razor and you will make a threat
That's a razor make million billion threats
And I won't rest 'cause I heard it all before
My behind is a beehive, there's a buzz in my backside
My behind is a beehive, and I won't rest
while you break my will
Je t'aime the valley
Je t'aime the valley, oh
I am an orphan de la valley
And I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
