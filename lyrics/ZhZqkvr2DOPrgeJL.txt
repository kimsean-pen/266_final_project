I saw you there, just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming, yeah
I kissed you then, then once again
You said, you would come and dance with me

Dance with me, across the sea
And we could feel the motion of a thousand dreams

Doctor, doctor, can't you see, I'm burning, burning?
Oh, doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling?

Ships at night give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please don't go, no please don't go
'Cause I don't want to stay here on my own
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Doctor, doctor, can't you see, I'm burning, burning?
Oh, doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling?
Doctor, doctor, can't you see, I'm burning, burning?
Oh, doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling?

Fever breathe your love on me
(Breathe your love)
Take away my name
(Take away)
Fever lay your hands on me
(Breathe your love)
Never be the same

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doctor, doctor, can't you see, I'm burning, burning?
Oh, doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling?
Doctor, doctor, can't you see, I'm burning, burning?
Oh, doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling?

Come with me and make believe
We can travel to eternity
