Parched, cracked mouths, empty swollen guts
Sun baked pavement encroaches on us
Haves and have-not together at last
Brutally engaged in mortal combat
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010

What kind of God orchestrates such a thing?
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010
Ten billion people all suffering
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010

Truth is not an issue just hungry mouths to feed
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010
Forget what you want, scrounge the things you need
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010

Ten in 2010
Ten in 2010

Happy and content it can't happen to you
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010
Fifteen years we'll think of a solution
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010

It won't just appear in one day
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010
For ten in twenty-ten we're well on our way
Ten in 2010, ten in 2010

Ten in 2010
Ten in 2010

Like piercing ear darts, I heard the news today
10 billion people coming your way
Ten in 20, ten in 20
Ten in 2010
