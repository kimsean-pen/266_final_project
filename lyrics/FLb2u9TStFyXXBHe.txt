Here's my body, I am undone
Let them have me, let them come
Blue beaks aching, flesh forsake me
Holy bones for the hunter's gun

Load me heavy, I can't bend
Break me better so I won't mend
The forest meadow's careful creatures
She'll be gone when the master comes

They heard my howls from amongst the answers
Sneaking on, the silent shots are crumpled in my chest

Let's undress, I don't want you to heal me
Rather take this broke machine
Hold me close, this beast I've burdened
I can't sing in the morning light

I'll be here when you can't breathe
Waiting patient, silently
