I'll dry my eyes
for tonight
No more tears, no more sorrow
And I'll cry again tomorrow night
because I need you so
Those tears I cry, for you
are tears of lonliness
On bending knees, I come to you
Because I need you so
Why, why must we break up
Why can't we make up
My heart, my heart is still on fire
Just lately I found, you don't want me 'round
and I, I still need your love
and I'll, I'll dry my eyes
for tonight
And no more, no more tears
and no more sorrow
And I'll cry again tomorrow night
Because I need you so
