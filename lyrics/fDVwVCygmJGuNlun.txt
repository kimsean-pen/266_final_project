Honor me Chaldean priests
Bow to me in adoration
Evangelize prophets of the boundless joy
Sanctify the sin of indulgence

We worship the sun
We worship the moon
Spreading like rats
Exalted above the stars of God

All hail slain and risen God
All hail Dionysus
All hail slain and risen God
All hail Dionysus

Come blessed Dionysus, various nam'd, bull fac'd
Begot from thunder, Bacchus fam'd
Bassarian God, of universal might
Whom swords and blood and sacred rage delight

War be sustained, my godless phoenix rise
Ne'er to lifeless shall I submit
Offering solely the sword not peace
Mercy and cowardice extinct within

We worship the sun
We worship the moon
Spreading like rats
Exalted above the stars of God

All hail slain and risen God
All hail Dionysus
All hail slain and risen God
All hail Dionysus
