All the wrath and all the faith
I have inside is eating me alive

Most tend to put their dreams aside
To get them through the day
But my eyes are open
And I see the sky

And I am infinite
I continue on
I will never fear the unknown
And I am infinite
I can continue on

Limitless and unbreakable
The wavering wishes of man are but a whimper
Now stand up high to come and live forever with me
Now stand up high to come and live forever with me

All hope is not lost
All hope is not lost

Some things seem so far away
To a half-hearted and broken youth
Terrified of the outside
And everything

It's just within your reach

Everything is just within your reach
Everything is just within your reach
