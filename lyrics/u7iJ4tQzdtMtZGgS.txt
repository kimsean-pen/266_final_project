I'm sinkin inside
And the mass in lines are broken down tonight
I swallow my pride
But we're drowning in the ocean

And it's tearing my heart open baby
We're high then we're low. first it's yes then it's no and we're changing like the tides
But I want you, I need you and I guarantee you we'll make out alive
(Pre-)

'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we said we've had enough

And I don't wanna fight this war
But it's comin off my lips
But we're still doing guns and make love like battleships

Like battleships
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom

Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom

And the cannon goes
Bombs fly through the air
And I know that we're both playing not so fair
So show me you care

Got my white flag open, it's waving

'Cause you know this love's worth saving baby
We're high then we're low first it's yes then it's no and we're changing like the tides

But I want you, I need you and I guarantee you we'll make out alive
(Pre-)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more

Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we said we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
But it's comin off my lips
But we're still doing guns and make love like battleships
Like battleships
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And we love, yea love
(Boom boom boom b-boom)
And we love, yea love
(Boom boom boom b-boom)
I'm sinkin inside
'Cause we've finally put our weapons down tonight
(Pre-)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we said we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
But it's comin off my lips
But we're still doing guns and make love like battleships
Like battleships
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
We make love like battleships
