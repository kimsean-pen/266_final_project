I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
It's like there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true when there's something to do

Me ni mai yo
Kurakura sekai ah kaki nuki
Dzudema watashi wa daydream
Yumi meteru
Look out the window madonoso to
Watching the world go by, goodbye!

Minai doko ka imu ka teru
Domo kami ga
Dancing in the wind
Ko yu doki ni omō n ga
Ikite to hontoni yo kata
Syer washi chi bu ni nari unda
Koro de ike ga suru nda
I've got a smile on my face
'Cause now I'm taking a break

Nani mo shi ny
Kono chi kan
Ma t yu kono chi kan
Desu ni kurai ikita kete
Let's slow down

I know it's seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
It's like there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true when there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
Now get down and put up your feet
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
If you like to lounge, relax or flop
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)

Sora awu miage iu n ma n-getsu
Hoshite go n'na ne keirena nda
Ko yu doki ni omō nda
Iki deru te fushi chi
Life is a race, that's what they say
So time out and look around
Tachidomaru to ni ie tsukuru
I see it now
Take a break!

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
It's like there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true when there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
Now get down and put up your feet
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
If you like to lounge, relax or flop
(Ayo, ay ay yo oh)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat
(Ayo, ayo)
