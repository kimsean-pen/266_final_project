I started thinking if I wasn't away
I couldn't picked up by the signs that slip through our conversation
This is a part of my life that I'd like to ignore
Till I'm ready to face it

It started with the tremble in your voice giving you away
How could you think that I would still carry you over
There is this storm coming in and I'm underprepared
I give you nothing to stop it

Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies

Take apart the things you said to him that made this seem alright
Poison in your mind that all of the strength that your body cant fight
Take apart the things you said to him that made this seem alright
Poison in your mind that all of the strength that your body cant fight

Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies

Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
Was it hard living with your lies
