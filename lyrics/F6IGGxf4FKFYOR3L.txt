she comes in like an angel
and goes down like these flats
i don't know why she does all this
it's making her see that
i don't want you always
and i won't hold your hand
i won't give you flowers
i just wanna sleep with you
i just want to sleep with you
i just want to sleep with you
i got my own morals
you've got your own too
lovers will just steal your clothes
but i'm not one of them
forgive me
i just didn't want to run away with you
there's romance or so she says
i wanna sleep with you
i just want to sleep with you
i just want to sleep with you
i wanna sleep with you
i didn't want to fade in you
i make my own scenes
these go-go girls are happening
they're just like accidents
he's got sunglasses electric shoes
this vicious dog and i shake
a uniform in black and blue
he wants to be your guard
i just want to sleep with you
i just want to sleep with you now
