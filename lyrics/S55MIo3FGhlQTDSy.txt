I knew that I could love you
When you and I look away

I see
Your eyes on me

I know sometimes it's hard
And nothing seems right

I know when you look away
You're trying to find peace of mind

All the people sleep

May I wake up to
Only you and I

See the sunrise

...
To the place where you and I

Lie
I knew that I would find you
Our two roads they lead the same way

To the same place
Sometimes I hold my hand out into the rain

It's a feelin' that I can't explain
I found

Peace of mind

Because you're mine

Because you're mine

...
Hold me closely

May I wake up to
Only you and I

See the sunrise

...
The place where you and I

Lie
...
Only you and I
See the sunrise
Only you and I
Only you and I
Only you and I
See the sunrise
Only you and I
Only you and I
Only you and I
See the sunrise
Only you and I
See the sunrise
Only you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
