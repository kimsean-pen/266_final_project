We are the pain.
We are the shame.
We've gone insane,
Inside where no one's around.
I am to blame,
For everything.
I like this game,
That you all make me play.

I'm done being there for others,
They have their pain and so do I.
Don't need to feel it all over,
I try to hold on and you bring me down.

We are estranged.
We are deranged.
I can't explain,
How you all break me apart.
I am to blame,
For everything.
I like this game,
That you all make me play.

I'm done being there for others,
They have their pain and so do I.
Don't need to feel it all over,
I try to hold on and you bring me down.

We wait, we hate,
We try to get away.
Mistake, my pain,
It has been lead astray.
I'm looking around,
I drop to the ground,
Why does it have to end this way?
Feeling numb so long,
Oh God it's just everything.
It's everything,
Now I pray for all of them to go away.

I'm done being there for others,
They have their pain and so do I.
Don't need to feel it all over,
I try to hold on and you bring me down.
