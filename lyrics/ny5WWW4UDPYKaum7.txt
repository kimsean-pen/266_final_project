Where it's leading, no one is believing
and they say it's only talk.
And where we're going, only we can know it.
All we gotta do is start.

Oh we were dreamers, nothing got between us.
We were never alone.
Stargazers, everything amazed us.
We're forever at home.

Didn't have rules, 'cause they never felt true.
Couldn't pick up on the cause.
Lived our own way, free and easy most days,
happiest to roam.

Oh we were dreamers, nothing got between us.
We were never alone.
Stargazers, everything amazed us.
We're forever at home.

Oh we were dreamers, nothing got between us.
We were never alone.
We were stargazers, everything amazed us.
We're forever at home.

In the winter, slowly brunin' embers,
floating high above
from the bright lights, to the dark nights
always on the run.

We kept the world out and we let it slow down
and reveled in the calm.
Didn't pay mind to the rest of mankind,
Didn't bother us at all.

Oh we were dreamers, nothing got between us.
We were never alone.
Stargazers, everything amazed us.
We're forever at home.

Oh we were dreamers, nothing got between us.
We were never alone.
We were stargazers, everything amazed us.
We're forever at home.

Aaaaah, dream it all away.
Dream it all away.
