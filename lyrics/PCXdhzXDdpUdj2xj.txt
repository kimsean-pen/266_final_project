In time you'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings

Craft it to how you see fit
Recognize powers you hold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings

I swear by the blood I have shed

In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been

To achieve the victory
Is to set yourselves free
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings

I swear by the blood I have shed

In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have

Burning, burning, faster, faster are your revolutionists
If I could collapse the masses
We'd be free to grow our wings

In time you'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings

I swear by the blood I have shed

In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have
To set yourself free
