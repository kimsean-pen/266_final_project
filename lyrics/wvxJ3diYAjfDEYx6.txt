I see them coming with shrouds to bury us all
Before we were, before we were born they shaped our lives
Leading us into an unmarked grave
In moments, moments life could end so I will speak
I will speak while I can

This is my chance
My time to stand (this is my)
This is my chance (this is my)
My time to stand (this is my)
This is my chance (this is my)
My time to stand

We may fail alone but that is better
Than dying with them only to be forgotten
I for one would rather suffer now
Than leave this life without passion

This is our chance
Our time to stand (this is our)
This is our chance (this is our)
Our time to stand (this is our)
This is our chance (this is our)
Our time to stand
