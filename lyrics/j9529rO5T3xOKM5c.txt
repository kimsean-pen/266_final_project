It's you I love and not another
And I know our love will last forever
You I love and not another
And I know we'll always be together

Some men have one love
Two and three love
Four and five and six love
But I believe in one love
I believe in one love

Some men don't feel secure
Unless they have a woman on each arm
They have to play the field, prove they have charm
They say don't lay your eggs in one basket
If the basket should fall all your eggs will be broken

But I believe in one love
I believe in one love
Oh girl I believe in one love
I believe in one love, oh girl

Hey baby

It's not that everyday you find the woman of your dreams
We will always be there no matter how bad things seems
Ever so faithful ever so sure
No man could ever ask for more

I believe in one love
I believe in one love, oh girl
I believe in one love
I believe girl, oh yeah, oh yeah

In one love, in one love
In one love, in one love
I believe, I believe
I believe in one love

I believe in one love, yeah
I believe in one love
In one love
