Come baby, come close to me
Let me love you
Come baby, come close to me
Let me feel you

Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other

Look at each other

Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other

Go away
Go away

Go away

Go away
Well, mutually, mentally
Molested children of a mother
Mutually, mentally

Molested children of sin
Oh no, the ever so popular

Beating that took you under
Oh no, the ever so popular
Beating that broke your skin

Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame, hate, for fate's seed
Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Oh, you need the ones you love
Love the ones you need
Need the ones you love
And love the ones you bleed
Lives rearranged and lives in my range
Can you see?
Lives rearranged and lives in my range
Can you see?
Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame, hate, for fate's, seed
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die
Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
