Drop dead cynical

I need attention, feed my addiction
I want the action, the satisfaction
You have to feed me worse that I inquire
So my discord someday takes me higher

I hope to thrill you that expectations rise
I want to bring you so that you can compromise
I'm coming at you like a killer now
so it's the truth you are drop dead cynical

Welcome to the new world
Open up the gates of paradise
So let's get cynical
Run into a new maze
Open up your minds
and soon we'll all
Be drop dead cynical

Be drop dead cynical

It's your illusions, fatal contradiction
I need the action premonition
I like to thrill you, I am what inspires
Let you explode in a cosmic fire

your death counts as a light that feels right
To die so sadly as the red behind the sun
You make it hard to justify now
Say what you want you are drop dead cynical

Welcome to the new world
Open up the gates of paradise
So let's get cynical
Run into a new maze
Open up your minds
and soon we'll all
Be drop dead cynical

Be drop dead cynical

Be drop dead cynical

(Drop dead cynical)

(Drop dead cynical)

I hope to thrill you that expectations rise
I want to bring you so that you can compromise
I'm coming at you like a killer now
so it's the truth you are drop dead cynical

Welcome to the new world
Open up the gates of paradise
So let's get cynical
Run into a new maze
Open up your minds
and soon we'll all
Be drop dead cynical
