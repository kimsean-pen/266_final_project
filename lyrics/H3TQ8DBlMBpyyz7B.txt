Stillborn pride
Let me hide

Once more I've stepped across the line
Repeating to myself that everything is fine
Once more I'm shipwrecked far from shore
This time the war and blood and gore are mine

Approaching the end, thinking it's all pretend, then

Clarity, so close to me
Although I knew I killed me to I came back to life
The key is flexibility
Guard your strengths and drown the rest out of mind, out of sight

The chains on my wings, still tight but loosening
The age of wondering led me to a place never revisited again

Stillborn pride
Spare my mind

Don't regret all of your past, you can't change
Tears dry but they're never your last, that won't change
The first stone has just been cast, show restraining
You can't take all my apathy
You can't fake such a tragedy
You can't break all my fallacies
Let serendipity

Okay, so things don't always go your way
We may see things for what they are today
So things will never go your way
See things for what they are today

Stillborn pride
Truth denied
