I've made up my mind
don't need to think it over
if I'm wrong I am right
don't need to look no further
this ain't lust I know this is love
but if I tell the world
I'll never say enough
cos it was not said to you
and that's exactly what I need to do
if I end up with you

Should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads no where
or would it be a waste
even if I knew my place should i leave it there.

Should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere

I build myself up
and fly around in circles
waiting as my heart drops
and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be it

Or should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads no where
or would it be a waste
even if I knew my place should i leave it there.

Should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
yeaaah ehh

Should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads no where
or would it be a wait
even if I knew my place
should I leave it there
should I give up

Or should I just keep on chasing pavements
should I just keep on chasing pavements
ohhhh ahhhh...

Should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
or would it be a wait
even if I knew my place
should I leave it there
should I give up
or should I just keep chasing pavements
even if it leads nowhere
