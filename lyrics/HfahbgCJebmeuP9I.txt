I sowed a seed
Underneath the oak tree
I trod it in
With my boots I trampled it down
Grow, grow, grow, grow

I sowed a rose
Underneath the oak grove
With my boots on the ground
Into the earth I trampled it down
Grow, grow

Teach me how to grow
Teach me how to grow

Teach me mummy
How to grow
How to catch someone's fancy
Underneath the twisted oak grove
