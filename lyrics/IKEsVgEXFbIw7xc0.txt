We got to stop the pain and put the the wars on hold
Let the power of love inside the soul unfold
Free the mind, let it rise above
We've gotta change this world into a world of love

Mother Earth, she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We got to look back and see a love from the past
We got time to change it but it's running out fast
(Out fast)

How many more tears must she cry?
How many more fears must be felt inside?
Before we realize we've gone too far
The creator created, we tore apart

Love can guide us back on the right road
Gotta save the planet before she explodes
We gotta love our mother, gotta let her know
Boom, boom, before she blows

In the house of love, everybody's free

Born to live, we live to die
Our eyes can't see, they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying, she's had enough
She's gotta surely blow 'cause we're giving up

Build the house of love while we've got the time
Too many bombs in the world, it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't last if the present is killed
