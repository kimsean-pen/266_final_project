Flames
Wildfire
As far as the eye can see
Purging inferno catastrophe
Waves
High water
At the places it shouldn't be
Sweeping
Whirlpool insanity

World downfall
The fury and the chaos within
Ambushment
Attack from within the Earth

When the sky turns black and nature's sounds go mute
The dead walk the Earth's last round
Outnumbering the day
All light peels away
In the flickering sway of the sun's last ray

Winds
Tornado
Rage above all lands
Blowing storm out of hand

Soil
Sands
Spreading across the nations
Disastrous dry desert plantations

World downfall
The fury and the chaos within
Ambushment
Attack from within the Earth
When the sky turns black and nature's sounds go mute
The dead walk the Earth's last round
Outnumbering the day
All light peels away
In the flickering sway of the sun's last ray
When the rats flee off this sinking ship called Earth
The world stops turning as time dies
Outnumbering the day
All the air blows cold
As the damp mold covers more than only our old
World downfall
The fury and the chaos within
Ambushment
Attack from within the Earth
Outnumbering the day
