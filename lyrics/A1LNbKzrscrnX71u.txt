Happiness
More or less
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my...

Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever grow
And I know
Just where I am

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

But I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness
Something in my own place
I'm stood here naked
Smile and I feel no disgrace
With who I am

Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever grow
And I know
Just who I am

And how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

I hope you understand
I hope you understand
Ohhh yeah
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Got a love that'll never die, no no (you know, you know)

Happiness
More or less
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty

Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever grow
And I know
Oh, my, my...
Oh, my, my...
Oh, my, my...
Oh, my, my, my, my, my...
We got a love that never dies
I got a love that'll never die
No, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I'm a lucky man
Yeah

It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think, don't, don't think I'm lying)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think,
Don't think I'm lying, I'm trying, come on now)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my (whew)
Oh, my, my...
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, my, my, my, my, my...
