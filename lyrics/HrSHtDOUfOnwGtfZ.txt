Hold a moment in time
And look to the skies
When we are frozen in light
Not a second goes by
Is it a waking dream
Holding me?
You never really know
Till you know
In the blink of an eye
Hearts will unite

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die
Right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, ohoohohoohoh
'Cause tonight
We found heaven in the dark

A silhouette in my mind
It's just you and I
And as the starlight shines
Our bodies outline
It's so natural
Unbreakable
Won't ever let you go
Let you go
Your hand in my hand
Here till the end

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die
Right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, ohoohohoohoh
'Cause tonight
We found heaven in the dark

As a new day rises
Lost in our embrace
We are one

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die
Right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, ohoohohoohoh
'Cause tonight
We found heaven in the dark
