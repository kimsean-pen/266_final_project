I wish this whiskey
Would make her miss me
Like I wish she did, I wish she did
Pouring up another one

Won't change what I should've done
Before she left, now all that's left is
Mile by mile and city by city she's
Getting over me and man it ain't pretty, no

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open, couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open, won't pick up the phone

While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

I can't take back what
I never said but
If I could, man I would
Try and make her see

That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that, yeah
If I had half a clue where she was heading now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn her car around

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open, couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open, won't pick up the phone

While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

Yeah, I shoulda held her close
I shoulda let her know
How I felt about her
'Bout a couple county lines ago

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open, I couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open, won't pick up the phone

While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late, yeah

I love you too late
I can't take back what
I never said but
If I could, damn I would
