With our callous minds we infect
Other ways of life, no regrets
Like a masochist we instigate
While the rest of the world must tolerate

Americon
Americon
It's all about the motherfuckin' oil
Regardless of the flag upon its soil

In a bloodbath we pad our fuckin' greed
The price is high to maintain liberty
Americon
Americon

So here we live in a land of deceit
That imprisons the minds of the weak
No immunity for swayin' the odds

From this resistant strain Americon
Americon

Some feel the need to play God
No immunity for swayin' the odds
This resilient plague Americon
With our poisoned minds we infest
Other ways of life we ingest
In a bloodbath we steal you dignity
The price is high to maintain liberty
Americon
