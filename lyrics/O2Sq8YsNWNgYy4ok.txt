On a silver unicorn
Rides that lady of the storm
Heaven's bliss from up above
She's the queen of all beloved

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you

Making love all night long
Going crazy on and on
Finally when morning came
She was gone and I was drained

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you

She's coming your way
She's the night, she's the day
She's coming to you
Coming to get me, coming to get me and you

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you
