Took a tube to Camden Town,
Walked down Parkway, and settled down
in the shade of a willow tree,
someone hovering over me

Close my eyes,
breathe out slowly.
Today the sunshine (sunshine) loves me only

To the sound of the World of Twist
you leant over, and gave me a kiss.
It's too warm to even hold hands,
but that won't stop us from making plans.

Close our eyes,
breathe out slowly.
Today London (London) loves us only.

Do you ever wonder where we've been?
Do you ever wonder where we're going?
Just close your eyes.
Just close your eyes.
Just close your eyes (close your eyes),
and breathe out slowly (breath out slowly).
Tonight the world (the world) loves you only.

Just close your eyes.
Just close your eyes.
Just close your eyes.
Just close your eyes.
