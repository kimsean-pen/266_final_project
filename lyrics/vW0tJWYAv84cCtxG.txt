Isolated
Alone and apart
Isolated
Isolated

I'll never crawl again
I'll never fall again
Until I'm free

Here I stand in this room
Caged and trapped inside
Seems I'm damned to live a lie
Unaware of what's outside
Should I care
For what's left me behind

And I stare at lights that makes me blind
Internally there's nothing left for me to be
I'm here alone and isolated

Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Struggling, left alone, apart
See I have no choice but be isolated
Threatened, forced to extract the heart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Have no choice but be...

The monsters make me hide
Perhaps I'll eat myself alive
Internally but it's there left for me to be

I can't care for what's left me behind
And stare at lights that makes me blind
These broken walls trap me inside
I'm isolated

Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Threatened, forced to extract the heart
Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Have no choice but be...

I'll never crawl again
I'll never fall again
Until I'm free
I'll never crawl again
I'll never fall again
Until I'm free

And I stare at lights that makes me blind
Internally there's nothing left for me to be
I'm here alone and isolated

Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
Threatened, forced to extract the heart

I'll never crawl again
I'll never fall again
Until I'm free
