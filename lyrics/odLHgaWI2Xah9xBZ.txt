I'm a witch on the weekend
I really go off the deep end
once my work is completed
I'm a wolf in the night
Quite likely to bite you
When my composure's defeated

I really wanted to go
With you just like you said
But you used my let down guard
To get into my head

I'm a witch on the weekend
I really go off the deep end
once my work is completed
I'm a wolf in the night
Quite likely to bite you
When my composure's defeated
In the night

I really wanted to go
With you just like you said
But you used my let down guard
To get into my head

I'm a wolf in the night
I'm a wolf in the night
Quite likely to bite you
I'm a wolf in the night
I'm a wolf in the night
Quite likely to bite you
