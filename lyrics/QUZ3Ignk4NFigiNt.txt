As she mistakes my name I see the light come around
And strange as it seems I'm bursting at the seams
Oh I've got a woman now

Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
And her stone-wash denim jeans are darker than they seemed
Oh I've got a woman now

She said, "My name is Eileen, boy that's all you need"
Oh, and "this one's on the house I don't mind"

It all tastes the same
But boy there's something different about your mouth
You try chasing dreams, man it's harder than it seems
Oh I've got a woman now
Oh I've got a woman now
