Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?
Down, down

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private get away

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
You down

Even if the sky is falling down?
Down like she posed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature

'Cause to me she zero degrees
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America

Now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fightin' for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid
Sent her arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably

And honestly, I'm down like the economy
Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(And the sky is falling down)
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Are you down? Are you down?)
Down, down
(And the sky is falling down)
Even if the sky is falling down?
And the sky is falling down
