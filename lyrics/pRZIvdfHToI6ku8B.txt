I don't feel a thing walking on hot coals
No sensitivity in a fog of war
Try to unwind to enjoy the good life
But the pressure that I hold on my shoulders goes

I suspect the reason I am loved
Is because of how tight I'm holding on

Nowadays you're supposed to talk problems on and on
Whatever happened to the old-fashioned strong and silent type?
What they didn't know is once you get us in touch with our feelings
You would never hear the end, once you pull the pin

I suspect the reason I am loved
Is because of how tight I'm holding on
If I set you free, if I let go
Tell me would I still be the one you want?

Even a broken clock is right twice a day
Even a busted lock can keep a thief away

He's not the type and soldiers
Don't go to hell
It's a place reserved for the twisted and evil
Now you ask how I'm feeling
I told you then
You're gonna torture me slowly with it

I suspect the reason I am loved
Is because of how tight I'm holding on
If I set you free, if I let go
Tell me would I still be the one you want?

I am falling behind
I am falling behind
I'm falling, falling behind

Oh, I suspect the reason I am loved
I suspect the reason I am loved
If I set you free, if I let go
Tell me would I still be the one you want?
