Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

Now, that I'm here, no more tears
Come here, come here
And you won't find, things
That broke your heart
And blew your mind
Not here, no, not here

And my, oh, my
Girl, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you, my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years

To you my dear I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years
And years and years

And I'll fill you in your hopes and dreams
Believe me, girl, you got everything
Right here, right here
No one could offer you more
Than the love I have for you in store
It's here, oh, oh, yeah

And my, oh, my
Honey, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years

To you my dear I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years
And years and years

Believe me, baby
We've found that certain thing
That certain feeling
That lets two people
Express themselves, how they feel
Let your love flow inside of you
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, baby
