I want to see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I want to see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock

Word on the street
You got something to show me, me
Magical, colorful, mister Mystery

I'm intrigued for a peak
Heard it's fascinating

Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
Words are mislead

Such a tease

Wanna see the show
In 3D, a movie

Heard it's beautiful
Be the judge

And my girls gonna take a vote
Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath

I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a Beeotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off

Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for?
It's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy
I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock

Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock

Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock

Your peacock
I wanna see it

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, stick it loose, come on, take a shot

Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath

I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?

Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a Beeotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off

Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for?

It's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy
I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Oh my god, no exaggeration
Boy, all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I'm so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End-of-the-rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see, and it's all for me
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a Beeotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for?
It's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy
I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
I wanna see it
Come on, baby, let me see
What you're hiding underneath
