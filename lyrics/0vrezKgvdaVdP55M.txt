Baby don't you cry
Baby don't you cry
Tears wont help you
Though you're pouring tonight
Baby don't you cry
It's never easy letting go
But you can't keep holding on
To someone you never really known

I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
And my days are mine alone
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
Sometime you only see the light
When you're standing in darkness
Tonight might save you life

Baby don't you cry
Tears won't stop the world from turning
Its gonna be a hard mile
Oh but I'll be alright

Baby don't you cry
For long you letting go
When you try you try you try
I'm just no fear there by your side

I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
And my days are mine alone
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
Sometime you only see the light
When were surrounded by darkness
Tonight might save you life

I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
And the future is mine alone
I'm living without you now
I'm living without you now
Sometime you only see the light
When were surrounded by darkness
Tonight might save you life
