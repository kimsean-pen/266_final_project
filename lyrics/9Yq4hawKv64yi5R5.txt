You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day by day

I though I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what my future held that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn

Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn

Don't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me

Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn

Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn

Don't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me
Don't know what I want or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused the more the days go by
