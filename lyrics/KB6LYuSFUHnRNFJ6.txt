Well with me and chipin' me and kisses?
Not the man in my life I know
And I been going to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back whan you said little girl
And while you're at it take yourself back too
Woman whatcha gonna do now, whatcha gonna do about it

Oh, yeah

You don't seem to come around
Point your finger and make a sound
You don't seem to come around
Not since I said you knocked it down?

Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody gotten away with it baby.
But how come it's so easy to you
You know it's like me at times I can be careless
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I don't need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends
They're all above me

And I've been thinkin' about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it
Yeah, I've been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it oh

Oh, well

They don't seem to come around
Push the finger and make a sound
They don't seem to come around
Maybe they they'll knock 'em down

Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home
