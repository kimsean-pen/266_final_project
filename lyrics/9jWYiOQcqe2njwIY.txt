We kiss with tongue and cheek and burn the witches in our beds
Wrap vacant stakes in sheets, accuse monogamy instead
I tried to catch the beat and do the dance of marionette
Can't groove to my heartbeat since rhythm stops when you are dead

They say? there's one way to feel I will
They say? there's one way to feel I will

Taxi drive me to the end
Let the meter run into the digits I can't spend
The you'll drive me to the edge
I'll stand upon the precipice and jump to pay my debt... goodbye

So take some hair from me
That's what the dog that bit me said
A process we'll repeat until it's bald and I am dead
I played it by the book and soon became illiterate
The words that I mistook negate everything I have read

They say? there's one way to feel I will
They say? there's one way to feel I will
They say? there's one way to feel I will
They say? there's one way to feel I will

Taxi drive me to the end
Let the meter run into the digits I can't spend
Then you'll drive me to the edge
I'll stand upon the precipice and jump to pay my debt
So be my driver to the end
Crash into my rigid back
You'll see that I don't bend
Now were standing on the edge
So push me off the precipice and prove that you're my friend

They say there's just one way it's kill or be killed, If you show me the way I will
They say there's just one way it's kill or be killed, If you show me the way I will

If love is like a cancer (kill or be killed)
then sex is just a pill (I will I will)
well we're making love to kill ourselves (kill or be killed)
and we're fucking just to feel (I meant "heal" ... aww fuck)

And if love is like a cancer (I've been there before)
and your sex is like a pill (I'm not afraid of death anymore)
well we're making love to kill ourselves and we're fucking just to heal?(I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay)

And your love is like a cancer (I've beat it once before)
And your sex is just a pill (I'm not afraid of dying)
I'll keep making love to kill myself (Go ahead and quit if you want)
and keep fucking just to heal

They say that god is love and love it always wins
Except for a hopeless damned romantic with a crush on deadly sins
Now I'm closing both my eyes to see your point of view
it's a picture perfect paradox? for camera shy taboo

I'm okay
