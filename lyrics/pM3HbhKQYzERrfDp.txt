As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

I will be consumed, returned into the earth.
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to.
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow.
Cut the chord and cast me out.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

It'll wear you down, through skin and bone.
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own.

When my heart skips two beats,
I am hidden deep. Fast asleep.
The sea will part, where oceans meet.
Finally complete.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

Swan song.
A declaration of endlessness.
I swear I will not look back,
As I return into the black.
When the veil lifts, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.
