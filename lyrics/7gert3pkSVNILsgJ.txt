Laying on my back again
Couldn't get up
I think above my head again
I know you're pretty fed up

'Cause I wanna come down
Put my feet on the ground, the ground, the ground, again
'Cause I wanna come down
I guess I'll see you around, around, around, around, around

I'm so, well, I'm so faded
Think I'm gonna disappear
I'm so, well, I'm so wasted
Do you think so

Kicking off my day again
Should I get up
I'm rolling off the bed again
Been feeling pretty fed up

'Cause I wanna come down
Put my feet on the ground, the ground, the ground, again
'Cause I wanna come down
I guess I'll see you around, around, around, around, around

I'm so, well, I'm so faded
Think I'm gonna disappear
I'm so, well, I'm so wasted
Do you think so

I'm so, well, I'm so faded
Think I'm gonna disappear
'Cause I'm so, well, I'm so wasted
