Oou oow oou
Haahh oou
This is what a woman wants oou

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly he still better love me
And I can be late for a date that's fine
But he better be on time

Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah, (yeah), yeah, (yeah), yeah I like it that a way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine oou oow oou

Well any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say, mmmm, I like it like that yeah

And if I changed my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah, (yeah), yeah, (yeah), yeah I like it that a way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kiiind

Any man of mine, heeh

He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kiiind

You gotta shimmy and shake (oou)
Make the earth quake (oou)
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp (oou), then you jump (oou)
Heel to toe, Do Si Do (oou)
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache (oou)
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take (oou) anymore
