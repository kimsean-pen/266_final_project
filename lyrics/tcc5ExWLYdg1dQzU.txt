Summer's gone, day's spent with the grass and sun
I don't mind, to pretend I do seems really dumb
I rise as the morning comes, crawling through the blinds
I shouldn't be up at this time, but I can't sleep with you there by my side

Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
The sun shining for your eyes
Wake up, it's so beautiful
For what could be the very last time

Twenty five, don't recall a time I felt this alive
So wake up boo, there's so many things for us to do
Its early so take your time, don't let me rush you please
I know I was up all night, I can do anything, anything, anything

Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
The sun shining for your eyes
Wake up, it's so beautiful
For what could be the very last time

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

But you can't blame me now for the death of someone
But you can't blame me now for the death of someone
But you've gonna say, what you wanna say
You have to put the death in everything

Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
The sun shining for your eyes
Wake up, it's so beautiful
For what could be the very last time, ahh
