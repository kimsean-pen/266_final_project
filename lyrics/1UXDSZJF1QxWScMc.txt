I don't know why sometimes we seems so apart
Sewn together with a broken heart
I try to see you but it's getting dark

Words keep flowing out I wonder what they mean
You're like a little piece of coarsene
But girl you've always been a friend to me

And I been too proud sometimes
Chasin' fog lines

Oh no
I'm gonna be there always
After the pain has gone away
The feelings are so strong
This can be our song
This can be our song

Oh no
I'll never make you cry again
I'm gonna set things right again
And I won't let 'em go wrong
This can be our song
This can be our song

I don't know if someone else could handle me
well I don't know what I'm supposed to be
You're the only one who really sees
You get me

I feel something growing deep inside of me
What I say and what I mean
Always seems to disagree
So help me through this hard time
Change these fog line

Oh no
I'm gonna be there always
After the pain has gone away
The feeling is so strong
This can be our song
This can be our song

Oh no
I'll never make you cry again
I'm gonna set things right again
And I won't let 'em go wrong
This can be our song
This can be our song

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

oh no
I'm gonna be there always
after the pain has gone away
the feeling is so strong
this can be our song
this can be our song

Oh no
I'll never make you cry again
I'm gonna set things right again
And I won't let 'em go wrong
This can be our song
This can be our song

(oh oh)
This can be our song
This can be our song

(oh oh)
This can be our song
This can be our song

Oh no
Oh no
This can be our song
This can be our song
