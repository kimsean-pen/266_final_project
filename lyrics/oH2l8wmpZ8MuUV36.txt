Windows down, pedal to the sneakers
Turn up the volume, blow out the speakers
Best clothes on, goin' down on fire
Turn the lights off, turn the music higher

I broke free, cast away
Won't find me and now you're never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take
So farewell, 'cause your never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young, we are young
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb, we're on the run
And you're never gonna chase us down, we are young

Dance with the devil, don't be shy
Nothing's gonna stop us, we can't die
Sleepin' in a bed, waking up outside
At least I can say I tried

So you fathers don't let go of your daughters
We take what we want, we don't borrow
Think I found a message in a bottle
This says, "Drink me", drown your sorrows

I broke free, cast away
Won't find me and now you're never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell
'Cause you're never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young, we are young
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb, we're on the run
And your never gonna chase us down

We are young, young, young
We are young, young, young
We are young, young, young
And your never gonna chase us down

We are young

If I'm doin' this right, I'll be leavin' tonight
I got my bags packed tight
So many reasons to leave, I got my hands on my keys
Yeah, I'll be leavin' tonight

We are young, we are young
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb, we're on the run
And you're never gonna chase us down

We are young, young, young
We are young, young, young
We are young, young, young
And you're never gonna chase us down

We are young
