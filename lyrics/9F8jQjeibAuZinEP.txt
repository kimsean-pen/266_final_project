Closing up, right in with sand
Stretching like a child in the night
Trusted me, knowing he could see
I would never lead you astray
All, all is lost,
All will be returned in the end
Ill, Ill be at,
Ill be at the sun
When it begins
Resting in the finest,
Blowing in the breeze
Calculate the pattern
And its cause in my disease
Child of the desert,
Never had it made
Klimax on the concept of believing in any pain
Taking it underneath the sun
Watch me to the sun
Thats so extreme
Dont believe,
Time will have you see
I would never lead you astray
All, all is lost,
All will be returned in the end
Ill, Ill be at,
Ill be safe
Just give it away
Give it away,
Give it away
Melting in the shadows,
Melting in the dark
Rise above the surface,
Eliminate the spark
Wild like a daydream,
Soon will be erased
Searching for the moment
To evacuate the race
Resting in the finest,
Blowing in the breeze
Calculate the pattern and its cause in my disease
Child of the desert,
Never had it made
Knowing it would never be the same
Instrumental
Not sure Ill make it
Ill take my time,
I came away
Come walk clear with me
I wonder,
I wonder I dont want,
I dont want
I dont want to take my time
They control my life
They control my
