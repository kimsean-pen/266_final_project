You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking role
Bragging that perfect life you've never had
The tables turn, kid
I just can't wait to see it
I wanna know what you are made of

You just don't know who you are
There's not much left of yourself
How could you even see with your heart?
You can not see the whole world around

There is no chance to, to cover this hole
I can't see where your heart takes place
There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself
Because you're living in a lie
You don't even know who your friends are
Do you feel the gravity?
Just come back, just come back down

Alterating the reality
Your heart is blinded by the lies that you told
You want a life you'll never have
Leading yourself to your motherfucking downfall
Open your mind to the world around
Or you will never make it out alive

You just don't know who you are
There's not much left of yourself
How could you even see with your heart?
You can not see the whole world around

There is no chance to, to cover this hole
I can't see where your heart takes place
There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself
Because you're living in a lie
You don't even know who your friends are
Do you feel the gravity?
Just come back, just come back down

Open your eyes all your loved ones are faking
You're getting caught up by your lies
I just can't wait to see how this will end
Oh, you'll never know how to animate your empty heart
You'll never feel that fire

You feel nothing
Your chest is empty, you can't fill this space
Your heart is gone for good, leaving you loveless
It's been a while that you're life is a mindfuck
How the fuck could you live with yourself?

You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking role
Bragging that perfect life you've never had
Facing the mirror, you just can't be yourself
Feeling the reality slip between your fingertips
