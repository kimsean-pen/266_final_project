I never meant to go
I never meant to fall but I'm only gone
I never meant to go I'm only gone inside my own

Some day I'll wake you
Some times I'll wait for myself
Some day I'll hold you through

Tonight I'm alone to go high
Tonight I'm alone to go high
Tonight I'm alone to go

In state of confusion you made an illusion
State of confusion you made an illusion

It is exciting to be away
Feeling you all inside of me
I'm standing here but I'm really gone

Some day I'll wake you
Some times I'll wait for myself
Some day I'll hold you through

Tonight I'm alone to go high
Tonight I'm alone to go high
Tonight I'm alone to go

In state of confusion you made an illusion
State of confusion you made an illusion

You see me as I go
You've been precious to me
I've been blessed in the way
But Now I'm falling I'm inside
