We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside

This tick by the door like a broomstick
With a clipboard tryna be uptight
Over capacity, rubbin' us wrong
But my girl better put her up right
And we're all a bit fed up
Half of us halfway wasted
In the queue gettin' right up
In the queue gettin'

Oh yeah, we look like sickness
Barely movin' inches
Let's leave this line, your club will close
We'll run you outta business
What I do, what I do
That's what I do

We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside
We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside

1AM and it's freezin'
Silly, all us girls got our legs out
None of us are havin' this, the queue ain't moved
So the heels are comin' off right now
I think we're done bein' patient
So nobody can tell us all to pipe down
We're offline, cheap wine does that to your madness
Outside your club now

Yeah, we look like sickness
Barely movin' inches
Let's leave this line, your club will close
We'll run you outta business
What I do, what I do
That's what I do

We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside
We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside

We spent enough time waiting today
Front of the line, line, still got no entry
We been waiting in line to get into this club
Now fuck that, haha

We been waiting in line to get into this club
Like all night, all night
We don't wanna go home so we'll take it outside
Yeah, outside, outside

Yeah, we look like sickness
Barely movin' inches
Let's leave this line, your club will close
We'll run you outta business
What I do, what I do
That's what I do
