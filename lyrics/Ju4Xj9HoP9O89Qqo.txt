This is a crazy world
These can be lonely times
It's hard to know who's on your side
Most of the time

Who can you really trust?
Who do you really know?
Is there anybody out there
Who can make you feel less alone?
Some times you just can't make it on your own

If you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I'll always be your friend

When you need some shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am

If you have broken dreams
Just lay them all on me
I'll be the one who understands
So take my hand

If there is emptiness
You know I'll do my best
To fill you up with all the love
That I can show someone
I promise you you'll never walk alone

Well, if you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
Well, I'll always be your friend

When you need a shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am

Everybody needs somebody who
They can pour their heart and soul into
Well, if you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I'll always be your friend
When you need a shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am, here I am
