[Hook]
Fumbling over words that rhyme [x4]

[Verse 1]
Pure rap music ain't made under pressure
Expose a jewel, teach school at my leisure
Fumble over words that rhyme with a verse divine
I backtrack and think of the greatest of all-time
Class is in session, master this lesson
Teacher was a student, studied like a Buddhist
Reviewin' on the best to do it
So let's do this

["Do it"]

Nothin' to it
Considered the first emcee to blow the spot
and do work, was Coke La Rock spittin' for Kool Herc
Followin' the influence of Herculoid parties,
Brothers like Cowboy made you move your body
Cowboy would toast for the G.M. Flash
And the skills elevated as crews started to clash
Flash and Bam, they both sought clientele
So Flash formed the Four with the father Melle Mel
Four became Five, law became live
Routines over breaks, true kings motivate
Out the L brothers came the Five Fantastic
With Theodore they battled with the Cold Crush Four
Few had the confidence of G.M.C.
Without the C.C.B.'s there'd be no Run-DMC
The Funky and the Fearless Four, Force MC's, the suave Spoonie G
And I can't forget the ["Treacherous Three MC's..."]

[Hook]
["Come with sound... Around and 'round"]

[Verse 2]

Praise to the Kool Moe Dee, he elevated
and changed it with records like "The New Rap Language"
Before the first full length LP's
There was abstract brothers like the one Rammelzee
Run DMC broke through in '83
Outta Queens, and started rapping hard over drum machines
808's started shakin' up floors ["It's yours"]
With T La Rock's complex metaphors
["T-L-A-R-O-C-K"]
A primary influence on L.L. Cool J
T La Rock's futurism must've been respectable
'Cuz Tragedy from Queens was young but very technical
Sham was eloquent, Chris was intelligent
The 'R' was all of the above with added elements
Slick Rick the Ruler was a screenplay producer
Ultramagnetic had the vision for the future
Big Daddy Kane getting raw at The Apollo and
Kool G Rap was probably the sickest of all of 'em
Jaz from the BK, Percee and Finesse from the BX
Prince Po and Pharoah came next
Wu with the G-Z-A, G-F-K
N-A-S, one of the best out today
Any MC that's addin' on to the list
Pump your fist, but first give praise to the true scientists
