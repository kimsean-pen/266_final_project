Turn it up, it's my song, I can't sing, but I sing along
I can feel it in my bones, a little rock, a little roll

Take it fast, take it slow
Let me tell you something that you don't know
Well the bars are all closed and we got no place to go
But we're all a little drunk and we wanna hear some rock 'n' roll

Is anybody listening, no, where did that old feeling go?
Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll

Another round to the sound that moulds your music
But we wanna say we got it so we might as well use it
I asked Katie to dance and I almost blew it
I only kissed her on the mouth 'cause he told me to do it

Is anybody listening, no, where did that old feeling go?
Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll

Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll
Don't stop, yeah

Is anybody listening, no, where did that old feeling go?
Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll

Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll
Don't stop listening to rock 'n' roll
Don't stop, yeah

What does it take to be alive?
And all the chances we take, what we're measured by
I sat on my couch, and wondered why, why
It's such a beautiful day, I'm still sitting inside

All I know is I'm still waiting for my sun to shine
