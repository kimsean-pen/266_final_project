Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks

Wait around here long enough, you'll see
Another junction, line up and lay down for me
You fall wonderfully
If I question everything you say
Another answer crumbles the birth of my day
It's when you were here

You, calling out a name
You, swimming to me through a dream

Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks

Every siren lost in my lullaby
Every heartbeat functioning thrown to the night
I'm quenched in your light
See the floor rising through a dream
Forgotten thoughts lost in a memorable theme
And soaked to the skin

You, calling out a name
You, swimming to me through a dream

Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks

Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through

All the cracks
I wanted life to be that

I wanted life to be that
I wanted life to be that
I wanted life to be that

You, calling out a name, oh
You, swimming to me through a dream
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
Life is a fear of falling
Life is a fear of falling through
All the cracks
