Ooohh...
Oh yea-yeah

Listen
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers, to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still I find
Just a grown man running out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl
My life is incomplete
I said, without you girl

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year- Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall
But being without you, just ain't livin', ain't livin' at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete (oh yeah)
That without you girl

I just can't help loving you
But I loved you, much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say, that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl
My life is incomplete

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl
My life is incomplete

Without you girl
Without you girl, my life
Without you girl
My life, my life is incomplete
Without you girl
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah, my life is incomplete
