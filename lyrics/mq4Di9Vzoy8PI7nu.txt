Help! Someone convict him of this heinous crime,
We're running out of time.
Well, it's like they say some people never learn,
Another bridge you burned.

Every time you walk the line,
Hand to the Bible, don't you lie,
Not gonna let you come and go this time.
Either you're in or you are out,
Sick of the drama take a bow,
Sorry to say, your curtain call is now.

No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.
No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.

Woo hoo, no more, woo hoo, no more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo hoo, no more, woo hoo, no more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo Hoo!

So, if you're the puppet she's the puppeteer,
Strung out by volunteer,
No, this metaphor's everything but absurd,
You hang on every word.

Every time you walk the line,
Hand to the Bible, don't you lie,
Not gonna let you come and go this time.
Either you're in or you are out,
Sick of the drama take a bow,
Sorry to say, your curtain call is now.

No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.
No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.

Woo Hoo, No more, Woo Hoo, No more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo Hoo, No more, Woo Hoo, No more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo Hoo!

I'll be damned if I sing another swan song,
No more shooting for the stars when yours burned out.
Common chemistry can build an atom bomb,
Detonation counting 5-4-3-2-1, I'm done!
(Tell 'em why!)
It's time for me to let you go!

No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.
No more tug of war,
It's time for me to let you go.

Woo Hoo, No more, Woo Hoo, No more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo Hoo, No more, Woo Hoo, No more,
It's time for me to let you go,
Woo Hoo!
