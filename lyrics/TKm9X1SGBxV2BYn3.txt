If today's the day I die
Lay me down under the lights
Let me fall in love
Let me save a life
And let me lose my voice, singing all my favorite songs
Let me stare up at the stars 'cause it's where we all belong

My heart like a firework in my chest
My only regret is having regrets
Traveled the world, I loved every step
And all I know is...

No one, no one lives forever
But we will be remembered for what we do right now

Baby, I'm living louder & dreaming longer tonight
(Living louder, we're living louder)
And baby, I'm fighting harder & loving stronger tonight
(Loving stronger, we're loving stronger)
Because we're all just kids who grew up way too fast
Yeah, the good die young but the great will always last
We're growing older but we're all soldiers tonight

If today's the day I go
Gonna drink with all my friends
Gonna laugh until we cry as we talk & reminisce
Let me kiss a stranger & rob the local bank
Let me become real rich so I can give it all away

No one, no lives forever
But we will be remembered for what we do right now

Baby, I'm living louder & dreaming longer tonight
(Living louder, we're living louder)
And baby, I'm fighting harder & loving stronger tonight
(Loving stronger, we're loving stronger)
Because we're all just kids who grew up way too fast
Yeah, the good die young but the great will always last
We're growing older but we're all soldiers tonight

When you got your breath inside your head
Everyday's a second chance
If I wake up with a beating heart
Will I stand or will I fall apart?

I'm living louder, dreaming longer tonight
Baby, I'm fighting harder & loving stronger tonight

Baby, I'm living louder & dreaming longer tonight
(Living louder, we're living louder)
And baby, I'm fighting harder & loving stronger tonight
(Loving stronger, we're loving stronger)
Because we're all just kids who grew up way too fast
Yeah, the good die young but the great will always last
We're growing older but we're all soldiers tonight
