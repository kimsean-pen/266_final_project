Tonight could be forever
I can't explain it
Nothing's ever felt, quite like this before
Looking into your eyes
I see everything I need, you're all I been searching for
I don't wanna leave your side, its far too cold without you baby
(just wanna bring you in closer and closer)
Keep your body next to mine, we'll worry 'bout the mornin'light
(I'm telling you straight from the heart)
Long as the stars keep shining and the sun can't find us
Baby tonight could last forever
Under the moonlight brightness, everything just right
I feel like tonight could last forever
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Don't let go, don't let go
Cause I wan't tonight to last forever
I'll be yours, through the night
And I'll never let go
I just wanna tonight to last forever
You are the reason
I can't keep a straight face whenever your around
Let them think we're crazy
It doesn't really matter what they think about
I don't wanna leave your side, its far too cold without you baby
(just wanna bring you in closer and closer)
Keep your body next to mine, we'll worry 'bout the mornin'light
(I'm telling you straight from the heart)
Long as the stars keep shining and the sun can't find us
Baby tonight could last forever
Under the moonlight brightness, everything just right
I feel like tonight could last forever
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Don't let go, don't let go
Cause I wan't tonight to last forever
I'll be yours, through the night
And I'll never let go
I just wanna tonight to last forever
You are the reason...
Tonight, tonight, we'll be, together forever, and ever, baby
Tonight, tonight, we'll be, together forever, and ever
