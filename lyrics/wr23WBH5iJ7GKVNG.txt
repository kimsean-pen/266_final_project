How I wish I had a loving man
who could give me some joy
who could give me some fun
How I wish you were fine
it shouldn't hurt you so much
to talk to me. Talk to me

You fill my life with desire
and I have given you so much
of what you keep under your skin.
You fill my life with desire
and I have given you so much
of that touchless statue in your head.

How you wish I was blind
I couldn't look in your eyes
and torture you.
How you wish I was fine
it should hurt me sometimes
to talk to you. Talk to you.

You fill my life with desire
and I have given you so much
of what you keep under your skin.
Oh you fill my life with desire
and I have given you so much
of that touchless statue in your head.

Oh you fill my life with desire
and I have given you so much
of that touchless statue in your head.
Ah, Ah, Ah,...
