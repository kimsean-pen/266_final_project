The kiss sweetest
And touch so warm
One smile kindest
In this world so cold and strong

We're so close to the flame
Burning brightly
It won't fade away

Leave us lonely
The arms safest
And words so good
The faith deepest, yeah

In this world so cold and cruel
We're so close to the flame
Burning brightly

It won't fade away
Leave us lonely
So close to the flame

Burning brightly
Won't fade away
Leave us lonely
Close to the flame
Burning brightly
Won't fade away
Leave us lonely
