I wish that I could reach out
Steal all your feelings
They'd fit me like a glove
Instead I've just been sleeping
Straight through the summer
How they beg me to wake up
And all my wasted youth's not wasted
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
I wish that I could march in
Stand up for something
But there's nothing i believe
I get a little older
Maybe even wiser
But my heart's stuck on my sleeve
And all my wasted youth's not wasted
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
And when all that's left are bed bones
And we step off all our misled thrones
After all the let downs and let-go's
Hold your breath, play dead, ready, set, no
Ready, set?
No
Ready, set?
No
And all my wasted youth isn't wasted
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
If it's on you
