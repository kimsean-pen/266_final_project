It seems so far already
It seems so far ago
I don't know if I'm ready
I'll take it slow

Take it slow
Take it slow
Out and around we go
We'll take it slow

And when we're lost together
We seem so far apart
I don't know where we headed
We'll make a start

Take it slow
Take it slow
Out and around we go
We'll take it slow

(Ah, ah, ah...)
Take it slow
Take it slow
Out and around we go
We'll take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow
Out and around we go
We'll take it slow
