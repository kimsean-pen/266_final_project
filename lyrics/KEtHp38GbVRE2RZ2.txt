You'll never take my soul
you'll never take my soul
the next generation in synchronization
devoid and astray
burned and defensless
against the relentless hacking machine
we're disconnected as one soulless nation
we're disconnected as one devastation
no soul I gotta have all control before I break
no soul you'll never take my control I dominate
contamination severe violation of all that I see
breaking down defenses devouring access decoding their dreams
we're disconnected as one soulless nation
we're disconnected as one devastation
no soul I gotta have all control before I break
no soul you'll never take my control I dominate
seek out and destroy the source of inhumanity
seek out and destroy the source of inhumanity
we're disconnected as one soulless nation
we're disconnected as one devastation
no soul I gotta have all control before I break
no soul you'll never take my control I dominate
no soul I gotta have all control
You'll never take my soul
I gotta have all control I dominate
