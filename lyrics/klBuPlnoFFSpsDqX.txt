(Chorus x2)
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw

(Verse)
The death, I may face it on
The love, it's like it's a war
I'm deep, likw a warrior your life comes short
To your drawn intervention
Give me all

(Bridge)
You want it all, you want it all
I don't like you, I don't like you
How? What do you want from me?
And I guess it's time to think
Here, now, the wicked blows high
Discover your mouth for another full lie
Sing free and hold your person
The very old best, take longer they come now

(Chorus)
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw

(Verse)
This silence is pulling an empty drawer
Believe the dim can go far
I take, I'm riding the turu there
To you, joy make sure you
Build a wall

(Bridge)
You want it all, you want it all
I don't like you, I don't like you
How? What do you want from me?
And I guess it's time to think
Here, now, the wicked blows high
Discover your mouth for another full lie
Sing free and hold your person
The very old best, take longer they come now

(Chorus)
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw
Maw maw ma ma ma ma maw
Ma ma ma ma maw, maw maw maw

(Verse)
Your pain, put it right here
I'm taking you somewhere to be, somewhere to be
The sky right, the stars of this sun
Will sure remain down, they can't get more up
I won't your mind to water the cag
We're ready to bust, high at would take
Your hand â€“ put it right here
I'm taking you somewhere to be, somewhere to be
