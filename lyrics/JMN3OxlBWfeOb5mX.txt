We've found a taste for self-destruction
A blind eye for blatant dysfunction
We've found a taste for self-destruction
We're all born in black blood!

There's an imminence stirring like a siren singing
There's a debt to pay but they keep on drilling
Why is simple truth so hard to tell?
We had an Eden and turned it into hell

Born in black blood
Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget

The lonely sound of the final drip
Like the starting gun marking the end of it
On the shoulders of forever, it's a long way to fall
Black gold will be the death, the death of us all!
Black drought, the word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled

Born in black blood
Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget
Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget
We won't forget, we won't forget

Black drought, word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled
We've found the cancer inside of our heads
There's no turning back now, we're as good as dead
When the well dried up, no one cared
But when the hell shows up, they'll all stop and stare
When the well dried up, no one cared
But when the hell shows up, they'll all stop and stare
We've found the cancer inside of our heads
No turning back now, we're as good as dead
We've found the cancer inside of our heads
No turning back now, we're as good as dead

I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget
I can't forgive, we won't forget
