Every time's the last time
But it never is, now is it?
You apologize
And make promises, but in a couple weeks
I'll be crying again
Touch me baby with your tender love
Again
Baby, make it worth it

You keep rockin' me back and forth
Rockin' me back and forth
When you should be careful
Careful with me

See, we're hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
And I'm barely holding on
You should be careful

Que serais-je sans toi qui vins Ã  ma rencontre
Que serais-je sans toi qu'un coeur au bois dormant

No more second chances
I really mean it, this time believe it
I just wanna love you
But you make it so hard for me to do
I'll be crying again
Touch me baby with your tender love
Again
Baby, take it easy

You keep rockin' me back and forth
Rockin' me back and forth
When you should be careful
Careful with me

See, we're hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
And I'm barely holding on
You should be careful
You should be
Careful, careful, careful with me
You should be
Careful, careful, careful with me
You should be
Careful, careful, careful with me
You should be
Careful, careful, careful with me

See, we're hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
And I'm barely holding on
You should be careful
Careful, careful, careful with me
Careful, careful, careful with me
