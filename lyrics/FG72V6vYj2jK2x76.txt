You told me, I see you rise
But, it always falls
I see you come, I see you go
He said, "All things pass into the night."
And I said, "Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
"I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong.
"Won't you listen to me?"

You told me, I've seen it all before
I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams
A lying on the ground.
I've seen the sky just begin to fall
He said, "All things pass into the night."
And I said, "Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong,
"I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong.
"Won't you listen to me?"

Goodbye horses, I'm lying over you
Goodbye horses, I'm lying over you
Goodbye horses, I'm lying over you
Goodbye horses, I'm lying, lying, lying over you

Hoooooo
Hooooooo...
