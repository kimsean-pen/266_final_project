Details of your look, like your touch
Killing me by shoot, just in once
Let me look at you with your cries
Since the days of school, you and i
You are my way.

You did the hook, you did right
Shiny as a jewel, with your tie
Oh see, just take a look on the edge
See darling the moon, on the sand
You are my way.
Just let me play.
Just let me play.
