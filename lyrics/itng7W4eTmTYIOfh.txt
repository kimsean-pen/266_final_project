You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out feeling nothing
Something that you do

And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark and stealing my heart away

Crying, trying anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action

(dont pass me by)

I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free

We talk about love, love love
We talk about love

We talk about love love love
We talk about love
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swollow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole a world over
You never find your love if you hide a way
Crying, dying all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of chain reaction
You get a medal when yourè lost in action
(dont pass me by)
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
(dont make me cry)
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love, love love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
Arms will cover you
All you gotta do is get in the middle of chain reaction
You get a medal when yourè lost in action
Don't pass me by
I wanna get your love all ready for the chain reaction
