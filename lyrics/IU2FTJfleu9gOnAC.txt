I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only
One who's drinking 'bout myself
Wishing that I was somewhere else
Talking to voices in my head
Because at least they're listening
Right here's an easy place to hide
I'll stay in bed and shut the blinds
Don't even know where I would go

But I know
That there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company
And it's comforting to know
I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only

One with nobody to call
This city makes me feel so small
A million people in this town
But I could scream without a sound
So, I get high to pass the time
Talk to someone I met online
To make myself feel less alone

'Cause I know
That there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company
And it's comforting to know
I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only

No, I can't be the only one
Who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only one
Who's lonely
No, I can't be the only
The only
