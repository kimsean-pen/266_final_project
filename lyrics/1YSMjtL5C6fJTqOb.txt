Do you believe in the dark
In feeble love, feeble reel
They say it now
They're dreaming now
Just staying pretty
Every time we last
Feeling on the sun, reel

for your love, I want you, I want you
I'm still, still, still, still, still
Feeling numb, do you really love now
Feeble reel
Did you really sound?
Did you really sound sense
Tell me me

for your love, I want you, I want you
I'm still, still, still, still, still
for your love, I want you, I want you
I'm still, still, still, still, still

Here, come here fast
Feel, I know you so, reel
I know you never wanted my love
I know you never wanted my love
All you ever wanted was reel, reel, reel
All you ever wanted we never tried
Was reel
