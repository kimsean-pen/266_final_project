When you go on camping trips
You're stuck right out in nature
Foraging the forests like a primate
Using sharpened tools instead of hotplates

Your thumb and forefinger
Supposed to show you're not a wild beast
You can hear their noises at night time
They don't have to keep a certain bedtime

See in the shapes of my body
Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys

Sometimes when I lie awake
I hear the rainfall on my tent fly
I think of all the insects that are sleeping
And wonder if the animals are dreaming

See in the shapes of my body
Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys

In the days of the caveman
And mammoths and glaciers
Bugs and trees were your food then
No pajamas or doctors

And when I finally get to sleep
I dream in Technicolor
Well, I see creatures come back from the ice age
Alive and being fed inside a zoo cage

See in the shapes of my body
Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys

In the days of the caveman
And mammoths and glaciers
Bugs and trees were your food then
No pajamas or doctors

In the days of the caveman
And mammoths and glaciers
Bugs and trees were your food then
No pajamas or doctors
