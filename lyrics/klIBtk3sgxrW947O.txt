I really want to find a bar
And mix a fear up with a friend
Plant a joke kiss on your arm
And give you skulls tattoos in pen

I want to know...
Do I dance inside your head?
Is our love star crossed?
'Cause all I feel is that I'm caught in it

I really want to go to bed
With a feeling in my chest
Like I lost again
But this time for the best

I want to know
Do I smooth your checkered past?
Does your hope float?
When you call me your last

I really hope you're on at eight
With no commercial breaks
And the sofa sinks
Underneath our doubled weight

If I love you
Like I loved you from a far
If you love me
When your skin wasn't so hard
When your skin wasn't so hard
