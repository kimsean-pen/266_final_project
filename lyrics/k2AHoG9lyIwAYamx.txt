Remember when we were so small
And all the times we used to fall
You never walk before you crawl, before you crawl

We wake up and we go to school
Together breakin' every rule
They say that we're just young and fools, young and fools

Grown-ups, what do they know?
Living by the stories on the radio
Bad news on the T.V.
Headlines are made of reality

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us, we will carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us, we will carry on

Remember all the memories
And every little fantasy
Careless about destiny, destiny
We don't have the time to sleep
There's every possibility
We'll be a part of history, history

Grown-ups, what do they know?
Living by the stories on the radio
Bad news on the T.V.
Headlines are made of reality

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us, we will carry on

Carry on

Carry on, carry on
Wide awake and we're dreamin'
Carry on, carry on, carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us, we will carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us, we will carry on

There's no stopping us, we will carry on
