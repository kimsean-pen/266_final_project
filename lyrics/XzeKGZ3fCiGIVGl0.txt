My momma told me
If you find some fame
Don't start the cocaine
Yeah, yeah, now
But we could always
Find some mindless ways
To keep entertained
Yeah, yeah

(We've got something)
Don't take much to have some fun
Grab your shades and we'll do some
(People watching)
Keep all your designer drugs
I just wanna smoke your love
(We've got something

Momma told me
If she consumes your mind
Hold on for dear life
Yeah, yeah, woo!
Don't need an island
Or a private plane
To better these days
Yeah, yeah

(We've got something)
Don't take much to have some fun
Grab your shades and we'll do some
(People watching)
Keep all your designer drugs
I just wanna smoke your love
(We've got something

Play, play, play, the champagne
While we lay a Sunday
Strangers living out their lives
Place your bets on all them
I can search to no end
Now you could say
You could say
It's all in your hands

(We've got something)
Don't take much to have some fun
Grab your shades and we'll do some
(People watching)
Keep all your designer drugs
I just wanna smoke your love
(We've got something
