You're the kind of, kind of, kind of
I should make a move on, move on, move on
And if I don't let you, don't let you win

You're the kind of, kind of, kind of
You're the kind of, kind of, kind of
And if I don't let you, don't let you win
I would like to get to know you

If I could feel something,

If I could feel something,
Girl you got be blind

If I could feel something,
Girl you could be down for
If I could feel something,
Girl you got be blind

I am lost in the vision
Every time our bodies meet,
To our hearts without emotion, synchronized
