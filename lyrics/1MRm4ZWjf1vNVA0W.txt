You were a wide eyed kid
With failure drilled into your head
And what's fucked up is
You went and got used to it
You got blindsided
Caught in a loop that never ends
It's like a wound that never mends
You went and made peace with it

There's a story told, as old as time itself
We both know life is temporary
It's the pain you feel, the zeal when steel meets flesh
And history writes the rest
That's oh so dangerous

You know how it is
Know how you'll die, but never when
When you're the type that never bends
You just gotta break to bits

There's a story told, as old as time itself
We both know life is temporary
It's the pain you feel, the zeal when steel meets flesh
And history writes the rest
That's oh so dangerous

Worth its weight in gold, your soul just sold itself
We both know life is kinda scary
And the fear it wields that pierces through your chest
You know it never left
And that's oh so dangerous
That's oh so dangerous
