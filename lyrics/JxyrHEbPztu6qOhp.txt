Fast and mean
The fever is burning up
What a scene
A hot dazzling club in a sandstorm
A mirage as I look in your eyes
I'm in between
In an illusion
Like I've never seen
I feel the lights are getting dim and low
And I can't let go
I can feel the heat rising when you're near
You pull it off boy like you don't care
You're what I'm dreaming of
And I just can't get enough
We're gonna lose it on the floor
Disco intrusion, say no more
You make me lose control
Disco intrusion, give me more
Flip and spin
Play me your record
I'm yours again
Don't you press stop till the morning
Four on the flooring away
I look at you
I see your body
Loving what you do
I keep on watching
And I think you know
That I can't let go
I can feel the heat rising when you're near
You pull it off boy like you don't care
You're what I'm dreaming of
And I just can't get enough
We're gonna lose it on the floor
Disco intrusion, say no more
You make me lose control
Disco intrusion, give me more
Boy your gotta prove it
So baby move it
Let me watch you do it
The way you do it
Boy you gotta prove it
So baby move it
Let me watch you do it
The way you do it
Yeah, boy you know you got it
Let's get it started
Crazy mad chaotic
You're so hypnotic
Yeah, boy you know you got it
Let's get it started
Crazy mad chaotic
You're so hypnotic
You're so hypnotic
I can feel the heat rising when you're near
You pull it off boy like you don't care
You're what I'm dreaming of
And I just can't get enough
We're gonna lose it on the floor
Disco intrusion, say no more
You make me lose control
Disco intrusion, give me more
Boy you gotta prove it
So baby move it
Let me watch you do it
The way you do it
Boy you gotta prove it
So baby move it
Let me watch you do it
The way you do it
Boy you know you got it
Let's get it started
Crazy mad chaotic
You're so hypnotic
Boy you know you got it
Let's get it started
Crazy mad chaotic
You're so hypnotic
Disco intrusion, say no more
