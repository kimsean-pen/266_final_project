The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like going out before the night passes by
I won't just sit around when life becomes a drag
I dance (dance)

I like the bass (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like the boom (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum when it goes boom, boom, boom

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about, let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends
Sweat it out, let's dance
(Move your whole body and let's start the party)
To much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me, baby (dance)

The music's on (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
My favorite song (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
The beat is strong (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
We'll dance, come on (on, ow)

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about, let's dance
Grab your girlfriends (yeah, oh)
Grab your boyfriends
Sweat it out, let's dance
(Move your whole body and let's start the party)
To much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me, baby (dance)

(Keep moving)
(Crank it up, yeah)

When the night says, "Hello"
Yeah, get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose
Yeah, you got no excuse
Just take a chance (just take a chance)
Get out on the floor and dance (let's, let's dance)

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about (dance, baby)
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends
Sweat it out, let's dance (let's dance)
And let's start the party
(Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance)

Let's dance (oh, baby)
What the weekend
What the night is all about, let's dance (get up)
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends
Sweat it out, let's dance
(Move your whole body and let's start the party)

As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lim I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds, ha (ha, ha, ha)
