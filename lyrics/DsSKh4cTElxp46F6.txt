Live through the daze all the time
Trying and tryna make you mine
Oh... it's buried in the sand, chase arrives
Those burnout eyes...
Oohh... those burnout eyes
(Ohh... it's flowing up on me through my eyes?)
Ohhhh... those burnout eyes
Ohh... those burnout eyes
I wanna stay just like this
I wanna stay just like...
I wanna stay just like this
I wanna stay just like...
I wanna stay just like this
I wanna stay just like...
I wanna stay just like this
I wanna stay just like...
