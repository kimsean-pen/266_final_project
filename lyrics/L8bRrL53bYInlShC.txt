We've been here before
Like a book I read
In the hall that leads to the door
My words hang in the air
When I spoke to you
I believe it's magic, magic
In the hall that leads to the door
And my words hang in the air
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
We've been here before
Like a book I read
In the hall that leads to the door
My words hang in the air
When I spoke to you
I believe it's magic, magic
In the hall that leads to the door
And my words hang in the air
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
I believe it's magic, I believe it's magic
I believe it's magic, magic
And my words hang
And my words hang
My words hang
