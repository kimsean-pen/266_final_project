We've seen the fall of an empire, with a dismantled throne
Send a message to sons of their time, to return home
They think they own us, they think we care
Your wealth on earth, will be your cross to bare
They'll stab you in the back, with a knife made of gold
Then they'll drain all you have left, and swallow you whole
Divide, divide and spread your lies
No spine left in sight
They try and try to infect our lives
Divide, divide and spread your lies
No spine left in sight
They try and try to infect our lives
I have seen the way you've played this, its over now
I will hunt you down and break this,
don't try to run you won't survive it
I will leave you in the graveyard, to be dead amongst the old guard
Cold, As the writing on your tombstone
Cold, As the writing on your tombstone
Release your hold
I have seen the way you've played this, its over now
I will hunt you down and break this,
don't try to run you won't survive it
I will leave you in the graveyard, to be dead amongst the old guard
Divide, divide and spread your lies
Divide, divide and spread your lies
Divide, divide and spread your lies
Human parasites
