Oh, oh, ooh

I don't need a man doing everything he can
And giving up his life and everything he has to please me
(Oh, oh, oh)
I don't like the kinda guy who does the can and
Loves you for the sake in the heat of a one night stand

I never met a man as perfect as you
No one makes me feel the way that you do
I really, really need it, when I say

If you want it come and get it
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(Don't go hesitating)
Don't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby let me take you) Oh
Somewhere where only this girl's allowed

I don't like a man who drives a fast car
To make you think they're bigger baby than they really are
(Oh, oh, oh)
I don't need a man who hasn't got a job
Who sits watching telly with his belly and a bottle of rum (Oh yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh)

I never met a man as perfect as you
No one makes me feel the way that you do
I really, really need it, when I say

If you want it come and get it
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(Don't go hesitating)
Don't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby let me take you)
Somewhere where only this girl's allowed

Never give up when I'm wanting
(Yeah)
Never give up when I'm needing
(Yeah)
Never give up when I'm feeling
Never give up
Never give up
Ooh
If you wanting to know that I get some
If you wanting to know that I taste some
Never give up
Never give up
If I want it, gonna get it
Gonna take it, gonna make it
This way yeah

If you want it come and get it
(Come and get it)
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(Don't go hesitating)
Don't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby let me take you)
Somewhere where only this girl's allowed

If you want it come and get it
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(Oh, oh)
(Don't go hesistating)
Don't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby let me take you)
Somewhere where only this girl's allowed

If you want it come and get it
(Oh, oh)
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(You know that I need it)
Don't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby let me take you)
Somewhere where only this girl's allowed

If you want it come and get it
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
