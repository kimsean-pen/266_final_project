Violence in my head
Like a thorn that pierced my skin
Spilling strength on the floor where I stand
It surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me
Surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me

They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed!

No one
No one
No one can deny!

Sadness in my heart
Like a storm that ripped apart
All the fragments of what was happiness
It takes over, and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
Takes over and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me

They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed!

No one
No one
No one can deny x2

Take one, take one more shot, one more shot at me x2
And believe! x2
Take one, take one more shot, one more shot at me x2
And believe! x2

Takes over and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
Inside! x2
Inside my head!

No one
No one
No one can deny x2
No one x4
