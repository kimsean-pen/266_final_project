You're hard to talk to
With that wall around you
Don't look at me that way
What can I do
To build that bridge to find you
I don't know what to say

Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Tell me what you need, so we don't have this fight
Come on and open up
Open up my love
I know it's a front you've been hiding behind
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind?

I know you want to
Do that thing you always do
You get in your head
When that door stays shut
It puts this space between us
You make it hard to guess

Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind?
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Tell me what you need so we don't have this fight
Come on and open up
Open up my love
I know it's a front, you've been hiding behind
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me, what's really on your mind?

I don't believe the last thing that I said's
The real reason you're so upset

Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind?
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Tell me what you need so we don't have this fight
Come on and open up
Open up my love
I know it's a front you've been hiding behind
Come on and open up
Open up my love
Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind?

And open up (Come on and open up)
And open up (Come on and open up)
Yeah open up (Come on and open up)
And open up
