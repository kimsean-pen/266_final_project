The new years getting older, the February roses are withered away
The sun keeps getting closer, sinking a little slower everyday
Ooo it's getting louder at the lights, music clashing in the street, moon shining on the parking lot daws
Tanned legs in the nights, sliding out of the sea, stilettos at the crosswalk
I graduated but every year in May I get that 'schools out' feeling
I feel it creeping in, every day's a weekend and I'm drowning in the freedom

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much i love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
I've gone off the deep end, the company of keeping is messing me up
The good girls at home sleeping, while I'm out creeping til the sun comes up
Ooo i've got my phone faced down, and my hair combed back, riding round getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls holding hands and forgetting their names
I graduated but every year in May I get that 'schools out' feeling
Don't wanna leave her, but damn it I'm not a cheater and I can't help leaving

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
All of these pretty young thangs (pretty young thangs)
Can make you forget a goodbye sad
Try to make a good guy bad

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer
Why do I love all of these city girls
Why do I love all of these city girls
Why do I love all of these city girls with pretty eyes
Down on the money and Broken hearted rich girls, the debutants, the small town runaways
All dolled up at the bar, with debit cards, they don't know how pretty they are
City girls, city girls
