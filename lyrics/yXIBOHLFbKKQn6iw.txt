I can't see in this darkness
So in need of forgiveness
Before all of my faith dies
Show me the way like a northern light

Come find me 'cause I can't find myself

I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But I'm feeling lost can you save me
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve

Don't know how I got where I am
Hurting so much I need healing
All I have is what I can pray
Send me your mercy I need your grace

I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But I'm feeling lost can you save me
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve

Come find me 'cause I can't find myself

I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But I'm feeling lost can you save me
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
I'm looking for you on Christmas Eve
