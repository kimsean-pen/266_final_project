Colors are what
Keep me alive
Colors are what
To hold in my head

Colors are where my
My old meets new
Colors are where my
My brain finds blue

Colors and colors and colors of colors
Colors and colors and colors of colors
Colors and colors and colors of colors
Colors and colors and colors of colors

Bursts are where
I find a face
Bursts are made
To color me rich
Bursts are blocks
Stickle bricks
Bursts of color
Until I'm sick

Colors and colors and colors of colors (I only wanted for to see)
Colors and colors and colors of colors
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colors and colors and colors of
colors (Everything you want is not free)
Colors and colors and colors of colors

Colors and colors and colors of
colors (I'm everything a girl could need)
Colors and colors and colors of colors
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colors and colors and colors of
colors (If everything you want is free)
Colors and colors and colors of colors

Colors and colors and colors of
colors (I'm everything a girl could need)
Colors and colors and colors of colors
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colors and colors and colors of
colors (If everything you want is free)
Colors and colors and colors of colors

Colors and colors and colors of
colors (If everything you want is free)
Colors and colors and colors of colors
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colors and colors and colors of colors (I only wanted for to see)
Colors and colors and colors of colors

Colors and colors and colors of colors (I only wanted for to see)
Colors and colors and colors of colors
(There's nothing in this heart but me)
Colors and colors and colors of
colors (Everything you want is not free)
Colors and colors and colors of colors (Free, free)
