White hot stone, waiting in the sky.
You're a big big drip of light.
When you go will you say goodbye?
I've got big big lips tonight.

Black hair, enfold me.
We could rent a room in all the range between.

Stoop to hold me.
Know what soothe means.
Boundless beauty.
Always burning.

I'll pull you down,
where there's no one else around.
I'll pull you down,
where there's no one else around.

Baby, you're so skyward gazing.
Did I wake you up?
Did I make your nose bleed?
Can you feel my touch?
Do you think I'm lovely?

Black cat howling at the warm spot on my hand.
Sense my heat.
Slink through my feet.
You're wild and you're sweet.
You stay when you leave.

There's a big light, always burning.
There's a long night, full of yearning.
There's a big weight, always growing.
there's the day break, I'll be going.

I'll pull you down,
where there's no one else around.
I'll pull you down,
where there's no one else around.
