In the days, in the nights,
In the hours leading up to your death
I won't weep, I won't weep
[x3]
In the days, in the nights,
In the hours leading up to your death

I dream of you oh my strangler
I dream of you oh my
I dream of you oh my strangler
I dream of you oh my

In the days, in the nights,
In the hours leading up to your death
I won't weep, I won't weep
[x3]

I dream of you oh my strangler
I dream of you oh my
I dream of you oh my strangler
I dream of you oh my
Oh my
