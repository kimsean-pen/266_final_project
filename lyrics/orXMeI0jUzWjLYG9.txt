(C. Currie/K. Fowley/K. Krome/S. West)

We speak in codes and no one knows
Cause we're living a double life
Kept inside our love dreams hide
Cause we're living a double life

Secrets
We're got dreams
Mysteries
And crazy schemes
Secrets
We've got dreams
Secrets
Can't be seen

Out on the street the shadows meet
Cause we're living a double life
We can't tell it fits so well
Thats we're living a double life

Secrets
We're got dreams
Mysteries
And crazy schemes
Secrets
We've got dreams
Secrets
Can't be seen

Shhh someones coming
Shhh be quiet
If we get caught
Just deny it
