We had a bad year
Forget and erase it
Too many people at the bar
Too many people playing on card
Too many people I adore ain't round no more
Too many people I don't know
Too many people I'm unsure of
So many people I can't think
You better get me something to drink

Something to drink
Something to drink

I grew up this year
Home truths, had to face that I thought the world was a good place
I thought that I might still be saved
I trusted people, now all I think
You'd better give me something to drink

Something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink
So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

So when you find me in the crowd
And you're shouting out, I'll be happy to see you
Be happy to see you here
Be happy to see you in the crowd
Getting rowdy now
Be happy to see you
Be happy to see you here

There's too many people at the bar
And the queue's not moved at all
Pushing my way to the front
Cause all I want to do is be drunk

So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
Just give me something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink

So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
So I don't feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
Just give me something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink
Something to drink

We had a bad year
Forget and erase it
