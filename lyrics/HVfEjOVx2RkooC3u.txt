High on the hill with the lonely goatherd
Lay odl lay odl lay he hoo
Yodel back with the girl & goatherd
Lay odl lay odl oh.
Wind It Up, Wind It Up, Wind It Up!
Odl lay odl lay odl-oo.
Yeah.
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much.
They like the way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape.
She's crazy, right?
They like the way we react every time we hear the...
Every time the bass bang
Realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up
And don't stop 'til your time is up.
Get in line now.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.,,,,,,
Come on.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Odl lay odl lay odl-oo.
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up & let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare.
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs & cars that go...
Every time the bass bang
Realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up
And don't stop 'til your time is up.
Get in line now.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Are you all ready?
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh...
Wind It Up!
Odl lay odl lay odl-oo.
Uh-huh, it's your moment
Uh-huh, come on girl, you know you own it
Uh-huh, you know your key is still tick-tockin'
Hell yeah, but you know they're watchin'.
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl...
To the front, to the side
To the back, but don't let him ride
Keep goin' girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks your fine & stuff.
But does he know how to wind you up?
Come on.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh...
Wind It Up! Uh, uh, uh.
Wind It Up!
Odl lay odl lay odl lay, hey!
