Ragtime fast lane another overdose
You know James Dean wasn't playing the role
I said hey, you, whatcha gonna do
When time runs out on you?

Use it or lose it
Sweet pain is the name of the game
I said, hey hey, hey hey hey

You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey
You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey

Hey hey hey, don't throw it away

JFK, Marilyn Monroe
Street walking gypsy, Margaret Trudeau
I said hey, you, whatcha gonna do
When time's run out on you?

Use it or lose it
Sweet time is it on my side?
I said, hey hey, hey hey hey

You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey
You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey

Hey hey hey, don't throw it away

Sweet pain is the name of the game
I said, hey hey, hey hey hey

You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey
You better use it, before you lose it
You better use it, don't throw it away, hey

Hey hey hey, don't throw it away

Don't throw it away
