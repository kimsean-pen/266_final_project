Gonna find me a river, gonna make myself a bed
Where the fishes sleep and no man's ever been
Gonna call your name with my very last breath
Gonna get gone, get gone

When I walk through town no one sees my face
Except the crow whose shadow takes my place
But I'll be waiting, calling out your name
Gonna get gone, get gone

When you're driving upstate
And the street lights change
Oh, do you remember me?
When the skyline pulls
Out the darkest night
Oh, do you remember me?

Well the sheriff and your name carved in the sand
The very last words written by my hand
Well, don't cry for me like you never did
Gonna get gone, get gone

When you're driving upstate
And the street lights change
Oh, do you remember me?
When the skyline pulls
Out the darkest night
Oh, do you remember me?

When I float downstream I don't make no waves
And the sun don't cast my shadow any place
But I'll be waiting, calling out your name
Gonna get gone, get gone

When you're driving upstate
And the street lights change
Oh, do you remember me?
When the skyline pulls
Out the darkest night
Oh, do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
