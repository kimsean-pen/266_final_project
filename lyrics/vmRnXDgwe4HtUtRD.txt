Cut and crossed over, appearing and keeping hold.
Let you see, and touch, before it is struck and taken.
After the first movement, it comes forward.
In a revelation, it is scorched, bitter.
Structures of movement escape,
and change into something
removed from nothing.
Rattled by and by, as if someone was right.
Drawn and downed, indifference stands.
But a light from deep, it glows.
They must have seen it too.
Rattled.
