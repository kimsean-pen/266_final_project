I've been waiting all this time
Watching my shadows arrange
I've been straying from the course hoping to make a change
I have worked against my code
Forcing my feet to align
I've been straining every cord controlling my slumber spine

He will never leave his burning star
He will never cross the tainted element
He will never leave his solitude
He will never leave his solitude

I've been training to depart
Like statues preparing to fly
I've collected every sight needed to calm my eye
I've been holding back the night
Now I'm holding back the day

Patiently reaching for dark terrain
Hoping his self-restraint disappears
He will keep searching for confidence
Watching the evidence in his fears

But he will never leave his burning star
He will never cross the tainted element
He will never leave his solitude
'Cause he will never leave his thoughts of you
