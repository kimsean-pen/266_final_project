Underground or Aeroplane
Doesn't matter in the end

I know it has to be this way
You're leaving me again

So I'll write my little love song
And I'll sing it to the wind

So you're out there on the road tonight
London, New York, Amsterdam

And I'm lonely here without you
Miss your breath against my skin

You love me then you leave me still I lie here
Pressing fingers, where your kisses have been
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you

I know that I should be in bed
It's almost 3AM
But when I close my eyes I only see miles of headlights
Fleshing out the distance

'Cause I know that its been calling to you
London, New York, Amsterdam

So I'll sing my little lonely songs
It's just part of who I am

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you

And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you

'Cause I know that its been calling to you
London, New York, Amsterdam
