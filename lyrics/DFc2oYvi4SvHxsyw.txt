So I been doin' a good job
Of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

And if I go out tonight
Dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh, oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good
And that I'm happy now
Ooh ooh
I shoulda known when things were going good
That's when I'd get knocked down

Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no (Oh no)
Oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Oh please
Oh please
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
