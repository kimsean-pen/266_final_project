Push
This sugar will kill your pain
Push
This sugar will kill your pain
Push
This sugar will kill your pain
Push
This sugar will kill your pain

Push!

Sate your frustration
Quench your sick desire
Sweeten your pain with fairy dust
As desperation melts down this toxic powder
On that spoon you set your life on fire

Sense of shame to forget
Far astray you'll wander
Isolated in regret
Narcotize your existence

It's self-destruction
It's suicide
These wicked voices bewitch you
But you're too young to die

Speak to your torment honey
And listen to your soul
As we're the temple of strength
And we must soldier on

Push! Push! Push! Push!
I want to see you push
The hunter has become the prey
The master's turned into a slave

Push! Push! Push! Push!
We all want to see you push
Your mother's cry, your father's prayers
They just mean nothing

Push!
And pump this venom through the veins
Into your bleeding heart
Push!
And put an end to all this pain with this final act
Push!

Orgasmic rapture, down in a hole
The needle bleeds the pleasure grows
Internal fracture, denial of your soul
Your blood freezes your body

Push! Push! Push! Push!
So let me see you push
The hunter has become the prey
The master's turned into a slave

Push! Push! Push! Push!
We all want to see you push
Your mother's cry, your father's prayers
Make way for silence

Push!
And pump this venom through the veins
Into your bleeding heart
Push!
And put an end to all this pain with this final act

How can you do this to yourself, in your very prime?
Life's worth living no matter what is the sacrifice
Fight!
