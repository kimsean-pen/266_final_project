I can see it
The way you look at me

Stare, kind of rare
Put your eyes where they shouldn't be
I'm forbidden
Are you an enemy?

Cause lately I've been doomed
In my velvet red room
Every time you do
The sparkles "Boom"
For a little ache in bloom

You've been following my downfall
You see Hope
You see Hope like a burden
So silent in the wonder
And I've been losing my strength to
Keep control
Keep control over your eyes like thunder

Mmm...
Dip me down into your Mercury lair
Boy, you dare put your kisses where they shouldn't be

If you're holy
Oh, won't you pacify me?
Cause lately I've been sinking
I've been losing my mind to a space-
A time we could untie & I wouldn't have to hide

You've been following my downfall
You see Hope
You see Hope like a burden
So silent in the wonder
And I've been losing my strength to
Keep control
Keep control over your eyes like thunder
Oh, won't you come ever?
Won't you come to me?
Heaven is when you're touching me
Heaven could be where you want it to be
Heaven could be where you want it to be
Heaven could be...
