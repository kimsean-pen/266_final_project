Come in alone
You'll love
To let go
And I'll turn
You around
When your hopes
Gave me doubts

Run and hide
__ ____
Why I don't need
To believe
What you see
To look up
And around
You were gone
(Words came out)
To a sound

Feel
I'm alive
You will see
(Why I'm alive)
Felt like crying
Over her
I will go
To the wall
Run from some

Come in alone
You'll love
To let go
And I'll turn
You around
When your hope
Gave me doubts
Love and hide
