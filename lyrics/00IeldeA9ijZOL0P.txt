Yeah
Yeah

Love always finds a way, every single time
Once we learn to trust our heart
(And know inside it feels just right)

Now we see who we are, in a different light
We're not so far apart
(Anything is possible)

With all the differences, we're stronger here
Now the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through now it's clear
That all of us, we share

One World (One World)
One Love (One Love)
One All (One All)
We're a circle together

One World (One World)
One Heart (One Heart)
One Song (One Song)
Now and forever

Everybody Celebrate!
Bring on the party, bring on the dance!
Time to let the music Play!
The Party never ends!

Everybody every world!
Stand up and shout, say it loud!
Everyone around the world!
Come on and join in!

We're gathered here today, everything just right
'Cause when you give from your heart
(The things you do come back to you)

Dare to be strong and brave, not afraid to try
That's when we see who we are
(The best of friends, and that's fun)

With all the differences, we're stronger here
Now the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through, now it's clear
We're all right here to share

One World (One World)
One Love (One Love)
One All (One All)
We're a circle together

One World (One World)
One Heart (One Heart)
One Song (One Song)
Now and forever

Oh, I never knew that love, would find a way to bring together both of us
Now inside, I know it's true
'Cause what we have is meant to be, you let me be the real me
Together here is were we belong

One World (One World)
One Love (One Love)
One All (One All)
We're a circle together

One World (One World)
One Heart (One Heart)
One Song (One Song)
Now and forever

One World (One World)
One Love (One Love)
One All (One All)
We're a circle together

One World (One World)
One Heart (One Heart)
One Song (One Song)
Now and forever

We're a circle together
Now and forever
One World
