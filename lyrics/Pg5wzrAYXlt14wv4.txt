Why'd you tell me this
While you look for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be the one?

You don't have to prove to me
You're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own

You belong to me in this life
Anyone could tell
Any fool can see who you need
I know all, you all too well

You don't have to prove to me
You're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes and I can tell

(You belong to me)
Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Oh, girl, you belong to me
(You belong to me)

Tell him he's a stranger
(You belong to me)
You belong to me

Tell him
(You belong to me)
That you belong to me
(You belong to me)

Girl, girl
(You belong to me)
Tell him he's a stranger
(You belong to me)

Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Yeah
(You belong to me)
Please, girl
(You belong to me)

You belong to me
(You belong to me)
(You belong to me)
Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
