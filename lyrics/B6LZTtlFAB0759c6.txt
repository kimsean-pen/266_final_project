He drives a truck
And he makes Time On Your Side
The water splashes from his flaps for miles
And 3 am on the I5 in the dark
As he moves away

Not much to do
When you've got Time On Your Side
You sit and think
About your wasted life
I try to move
Change things through and through

Why does your face grow so long my dear
Why did your hair grow so long this year
Why does your face grow so long my dear
Why did your hair grow so long, so long... this year
Oh and so long, and so long this year

She's a dancer
When she dances she is free
And 3 in the morning
And clouds rise in the east
To Frank Sinatra which your parents put on repeat
On repeat
