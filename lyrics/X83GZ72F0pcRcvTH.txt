Two words
Rock, chalk, shot a jayhawk
Never been to jail 'cause I never get caught
I got smarts, dark, dangerous dog
ODB got it right from the start
You got one and you changed from crazy to calm
I've been awake for days in the dusk and the dawn
And you're loving me whether you want to or not
I want you for sure, I am loving you more

I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

Who heard?
What, no, no right from the start
Go sell that shit somewhere farther from the heart
Running, and running, and running, and stop
Come on, we both knew this thing would be hard
I see art
You see class
You think
You ask
You say darling am I a chore?
I said I know you love me
I am loving you more

I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

Pick up the perfect card
Slip into smiling wildly
After the rest have gone
We become beyond timeless
Give you everything that I have ever owned
Soon I will have bought us up a house and home
Up on the seventh floor
I know you love me, I am loving you more

I am loving you, more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
