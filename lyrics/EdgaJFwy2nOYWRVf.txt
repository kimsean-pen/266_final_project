You can't escape the wrath of my heart
Beating to your funeral song
All faith is lust for hell regained
And love dust in the hands of shame

Let me bleed you this song of my heart deformed
Lead you along this path in the dark
Where I belong until I feel your warmth

Hold me like you held on to life
When all fears came alive and entombed me
Love me like you loved the sun
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart

I'll be the thorns in every rose
you've been sent by hope
(You'll grow cold)
I am the nightmare waking you up
from the dream of a dream of love
(Just like before)

Let me weep you this poem as heaven's gates close
Paint you my soul scarred and alone
Waiting for your kiss to take me back home

Hold me like you held on to life
When all fears came alive and entombed me
Love me like you loved the sun
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart

Hold me like you held on to life
When all fears came alive and entombed me
Love me like you loved the sun
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart

Hold me like you held on to life
(Like you held onto life)
(When all fears came alive and entombed me)
My vampire heart
Love me like you loved the sun
(Love me like you loved the sun)
(Scorching the blood in my)
My vampire heart
