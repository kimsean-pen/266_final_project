The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one

It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not that kinda girl who gives up just like that
No no no no no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one...

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait, my dear, till it's my turn
I'm not that kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
No no no no no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one...

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
When I was kick back relax wit my old school crew
Was rollin in the jeep, top down, loud sound
Bumped into this girl and her was Billie P
My man was like "the girl was on tv"
I'm like Hugh, what's the song again?
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
Yeah, that's right, she's got a real tight diddy
If you're getting down, i got the keys to your city

I'm not that kinda girl who gives up just like that
No no no no no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one...
