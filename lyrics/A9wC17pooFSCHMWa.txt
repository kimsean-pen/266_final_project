Waiting for an Indian summer
For the time we lost, to come alive
Kiss me and my body will shudder
September skies electrified

I've been waiting here a hundred nights
Watching everybody drink our wine
And I've been wondering why
I didn't have you by my side

Can you give me an encore, one more to end the show
I didn't get what I came for, came for, the afterglow
Show me what it takes for the dead to rise
Just say the word and I'll paint the skies
For an Indian summer
To come alive

Praying love will never go under
A harvest moon to light the skies
Autumn leaves one after another
You make me watch the flowers dry

I've been waiting here a hundred nights
Watching everybody drink our wine
I've been wondering why
I didn't have you by my side

Can you give me an encore, one more, to end the show
I didn't get what I came for, came for, the afterglow
Show me what it takes for the dead to rise
Just say the word and I'll paint the skies
For an Indian summer
To come alive
To come alive

Show me what it takes for the dead to rise
Just say the word and I'll paint the skies
For an Indian summer to come alive
