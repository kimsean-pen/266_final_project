Let me tell you a story that'll make you change
I'll tell you when I'm way out of range
It's about a man who's cruel and mean
So promise not to cause a scene
Then heaven help the ones you love
There's nowhere 'neath the stars above
Where you can run you know he'll find you
It don't matter now, just look behind you
You had your warning, you knew the score
You got it wrong and that means war
So why'd you have to treat me rough
Your explanation's not enough

Ain't nobody but me
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you
Ain't no fish in the sea

Gonna sigh for you

Gonna try for you
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you

You see, I got a double disposition
Sometimes I'm mean, sometimes I'm vicious

I'm Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde
So if you want to stay alive
Just give me all you've got to give
And then perhaps I'll let you live

Ain't nobody but me
Gonna lie for you

Gonna die for you
Ain't no fish in the sea
Gonna sigh for you

Gonna try for you
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you
Gonna sigh for you
Gonna try for you
Gonna lie for you
Gonna die for you

(Hush) Now baby, stop your cryin'
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lyin'
(Hush) Now baby, stop your cryin'
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lyin'
(Hush) Now baby, stop your cryin'
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lyin'
(Hush) Now baby, stop your cryin'
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lyin'
(Hush) Now baby, stop your cryin' aah
