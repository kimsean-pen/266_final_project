I look through the window
To the coming dawn
Feel my body tingle
'Cause these days I don't sleep through the night

I should be a driver
I drive so true
Life's just an empty road
In the end it will lead back to you
In the end it will lead back to you

And when I find you
You show me the truth
You show me how I can sleep through the night
How I can sleep through the night

I don't care
I don't care anymore
Not like before

I don't care
I don't have to care anymore
Days go by and I will stay beside you

Looking up to the picture
Hanging on my wall
Reminds me of simple times
'Cause these days I don't sleep through the night

I should be an ocean
I get so blue
And you would be paradise
In the end I will run back to you
In the end I will run back to you

And when I find you
You show me the truth
You show me how I can sleep through the night
How I can sleep through the night

I don't care
I don't care anymore
Not like before

I don't care
I don't have to care anymore
Days go by and I will stay beside you

I don't care
I don't care anymore
Not like before

I don't care
I don't have to care anymore
Days go by and I will stay beside you
