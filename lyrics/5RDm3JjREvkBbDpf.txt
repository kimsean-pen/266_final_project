Well she's made of fire
and she's made of wind
She can take you higher
but she's not your friend
She don't beg, crawl, rise, fall

Well she's in no doubt that she just can't lose
She got no way out, she's no one's muse
She don't need, pray, bleed
Gets the job done any old way

No one ever told her that the world was under her skin
She goes to sleep in every place you know you never have been

Turn yourself around and she won't be there
You just won't see her cause she just don't care
Change you name and bury your dead
Leave some space for her in your head

Well she's in no doubt that she just can't lose
She got now way out, she's no one's muse
She don't need, pray, bleed
Gets the job done any old way

No one ever told her that the world was under her skin
She goes to sleep in every place that you know you never have been

Turn yourself around and she won't be there
You just won't see her cause she just don't care
Change your name and bury your dead
Leave some space for her in your head

Throw away your rights and wrongs
leave them in the dust
Forget the day that you were born
she'll take whatever she must

Well she's made of fire
and she's made of wind
She can take you higher
but she's not your friend
She don't beg, crawl, rise, fall

Well she's in no doubt that she just can't lose
She got no way out, she's no one's muse
She don't need, pray, bleed
Gets the job done any old way

No one ever told her that the world was under her skin
She goes to sleep in every place you know you never have been

Turn yourself around and she won't be there
You just won't see her cause she just don't care
Change your name and bury your dead
Leave some space for her in your head

Throw away your rights and wrongs
leave them in the dust
Forget the day that you were born
she'll take whatever she must
Take whatever she must
Take whatever she must
