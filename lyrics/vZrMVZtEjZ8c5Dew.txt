2008, watch it! Yeah!
Yo, Mariah Carey alongside Gong Marley
Huh, natty, check it, pepper!
(Y'all know what this is)

Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it but it's somethin' 'bout him
Makin me hot like a motor revvin' over and over
It don't stop, he cruised beside me now I'm flyin', driving

Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control, no, no, no

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But uh oh, I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him, I need cruise control

Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh hes so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go, gotta get on cruise control

C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control

Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes into view
Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin'
On me avenue

When the door open, de gals pon de block
They be hopin' to rob the clock
He said, no man, step up, step up
Bottle broken, think I'm jokin'?

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But uh oh, I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him I need cruise control

Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh hes so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go, gotta get on cruise control

You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law

You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want
(Why you always?)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis
Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh hes so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go, gotta get on cruise control
