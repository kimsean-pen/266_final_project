I'm thinking of my soul severity
And I know everything you hate in me
Fill me up with over-pious badgerate
Throw them up; one of my favorite things

Too bad the things that make you mad
Are my favorite things
My favorite things

Remember all the lessons fed to me
Me, the young sponge, so ready to agree
Years have gone; recognize the walking dead
Now aware that I'm alive and way ahead

Too bad the things that make you mad
Are my favorite things
Hell ya
Wo ya
I'm so happy

I see you looking
I know that you're thinking
That I'll never go anywhere
The things that I've done
And the things that I've seen
I don't really expect you to care
Go!

Too bad the things that make you mad
Are my favorite things
Hell ya
Wo ya
I'm so happy
Too bad the things that make you mad
Are my favorite
Too bad the things that make you mad
Are my favorite things.
