Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love, living a Christian soul
What do we get, she runs away
What about love, what about all I pray
Don't know the worst, she knows a priest
What about God, living is all I see
What do you get, things she would say
What about love, that's all I pray
Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
Sister's confused, she went alone
What about love, what about all I saw
Biding a life, reading the words
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse, what about all I've seen
You know the lie, you keep it low
What about heart, that's all I've known
Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (whoo)
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
Look at my words, what do they say
Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak
What do you get, what do you say
What about love, I feel my sin
Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (whoo)
Think about life, I'd like to have my child (whoo)
Who have the grateful, where will she go
What will she do to see the world
Sister don't know, where would she go
What about love, what about all I saw
What would you get, don't get so confuse
Love all the things, it's just the things I do
Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I'd like to have my child
