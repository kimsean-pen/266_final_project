We said that we were meant to be
That we were each other's destiny
And now we faded away
Maybe it's too late
Now it's time for us to get it straight

I'll never forget you but I'll be gone
I'll always respect you and life goes on
I'll never forget you, I'll never forget you

I'll hold on to the memory
Now that you and I are history
And why we will never know
Sometimes you let go
What you used to keep within your soul

I'll never forget you but I'll be gone
I'll always respect you and life goes on
I'll never forget you, I'll never forget you

Our moments together
I will keep them forever
Our hearts must surrender

I'll never forget you but I'll be gone
I'll always respect you and life goes on
I'll never forget you, I'll never forget you

I'll never forget you but I'll be gone
I'll always respect you and life goes on
I'll never forget you, I'll never forget you
