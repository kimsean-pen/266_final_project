Friday night it was late I was walking you home we got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
How to tell you girl...
I wanna build my world around you...
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan...
That's the way it began we were hand in hand
Glenn Miller's band was better than before

We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune
(Night and Day)

Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone...
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old

We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night it was late I was walking you home we got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Now as the years roll on...
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing spending the hours reminiscing...
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
(woo ooh-ooh)
Walking through the park and reminiscing
