Fists raised if you cause a reaction
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with me
I can tell by the way that you're acting
And we could both agree

I never felt so low
But I love the way I look, yeah
With this bloody nose
Look how many hits it took, yeah

I mix pain with this little satisfaction
They go together all the same to me
I'm just trying to stay ahead of the action
And we could both agree

I never felt so low
But I love the way I look, yeah
With this bloody nose
Look how many hits it took, yeah

Here I go down this broken road
My smile still shows through my bloody nose
Still, I go, ooh
Still, I go, ooh
Yeah, I go, ooh

I smile, but there's blood in my reflection
There's violence in the poetry
When it's over, there's no resurrection
At least for you and me

I never felt so low
But I love the way I look, yeah
With this bloody nose
Look how many hits it took, yeah

Here I go down this broken road
My smile still shows through my bloody nose
Still, I go, ooh
Still, I go, ooh
Yeah, I go, ooh

Though words are just like violence
Today I'll break the silence
This could be goodbye, kid
Do you see me when you close your eyelids?
Today I'mma get back up
Fists raised, let's get close up
Your life won't be so rough
Get the fuck up 'cause we've had enough

Here we lay
In our final hours like dying flowers
The price we pay
As you struggle for power that your ego devours

Here I go down this broken road
My smile still shows through my bloody nose
Still, I go, ooh
Still, I go, ooh
Yeah, I go, ooh

Though words are just like violence
Today I'll break the silence
This could be goodbye, kid
Do you see me when you close your eyelids?
