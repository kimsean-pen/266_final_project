When I was a kid I played with them toys
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Now I grow older I make a lot of noise
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy

Lights camera but action
Motherfuckers wanna make me put my hand on my hand gun
So I raised up drew down and blammed em
Now they runnin like they never seen no murderin happen
It's like every day I wake up and pray
I pray hate don't take ahold of me
I know god got a purpose and a soul for me
Cuz I ain't got one for myself its takin over me

When I was a kid I played with them toys
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Now I grow older I make a lot of noise
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy

Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy

You scared of gun shots boy
Pussy boy
Wanna run and tell the cops boy
Pussy boy
I'm a real don dada boy
Pussy boy
Shottas comin out that Glock boy
Pussy boy

Choppin and movin them thangs in
Coppers and we don't make statements
Rackin the tool how my day spent
Droppin a fool on the pavement
Oh it's the boogeyman
I bet you hoped you'd never hear that again
You wanna see a dead body
You wanna see an armed robbery
Long clips that's them tracking shots
I track a boy around the block then his block was hot
Framed him up aimed him up then I shot the actor
Is you game or what?
Boy is you target practice
See some people wanna be famous I just wanna grip stainless
Mamma I know that you pray bitch but
some children just can't be saved bitch
I'm a real rude boy I don't ever run I only
touch hands with boys whose hands squeeze guns

When I was a kid I played with them toys
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Now I grow older I make a lot of noise
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy

Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy
Bang guns boy bang bang guns boy

And I feel like were the only ones
Were the only ones
With the drums on our guns
Were the only ones
With the drums on our guns

And I feel like were the only ones
Were the only ones
With the drums on our guns
Were the only ones
With the drums on our guns
