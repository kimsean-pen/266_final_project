Fools
They don't know
What they're on about
Those fools
Don't get bad dreams

And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it all

You can't wait to watch me fall

I sing stories on a wrecking ball
Colliding, ask to bring you down

If you want it, you want it, you want it
If you want it, you want it, you want it all

Sometimes, things we build to fall

And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it all

And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it all
