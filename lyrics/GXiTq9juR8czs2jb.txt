I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
I'm born with this mighty sin
Thinking about the naked women in my bed

I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
Conversation based around just sex
Words at the tip of my tongue
Oh damn baby

I'm born with this mighty sin
Tell me one thing I must forget
Thinking about the naked women in my bed
Lost at the tip of my mind
Oh damn baby

I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
Conversation based around just sex
Words at the tip of my tongue
Oh damn baby

I'm born with this mighty sin
Tell me one thing I must forget
Thinking about the naked women in my bed
Lost at the tip of my mind
Oh damn baby

I need to be your lover
I need to be your king

I need to be your lover
I need to be your king
I need to be your lover
Everything in between
I need to be your lover
You need to be my queen
Kiss me in my dreams
And tell me paradise is what we see

I have seen your face
Kiss me in my dreams
Tell me I won't wait
Paradise awaits

Baby you wanna love me
Baby you wanna touch me
Baby you wanna kiss me
It's alright
Baby you wanna love me
Baby you wanna touch me
Baby you wanna kiss me
It's alright

I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
I'm born with this mighty sin
Thinking about the naked women in my bed

I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
Conversation based around just sex
Words at the tip of my tongue
Oh damn baby

I'm born with this mighty sin
Tell me one thing I must forget
Thinking about the naked women in my bed
Lost at the tip of my mind
Oh damn baby

I need to be your lover
I need to be your king
I need to be your lover
Everything in between
I need to be your lover
You need to be my queen
Kiss me in my dreams
And tell me paradise is what we see

I have seen your face
Kiss me in my dreams
Tell me I won't wait
Paradise awaits

Baby you wanna love me
