Tears of a clown
My face has the tears of a clown
Tears of a, of a . clown...

I lay here awake, unable to dream, here in a state...
Disconnected from you, oh oh!
A pretentious glare, how you don't care, Oh I don't care...

The Tears of a clown, falling, falling, falling, down my face,
Does anybody really care...

I'm just a clown, clown, clown, clown, clown, to you...
I'm just a clown...

(but) darling look over the moon, what do you see?
darling look over the moon, what do you see, what do you see?
