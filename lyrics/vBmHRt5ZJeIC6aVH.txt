Here's to being human
All the pain and suffering
There's beauty in the bleeding
At least you feel something

I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong, but

I am machine
I never sleep, I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something

Here's to being human
Taking it for granted
The highs and lows of living
To getting second chances

I wish I knew what it was like
To care about what's right or wrong
I wish someone could help me find
Find a place where I belong, but

I am machine
I never sleep, I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something

It wasn't supposed to be this way
We were meant to feel the pain
I don't like what I am becoming
Wish I could just feel something

I am machine
I never sleep, I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something
I am machine
I never sleep until I fix what's broken
I am machine
A part of me wishes I could just feel something
