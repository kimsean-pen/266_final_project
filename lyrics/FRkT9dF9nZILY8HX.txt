Down on your knees, you'll be left behind
This is the beginning
Watch what you think, they can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
Well, my reflection I don't recognize
This is the beginning

We think we've climbed so high
Up all the backs we've condemned
We face a consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn, you'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way, 'cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
God helps the ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late, as far as I can tell
This is the beginning

We think we've come so far
On all the lies we depend
They say no consequence
This is the beginning of the end
