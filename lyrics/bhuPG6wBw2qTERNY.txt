I don't wanna talk about it
And I think we both know why
I wish it wasn't automatic
The way I want you every time

I see shades of you when I don't want to
Can't think straight since you've been gone
Saw someone out in your go-to outfit
Right when I thought I was on

You've got me off track
Got me thinking abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you

I hesitate to say the ocean
Could hold a candle to your eyes
You shut the door and cut me open
Now I'm wishin' I was colorblind

'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to
Right when I thought I was on

You've got me off track
Got me thinking abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you

You've got me off track
Got me thinking abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you
