Wherever you go
You know I'll be there
If you go far
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there
You place the name
You know I'll be there
You name the time
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I'll be there for you

Where there's truth
You know I'll be there
Amongst the lies
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I'll be there for you

If you should fall
You know I'll be there
To catch the call
You I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I don't care
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
