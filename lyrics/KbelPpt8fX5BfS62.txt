You said this isn't working, got to move on
You maybe right, perfection this is not
But what's the perfect love like, a flower or a flame?
You got something you want everything and never what you got

Cause how many times how many times how many times
Can you fall in love?

And how many loves how many loves how many loves
Make a life?

Sweet happiness they say comes in doses
Are they numbered and what's left of my stock?
Thinking 3 AM thoughts, in the 3 AM dark
Am I listening to my heartbeat or the ticking of the clock?

How many times how many times how many times
Can you fall in love?

And how many loves how many loves how many loves
Make a life?

Tell me how many times how many times how many times
Can you fall in love?

And how many loves how many loves how many loves
Make a life?

The girl behind the counter made his heart throb
He paid and got his change and turned to go
Thinks, he'll ask her out tomorrow
But tomorrow she'll be gone
It will take three weeks till he won't dream about her anymore

Thinking how many times how many times how many times
Can you fall in love?

And how many loves how many loves how many loves
Make a life?

How many times how many times how many times
Can you fall in love?

And how many loves how many loves how many loves
