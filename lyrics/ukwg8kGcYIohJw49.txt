Find your life, dont hide from what you are
And rise before you fall
And hope for something more
Live if you really want to
Live if you really want to
Live if you really want to

All my life, I've been looking for something amazing
Its almost like I've been star gazing
The sky is riding above me
Oh, oh, oh
We were meant for something bigger than this
Dont ever try to dismiss yourself
Cause you dont have to lose

Find your life, dont hide from what you are
And rise before you fall
And hope for something more
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to

All my life, my dreams just seemed so far away
And now its like they're here to stay
I hold it close to me
Oh, oh, oh
We were meant for something bigger than this
Dont ever try to dismiss yourself
Cause you dont have to lose

Find your life, dont hide from what you are
And rise before you fall
And hope for something more!
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
