Stray and play infinitely
No end and no beginning
Shed all your skin
And don your victories
Stray and let it sin

It only lasts so long
When it's gone, it's gone

In broad daylight I swear I'm alright, I'm alright
Picking my line
Just endeavouring to get it right
In daylight I swear I'm alright, I'm alright
Taking my time
Just been trying to change my mind

Wait, you feel on your back
No space to pay or counteract
Shed all your skin
And titles and masks
Pray before its past

It only lasts so long
When it's gone, it's gone

In broad daylight I swear I'm alright, I'm alright
Picking my line
Just endeavouring to get it right
In daylight I swear I'm alright, I'm alright
Taking my time
Just been trying to change my mind
