Don't you think it's time I let you know?
Don't you think I should before you go?
I'm not gonna let you get away
I want to fuck you night and day

I'm a pervert

I like to go out on dates
See a movie, communicate
We'll go home and have some fun
I'll tell you "Sure, you're the only one."

Then when I leave your house I smell
Of sex, and I know I'm a pervert because I like it
And I know I'm perverted because I want it
Want it all of the time

Don't you sometimes wonder what I want?
Don't you sometimes think I just want your cunt?
I'd hate to think that romance is just a pose
But all I wanna do is rip off your clothes

I'm a pervert

I'd like to hold you in my arms
You know I wouldn't do you harm
I never take advantage, in my book that's a sin
But somehow I find myself caressing your skin

And then there's a word on my mind, and that word is
"Fuck", and I know I'm a pervert because I like it
And I know I'm perverted because I want it
Want it all of the time
