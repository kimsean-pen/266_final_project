I'm laying in this hotel
Cuddling up to the body pillow
I'm trying not to call you
Cause I don't want to miss you no more

Every now and then I get a little lonely
I can hold myself but no it's not the same thing
Need to feel the pressure somewhere on my body
On my body, oh

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me
So touch me
So touch me

I can't get to sleep
Damn oh damn I'm trying now
Oh, I put on the Tv right here
Maybe it'll calm me down

Every now and then I get a little lonely
I can hold myself but no it's not the same thing
Need to feel the pressure somewhere on my body
On my body, oh

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me
So touch me
So touch me

All I want, all I want, all I wanna do
Is be touched by you
If you want, If you want, if you want it too
Tell me the truth
All I want, all I want, all I wanna do
Is be touched by you
And if you want it too
Just touch me

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me

Cause sometimes
All I wanna do is be touched
All I wanna do is be loved
All I wanna do is be touched
So touch me
Oh hustle baby
Oh hustle baby
Oh, so hustle baby
So touch me

the end
