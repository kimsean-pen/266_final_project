Uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

I met up with an acrobat
in Brooklyn or some place like that

With life and taxis flying past
we tore that dance hall down

Uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Pocket change and subway cars
Our big ideas filled empty bars

We might be from the moon or mars either way
I'm never going home

So lets hang an anchor from the sun
there's a million city lights
but you're number one

You're the reason
I'm still up at dawn
just to see your face
we'll be going strong
with the vampires baby

We belong
we belong awake

Swinging from the fire escape

Uh oh uh oh oh oh

I was drinking from the wishing well some junkie metal-head hotel

When we boarded the carousel
The roof was caving in

Uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

And on this stage
my ox blood friend
We're singing songs about the end
The bankers in lion's den
They're dropping lines
Like beggers in the snow

Uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

So lets hang an anchor from the sun
there's a million city lights
but you're number one

You're the reason
I'm still up at dawn
just to see your face
we'll be going strong
with the vampires baby

We belong
we belong awake

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Swinging from the fire escape

Walking home
Your hand in mine
Tattoos on the river line
The morning birds are taking flight
Either way I thought that you should know

You're my number one

You're the reason
I'm still up at dawn
just to see your face
we'll be going strong
with the vampires baby

We belong
we belong awake

Your're my number one

You're the reason
I'm still up at dawn
just to see your face
we'll be going strong
with the vampires baby

We belong
We belong awake

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh

Swinging from the fire escape
Uh oh uh oh oh oh
