Come fanatics, come to the sabbath
Thirteen dressed in black are here
Screaming, naked our altar
Kissed by the whi, now satans daughter

Our witchcult grows...

Black goat forms from dopesmoke
Baphomet we bow to thee
Higher, higher devils disciples
Nameless chants breed sorcery

Our witchcult grows...

Father, mother, our brethren your children
Black masses, black magic, with drugs
Our witchcult grows...
