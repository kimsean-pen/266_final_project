With every beautiful new sight,
I see that perfect golden light against your eyes.
Try to hold up,
Try to live it up.
See it when you touch
everything at once.
You only get what you put into this life,
so how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
OH! When you got this open ROAD,
and the sun is shining, how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
OH! With the top down driving SLOW,
all the love that I know, how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
Last night my dreams were on TV.
I stepped away to watch the world play out in front of me.
Slowly in your eyes
this is real life.
It's good enough for me,
Good enough tonight.
You only get what you put into this life,
so how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
OH! When you got this open ROAD,
and the sun is shining, how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
OH! With the top down driving SLOW,
all the love that I know, how could anybody be living in a Bad.
Dream, Dream, Dream x4
OH! When you got this open ROAD,
and the sun is shining, how could anybody be living in a Bad Dream?
OH! With the top down driving SLOW,
all the love that I know, how could anybody be living in a Bad...
Dream, Dream, Dream x3
Dream, Dream.
