If the walls were too thin,
You would break in, mmm,
If the walls were too thin,
You would break right in

Huh, huh, huh, huh...

Morning
Morning

Out in the thunder,
opens my eyes wide,
There is something in my mind,
Keeps me up at night,

Ooh when the window
Lets in hot whips of light
Before I feel it's time,
To control my mind.
