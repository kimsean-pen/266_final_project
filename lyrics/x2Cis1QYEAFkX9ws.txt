There's no fire without friction
That, you know, we are so good at
I said to you many times, "Don't push me around
'Cause that's what my daddy did"

And it don't work anyway
Just more fires, more burns
Taking turns to say, "What's wrong tonight?"
But nothing learnt

A and E, what you do to me
But you wait in the waiting room patiently
Black and blue, they say
But you're ready with the
Germaline to fix what you did today

And what you did, let's not say
What you did, let's not say
Oh, I can't believe it anyway

Back of the class, push in the queue
That's not you, perfect gentleman
Not so gentle hands, on a gentle man
Such a gentleman, I'm watching you with your mam
She's your biggest fan, I couldn't let her in on this today
Oh, she wouldn't believe it anyway

A and E, what you do to me
But you wait in the waiting room, patiently
Black and blue, they say
But you're ready with the
Germaline to fix what you did today

A and E, what you do to me
But you wait in the waiting room, patiently
Black and blue, they say

Germaline to fix what you did today

Back of the class, push in the queue
That's not you, 'perfect gentleman'
Not so gentle hands, on a gentle man
Such a gentleman, I'm watching you with your mam
She's your biggest fan, I couldn't let her in on this today
Oh, she wouldn't believe it anyway

I can't believe it anyway
I can't believe it anyway
I can't believe it anyway
I can't believe it anyway

A and E, what you do to me
But you wait in the waiting room, patiently
Black and blue, they say
