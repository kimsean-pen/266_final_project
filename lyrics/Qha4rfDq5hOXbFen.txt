(ow ow now ow ow)
(ow ow now ow ow)

You know it use to be alright,
when you woke me in the morning
waiting for the sun to shine
And do the two step all night
Then you'd spin me round and catch me
Laughing as the sun would rise
(sun would rise)

Ohh I don't know what to do
you speak a foreign language when you put me through
The enemies I know your hiding one or two,
but I just can't say no to you

So I can't let you go and you won't let me know

I can't let you go and ah you won't say

I can't let you go
and you won't let me know
I cant let you go I, I slip away
(ow ow now ow ow)
(ow ow now ow ow)

Boys its just a puzzle and the pieces they have scattered on the floor
(ow ow now ow ow)

It's a silly little game but the sentences are scribbled on the wall
(ow ow now ow ow)
You think you have the time but we should open up the rise and the bottom of the matter is it takes up all your time
Takes up all your time

Ohh I don't know what to do you speak a foreign language when you put me through
The enemies I know your hiding one or two, but I just can't say no to you

So I can't let you go and you won't let me know

I can't let you go and ah you won't say

I can't let you go and you won't let me know

I cant let you go I, I slip away
(ohh I slip I slip away)

never ending stories lead me to the door (so I) then I wait alone just like I did before
another mystery is laying down the rhymes seems you are distracted and you never have the time

So I can't let you go and you won't let me know

I can't let you go and ah you won't say
(you wont say you wont say)

I can't let you go and you won't let me know

I cant let you go I, I slip away
(I slip away)
