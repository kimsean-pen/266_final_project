Promises always leaking through the day
Happiness as the daylight turns away
But I hear those echoes in myself

Honey I'm staying in the night
I can see your darkness in the light
Honey I'm staying in the night, in the night
Flesh is flesh, and blood is life
A wild desire for the night
Honey I'm staying in the night, in the night

Falling with a heavy heart has marked
I will leave for moments in the dark
But I hear those echoes in myself
