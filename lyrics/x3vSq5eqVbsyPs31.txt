And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home

And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home

I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder that life is unkind
At the best of times

And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home

I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder that life is unkind
At the best of times

Brace your self
'Cause I think I'm coming for you
Look up into the sky

Home could be anywhere
When I am holding you
