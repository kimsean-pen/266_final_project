Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other
Watches him close
From that wire

He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar

I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand

I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds on a wire
One says come on
And the other says

I'm tired
The sky is overcast

And I'm sorry
One more or one less

Nobody's worried
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand

Two birds of a feather
Say that they're always
Gonna stay together
But one's never goin' to

Let go of that wire
He says that he will
But he's just a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other
Watches him close
From that wire
He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other
