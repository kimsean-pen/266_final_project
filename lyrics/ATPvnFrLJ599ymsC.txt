Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood?
There's a reason you don't want me around
Want me around

When the lake is freezing cold
And the city's underground
Will you feel me like the snow
Building up without a sound?
'Til I melt back into view
A bottle of red and a case of blues
Can I fall back into you?

You're unfazed
By the time we wasted saving face
Through the postcard on the floor
'Cause I screwed up like before
They say that time heals everything
But what if time is everything?

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood?
There's a reason you don't want me around
You play it chay and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around

When the air is filled with smoke
On the fourth day in July
Will you watch my heart explode?
Shed a brilliant disguise
In a disappearing bloom
I caught the darker shade of you
Then you did like you always do

You're unfazed
By the time we wasted saving face
Left a postcard on the porch
'Cause I've grown up a little more
They say that time heals everything
But what if time is everything?

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood?
There's a reason you don't want me around
You play it chay and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around
Want me around

I've been awake since 5 a.m.
Do you even wonder where I am?
Your time is floating away
I've been awake and I'll stay awake
Your time is floating away

So, will you call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood?
That there's a reason you don't want me around
You play it chay and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around

Afraid to call and see what's good
Or is it simply understood?
There's a reason you don't want me around
You play it chay and that's okay
But I don't buy the whole charade
Like it's a secret you don't want me around
