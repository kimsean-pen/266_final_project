Looking up at those stars
I know they're so far
Wanna be there with you
In time I'll take you there

'Cause you can make me fly
With me I'll take you high

We'll be on Mars
Bathing in stars
Our own private show
And nobody needs to know what we're doing

If you let me guide you
Say you want me to
Please let me in let me in

I'll take you to planets
You've never been to
I'll take you there take you there

'Cause you you take me higher
With me I'll make you fly
And nobody will ever stop us
We're going far from here

We'll be on Mars
Bathing in stars
Our own private show
And nobody nobody needs to know
What we're doing
What we're doing
What we're doing
What we're doing

If you let me guide you
Say you want me to
Please let me in let me in

I'll take you to planets
You've never been to
I'll take you there take you there

If you let me guide you (Baby If you)
Say you want me to
Please let me in let me in (let me in)

I'll take you to planets (you and me)
You've never been to (we will be)
I'll take you there take you there (together, forever)

We'll be on Mars
Bathing in stars
Our own private show
And nobody needs to know what we're doing
