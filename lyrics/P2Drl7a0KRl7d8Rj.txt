Meadowlark, fly your way down
I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
For you to wear upon your fleecy down

A meadowlark sing to me

Hummingbird, just let me down
Inside the broken ovals of your olive eyes
I do believe you gave it your best try

A hummingbird sing to me

Mmmmmmm...

My hummingbird sing to me

Don't believe a word that I haven't heard
Little children laughing at the boys and girl
The meadowlark singing to you each and every day
The orchid on the hillside and the market in the hay

Ooooh...
