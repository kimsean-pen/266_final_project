When I first saw you
I saw love
From the first time you touched me
I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmmm yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on

We're still together still goin' strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)

You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together

I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together still goin' strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to

The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love

The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
(You're still the one)
Yeah, (You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
