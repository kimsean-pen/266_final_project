You're all I need, all I don't

Talk smooth, play rough
You're calling my bluff
I've seen you too much
But not quite enough

And you want me
And you get me
And you want me
And you get me

(Ah)
You're all I need, all I don't
(Ah)
All I need, all I don't

All night, I knew
Just what you're up to
Too fall but not true
I'd hate to love you

And you want me
And you get me
And you want me
And you get me

(Ah)
You're all I need, all I don't
(Ah)
All I need, all I
(Ah)
You're all I need, all I don't
(Ah)
All I need, all I don't

Oh, uh, huh, All I don't

And you want me
And you get me
And you want me

(Ah)
You're all I need, all I don't
(Ah)
All I need, all I
(Ah)
You're all I need, all I don't
(Ah)
All I need, all I don't

All I need, all I don't
(All I don't, You're all I don't)
All I need, all I don't
(All I don't, You're all I don't)
All I need, all I don't
