It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for?
It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for?

I know just how it feels to be there
One step too far and it's on your mind
Your heart it falls like you do
You say that it hurts, say that it hurts

I'll walk away if you follow me
We're so far from
What we know could be
Lights from your house
Will shine over me

And we had...

You let me go right from start
Inwards you fall and it's on my mind
It was just like you asked for
You know that it was, know that it was

I'll walk away if you follow me
I'll walk away if you follow me

We're so far from
What we know could be
Lights from your house
Will shine over me

And we had...
And we had...

I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all

I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all

I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
I've got none you had it all
Can you feel it now it's gone?
Is it what you thought it was?
Can you really stop it now?

It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for?
It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for?

It's a long time
What you're looking for
It's a long time
What you're looking for
It's a long time
What you're looking for
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for?
