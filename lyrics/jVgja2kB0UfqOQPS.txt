Under the banner of death I am alive.
Amidst the storm of infinite darkness
my spirit still burns.
With the unyielding force of the tyrant
I live free.
A flaming spear cast into the heavens
shatters my chains.

In your fortress walls I see weakness.
In your prideful stare I see fear.
I claim my place in the eternal cycle,
Chargeless demon of retribution.

Under the banner of death I still live.
In the void of unknowing my will is realized.
Through the gauntlet of mirrors,
Reduced to essence, purified.
I speak my being in the language of fire.

UNDER THE BANNER OF DEATH I AM ALIVE.
I DECLARE MY BEING IN THE LANGUAGE OF FIRE.
