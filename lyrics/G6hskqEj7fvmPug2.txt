You were going round in circles
Covering the same old ground
The winds are coming up like soldiers
And we're just going round and round
Most of the grass is frozen
There's nothing that can thaw it out
But we continue trying to burn it
There's nothing that can help us now

'Cause every inch above is covered in our dust
And we were left alone but we betrayed the trust
'Cause what's in front of us is played for all to see
We're taking every step we can but we're not free, we're not free

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
