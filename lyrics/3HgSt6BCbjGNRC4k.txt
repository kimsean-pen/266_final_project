Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb

This shits contagious like a fucking disease
Infecting every stupid person that's in front of me
God damn
How blind are we
To only see the differences in everything
Hell on earth is what we seek
An apocalyptic sci-fi reality
Blow it up in front of me
Dancing in the streets with the dead bodies
Dancing in the streets with the dead bodies

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all time low
Can you get that through your skull
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?
Yeah

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb

Caustic, back once again
Has got me in a state of disbelief
Like "Oh shit, here we go again"
I think that we're all living in sin
Your ignorance, it isn't a gift
But you keep it, love it, nurture it
I gotta ask, where are we going with this?
It feels like the end, are you sick of it?

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all time low
Can you get that through your skull
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?

One day you'll wake up
And you'll see how bad you've fucked up
You've lived a life in fear and created hell
So open your mind
And see the hate you've left behind
The only way to fix yourself
Is to find some love inside your empty heart

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all time low
Can you get that through your skull
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?

Yeah we're blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Blind, deaf, and dumb
