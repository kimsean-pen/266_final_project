I
Seem to have a history
At missing the point
At this stuff
Apparently
Very absent-mindedly
I care
But never enough
For
You
Time to put the record straight

Time to stop communicating
Please anticipate
I'm trying to comprehend the things I write

I'm living the lie that I cannot satisfy
Much against everyone's advice
I'm still trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

Cheated me of everything
But I laughed until
I stopped
Publicly
Very, very openly
I sat alone with my thoughts
For
Time to put the record straight
Time to stop communicating

Please anticipate
I'm trying to comprehend the things I write
I'm living the lie that I cannot satisfy, oh
Much against everyone's advice
I'm still trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
