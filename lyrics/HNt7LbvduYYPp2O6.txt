Look at you
An accident of drinking
What a mess
A train wreck of lipstick
What a joke
Well do you hear me laughin'?
Get off my face
Before I lose my patience
Oh me and you
Let's cut this party
Little boy
It takes a lot to shake me (oh shake it)

It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you

It's a bloody war
Of attriton
Let's see which one of us
Is gonna last tonight
'Cause I have all
of my whips around me
and I'll be damned
if I'm done
Why rob the place?
Why won't the room stop spinning?
Oh make it hard
Want something to happen
So make it happen

It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you

Let's take a torch
to the past and the future
Let's make out
Wanna tear your?
See how it feels
With the passion burning
We'll be damned
When we're done.
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
'Cause it's the battle in you (it's the battle in me)
'Cause it's the battle in you (it's the battle in me)
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
Shake it, shake it
Oh shake it up
