This is the final war along the Lonian Sea the Battle of Actium
Mark Antony's forces to engage Octavian's legions at sea
Breaking the alliance of the Second Triumvirate
Cleopatra and Antony to defy
Caesarion named King of Kings
A lethal threat to Octavian
Two Hundred Thirty warships at sea
Headed by the great Mark Antony
Devastating loss forces retreat
Agrippa's forces led by experience at sea
Roma shines once again Octavian's forces powerful and unmatched
Two hundred ships lost
Five Thousand lives lost
Broken line broken will
There's no place for glory to heal
Raised in blood raised in fear
There's no place for honor to heal
There's no place for glory there's no place for honor...
