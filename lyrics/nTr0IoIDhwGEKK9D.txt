Under this canvas, he hides a dream
A trick of the type too cheap to be free
Makes your bourgeoning inquiry
More easily answered
Oh, a sight they have come to see
We shan't disappoint
They've paid for a scene
And a scene they shall have indeed

This dark, dark evening

Join us inside that's the way here
Come now, just step right up in line

It's freaks fools and fire
Come nearer, come closer
It's nearly time
You there and you there and come one and all

It looks better in red, my calico friend
Let us brood on the hue of need

What finds your favor?
Oh, the show must go on instead
With hundreds of eyes at two to a head
And the blindness is thrice complete

When all stand watching

Step aside make way for the stars presence
Better beware there's lights and glittering
Gaze deeper, stare harder it's nearly time

You there and you there and come one and all so plain

So have you ever wondered
Where were the demons they told us of
Be patient their coming shortly revealed to you and I do think you'll find
A dead ringer, a dead ringer
Much still hides you curious minds
There's no hurry
Now where are my manors round and around
Why I believe they've all arrived

Out, out from the wings
Set all the props in place
Lower the lights and wait
Now bring them in let them watch
Let the spectacle rise
Hold you breath
The suspense leads the arrogant dead eyes
More than them will you spend for the vision of your life
Let the curtains fall down
Look now and see
That's quite the motley
Disguise you've borrowed
My friend, it seems quite odd
But you are the show you've paid for
Step through the mirror
And now the circus spins on and on
So, come one, come all tonight
