Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Big 14 bitch, big 14 bitch, Yeah

Living in this fucking life of sin, yeah
Hoping that the God will let us in, yeah
Open up them gates and let us in, yeah
I blow it down with that FN
If that's my brother, that's my brother till the end
That's my brother not my motherfucking friend
That's my woadie, that's my slime, that's my kin
This is a wraith this ain't no motherfucking Benz

Swerve swerve swerving
I count it till my fingers hurting
Trynna do this shit, I make it perfect
Sippin' on this drink, I lose my purpose
Try to test me then it's curtains
You ain't nothing but a bird steady chirping
I done made it out the motherfucking dirt bitch
That just came from serving niggas like a clerk bitch
Yeah like a clerk bitch
See them snakes up on the grass them are serpents
Kick the pussy niggas down 'cause they worthless
Test my gangsta, I'mma kill you that's for certain
God won't be blessing you
God blessed me like I said achoo
Diamonds dancing on me and they saying peekaboo
Electrify that nigga like a fucking Pikachu
Yeah keep a chopper, I might pop you
Fomo they gon' drop you
She gon' suck the dick, and she need a sponsor
Took that bitch to Barry's, got that bitch some lobster

Living in this fucking life of sin, yeah
Hoping that the God will let us in, yeah
Open up them gates and let us in, yeah
I blow it down with that FN
If that's my brother, that's my brother till the end
That's my brother not my motherfucking friend
That's my woodie, that's my slime, that's my kid
This is a Wraith this ain't no motherfucking Benz

We're brothers,
we're happy and we're singing and
we're coloured, doo-do-do-doo, Big 14 bitch
