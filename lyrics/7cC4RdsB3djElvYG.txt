When I can work out how it was
Then I'll tell you
TV stained my memories, yeah
I don't think that she's

Remember through sounds
Remember through smells
Remember through colors
Remember through towns with fear and fascination
On what was here and what's replacing them now

Interchange plazas and malls
And crowded chain restaurants
More housing developments go up
Named after the things they replace

So welcome to Minnow Brook
And welcome to Shady Space
Well it all seems a little abrupt
No I don't like this change of pace
