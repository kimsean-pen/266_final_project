What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around

What goes around comes around, you better realize
You kill life, you kill life - Why? Why?
I see your eyes, I see your lies
I see you hide, inside

What goes around comes around, now it's your time
How long can you lie? How long can you hide?
How long can you live with your soulbleed?
How long can you live with your soul...

Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Go!

What goes around comes around, no more lies
You kill life, you kill life - Why? Why?
I see a mother cry
I see a brother cry

What goes around comes around, now it's your time
How long can you lie? How long can you hide?
How long can you live with your soulbleed?
How long can you live with your soul...

Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Fuckin' bleed...

Bring it on
Bring it

(Bleed!)
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now (Bleed!)
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now (Bleed!)
I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now (Bleed!)
Muthafucka

I got my pride and that's all I need
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio
Don't take advantage of this process
You might have to digest a blade made for your ass to fade
I'm living on instinct
Never think when I'm rushin', bones crushin'
When I put your sorry ass in a package
You piece of shit, sealed and delivered from a savage
And now you sweat because you're goin' down
You envious clown, fuckin' bleed

Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed)
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed) - Fuck it
Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed), Bleed (Bleed) - Oh shit
