I left myself
I left my body
I got so frightened by the light,
and all the things that I could see
I left myself

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I whispered "no"
To my own shadow
I got so frightened by the light,
and all the tings that I could see
I whispered "no"

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I got along
To my own voice
I got enlightened by the fright,
and all the things that I could see
I got along

Blinded by the light
Faded by the dawn
Of mine

I flew away...
