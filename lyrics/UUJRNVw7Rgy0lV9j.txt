I'm somewhere between "I love you" and "I'm leavin'"
Somewhere between "I need you" and lettin' go
And it scares me so when I look hard I find no good reasons
I'm somewhere between "I love you" and "I'm leaving"
Somewhere between "I miss you" and "I"m gone"
Running hard through the middle of the night
And you spend yours alone
I hold you close then I let you go, no leavin' well-enough alone
I'm somewhere between "I miss you" and "I'm gone"

And the ties that bind, they hold my mind
No matter where I go
I'm alone

Here with you or out there tearin' down some road
Nowhere is home
And you're the only thing on Earth that I believe in
I'm somewhere between "I love you" and "I'm leavin'"

And the ties that bind, they hold my mind
No matter where I go, I'm alone
Here with you or out there tearin' down some road
Nowhere is home

And you're the only thing on Earth that I believe in
I can stay or I can go and not break even
I'm somewhere between "I love you" and "I'm leavin'"
I'm somewhere between "I love you" and "I'm leavin'"
