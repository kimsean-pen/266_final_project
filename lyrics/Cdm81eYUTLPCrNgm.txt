I don't know how
I don't know why
But girl it seems
You've touched my life
You're in my dreams
You're in my heart
I'm not myself
When we're apart

Something strange has come over me
A raging wind across my seas
And girl you know that your eyes are to blame
What am I supposed to do
If I can't get over you
And come to find that you don't feel the same

'Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too
I've been falling, falling
Ever since the moment I laid eyes on you
(Girl I'm falling, falling, falling
When I laid eyes on you
Girl I'm falling, falling, falling. Yeah...)

I lose my step
I lose my ground
I lose myself
When you're around
I'm holding on
For my life
To keep from drowning in your eyes
Girl, what have you done to me
To make me fall so desperately
To think that I don't even know your name
(no, no)
How am I supposed to live (supposed to live)
If I can't get over this (get over this)
And you decide that you don't feel the same

'Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too
I've been falling, falling

(Falling)
Will you stay or will you go
(Heaven)
Heaven knows what my future holds
(Questions)
Questions linger on my mind
(Day break)
From day break to dark of night
(I'm falling)
I don't know what's come over me

Can't you see that I'm falling, falling
Girl, I'm falling for you
And I pray you're falling too (yeah)
Falling, falling
Ever since the moment I laid eyes on you
Ohhhh
I'm falling
