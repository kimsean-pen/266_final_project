I laid on my back
An echo of silence
Floating on top a shallow pool of self-awareness
Or a lack there of, when I saw your face and I knew
That you were drunk
You were drunk

I laid on my back
An echo of silence
Floating on top a shallow pool of self-awareness
Or a lack there of, when I saw your face and I knew
That you had just come
And you were far away from done

All we want to do is to be something
To be something we're not
But all we really want is to have someone
To hold us when we're drunk
When we're drunk

It's more than just sex
It's more than our bodies
It's more than a movement made from self-loathing and irony
But I don't know what to call it just quite just yet
So I'm gonna shut up
Cause I'm so far away from done

All we want to do is to be something
Be something we're not
But all we really want is to have someone
To hold us when we're drunk
When we're drunk

All we want to do is to be something
Be something we're not
And all we really want is to have someone
To hold us when we're drunk
I was drunk
