Here we are again
Wake at 5 am
I didn't mean a word I said
Can we just pretend
I can take it back?
Change the way the story ends

I remember when things were simple then
Didn't know we hurt this way
I would fall asleep, you would carry me
You would take my fears away

Am I messed up?
Forever flawed
Beyond repair
But forever yours

All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

I don't know why
I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

When you look at me
I wonder if you see
All the things you thought I could be
Or all the crazy nights
All the stupid fight
All the tears that filled our eyes

Am I messed up?
Forever flawed
Beyond repair
But forever yours

All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

I don't know why
I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

I don't know why
I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

(Ohhhh)
Yeah
(Ohhhh)
Yeah
(Ohhhh)
Your problem child, yeah
(Ohhhh)
Yeah
(Ohhhh)
Yeah
(Ohhhh)
Your problem child, yeah!
