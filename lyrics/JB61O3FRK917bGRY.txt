Broken sleep
Broken hearted
I don't like the light, I keep on hiding in the darkness
Don't get me started
'Cause without you I lie awake for hours and hours alone

Don't wake me up, no
Not ready to let go
'Cause I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Broken sleep
When I wake up I remember you're not next to me
Or where you should be, like in my dreams
'Cause I go to a place where you come back to me
Lost in a fantasy of broken sleep

Broken promises
All the shit that you would say to all your friends in confidence
If I get handed
Everything I wanted on a plate then I still want you

Don't wake me up, no
Not ready to let go
'Cause I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Broken sleep
When I wake up I remember you're not next to me
Or where you should be, like in my dreams
'Cause I go to a place where you come back to me
Lost in a fantasy of broken sleep

Five more minutes
Just five more minutes
It's hard to let you go
It's hard to let you go
Five more minutes
Give me five more minutes
It's hard to let you go
It's hard to let you go
Five more, just five more
'Cause I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Broken sleep
When I wake up I remember you're not next to me
Or where you should be, like in my dreams
'Cause I go to a place where you come back to me
Lost in a fantasy of broken sleep

I'm in and out of broken sleep
I'm in and out
I'm in and out of broken sleep
I'm in and out
Well I'm in and out of broken sleep
I'm in and out
