Lookin' back on my life
You know that all I see
Are things I could've changed
I should have done
Where did the good times go?
Good times so hard to hold
This time, this time
This time I'm gonna find the light
(The light, the light, the light, the light)

Lookin' back on my life
You know that all I see
Are things I could've changed
I could have done
No time for sad lament
A wasted life is bitter spent

So rise into the light
In or out of time
Oh rise straight to the light
In or out of time (inner light, inner light, inner light)
(Through the light, through the light, through the light)

Woke up one other day
The pain won't go away
I am growing
In peculiar ways
Into a light I pass
Another dream, another chance
This time, this time
This time I'm gonna rise into the light
In or out of time (you beside me)

Gonna find my way in life
In or out of sight
I'm still seeing things in black and white
Gonna rise straight into the light
In or out of sight

I'm gonna see the light
I'm gonna see the light
I'm gonna see the light

'Cause I know there is time
There is time
There is time
There is time
There is time
There is time
There is time
There is time

Where did the good time go? oh, for the last time
This time, this time
This time, this time
This time, this time
This time, this time
Through the light, through the light, through the light
Through the light, through the light, through the light
Through the light, through the light, into the light
