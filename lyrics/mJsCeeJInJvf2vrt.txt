I need you and I want you 'cause I know you from before
I hate you and I fear you but I hold open the door
I see you and you see me and we know what must be done
So we draw knives and lock eyes 'cause it does no good to run

Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams

I've missed you, you know that's true and I've retraced every scar
My head sings and the steel rings 'cause we've traveled, oh so far
I chased you to embrace you like the sun chases the moon
I burn you and you burn me but I know I'll see you soon

I've watched you and I've seen you and known that you were there
I've held and you've loved me but our lives cannot be spared
I trust you and despised you, shadowed your every move
Scorned you and warned you, befriended everyone you've used

Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
