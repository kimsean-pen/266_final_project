I got something new for you
when it hits you wont know what to do
Relax, let me move u
dont resist its in the air
just one taste will take u there
let it flow right through you
I know ur getting tired of the same ole thing
Imma break the rules gonna change the game
You'll be screaming my name
and imma take u places u never seen
u couldnt picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear, you're here with me

Let's get Lifted
(lifted)
ooh I'm get you high
im really gonna blow your mind
We'll get Lifted (lifted)
Ur gonna feel it in your soul
and baby you will lose control
we'll get lifted (high)
ohhh ohhhh

Once u take a hit of this
you wont ever wanna quit
you'll be so addicted
said I'll have you spinning round and round
crazy, making freaky sounds
you won't want to come down
And I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
even walking funny cuz your legs are shaking
All night we'll be blazin'

I'll take you for a walk to the other side
we can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight we'll be alright

We'll get Lifted
(lifted)
ooh imma get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind
We'll get Lifted
Ur gonna feel it in your soul
and baby you will lose control
We'll get lifted (high)
ohhh ohhhh

So come and go
(so much I wanna show you I'll take u there)
Yeah, I'll take you there

said I will show you
(so much I wanna show you I'll take you high)
There's so much I wanna show ya
I'll take you high ...
