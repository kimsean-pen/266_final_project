Some bands i like to name check,
and one of them is rem,
classic songs with a long history
southern boys just like you and me.

flashback to 1983,
chronic town was their first ep
later on came reckoning
finster's art, and titles to match:
south central rain, don't go back to rockville,
harbourcoat, pretty persuasion,
you were born to be a camera,
time after time was my least favourite song,
time after time was my least favourite song.
the singer, he had long hair
and the drummer he knew restrait.
and the bass man he had all the right moves
and the guitar player was no saint.
so lets go way back to the ancient times
when there were no 50 states,
And on a hill there stands sherman
sherman and his mates.
and they're marching through georgia,
we're marching through georgia,
we're marching through georgia
g-g-g-g-georgia
they're marching through georgia,
we're marching through georgia,
marching through georgia
g-g-g-g-georgia
and there stands rem
(aye sir, aye sir, aye sir they're coming, aye sir, move those wagons, aye
sir, artillery's in place sir, aye sir, aye sir, hide it, hide it, aye
sir, run, run.)
