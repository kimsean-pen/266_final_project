So I dance with nothing
So I dance for free
And there is no glamour
Stumbling down Queen

Come back to me
You're seventeen
I have no silence
Calamity

We knew no difference
Awake the arc
She saw the future
And it was dark

So I dance with nothing
So I dance for free
And there is no love here
Where the old queers sting

Come back to me
You're seventeen
I have no silence
Complacency

We knew no different
Awake the arc
She saw the future
It was dark

So I dance with nothing
So I dance for free
And there is no glamour
Stumbling down Queen

What we done?
Deceiving the peace we had inside
What we done?
Believing the peace we had inside

I've become the ceiling
Where are you?
Believing we found our way alright

Here again, this feeling
This aching space inside
Here again, this feeling
This aching place inside
