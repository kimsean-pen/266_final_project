I await at??
Look your way, and you tilt your head out of place

Far away I have acquired your word through the fray(?)
And I savour another drink, and you stay

At the moon you breathe life

I'm awake to the space in my mind that you take
In the shade, in the glowing corners, I wait
Let it move to the darker side of the moon
Come to you as you keep one eye on the room

At the moon you breathe life
