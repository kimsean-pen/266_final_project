Lightyears from everyone
Stranded on a foreign sun
Blacked out up on the edge
Am I the only one out here?
Dazed in the daytime light
Floating in a violet sky
Am I the only one?
The only one around out here?

Open my eyes I see someone I used to be
When I open my eyes, it's all coming back to me

Come and take me lightyears
Back to where we're from
We could be together
That's where we belong
Are you out there?
Come and send me a sign
As long as we're together
We could go wherever you like

Ooh, ooh
(Wherever you like)
Ooh, ooh
(We are made of)

Lightyears from everyone
I wonder what I have I become?
Washed up on a distant shore
No sign of me here no more

So fast, we're out of sight
Movin' at the speed of light
Pumping our hearts in time
Break through the atmosphere
So high that I can't stand
It's all coming back to me

Come and take me lightyears
Back to where we're from
We could be together
That's where we belong
Are you out there?
Come and send me a sign
As long as we're together
We could go wherever you like

Ooh, ooh
(Wherever you like)
Ooh, ooh
(We are made of)

As long as we're together
We can make it if you're ready
As long as we're together making love
'Cause we are made of (light)
As long as we're together
We can make it if you're ready
As long as we're together making love
Tell me, are you out there?
Can you send me a sign?
As long as we're together

We can go all night—
As long as we're together
We can make it if you're ready
As long as we're together making love
(Ooh, ooh)
Move all night—
As long as we're together
We can make it if you're ready
As long as we're together making love
(Ooh, ooh)
