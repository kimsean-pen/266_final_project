It's always dark at 5 P.M.
And I can't get you out of my head
I stay awake, I stay alone
And I don't even answer my phone

What is life, what is love?
What's the meaning of it all?
Do I even care or is it just that I am so unaware
So unaware

There is a light that I can see
Consumes me on to I can breathe you
Do you see me cause I see you
But I don't even have a clue

What is life, what is love?
What's the meaning of it all?
Do I even care or is it just that I am so unaware
So unaware
All never understand, you never understand
You never understand me now All never understand, you never understand
You never understand me now All never understand, you never understand
You never understand me now
