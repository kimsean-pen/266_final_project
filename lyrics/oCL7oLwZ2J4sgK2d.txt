I'm driving faster with the windows down
Just to keep my mind off of you,
So don't you try to ignore me,
You stood in the light before me;
But could you adore me?

I could listen to your voice all night,
Whisper to me baby, tell me what you'd like.
Who're you kidding baby, when you try and deny me,
When you try and deny me?

I'll make you stay, there's just no way
I'm leaving without your love.
You make me wait to hear you say
"If you wanna make a move, come on."
If I had my way, I would be yours.
You say my name, I have no choice,
Baby it's time to get comfortable.

You're so emotional when you walk into the room,
I can't keep my eyes off of you.
You got me doing things that I shouldn't do,
But baby I like it.

Who're you kidding baby, when you try and deny me?
Who do you think you're fooling, when you're trying to fight it,
When you're trying to fight it?

I'll make you stay, there's just no way
I'm leaving without your love.
You make me wait to hear you say
"If you wanna make a move, come on."
If I had my way, I would be yours.
You say my name, I have no choice,
Baby it's time to get comfortable.

I'm driving faster with the windows down,
Just to keep my mind off of you.
I'm leaving the light on for you, baby won't you come my way?
So come on baby, won't you come my way?

I'll make you stay, there's just no way
I'm leaving without your love.
You make me wait to hear you say
"If you wanna make a move, come on."
If I had my way, I would be yours.
You say my name, I have no choice,
Baby it's time to get comfortable.

How can I keep up when I know you're moving so fast?
Just gimme a reason baby, you know I want you so bad.
I'm leaving the light on for you baby, won't you come my way?
So come on baby, won't you come my way?

How can I keep up when I know you're moving so fast?
Just gimme a reason baby, you know I want you so bad.
I'm leaving the light on for you baby, won't you come my way?
So come on baby won't you come my way?
