I can't lie
I was attracted too
somehow the feelings
were so strong inside
but I'm not free to be
in love with you maybe
things would be different
in another place and time

And I can't give you
all you want me to
and I know you deserve
the best from me
but I can't give you more
of all that you long for
I would have loved you
in another place and time

Dreams aren't always bound to come true
but that's no reason you should cry

'Cos I would have loved you
really loved you
in another place and time

I'm hurting deep inside
just want you to know
oh, I would have loved you
oh yeah, in another place and time

Fate can't always be led by you
the time ain't right for you and I

In another place and time
in another place and time...
