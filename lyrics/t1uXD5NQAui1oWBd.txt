Stop in the name of love she said so we waited
Pull the car over I said let's break in
I never found religion but was born with freedom
That's the one thing I pray will not be taken

Kick my shoes off and I will run away
Will run away, will run away
Kick my shoes off and I have a found a place
Have found a place, that I call

Pink fields looking so good
Will I go home or will I run away
Yeah yeah
Pink fields make me feel good
Will I go home or will I run away
Yeah yeah

Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh

Breathe it in and taste it doesn't get no better
I've survived all kinds of stormy weather
Finding ways to kill pain, shiny things go deeper
If I go much further, Amy soon I'll see ya

Kick my shoes off and I will run away
Will run away, will run away
Kick my shoes off and I have a found a place
Have found a place, that I call

Pink fields looking so good
Will I go home or will I run away
Yeah yeah
Pink fields make me feel good
Will I go home or will I run away
Yeah yeah

Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh

Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
Ey yeah ey yeah yeah ahh ahh
