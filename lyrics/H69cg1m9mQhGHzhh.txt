Oh-o-o-oh

My mind is clear
I have no fear
'Cause now I know the other side of me
I'm letting go of who I used to be
Now I'm alive, I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end

Took a thousand scars to find me
Every one of them reminds me

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end
I found my way

Through jaded days
'Cause now I know the other side of me
I'm letting go of who I used to be
Now I'm alive I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end

Took a thousand scars to find me
And every one of them remind me

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end
Bitter end

My mind is clear
I have no fear
It took a thousand scars to find me

Memories remain

I won't ever surrender like that
I know better to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end
I won't ever surrender like that
I know better to ever fall back
The enemy was living in my head
I ripped it out and left it there for dead
Now I'm alive
I'm feeling born again
And I will fight until the bitter end
Bitter end.
