I don't need you here
The ocean is vast and clear
And something about the waves
Empties my mind, all my thoughts

There's no killer whales in here
The ocean is safe my dear
But something just stops me in my tracks
My head, empty my head

I can't swim my way out of this mess
Hold your breath and dive in deep, my friend

Does the sun rise out here?
The stars above the pier
But all I wanna gaze at into the night is
Your eyes

I can't swim my way out of this mess
Hold your breath and dive in deep, my friend

Is that you calling out my name?
Is that you, all so calm and tame?
Is that you pretending it's still the same?
Is that you? I think it's such a shame

Is that you calling out my name?
Is that you? I think it's such a shame
