Look aside
You don't see our things
We lose them all
Nothing is the same in this old town

So come inside,
Rolling down the stairs
You break her fall
No one is the same in this old town

You said
Our love will never die
It never was the same in this old town

So we dance to save them all
We ask to save them all
We try to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all

So we dance to save them all
We ask to save them all
We try to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all

You will never tell me
Exactly what you want
You don't see our things
We lose them all

You said
Our love will never die
It never was the same as old time

So we dance to save them all
We ask to save them all
We try to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all

So we dance to save them all
We ask to save them all
We try to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

So we dance to save them all
We ask to save them all
We try to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart

We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart
