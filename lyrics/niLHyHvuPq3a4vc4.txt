Pray the one my soul to keep
servant's service
too scared to sleep because of the creep
scarred surface

well in the right now

when I'm next to your head I see white
heaven's presence
mother dying all of the time
my sickness

well in the right now
we'll take you
we'll take all of you
well in the right now
