We've been going back in time
Underneath the future lights, lately
Give it up and come to life
Open up your heart tonight, baby

You're in or out
Right here, right now
I won't let
You down

I got one more touch
One more touch
To get a little bit closer now
One more touch
One more touch
To get a little bit closer now

Tell me what you feel inside
What if it's our only night, baby?
'Cause if and when you're out of sight
Doesn't mean your out of mind, lately
Uuh, yeah
You're in or out
Right here, right now
I won't let
You down

I got one more touch
One more touch
To get a little bit closer now
One more touch
One more touch
To get a little bit closer now

If you really want it that much
Stand up, my friend
Find love, again
Even if it's time for you, love
Stand up, my friend
Find love, again

I can stay and wait for you
Every single night
We can wait a thousand years
Won't be long enough to fight it
