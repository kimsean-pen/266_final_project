Someone carved you out of ivory,
With some porcelain and brass,
Then they looked upon your face,
And they knew they'd double-tasked

So they tore their tools to pieces,
'laid 'em underneath the grass,
There won't be another like you,
I don't even have to ask.

I stumbled on you singing,
On the bench beside the bank,
By the river where the dam was,
Before the old town went and sank.

'Said I'd be grateful just to sit,
Could you spare a little plank,
You said "I found it when I got here,
So you ain't got me to thank.

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the sting of a, heart cut open,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

A Love... That can't be broken

Well I can sing the lead,
If you can sing the harmony,
We'll play out on the porch,
'Let it blow off in the breeze,

We can listen as it lingers,
Through the leaves left on the trees,
We'll stay out on till the sun comes rising,
Up from in the East,

'Cause we live in the city now,
We live upon the shore,
We looked twice before we left,
But we don't look back no more,

So sick for one another,
May we never find the cure,
You can handle my best easy
I can try to handle yours.

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the sting of a, heart cut open,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

It's the, way you stay right, by my side,
It's the, way you lay your, lips on mine,
You're the, greatest things I'll, ever find,
My love...

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the sting of a, heart cut open,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the sting of a, heart cut open,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

-Break-

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the sting of a, heart cut open,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's a love that, can't be broken,
That's the thing about, blind devotion,
That's a love that, can't be broken,

That's a love that, can't be broken
