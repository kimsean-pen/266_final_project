It seems three years, or maybe four
Someone drops dead whom I adore
You love someone, there will be grief
The kiss of death, lips of a thief

Goddamn it

A dusty stack of photographs
Of times I've cried, but mostly laughed
Commit the past into blue flame
Acrid smoke, cowardly shame

Goddamn it

At times, I'm truly terrified
'Cause dope and booze don't help to hide
They're used to mask a weakling's hurt
It's just like painting over dirt

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

All dead

Life's a game I cannot win
Both good and bad most surely end
The mirrors always tell the truth
I love myself for hating you

Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead
Everyone I love is dead

Goddamn it
Goddamn it

All dead

All dead

All dead
All dead
All dead
All dead
All dead
All dead
All dead

Goddamn it
