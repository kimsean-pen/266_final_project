The whole world trying, to tame their spark
But we've got fire, burning bright, hidden
I catch the shimmer, of showering stars
The sky gets dimmer, and your light shows

You are the vision I'm looking for (looking for)
Make me remember all I forgot
Watch me become just an animal
Naked to nothing more than who we are

Feral hearts, in the night
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to light
Feral hearts, come alive
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Feral, feral, feral hearts

Whole world trying to blind the way home
But we've got shelter, deep inside, a secret
Tame the whispers of winds as they blow
Feel my shivers in your arms, stop

You are the vision I'm looking for (looking for)
Make me remember all I forgot
Watch me become just an animal

Feral hearts, in the night
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to light
Feral hearts, come alive
Loving like we've been kept captive
Free to
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Feral, feral, feral hearts
Feral, feral, feral hearts
