I think you've been infected
Take all of the pain
All of the pain and regret
Saved from breakdown

Now that I am reckless I'm giving away
Giving away your secrets
Just to watch you burn!

How does it feel on the outside
Looking inside
Till you feel rejected
I watch you to see what it looks like
On the inside

You're the one infected!
You're the one infected!
You're the one infected!

I'm known to your affliction
Keep running away
Running away
You get what you deserve

Now, now I feel ambitious
I'm giving away
Giving away your secrets
Just to watch you burn!

How does it feel on the outside
Looking inside
Till you feel rejected
I want you to see, what it looks like
On the inside

You're the one infected!
You're the one infected!
You're the one
You're the one infected
