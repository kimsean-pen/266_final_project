We used to go
Where no one dared to go
And now you've changed the dragon on your own
She used to suck the fun out of me

Beware the dog who's selling songs about defeat
Begging for love but you're old enough to know better than you know
You hate so much and you're better off alone

She used to suck the life out of me
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now it's all just hazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy crazy crazy
(Wooh!)

Beware the ghost who lives on Salamander Road
Trapped in a cloud of smoke
It's old enough to know better than it knows
Ate so much you better leave that prick alone

She used to suck the fun out of me
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now it's all just hazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy crazy crazy

She used to suck the fun out of me
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
We used to walk where the wild things grow
But now it's all just hazy
We used to go where the cool kids go
But now you're just too lazy
We used to joke and it felt like gold
But now you're fucking crazy
Crazy crazy crazy
(Wooh!)
