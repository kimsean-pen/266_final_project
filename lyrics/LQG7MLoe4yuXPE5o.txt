Balaam And The Angel
Days Of Madness
Goodbye Forever
Stripped between the morning light
Violent memories far away
I was happy always
Kneeling for your mercy
I just can't walk the streets
Of love anymore
I just can't take anymore
You've been driving me crazy

Goodbye forever
Cause we've got nothing left to say
We took some heaven
But now we've blown it all away

All my troubles cast aside
>From my stage I fly away
Feeling kinda hungry
A sky that has no boundary
I just can't walk the streets
Of love anymore
I just can't take anymore
You've been driving me crazy

I just can't walk the streets of love anymore
I just can't walk the streets of love
I just can't take anymore
You've been driving me crazy
