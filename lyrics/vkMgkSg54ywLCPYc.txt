Light me up and blow me away
Like a moth drawn to a flame
No screen though to keep you away
'Cause here in the dark is nothing to say

I'll sing a torch song for you now
If you want me to

I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo
Both ends burning

Making you warm and taking your heart
Can see the smoke from the trees or the forest through the fire
You saw the warning signs but you threw caution to the wind
So don't blame me for the sad state you're in

I'll sing a torch song for you now
If you want me to

I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo
Both ends burning
Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo
Both ends burning

I like candle lit dinner for two
I do, I do
'Cause I wanna see red flame turn blue
I do' don't you'

I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo
Both ends burning
Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo
Both ends burning

I'm a pyromaniac
You're my perfect match
This might flow so fast you know we got
Both ends burning
