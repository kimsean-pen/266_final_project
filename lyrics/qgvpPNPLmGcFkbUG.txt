It's funny how we've seem to made it.
It's funny how we can even walk up straight.
Last night you sat home waiting, and I got home much too late
So what if we loose our minds, so what if it doesn't make much sense
At least we know we're lazy, at least we know how to play, we're so great.

Come on, come on, come, get up and dance with me, yeah
No more, no more blue days and lonely years

And I'm afraid I need my baby
I'm afraid he doesn't know it yet.
Someday I will tell him maybe
It's been like this since I don't know when,
But it's great.

Come on, come on, come, get up and dance with me, yeah
No more no more blue days and lonely years
Come on, come on, come, get up and dance with me, yeah
No more no more blue days for you my dear

I've always been told, you will never grow old
You live your life too fast, but I don't want to rest
I'm not old and tired, but I've been trough fire
And I've seen enough, and I might never be the same again,
But have you seen my friends, they're just the same

Come on...
