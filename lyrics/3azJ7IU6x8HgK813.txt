Come with me

We took a back road, we're gonna look at the stars
We took a back road in my car
Down to the ocean, it's only water and sand
And in the ocean, we'll hold hands
But I don't really like you
Apologetically dressed in the best
Put on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky

And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
Don't you wanna come with me?

Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
This cinematic vision ensues
Like the holiest dream

There's someone calling, an angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same
(wait til tomorrow you'll be fine)
but its gone to the dogs in my mind
always hear them when the dead of night

comes calling to save me from this fight
but they can never wrong this right
Don't you wanna come with me?

Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me?

Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
It's only natural
I never had a lover
I never had soul

And I never had a good time
I never got bold
Don't you wanna come with me?

Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna come with me?
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Come and take a swim with me
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
It's only natural
