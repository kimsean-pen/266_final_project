Oh yeah
The birds in the trees, they don't sing no more
These autumn leaves are lying dead on the floor
Just like mister love, we gon' let it fall, oh yeah

Ain't nothing left but a picture frame
You've forgotten my face, so don't speak my name
Don't water it down, it's going up in flames

Yeah, you got me running down the wrong road
Yeah, I'm swimming in the shallows
'Cause the love that I seek ain't what you're giving to me
I want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea

Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow
Try to run but I always return to your ghost
I keep clinging to everything I had once known
But love don't live here anymore
Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow

I had the key to your heart, you changed the lock on the door
Won't even bother to knock, I know that nobody's home
You're not the person that I knew before, oh
Like the bones of our love is buried deep in the ground
Like the wings of a dove, you can't be holding us down
Let it go, let it go, yeah, forget all the vows

Yeah, you got me running down the wrong road
Yeah, I'm swimming in the shallows
'Cause the love that I seek ain't what you're giving to me
I want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea

Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow
Try to run but I always return to your ghost
I keep clinging to everything I had once known
But love don't live here anymore
Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow

Time is running, let the water come in from the sea
Wasting time over someone who's not meant to be
Let it go, let it go, go and set yourself free, free, free

Yeah, you got me running down the wrong road (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm swimming in the shallows (Swimming in the shallows)
'Cause the love that I seek ain't what you're giving to me
I want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea
(Yeah, yeah, oh no)

Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow
(On to your Shadow, on to your Shadow)
Try to run but I always return to your ghost
I keep clinging to everything I had once known
But love don't live here anymore
Oh, but I just keep holding on to your Shadow
(Your Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, oh)

I just keep holding on to your Shadow
