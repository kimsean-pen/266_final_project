Hit 'em with the jab
Buddah Bless this beat

Love me today
Love me forever
Ride with me, bae
Ridin' forever
Love me today
Love me forever
Love me to day, love me today, love me today
Love me forever
Ride with me, bae
Ridin' forever
Love me today, love me today
Will you love me today?
Love me forever

What type of time you want?
Make you fall in love by the time you gone
I'm not tryna play wit' you, baby, I'm too grown
Gettin' too much guap
Put diamonds in your watch
Baby girl, you look good in that hotel top
Drop the top on the coupe and do donuts in the lot
Hold it down for me
Baby, watch my back, these niggas plottin' on me
Both of us are bosses, that's why you ride with me

Love me today
Love me forever
Ride with me, bae
Ridin' forever
Love me to today
Love me forever
Love me to today, love me to today, love me to today
Love me forever
Ride with me, bae
Ridin' forever
Love me today, love me today
Will you love me today?
Love me forever
