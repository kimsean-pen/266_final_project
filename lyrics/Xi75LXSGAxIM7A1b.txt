I never wanted to break
I never wanted to be this way
I've never felt so low
But at the same time you make me feel high
Oh baby did I leave you out to dry
From all my lies

I know it's kinda hard
I know I fucked it from the start

I can't change I can't change
The way I had left you all alone
I don't ever want to see you fall again
I'm not saying, I'm not saying
That I can make it all ok
I'm just wanting you to hear me say
I don't ever want to see you fall
I don't ever want to see you fall

Sleepless nights what the hell am I meant to do
Never thought I'd break, never thought I'd be this way
I can say sorry but that'll never be enough
Feeling like a failure, feeling like I lost your trust

I know it's kinda hard
I know I fucked it from the start
I know it's kinda hard
I know I fucked it from the start

I can't change I can't change
The way I had left you all alone
I don't ever want to see you fall again
I'm not saying, I'm not saying
That I can make it all ok
I'm just wanting you to hear me say
I don't ever want to see you fall

You were everything I wanted now you are everything that I need
You were everything I wanted now you are everything that I need
You were everything I wanted now you are everything that I need
You were everything I wanted now you are everything that I need

I can't change I can't change
The way I had left you all alone
I don't ever want to see you fall again
I'm not saying, I'm not saying
That I can make it all ok
I'm just wanting you to hear me say
I don't ever want to see you fall
I don't ever want to see you fall
I don't ever want to see you fall
