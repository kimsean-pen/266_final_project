I've been bitten by the bug and I am comin' down with oh
Somethin' that can't be cured
There ain't a doctor in this town who is more qualified than you
Yeah to be so adored
So tell me what do you prescribe for these symptoms
(Heart beatin' faster and work is a disaster?)
I'm lovesick when you're not around, ch-ch-check me over
(When strong hands are healin' I'm dancin' on the ceilin')

Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
(Feel the fever)

I am ready for the news so tell me straight
Hey doctor just what do you diagnose?
There ain't a surgeon like you any place in all the world
So now shall I remove my clothes?
So tell me what do you advice for these symptoms
(Heart beatin' faster and work is a disaster?)
I'm lovesick when you're not around, ch-ch-check me over
(When strong hands are healin' I'm dancin' on the ceilin')

Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?

Fever sure has got me good
