Taffy spun
Wild horses run
And the walls are filled with molasses
You said I look pretty by the frozen Mississippi
The future felt fantastic

Lottery
I stole a Christmas tree
You stood watch in the hotel hall
You lit up our room like a waning moon
Of melting plastic

Just a couple hours (hours)
We'll have super powers
I wanna get lost over that bridge to La Crosse

Rolling guitars
Throwing dice on the bar
Your ranting, I couldn't stand it
I cut the apple until it just wouldn't do
Baby, you're so romantic

Endless talk
Not getting home
I could not leave it alone
I wanted to please you
My dress was see-thru
As I looked through your phone

I am such a coward
How could you send her flowers?
I want to get lost
There's a bridge to La Crosse

In a Chinese robe
I spun the globe
And my finger landed back home
If you're not willing then I'm not giving you my
Heart of gold

Nudie pics
I do not regret it
I knew that you were gone
I did so freely and wanted you to see me
Off that throne you put me on

Just a couple hours
We'll have super powers
I'm gonna get lost over that bridge from La Crosse
