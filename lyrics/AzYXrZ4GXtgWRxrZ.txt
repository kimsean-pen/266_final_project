Growing up with our eyes spread wide
So we can look across the spectrum of shades
When the sand turns into stone
we see the world's black and white become grey
Holding onto all my values
Letting go of all I've been through
Innocence is lost to greed
and the sweet becomes
a bitter taste
Friendship grown from chemistry
Now rivals in a constant race
Holding onto all my values
Letting go of all I've been through
The last repentance
Burning in the flames
Those who cross me will remember my name
Sinking my teeth
Into life and death
Ripping the flesh from my former self
As long as blood's still flowing red
I still need your words in my head
Waking life has no cure for spite
I want to stay asleep with my teeth clenched tight
And I'll never wake up from a dream
Where the road always leads
To the promise of peace and a slate wiped clean
Keeping up on my history
Hanging from the family tree
As long as blood's still flowing red
I Still need your words in my head
