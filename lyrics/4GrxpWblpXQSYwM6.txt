I lost my soul, deep in the shadows
Now i know, nothing can stop me
I believe, I believe, I believe we can make it out,
We can find a way
I believe, I believe, I believe it... I believe

Please don't cry
Help is on the way
Please don't cry
Help is on the way

I just don't know, which path to go down
The neon glow, could be the end now
I believe, I believe, I believe we can make it out
We can find a way
I believe, I believe, I believe it... I believe

Please dont cry
Help is on the way
Please dont cry
Help is on the way
