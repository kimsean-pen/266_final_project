White light and flowers, a pleasant dream
Only lithium controlls me
Everything keeps going
Frozen
We'll all be dead

Does it make you smile?

Does it make you feel alive?
(Only lithium controls me)
Does it make you feel alive?
(Only lithium controls me)

Embracing the black creates a spark,
and your stomach, an eon in ebony
Is it your final light?
Is it your final light?
Is it your final light?
Is it your final light?
Is it your final light?

The cold envelops you,
black diamonds dance, entrance you
When you look into my eyes
Does it make you feel alive?

Does it make you feel alive?
(Only lithium controlls me)
Do I make you feel alive?
Does it make you feel alive?
(Only lithium controlls me)
Do I make you feel alive?

Do they peirce you?
Do you see them?
Does it make you smile?

Do you see them?
Does it peirce you?
Does it make you feel alive?

Does it make you feel alive?
(Black diamonds dance entrance you)
Does it make you feel alive?
(When you look into my eyes)
(Does it make you feel alive?)

Does it make you feel alive?
Do I make you feel alive?
Does it make you feel alive?
Do I make you feel alive?
