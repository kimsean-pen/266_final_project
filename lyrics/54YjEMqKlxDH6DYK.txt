Hey

Black dress moves in a blue movie
Graverobbes from out space
Well your pulmonary trembles in your outstreched arm
Trembles so wicked

Two inch nails
Micro waist
With a pale white feline face
Inclination eyebrows to there

Mistress to the horror kid
Cemetery of the white love ghoul
Take off your shabby dress
Come and lay beside me

Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer to me

Vampira
Vampira
Vampira

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
