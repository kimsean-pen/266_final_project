I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say; no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's his destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool, playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me, does he kiss like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when he calls your name
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide, the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense -- no self-confidence

But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all...
