Lonely girl you lost the only thing you loved
Nothing that you have is ever good enough
And I won't be the one to keep you safe
And I won't be the one who stays the same

You've got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing me
Well like you miss me
You've got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me

Woah oh, oh
It's a long time to miss me
Woah oh, oh

Lonely girl it looks like you are out of luck
Tell me how it feels to watch your friends give up
I was on your side, I stood by you
So go ahead and cry, it's just like you

You've got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing me
Well like you miss me
You've got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me

Woah oh, oh
It's a long time to miss me
Woah oh, oh

And I don't feel sorry for you
Sorry for you
Cause now the tables turning
And now the bridge is burning
It's coming crashing down
Crashing down
Over you

Over you
Over you
Over you

You've got a lot of nerve and
Looks like the tables turning
And now you're wishing
Well like you miss me
You've got a dirty tongue and
Looks like the damage done is forever
And it's a long time to miss me

Woah oh, oh
It's a long time to miss me
Woah oh, oh
