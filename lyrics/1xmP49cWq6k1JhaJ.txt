We've been walking down this road some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's something behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise

Baby don't, baby don't
Baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't
Baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
I tell you know, I tell you know
I tell you know, why
Know, why
If you ever give up, then we're gonna die
Now we're in the out, baby don't lie

Baby don't lie

Baby tell me there's nothing but love

Baby don't, baby don't

And you can tell me if I'm getting warm
Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm?
And you can tell me if I'm getting warm

Baby don't, baby don't
Baby don't lie
