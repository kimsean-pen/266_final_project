Flash ah, ah
Savior of the Universe

Flash ah, ah
He'll save every one of us

(Seemingly there is no reason for
these extraordinary intergalactical upsets)
(Hahahahahahaha)
(What's happening Flash?)
(Only Doctor Hans Zarkov,
formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation)

Flash ah, ah
He's a miracle

(This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm)

Flash ah, ah
King of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He save with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, with a mighty
Flash

(General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching)
(What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching?)
(Open fire! All weapons!)
(Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body)

Flash ah, ah

(Gordon is alive)

Flash ah, ah
He'll save every one of us

Just a man
With a man's courage
You know he's
Nothing but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Oh oh, oh oh

(Flash, Flash, I love you,
but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!)
