Ha!
Whatever will be
Will be.

Delete me from your friends I don't care what you think
Let's forget we ever met, don't cha worry 'bout me
So I'm sick to my stomach
When I'm think about the wasted time we spend together

Planning on forever (whatever)
Cheat me once, shame on you
Cheat me twice, shame on me
I'm an idiot

That I couldn't see whats underneath
That beautiful face
Or these warm or worse days
Surprise, surprise

I'm doing just fine (whoa)
Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera

Whatever comes I'll be okay
Whatever life Throws my way
You wish I'd hurt
But I'm as free as a bird

And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow
(yeah)
Aaaah
Que sera
I could never go back
To a thing that didn't last

And I'm sorry to say
That you're living in the past

And if you'd ever believe
I would take you back (no)
It took you long to get in
But now you're out so fast

The way you played your cards
shoulda' told me who you are
always goin' all in and you hated when I win
Just had me whipped too far

I shoulda known from the start
that you gamble
with my heart
(ha)

Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Whatever comes I'll be okay

Whatever life throws my way
You wish I'd hurt
but I'm as free as a bird
And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow

Whoo
Ha Ha
Ooooh I feel it in the air
(feel it in the air babe)
Ooooh Theres something better out there

Ooooh Hello to the new me
(hello, hello, hello)

Ooooh So goodbye baby
(goodbye)
I could never go back
to a thing that didn't last
and I'm sorry to say
that you're living in the past
And if you'd ever believe

I would take you back (no)
It took you long to get in
But now you're out so fast
The way you played your cards

shoulda told me who you are
always goin' in all in
and you hated when I win
Just had me whipped too far

I shoulda known from the start
that you gamble
with my heart
(ha)
Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Whatever comes I'll be okay
Whatever life throws my way
You wish I'd hurt

And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow
(whoo)
Aaaah
Que sera, sera
Aaaah
Que sera
