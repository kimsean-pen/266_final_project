I spent the last year paying a stranger to listen,
to childhood thoughts about the love I am missing.

I've fallen for one of betrayal,
Distraced and the book holds.

We made it out of here.
(Cause we made it out of here)
Cause I watched it dimly clear.

(So save yourself)
Cause it's too late for me.
(Just save yourself)
Cause I lost everything.

Lying on the couch and spilling all of my guts out.
Walking out with nothing but a head full of self doubt.

I take back every good thing that I ever said to you.

It was all so meaningless.
(Cause it was all so meaningless)
It didn't help clean up my mess.

(Just save yourself)
Cause it's too late for me.
(Just save yourself)
Cause I lost everything.

Now I See
(You rip me open, rip me up)
Now I See
(You rip me open, rip me up)

I spent the last full year of my life,
Lost in the question, searched to find out, it was all a lie.

(Just save yourself)
Cause it's too late for me.
(Just save yourself)
Cause I lost everything.

Now I See
(Now I See)
