It's hot here at night
Lonely, black and quiet
On a hot summer night
Don't be afraid
Of the world we made
On a hot summer night

'Cause when a long-legged lovely walks by
Yeah you can see the look in her eye
Then you know that it's

Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight

(Stranger)
(Stranger)
For all the dreams and schemes
People are as they seem
On a hot summer night
Don't be no fun
Don't forget you're young
On a hot summer night

A sometime someone you're not
Don't wait to see what you got
'Cause you know that you're

Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
Alright
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight

Well I'll walk until my feet drop
I'm a train when I'm hateful
Yeah, lay right down now
And I'll ride until your head breaks
I'm a-walkin' 'til my brain pops
I will move with the beat now
I'm a chain 'round an A-bomb
I'm a ribbon in the heat now
New York!

Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
New York
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
New York
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight
Tonight
