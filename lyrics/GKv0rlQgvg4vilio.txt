Retreat, dis-ease; I pray for sleep
A temporary absolution
At least in dreams I might find peace
In the unwinding confusion

Sinking down with the fleeting thought that I missed
My chance to own up, to reconcile
Sinking down with the notion that you exist
Like I never owed anything

Drifting fog clears. Alone, I fear
Ending without resolution.
Looming idea, finite, severe:
I have sown our dissolution.
Each night I'm here shaking, unhinged
Still I can't make restitution
Looming idea, finite, severe:
I have made our desolation.

You're there in shadow,
Indicting me. We both know
I can't see you, or make amends
