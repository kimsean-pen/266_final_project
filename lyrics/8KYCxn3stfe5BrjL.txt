Trumpeter sounds a periphic dream the cries now shorn as prelate falls and send away.
Overture mits' forth clarion sky to sun she climbs and sheds her wings into the sea.
Memories rise to obscurate orb - the astral causate forms dissolve and send away.
Severance from illusory field the pilgrim wills to correspond with freedom.

Hold the oscillate light driven on to sender.
Soul arraigns the perceived and the seen to reap.
From the little drawn breath climbs away to the freedomsea.
Consecrates the sushumnic vertebrae.

Nerve currents arrest in abeyant formation.
Purified from the flames of the waking dream.
Negates requisite embodiment from life to life.
Currents ground as the solistic eye prevails.

As the sky grieves way remainder.
And the celestial's glow prevails.
Beyond the seen and seer and the sight which sees.
Into unmodified state reclaimed.

Witness from mind and psychic sheath a guardian sun restrains the world projection.
To knees in tears the purified light cessates the breath and shakes from frame to freedom.
Memories rise to obscure sun - from sorrows wash dissolve attained; returns in weeping.
Takes to flight surmounts the sky and voids the body frame impels into the ground.

Away from manifold formation.
A luminous light's sheen pervades.
Rescinds projected world to freedom.
Unchanged empiric soul remains.
