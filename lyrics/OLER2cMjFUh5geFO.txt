They crowl out from the dark
permeate through my door
float in the hallway
slowly blend into the walls

in the shadow of my grief
I can hear whispered sounds
feel a cold breath on my skin
here they come
to assert their rights

the fear is what I need, what I need to believe
the fear is what I need, what I need to feel

and so i dragged myself
int this gutter of mine
where shades of prey
feed on my soul

I crave to commit my words
to the book of stifled cries
I fell down so long ago
I don't remember now

the fear is what I need, what I need to believe
the fear is what I need, what I need to feel

and so i dragged myself
int this gutter of mine
where shades of prey
feed on my soul
