In this recognizable smell of cigarettes and perfume
And all those plastic-minded beats
Are a madcap explosion and a psychedelic celebration of
An animated youth
It's the senior age
Dancing on the teen stage
It's the field of dreams
Runnin' in the bloodstreams
And I only dream of you...

'Cause I kept it steady
But you kicked me hard and I had to change my ways;
Sneaking up on me like a cheetah;
Disillusioned girl
Keep your eyes straight through me
Heavy eyes

Mmm...

So capturing the essence of a whole lot of fun
In a bottle and a beat, feeling perfectly wrong
Got extensions in the stop
Fallin' madly in love with the pop
Maybe we got it all right
There's a scent in the air...
Got some true romance right here
There's a filthy beam
Going from the mainstream
And I only dream of you

'Cause I kept it steady
But you kicked me hard and I had to change my ways
Sneaking up on me like a cheetah;
Disillusioned girl
Keep your eyes straight through me
Heavy eyes
Straight through me
Heavy eyes
