Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Riddle on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

Ey ey ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
And stay
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah

Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
All the stars would shine upon in red

Stay
Ey ey ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
And stay
Ey ey ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah

And stay (I'm hearing voices all the time up in my mind)
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're hunting my mind)
And stay (I'm hearing voices all the time up in my mind)
Away ey ah
Away ey ah
Away ey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're hunting my mind)

Black out days
I don't recognize you anymore
