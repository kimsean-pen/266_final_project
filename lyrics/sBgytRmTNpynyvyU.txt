Tu as tué mon bébé

I always knew this is gonna end in tears
Didn't think your Miss would keep a souvenir
And I thought that I had heard it all
Till I heard your lover screaming down the phone

I know I said I was under your spell
But this ex is on another level
And I know I said you could drag me through Hell
Said I hoped you wouldn't fuck the Devil
