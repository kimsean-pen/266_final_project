I'm giving you all that I can take
Need you baby, I need you baby
Giving you all that I can face
Do you feel it, baby?
Do you feel it, baby?

I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE

Given your goal is to amaze
Need to face it, need to face it
Giving you picture to portrait
Need the place in, need the place in
I hear nothing at all but your breathing
I hear nothing at all, nothing at all
Giving you more than I can think
Do you feel it, baby?
Do you feel it, baby?

I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE

I hear nothing at all but your breathing
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I hear nothing at all, nothing at all
I hear nothing at all but your breathing
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I hear nothing at all, nothing at all

I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE

I hear nothing at all but your breathing
I need you baby, to KEEP ME ALIVE
To KEEP ME ALIVE
I hear nothing at all, nothing at all
