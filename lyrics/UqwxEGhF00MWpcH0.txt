Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell
our troubles to
and when it's twelve o'clock
we climb the stairs
we never knock
cause nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue

And when it's twelve o'clock
we climb the stairs
we don't ever knock
cause nobody's there
Me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
