"You know what? Of course I have my doubts
It's darker times and I can't always know what's ahead
So what are you going to do about it?
What can be done to resolve the situation?"

Spit at what you don't like
Taste the bitter reactions
Force-fed the weight of the progress
Lead by the will of your might

You can't block out the sun – Won't block out the sun, no!
You can't block out the sun

"It feels like everyone's eyes are on you
I can't be the enemy of myself
Everyone gets knocked down at some point in life
But it's how you deal with it to get back up"

I can't live without nothing
Must have guidance and focus
Cast out all the suffering
Hope thrives only when active

You can't block out the sun – Won't block out the sun, no!
You can't block out the sun – Won't block out the sun!

Sky
Low
No!

"Feels like everyone's eyes are on...
Feels like everyone's eyes are on you"

Won't block out the sun, no!
Won't block out the sun!

You can't block out the sun
You can't block out the sun
