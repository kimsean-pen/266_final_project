Have you heard that Minnie's in the money?
Take my word that Minnie's in the money
She hasn't got a guy Who's got a diamond mine
But she's a welder on the old assembly line
So bless her, yes sir, Minnie's in the moeny
Minnie's in the money, That's fine
She's okay, Whooray! Minnie's in the dough-ray-me
