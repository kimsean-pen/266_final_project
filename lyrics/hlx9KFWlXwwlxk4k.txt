There was a sorrow in there
She can tell I always feel the worst that I can
And all of it was real
It was something far too good to feel

We let our heads cave in
Subject to a greater thing
And faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew

And I do

You see that prize on my wall
It's just one of the heap
Just one from the home
You're in the shadows of my hair
And I know how you'd love to swim
Into the deep instead

We let our heads cave in
Subject to a greater thing
And faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew

And I do
And faster pace, and brighter hues
I'll sacrifice the love I grew
I do
