slow death
feel so good for now
knowing you turn me inside out
you turn me upside down
breaking
already know by now love would
turn me inside out and flip me upside down
we'll clean the mess you made tomorrow
don't worry your big old pretty eyes
we'll clean the mess you made tomorrow
everything is going to be alright
slow death
feel so good for now
knowing you turn me inside out
you turn me upside down
i feel safe inside you
we'll clean the mess you made tomorrow
don't worry your big old pretty eyes
we'll clean the mess you made tomorrow
everything is going to be alright
