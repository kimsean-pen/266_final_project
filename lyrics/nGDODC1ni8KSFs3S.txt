Lying in the green grass
Underneath the blue sky
Looking at a good man
Who oughta be the right guy
He's got that kinda heart that
Any girl would die for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

Treats me like a princess
Let's me have it my way
I can tell he's hanging
On every word that I say
All he does is love me
Swears that's what he's here for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

More fire, more feeling
More stars than what I'm seeing
More hope for what I'd find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of just acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

I oughta say I'm sorry
I oughta say it's over
Let him live his own life
Stop crying on the shoulder
He'd probably say it's alright
And hold me while me tears pour

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?

More fire, more feeling
More stars than what I'm seeing
More hope for what I'd find behind that door
More power, more passion
Instead of just acting
Like I'm the one that he's been looking for

Lying in the green grass
Underneath the blue sky
Looking at a good man
And I know he's the right guy
He's got that kinda heart that
Any girl would die for

So, how could I want more?
How could I want more?
