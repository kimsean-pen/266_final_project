Seventeen, driving fast in a stolen car
Why'd you give me the keys to your heart?
We were young, felt like love, thought we knew it all
Closed our eyes, took a shot in the dark

Eh
I got scared and you noticed
Showed your cards but I folded
I blame me for you leaving
I blame me for you going
Now you're living your new life
I'm still stuck in these highlights
Breaking down

Used to have it all
Threw it all away
Now you're just an imprint on my pillowcase
Used to have it all
Lost it in the waves
Now there's just an imprint where you used to lay
Now there's just an imprint that you left on me

Twenty two, now I miss all the little things
Like how you slept on my side of the bed
How you make me feel I could do anything
But now I'm drinking my courage instead

Oh I fucked up bad and I know it
You was there at my lowest
I blame me for you leaving
I blame me for you going
Now you're living your new life
I'm still stuck in these highlights
Breaking down

Used to have it all
Threw it all away
Now you're just an imprint on my pillowcase
Used to have it all
Lost it in the waves
Now there's just an imprint where you used to lay
Now there's just an imprint that I can't erase

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Mhm mmm mmm mmm
Mhm mmm mmm mmm
Mhm mmm mmm mmm
No

(Used to have it all)
Threw it all away
Now you're just an imprint on my pillowcase
Used to have it all
Lost it in the waves
Now there's just an imprint where you used to lay
Now there's just an imprint that you left on me
