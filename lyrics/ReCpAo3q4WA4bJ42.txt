I am forever the watcher
oath sworn protecter
foretold your saviour
I won't abandon you
I cannot lose you
I won't throw this hope away
the hope you once knew
I pray this sickness never ends
I will not leave you
to suffer at the hands
of sin
if I were silenced
your name i would still speak
There isn't a moment
that you will leave my eyes
as you become faint in person
you're stronger in my mind
so fight the demon inside
fight the demon inside
let go
let others take control
the poison will drain
and the possession will lose its hold
I am forever the watcher
oath sworn protecter
foretold your saviour
and I will never abandon you
I cannot lose you
I pray this sickness never ends
I will not leave you
to suffer at the hands
of sin
if I were silenced
your name i would still speak
I won't abandon you
I cannot lose you
I won't throw this hope away
I won't abandon you
I cannot lose you
I won't throw this hope away
I pray this sickness never ends
I will not leave you
to suffer at the hands
of sin
if I were silenced
your name i would still speak
