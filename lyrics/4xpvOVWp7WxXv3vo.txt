We will drown
Like zombies in the burial grounds
Like vultures in the sky
Watch a dying man
In the right city, right on the wrong side of town
Like ghosts, we don't make a sound

I kept quiet
I didn't care to feel your life
I'm with the black Madonna as my guide
With the wild demon Jesus running by my side
I didn't care to feel your life

Oh Carmelita
Hold me tighter
Does Mary pray for us?
When we are all strung out on heroin
Sitting down at the back of the bus

Feel no pain
Everything is right as rain
This city seems to know my name
She opens up her legs
And I opening a vein
Shines a light for me again

Feel no more
I do not care to fight that war
In a sordid leather jacket
Kneeling on the floor
For 40 minutes dying
And 40 years more
I do not care to fight that war

Oh Carmelita
Hold me tighter
Does Mary pray for us?
When we are all strung out on heroin
Sitting down at the back of the bus

These pretty girls
On the Boardwalk tonight
Pick up your Kansas side
The boys line up to the ride
They hitch up their skirts, sail
Drink till they fight
And I won't look away

All alone and divided we stand
With the marks of carelessness
Blackened in our hands
I don't know,
No, I don't understand
But I won't walk away

Feel no more
I do not care to fight that war
In a sordid leather jacket
Kneeling on the floor
For forty 40 dying
40 fucking years more
With the rats in the road
And the leeches at the door
At 8 a.m. the moment
Man, I can up his score
I do not care fight that war

Oh Carmelita
Hold me tighter
Does Mary pray for us?
When we're all strung out on heroin
Sitting down at the back of the bus

Oh Carmelita
Hold me tighter
Does Mary pray for us?
When we're all strung out on heroin
Sitting down at the back of the bus
