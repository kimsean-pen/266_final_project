You said you'd be there for me
In times of trouble, when I need you, when I'm down
And likewise you need friendship
It's from my side pure love but i see lately things have been changing
You have goals to achieve
But the roads you take are broad and heartless,
the wounds you make you are not aware
You throw stones
Can't you see that I am human?
I am breathing, but you don't give a damn

Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?
Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?

Blood blood blood ... keeps rushing

And now the world is asleep
How will you ever wake her up when she keeps deep in her dreams, wishing!
And yet so many die
And still we think that it is all about us
It's all about you?
You sold your soul to the evil and the lust
and the passion and the money ain't you?
Innocent ones die
People hunger for decades,
suffer under civilized damned robbers, modern slaveholders

Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?
Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?

Blood blood blood ... keeps rushing

Evaded, eliminated, erased, interrogated
Our tradition, our love for our fellow countrymen,
our property, our resources, our pride

Can you feel my heart beating?
NO NO NO NO NO NO
You don't, dont see, don't feel...

Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?
Can't you feel my heart is beating?
Can't you see the pain you're causing?
