Pain, pain go away
Come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.

I guess we'll never know
If when were gone there's a place to go.
Or if we don't see anything at all
Is that what were supposed to call faith?
Well if that is that, and it all just fades to black
And we don't see anything at all
We don't see anything
What are you waiting for?

Pain, pain go away
Come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.
And I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.

The world is a funny place
It kicks you when you're down
And knocks you out when you get up again.
I don't think it's worth suffering through.
But on the other hand
There's a world full of possibilities
And a million other people just like you
Who've all been through what you've been through
They were singing...

Pain, pain go away
Come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.
And I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.

I saw it all flash and pass by
With bright lights
And right before my eyes was the Exit sign.
I saw it all flash and pass by
And asked why I wasted precious time
It just passed me by.
It just passed me by.

We are just passing by.
(Just passing by.)
Just passing by.
Oh, we are just passing by.
(Just passing by.)
Just passing by.

Pain, pain go away
Come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I don't wanna wait for that goodbye to see what could've been.
And I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me.
