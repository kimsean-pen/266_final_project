Goodbye kinsman, polygon
I'm gone abroad, gondwanaland
Drift until I've poly-gone
Into my stop, gondwanaland
Grand and never been
Seen by man, veil of a dream

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

Exit, snow melts, polygon
Flown on rain drops, gondwanaland
It will get hot, polygon
Fasten seatbelts, gondwanaland
Sand and mountain
Unbosom his hidden hand We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland [Instrumental] Polygondwanaland
Can I see the eye
That sees me? Please show me these We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland
