I always swear I never plan again
But I can see the irony
I'm humbled by the passing of time
I am brought down to my knees
An Arizona half and half
A half pack of cigarettes
A vacant lot, my tangled thoughts
Suburbia give me my God again

All the senses say
Nothing has changed
Soft lines from the streetlights fall the same on my face

Something massive happened here
I can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

The house still stands where it was built
I know cause I drove by tonight
A candle in the bedroom
Where I once performed a holy rite
And I did stop to hang my head
Just for a moment at the light
Cause now the altar is dead
And now you're just a friend that once was mine

Oh civilian, I lay low
How can you understand that there's a whole world gone wrong?

Something massive happened here
Can you feel it in the atmosphere?
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

How can I try to be civilized
When inside there is a shifting paradigm
And everything we built, we built on our love
Everything is spinning on the one assumption
How can I try to say sorry
When my words don't carry the same gravity
And everything I say, I say it knowing
Full well you still don't want to believe

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you
