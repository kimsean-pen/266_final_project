Understand the Night
When she flashes her sparkling eyes at dusk
She flirts with twilight
When the noise of day dies away
The night and twilight stay and stay
Making quiet love up high over the town
And the gentle twilighy gives his light
Making a queen of Night

If I could,
I would write a sonnet of the night as a rememberance of your eyes

And, if you'd promise not to tell
I could whisper the words in the dark, like a lover
We could count the stars, the shooting stars
And talk of lovers through the ages who had lived out of their dreams
Such will and courage, they needed to live in a dream
To burn, with every breath so serene
As if they had been the first to find love at all
Like night and twilight
They were the first of lovers ever
Could we be like them?
Hold on to one another until dawn comes
Then, we'll fly off and dream until night and twilight, kiss again

My love
My one and only love
Let me take you out under the moonlight
and show how the twilight loves the night
Why he lives for an hour of loving through lifetimes of longing
And sings his moonlight serenade
