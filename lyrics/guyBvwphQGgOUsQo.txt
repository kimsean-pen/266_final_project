Justify the reasons why, you set my world on fire
Only to get cast into the flames
A falseful bliss, a Judas kiss, you set my soul on fire
Here I stand cast into the flames

I lie next to your tainted skin
My body's still but I shake within

By a fantasy I've been possessed
My crime of passion that I can't confess
Now in the arms of a devil I rest
There's no reason here to justify
There's no remedy, I'm petrified
I've been put to the test, I have fully been possessed
In the arms of a devil I rest

Purify the lust inside
Make my heart beat slower
Incarcerate the burning in my veins
Don't wake my worst, don't quench my thirst
Don't make my heart beat stronger
Never let me feel alive again

I lie next to your tainted skin
My body's still but I scream within

By a fantasy I've been possessed
My crime of passion that I can't confess
Now in the arms of a devil I rest
There's no reason here to justify
There's no remedy, I'm petrified
I've been put to the test, I have fully been possessed
In the arms of a devil I rest
