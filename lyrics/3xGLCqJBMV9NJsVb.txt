The compliments they leave you
When they're leaving
Though I had a really nice time with you
Afraid iImust be leaving
And I know I said I loved you
But I'm leaving

And you have been so great
I want you to know how much you have meant
You're an incredible guy
But I am growing older
And do not wish to be
Wasting any more of my precious time
I know I said I loved you
Now I'm leaving

You were building me a prison
I'm suffocating
You think I'm nearly perfect
And that's not what I am needing
Why can't you call me on my bullshit
Until now that I am leaving

And you have been so great
I want you to know how much you have meant
You're an incredible guy
But I am growing older
And do not wish to be
Wasting any more of my precious time
Our marching down 5th with hands held
Mourning for Orlando was such a
Meaningful incredible night
And you showed me a love
I've never felt quite deserving of
Have some things you can't simply solve in my life
And I know I said I loved you
Now I'm leaving
