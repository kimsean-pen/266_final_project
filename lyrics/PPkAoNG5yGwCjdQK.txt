So you know, if you wanted it,
You could have
(you can have) my heart.
You could have (you can have)
My everything,
And that's just for starts.
So you know, if you're into it,
I might have brought a gun or two.

Don't work.
Don't work don't matter none,
If it stays between me and you
Just so you know,
If you wanna we could
Rob this place and make a break.

Just saying, we could have it all.
We could get the money,
And we could get away
And then, if you want it,
I'll be yours forever.

Maybe we could find a place
And settle down together.
We can live wherever you want,
No matter what it costs.

Baby, you just pick the spot,
And I'll pick the lock.
Just so you know...
We could get the money,
And we could get away,
But you better kiss me now,

Just in case you and
I don't make it out alive
So you know,
If they come at us,
If they take my life,
It will be ok with me,
As long as you're right by my side.

Just so you know...

Even if it's a bust
And the cops show up
I'll take the fall for us.
Just saying,
We could have it all:
We could get the money,
And we could get away.
But you better kiss me now,
Just in case.

Yeah - you better kiss me now, just in case
