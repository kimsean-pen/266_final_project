Do you see the terror from within
And hear sustained outer blame?
Do you feel the liberty as it beats you to the ground?
Do you smell the empty shells of freedom?

Watch the humans race
Straight into death's embrace

You're choking under pressure
With that boot on your neck
They're sticking to their guns
To show you ways to go
And pay their debts

Your rights remain silent (silently changed)
You're right to remain violent
Until they take you away
Free guns, free will
Until we aim higher than our own
Your rights, your risk
Their fists will dry your blood red on the stone
Will dry your blood red on the stone

They'll take your eye for your eye
To make a blind man is injustice, justified
Those who see beyond the lies will rise
The wise will be withheld
The law's biggest fear is truth itself
Price of you life? A dime a dozen
Cheap to buy when you're in the way
Your eye for your eye, if you keep one open
Blind lead the blind, the rats start to race

Your rights remain silent (silently changed)
You're right to remain violent
Until they take you away
Free guns, free will
Until we aim higher than our own
Your rights, your risk
Their fists will dry your blood red on the stone
Will dry your blood red
On the stone of their laws, their gods
Their fraud system is there to gail you, ail you
And sell you on the nails of the cross
Roads of crossbones means that everthing's in order
So sit back, relax, and watch another mass murder

Frenzy
Mass murder frenzy
Mass murder frenzy
Mass murder frenzy
Mass murder
