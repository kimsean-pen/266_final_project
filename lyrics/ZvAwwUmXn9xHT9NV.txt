I have poured out my heart, laid it right here for you
I've tried so hard
that's the best that I can do
Please understand I am not who I was

You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
then I can get back to me

Tears forget, that's more than I can do
'Cause they don't wash away
all the things that we been through
I've put behind me my share of the shame
we could call villains but it's all in vein

You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
then I can get back to me

All of my life I've waited
hoping wanting you to see me the way that I am
But now I know that I'm not alone...
Someone understands...

You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
then I can get back to me
You've got to know that...
You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
then I can get back to me
Then I can get back to me
Then I can get back to me
then I can get back to me
