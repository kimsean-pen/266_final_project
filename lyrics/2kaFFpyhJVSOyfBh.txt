Gimme gimme gimme all your hurt
Gimme gimme gimme all the chains
Lemme lemme lemme take it away
Lemme lemme lemme heal your pain

We have each other
We have each other
We have each other
We have each other

Tell me tell me tell me what they took
Tell me tell me tell me where they live
Lemme lemme lemme put them away
Lemme give you a life again
