Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now that the light is fading
Silver and purple at twilight
Scenes of the day remain with us
Bright as the fire is burning bright

Blue is the sky above the lake
And blue the water flowing
White birch drooping on the shore
Rubies of emerald glowing
The night is roped in spangled black
And soon we shall be sleeping

Beyond the moon, the horizon high
The radiant dawn is creeping, creeping
Down through the leaves, the sunlight
Came in shafts of gold
Now by the dying embers
We watched the day grow old
