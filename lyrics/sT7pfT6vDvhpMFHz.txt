Just after the storm breaks, with the perfect amount of light,
You can catch a glimpse of magic, if the timing is right.
Rainbows are improbable, beautiful, and rare,
But so are you, and so is this, the love that we share.
Too vast to hold, and too small to name, it's no wonder why
You have to stand between the rain and the sun to see a rainbow in the sky.
All the things that had to go right, all the things that had to go wrong
That lead us to the place where we were going all along.
Right now they fall away,
Right now it's just us two,
Right now we make a promise:
If you do, then I do too.
Don't know how we found it, but we did somehow.
All the moments of our lives, were leading up to now.
I used to feel uncertain, but now I realize
When I wanna see my future, I just look into your eyes.
Too vast to hold, and too small to name, it's no wonder why
You have to stand between the rain and the sun to see a rainbow in the sky.
All the things that make you - you, all the things that make me - me,
That lead us to the place where we were always meant to be.
Right now they fall away,
Right now it's just us two,
Right now we make a promise:
If you do, then I do too.
A rainbow doesn't choose to be a rainbow, it just shines in the sky,
And there's nothing to debate, and there's nothing to deny.
Love might be a privilege, but marriage is right.
So to all of you detractors who don't know you've lost the fight,
To all of you in the darkness, we're here turning on the lights.
Now I stand with you for the world to see,
My love, my dreams, and me.
My love, my dreams, and me.
Right now they fall away,
Right now it's just us two,
Right now we make a promise:
If you do, then I do too.
