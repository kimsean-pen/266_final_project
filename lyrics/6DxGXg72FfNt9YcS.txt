-"First time in a while that everything is fine"
I'd lie to you, been lying to myself all the time

And your voice
In the back of my head wishing things could be quiet
And your voice
Murdering the silence consistent like a ritual

I'd stop and stare imagining that you'd be there
I'd spend my days wasting my time constantly

And your voice
In the back of my head wishing things could be quiet
And your voice
Murdering the silence consistent like a ritual
