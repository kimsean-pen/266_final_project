It was the way we always knew that we never had the clue
that we never had the chance like the others in the dance
like black diamonds, ash and light
like the mines and anthracite
split-tongued fellows, venom-survived
violence only against the vile
e'er we bleed into the wild
then laid to rest there, man or child
this shining gutter in the sun
is it worth it in the run
