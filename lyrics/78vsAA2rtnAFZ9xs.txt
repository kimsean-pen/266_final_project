take all my defenses to us
and throw them away
tell me what kind of monster have i been today
but you smile and call me a tough guy
to the opposite effect
it's a flower in a gun
and the tough guys a wreck
sorry i'm crying in public this way
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
i'm sorry i'm causing a scene on the train
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
(Love will be the bridge,
Over the sand,
Love will be the key,
from hand to hand)
like the peach you split open with two thumbs
i'm not half without a stone
and my heart is hollow with a space for your own
or whatever you wanna do with it
and i'm blaming all beauty upon you
from the birds at my feet
to the breakdancing boys and their boomboxes
beat beat beat
i'm sorry i'm crying in public this way
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
i'm sorry i'm causing a scene on the train
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
(Love will be the bridge,
Over the sand,
Love will be the key,
from hand to hand)
each autumn leaf and passing breath
each anadote till sudden death
and there we are
and who'd have guessed
that there it is, just like that
forgive me
sorry i'm crying in public this way
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
i'm sorry i'm causing a scene on the train
i'm falling for you
i'm falling for you
(Love will be the bridge,
Over the sand,
Love will be the key,
from hand to hand)
