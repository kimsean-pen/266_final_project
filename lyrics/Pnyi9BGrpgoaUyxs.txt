So come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!)

So listen here, I'm the voice in your head
And I can say the words that make you feel scared
So here's to you, and all the problems that we've made
And I know it's so hard to stay afloat
When you make monsters out of thoughts
And you're dragged under
And everyone around you is too far away to notice your
Chest start to crash, ooh, but it's alright
Oh, you'll be alright

So just breathe, It's almost over
And don't let the monster in your head
Become your fears
'Cause you can save yourself, you know
You know

So listen here, I know it's hard
Maybe I can't be what you want
But I'm just who I am, I'm trying to see what you could be
And I am still here, the voice in your head
And I'll be there for you, when no one else cares
And this is it, as far as where we've gotten since
So know a good thing when you got it
I hope you know, you don't go alone

(Come on, what's the big deal? Nobody's that heartless!)
You know it's time
It's time to decay
