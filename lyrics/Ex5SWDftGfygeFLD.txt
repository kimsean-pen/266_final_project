Sometimes I lie to get what I want (ooh ooh hoo)
Oh man, it's terrible I know
They won't agonize
And every time we betamax along (OOOOoohhhhh)

Sometimes I fight to get what I want (ooh ooh hoo)
Closer can help your mind, i know
Oh no either time it's hard to get inside alone (OOOOoohhhhh)

Miles 'til the very end of the sky
Loving every hour
Loving every minute
Arms and fingers, miles apart
Suddenly realize
My love is infinite

Sometimes I lie to get what I want (ooh ooh hoo)
Oh no, it's tearing me apart
This time I will drive
For we've decided to see the long way home (OOOOoohhhhh)

Miles 'til the very end of the sky
Loving everyday
more than every minute
Arms and fingers, miles apart
Suddenly realize
My love is infinite

I'm hunky-dory every day
Loving every hour
Loving every minute
Hours and minutes, it's miles apart
