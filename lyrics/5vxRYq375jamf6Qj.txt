I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire until the fire played with me
Yeah

And the stone was semi-precious
We were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be in the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day

We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
And it's not if I believe in love
But if love believes in me
Come on and believe in me

At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I have been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
And my body's now a begging bowl
And it's begging to get back
Begging to get back to my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

And I was punching in the numbers
At the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me

At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down till the pain would stop

At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me
