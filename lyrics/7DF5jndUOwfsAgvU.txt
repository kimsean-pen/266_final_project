Do you always trust your first initial feeling?
Special knowledge holds truth bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me
And I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like clear water fountain

Drove me like a magnet to the sea
How the faces of love have changed turning the pages
And I have changed oh, but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around
Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me
And I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet to the sea
