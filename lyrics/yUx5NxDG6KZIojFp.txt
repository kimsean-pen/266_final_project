Constantly in-between
Home and where I'll be
Light separates the space
I feel the cold against my face

I know I'll be there soon
Don't worry, I saw it too

Always passing through
Always torn in two
Staring straight through the night
While your red eyes said enough

I know I'll be there soon
Don't worry, I saw it too

Long way away always
Long way away always
Long way away always
Long way away always

Constantly in-between
Home and where I'll be
Light separates the space
I feel the cold against my face
