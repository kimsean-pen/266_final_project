I know that you feel that I keep you in the dark,
give it time and your eyes will adjust,
the feelings I hold start bleeding out my arms,
they don't know a thing about us

Cause like, wrecking balls come and set us free,
no iPhone come get the world and your still next to me,
now my feet don't touch the ground,
you throw me up
won't let me down

I can spend my life without a care,
with feelings
that there's somethin' in the air

If you knew the story before it was told
so picturess so perfectly clear
if you guessed the ending before it unfolds
I'm sayin' that you'd still be here

Came outta' nowhere
got lost in your sweet stare
I don't see another way

Just like a, wrecking balls come and set us free,
the kind of love that'll blind you but,
you'll never see ours
now my feet don't touch the ground
you throw me up
won't let me down

I can spend my life without a care
with a feeling
that there's somethin' in the air

Now my feet don't touch the ground
you throw me up
won't let me down

I can spend my life without a care
with a feeling
there's somethin' in the air

Now my feet don't touch the ground!
You throw me up!
There's noway down!

I can spend my life without a care!
Do you feel it!?
There's somethin', somethin, something in the air...
