So many feelings
End up in here
Left alone I'm with
Oh, an atmoshere

I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Just want to break out
Kick off this skin

I can't escape myself

All my problems
Lume larger than life
I can swallow
Another slice

Seems like my shadow
Marks every strike
Cannot learn to live with
What stuck inside

I can't escape myself
I can't escape myself

So many feelings
End up in here
Left alone I'm with
Oh, an atmoshere

I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Cannot learn to live with
Kick off this skin

I can't escape myself
I can't escape myself...
