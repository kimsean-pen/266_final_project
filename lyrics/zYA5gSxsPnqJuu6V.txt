Some folks like to get away
For a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach
Or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River Line
I'm in a New York state of mind
It was so easy living day by day

Out of touch with the rhythm and the blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times,
The Daily News

Oh, It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me

'cause I've let it slide
Don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside

I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
I'm just taking a Greyhound

On the Hudson River
Line

'Cause I'm in
I'm in a New York
state
of
Mind
New York State
of Mind
