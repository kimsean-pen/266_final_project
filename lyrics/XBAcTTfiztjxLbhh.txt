Outside my window there's a cave
Beyond that, I couldn't say
We sit inside and watch the tube
All my friends are on the net
And all my friends are in the net
And all of us are out of it
And none of us are into it
And everything I intuit
Says that we goin' on a ride for joy
All along for the girls and boys
Create, destroy, make, destroy
Inside your pocket there's a way
We used to travel out for days
But what's the point
We came unglued

Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real

All my friends are on the net
And all my friends are in the net
And all of us are out of it
And none of us are into it
And everything I intuit
Says that we goin' on a ride for joy
All along for the girls and boys
Create, destroy, make, destroy

Nobody kicks it
Everybody wants it
Nobody gets it

Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
Nobody hangs out anymore, in real, in real
