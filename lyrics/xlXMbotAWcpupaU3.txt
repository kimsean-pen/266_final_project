Messed up once again, told me it's okay
But this path that I'm taking
I'm lost in the deep end

My last chance, never more, told me it's alright
In this sea of denial
I'm cleansed in the fire

So why is it me?
Am I blinded or too blind to see?
(Am I too blind to see?)

Why was I born
Not a part of this society?
Again and again,

I tried so hard to reach for the stars but I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching

Same thing, different day, try to make a change
Left with nothing more to live for
But everything to die for

Humanity, insanity, the everlasting grip
Lost all will to keep trying
Our beds we must lie in

So why was I born
Not a part of this society
Again and again,

I tried so hard to reach for the stars but I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching...

For two thousand ways to say sorry
Life writes it's own tragic story
Time marches onwards and nothing can ever be the same

But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
Break free from this lifetime of sorrow
Years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game

I tried so hard to reach for the stars but I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching

I tried so hard to reach for the stars but I failed you all
Tried to keep standing tall
Never had a real chance at all
But still I'm searching...

For two thousand ways to say sorry
But life writes it's own tragic story
Time marches onwards and nothing can ever be the same

But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
Break free from this lifetime of sorrow
Years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game
