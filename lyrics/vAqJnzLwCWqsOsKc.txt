A grew soul, purple and blue
But I think I've found something in you
You hold my hand so close between yours
All of this time I always thought it would be your hand

Holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine

For these days I just count the hours
Oh, shape shifting boy in all of those scours
You hold your hand so close between yours
All of this time I always thought it would be your hand

Holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine

Thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
