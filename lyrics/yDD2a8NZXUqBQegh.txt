Did you see the news last night?
They shot another one down
Does it even matter why?
Or is it all for nothing?

Father, oh Lord in heaven, is this how you saw it?
When you made your creation, is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Maybe we'll never know
Or maybe we'll find paradise in the sky
When we die
When we die
When we die

Took her to the moon last night
Let a little, wait a little, why?
Left everything else but high
No plans on coming home

Father, oh lord in heaven
This is what you've started, it's your creation
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Rather watch the world burn down from a penthouse cloud, real talk
But if this is what you want I'll fight 'til the smoke-filled skies make the days turn night, then what?
Maybe when the world burns down and the clouds turns black and the sky turns white and the days turn night
It's a war outside, it's a war outside, it's a war outside
Or maybe we'll find paradise in the sky
When we die
