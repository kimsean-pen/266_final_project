Bitter tears flow through eternity
Lovers play out another tragedy
And you tell me

Hold on, hold on
I hear you say Hold on
Hold on.
I'll come back for you

I will wait for you
Tomorrow never comes
It can't be true
Life is not the same now without you.
Just a memory
Everything's empty without you.
Another night, another love song
Watching flowers die behind the wall

When you told me
Hold on, hold on
I hear you say Hold on
Hold on.
I'll come back for you

I will wait for you
Tomorrow never comes
It can't be true
Life is not the same now without you.
Just a memory
Everything's empty
Without you

I will wait for you
Tomorrow never comes
It can't be true
Life is not the same now without you
Just a memory
Everything's empty
without you
