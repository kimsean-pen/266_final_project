You won't hold me in my arms any more.
We've paid our price, learned from the sores.
I'm already gone, the house of stone we built has turned into sand.
And you know I'd still hold your hand.
A hope I can't conceal,
the memory how we used to feel.

Some winters end in loss and pain,
and thus all love ended in shame.

Shame ... that i was broken as a woman can be,
and I think don't you'll ever see
the hours of the dawn
that I still suffer on

Some winters end in loss and pain
and thus all love ended this way
In shame

Go on leave me for the last time
You can't save me again
again

Oh love is what you get
who knows how to start when it ends
And Iwish we could still be friends
but we wont end that way
sometimes there is just no more to say

Some winters end in loss and pain
and thus all love ended in shame
In shame
