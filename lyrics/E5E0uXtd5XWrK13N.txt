I met this real cool dude today
Looking like Jack Palance
He said I wanna get through to you
And help you find your talent
He said that if I had a certain style
Then stuff would start to happen
He said that soon he was going away
'Cause he's a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
He's a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
He's a major talent
I don't know

I said that he was getting through to me
And I would take his challenge
And maybe soon I'd be going away
'Cause I had certain talents

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
I'm a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside

I met this dude today
Down in the sewers of Paris
Was hiding from the sun
What a waste of talent
