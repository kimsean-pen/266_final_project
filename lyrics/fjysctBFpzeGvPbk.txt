I wish your mind was more like your heart
Nailed shut
Looking back, can't remember too much love

Now when I fall down
When I get weak
When I grow tired
I'll never drop my sword

Tell me a sadder story
So I can fall asleep
The right way, if I knew the right away
Well, we wouldn't be here

Now when I fall down
When I get weak
When I grow tired
I'll never drop my sword

Do you think Jesus loves me?
Can I go home again?

I'm a boy.
