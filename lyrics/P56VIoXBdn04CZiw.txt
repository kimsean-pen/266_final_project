I want to be back
Please take me to the filed
Where the sky flows
Into my eyes
So I can barely see
Wave me down, to you brother

Be my anemone
Pick me down
From this sky for I dissolve
In light, in sun, in day
My journey is so long and I am so small

And I can see the waves
Rumble and grow
A blur and pink puffy giant
Like a blanket I will use you
And cry with you to learn from you
