If this is true, I thought then, what will I think.
Will I stay but rather I would get away.
I'm scared that i won't find a thing,
And afraid that I'll turn out to be alone, but I.

I have to learn, have to try, have to trust I have to cry.

Have to see, have to know that i can be myself, yeah.

And if I could I would stay.
And if they're not, not in my way.
I'll stare here in the distance.

But I'll grow up to be just like you, yeah.
I'll grow up to be just like you, yeah.

I see it all I'm sure but,
Do I know what's right?
I thought I knew but it turns out the other way.
I am scared that I won't find a thing,

And afraid that I'll turn out to be alone, but I,

I have to learn, have to try, have to trust I have to cry.

I have to see, have to know that I can be myself.

And if I could I would stay.

And if they're not not in my way.

I'll stare here in the distance.
But I'll grow up to be just like you, yeah.

I'll grow up to be just like you.

I want to tell you.
Why would I try to?
You are all that I can see now.

Why would I try to?

And I want to tell you.
Why would I try to?
You are all I can see now.

I know I'll try to.

I have to learn, have to try, have to trust, I have to cry.
I have to see, have to know that I can be myself.

But if I could, yeah, I would stay.

And if they're not, not in my way.
I'll stare here in the distance.

But I'll grow up to be just like you, yeah.

I'll grow up to be just like you,

Like you.
