One, two

One, two, three, four
She gets the sun in the daytime
Perfume in the dusk
And she come out in the night time
With the honeysuckle musk
Because she smells like a rose
And she tastes jus' like a peach
She got me walking where the wildlife goes

I'd do anything to reach her
And she was made in Heaven
Heaven's in the world
Oh, she was made in Heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love?
You know I'm crazy for the girl

Just crazy for the girl
And she called me just to talk
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine
She says, "Hey mister you wanna take a walk
In the wild West End, sometime"
And I get trouble with my breathing
But she says, "Boys don't know anything"
But I know what I want

Don't want to please
Yes, I want everything
'Cos she was made in Heaven
As Heaven's in the world
Oh, she was made in Heaven
Just Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love?

See I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for the girl
Well I feel so good 'cos I feel so good
I feel so good 'cos it feels so right

I was made to go with my girl

Just like a saxophone
Was made to go with the night
She can raise one eyebrow
Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweat on her lip
Oh and I surrender to the fever
And I surrender to the weather midnight

She love me so tender
I got to believe her love
But expresso love's alright
'Cos she was made in Heaven
And Heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in Heaven
Heaven's in the world

Is this expresso love?

You know I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for that girl
Mama Mama
No and I don't want no sugar in it
No thank you very very very
All wired upon it, all fired upon it
Expresso touch
Ho, ho!
Na, na, na
Hey Maestro, expresso na
Hey Maestro
She says "Expresso na"
Is this another one, just like the other one
It's just another one, just like the other one
Oh hey Maestro, expresso
