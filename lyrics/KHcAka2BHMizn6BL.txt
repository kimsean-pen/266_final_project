You never show your love
No matter what I do
You're keeping up your guard
You locked away your heart yeah
You wanna stay the shore
And never ride the wave
But if you take the dive
If you know that you're alive yeah

But you just wanna take things slowly
You just wanna seek in silence
But if you're gonna be sad you'll see, yeah
Be happy that you do feel something
Be happy that you do feel something
And if you gonna be mad at me, yeah
I'm happy that you do feel something
I'm happy that you do feel something

I wanna keep you close
No matter what you say
I won't speak too loud to make me understood, yeah
You'll open up some day
You're meant to feeling it all
And I'll be here to face
The darkness of the night

But you just wanna take things slowly
You just wanna seek in silence
But if you're gonna be sad you'll see, yeah
Be happy that you do feel something
Be happy that you do feel something
And if you're gonna be mad at me, yeah
I'm happy that you do feel something
I'm happy that you do feel something

'Cause I'm still sure how do we nowhere to go... where to go

'Cause I don't wanna see you hurting
I just wanna make you smile
But if you're gonna be sad you'll see, yeah
Be happy that you do feel something
Be happy that you do feel something
And if you're gonna be mad at me, yeah
I'm happy that you do feel something
I'm happy that you do feel something

But if you're gonna be sad you'll see, yeah
Be happy that you do feel something
Be happy that you do feel something
And if you're gonna be mad at me, yeah
I'm happy that you do feel something
I'm happy that you do feel something
