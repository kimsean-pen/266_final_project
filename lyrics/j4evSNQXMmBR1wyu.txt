Don't let the silence get you down,
Though you've been sittin' here for hours,
Hoping a voice could soon be found
That speaks much louder that this music.

If you're a little off colour and,
Out for the count,
Don't let it get you down.

Don't let the talking keep you up,
If they're your friends they share your vision,
And as the phone ring breaks the silence they figure out that you don't want to answer.

If you're a little off colour and
Tired of the sounds
Don't let it get you down.

Don't let the people make you think
That just because you're young you're useless
You know it's not naive to think that you can change the things around
And that no man is an island.

For I'd rather be a pebble in
An ocean vast and drown
Than be alone they make no sounds
