The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again

Their ideas made me want to spit
A hundred dollars goes down the pit
Thirty-thousand wheels are rollin'
And my stick shift hands are swollen
Everything involved is shady
The Big Three killed my baby
Yeah-yeah, yeah

The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again

Why don't you take the day off and try to repair?
A billion others don't seem to care
Better ideas are stuck in the mud
The motor's runnin' on Tucker's blood
Don't let them tell you the future's electric
'Cause gasoline's not measured in metric
Thirty-thousand wheels are spinnin'
And oil company faces are grinnin'
Now my hands are turnin' red
And I found out my baby is dead
Yeah-yeah, yeah

The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again

Well, I've said it now, nothing's changed
People are burnin' for pocket change
And creative minds are lazy
And The Big Three killed my baby
Yeah-yeah, yeah

And my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence
Yeah, my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence
I'm about to have another blowout, yeah
I'm about to have another blowout
