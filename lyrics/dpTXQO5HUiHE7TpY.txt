Later on
I will find you
Not too strong
Not inspired

I've been holding off so long
Can't admit that I was wrong
I've been stung when I've been weak
In the end I disappear

But I've gone
All along

Pick me up
Cut me out
Tie me up
You're still smiling

I've been wasting all these years
Still you haven't disappeared
I've been lifted I've been poor
And I don't think I belong

Am I wrong?
All along

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Can't hold on
Well I smile
Could I reach you
All the while

I can't stop
It's always been
Awfully useless
You just smile and

Can I scream
Am I hurt
I still miss you
I still burn

Can I bend
To your will
Know I need to
Have to learn
