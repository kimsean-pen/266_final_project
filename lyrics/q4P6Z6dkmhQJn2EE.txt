As the night is leaving - silently retreating down an empty hall
Suddenly a stirring - finally recurring where I let it fall
Following the wanderings of a dream - a dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky - believing in a love.

Dancing with a stranger - careless of the danger there within his smile
While the dew was forming - breathing in the morning like a sleeping child.
If the memory of the light should fade - horizons reaching cold and blue
Until your heart is free to fly - then I will keep the sun for you.
Until you touch the open sky - then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodby - then I will keep the sun for you.
