Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
He wanna do something keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
He wanna shake it up

Shake it down
Doing it right
He wanna jump back half flap doing it right
He wanna lay you down

Turn it up
Kicking it loose
He wanna fly high nigh high
Baby for you'se
He wanna motormouth

Float around
Baby the back
He wanna shake it up
Shake it down
Moving round ha ha

Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
Susie like to agitate

Get the boy and make him wait
Mother's preaching Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn
He wanna do something keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you girl
He wanna do it up keep it high

Deep in the night
He wanna eye ball
Get hard
Playing it right
He wanna turn the key

Hurt the sheets
Move to the left
He wanna hot scrub
Hot love
Making it wet
He wanna give hot jump shot
Move to the left

He wanna time bar
Slam dunk ha ha ha
Keep it goin'
Party now
Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me

Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
Sister say she love him some
(She's doin' it, she's doin' it)

God is jammin' on the run
Mother's preaching Abraham
Brothers they don't give a damn
Johnny's begging pretty please
Keep the brother on his knees
Susie likes to agitate

(Keep doin' it keep doin' it)
Get the boy and make him wait
Sister's marries to a hood
Sayin' that she got it good
Holy Mary Mercy me
I can't believe the things I see

Thinkin' that they got it made
They doin' what they used to hate
Push it in stick it out
(Keep doin' it)
(Keep doin' it)
That ain't what it's all about
That ain't what it's all about

Holy Mary Mercy me
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)

I can't believe the things I see
(Goin' on now)
Mother's preaching Abraham
(She's doin' it she's doin' it)
Brothers they don't give a damn
(Holy Mary moly Mary)
Sister say she loves him some

(She's goin' down)
God is jammin' all around
(God is jammin')
Holy Mary Mercy me
(She's holy Mary moly Mary)

I can't believe the things I see
(Keep on goin')
You're doin' it
You're dirty
Keep doin' it
You're dirty
Keep nasty
You're nasty
You're doin' it

You're dirty
You're dirty
You're doin' it
You're nasty
You're doin' it
Keep dirty
Keep dirty
You really want it
(Go'on now)
(Close your eyes)
(I gotta make)
(Close the door)
(She's dirty)
(She's oh)
(She's)
(Keep on goin')
(Party down)
Holy Mary mercy me
I can't believe the things I see
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
