Oh the band marched on in formation
The brass was phasing tunes I couldn't place
Windows open and raining in
Maroon, yellow, blue, gold and gray

The drunks were ricocheting
Off the old buildings downtown empty so long ago
Windows broken and dreaming
So happy to leave what was my home

With a sky blue sky this rotten time
Wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh, I didn't die, I should be satisfied
I survived, it's good enough for now

With a sky blue sky this rotten time
Wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh if I didn't die, I should be satisfied
I survived, it's good enough for now
