The plastic flowers you gave for sit on the table so unstable
And there is some greasy finger prints on the pre-wrote birthday card you wrote your name in
And I know that you make your effort
But I think you could do much better

A rose is blue and violets red
Say it isn't true Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
All your dreams are just a kiss away...

I ask you for a letter so you emailed, Have we failed?
Oh, you kiss with such a potential,
Then ask to speed up
It's not enough
Now I am carrying my own bags up,
17 flights of stairs, love

A rose is blue and violets red
Say it isn't true, don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams is just a kiss away...

You shouldn't take just valentine day
Just to show you love me
You don't need any money,
Just abit of imagination

A rose is blue and violets red
You say it isn't true,
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams is just a kiss away

All roses blue and violets red
You say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make

All your dreams is just a kiss away!
