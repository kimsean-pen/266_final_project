Delete the pictures off my phone
You know, you know
You were never in my zone
Pack your bag, it's time to go
You know, you know
You are not the one I want

All of them messages you sent
Talking 'bout how we should stay friends
Come again, come again, come again
Every single second that we spent
Every single place and time we went
Off again, off again, off

I, you, us
Never, never, never again
I, you, us
Never, never, never again
I, you, us
Never, never, never again

Our story was beautiful
You know, you know
Tables turn and pages burn
Tryna climb up on my walls
You won't, you won't
It will be as if I never knew

The next girl that you meet
Couldn't do what I do on repeat
Come again, come again, say it loud
Never, ever see you on my street
Boy, you'll never talk to me
Let me spell, let me spell, spell it out

I, you, us
Never, never, never again
I, you, us
Never, never, never again

I will no longer be yours on your shoulders
So cry all you wanna, I can't stay to listen
To you telling me 'bout how perfect we were
Cause it's you who broke this and it feels so good to say
I and I, you and I, you and us isn't right
You weren't there when I needed you by my side
And so now you won't listen to me when I sing it to you
It's to easy to say it like, no no no no

I, you, us
Never, never, never again
I, you, us
Never, never, never again
