Ain't this a pity
People ain't this a damn cryin' shame
Oh yes, ain't this a pity
People you know this a damn cryin' shame

Wait those nine below zero
And this woman then put me down for another man
I give her all my money
All of my lovin' and everything
Yes, I give her all my money
People, I give her all of my lovin' and everything
When it goes nine below zero
And she done put me down for another man

She lied to me
She did not tell me everything
Oh yeah, oh yeah, she lied to me
The little girl didn't tell me everything
Well you know it's nine below zero
And she put me down for another man

Ain't this a pity
People this a damn cryin' shame
Oh yes, ain't this a pity
People you know this a damn cryin' shame
She waits til it got nine below zero, Tom
And this little girl then put me down for another man

I'm gonna retire down to Louisiana
Layin' out there in the fallin' rain (in the swamps too)
Yes, I'm gonna retire down to Louisiana
Oh yes, I'm layin' out there in the fallin' rain
You know it's nine below zero here in Chicago
And my love don't mean a thing
