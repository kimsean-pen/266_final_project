Oh, whoa

You've been running 'round, running 'round, running 'round
Throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up, babe

You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in L.A.
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking about when you were mine
And now I'm all up on you, what'd you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never getting over you

You've been running 'round, running 'round, running 'round
Throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standing face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know that you won

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret, yeah
You got me thinking about when you were mine
And now I'm all up on you, what'd you expect, yeah?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never getting over you

What are you doing to me? What are you doing, oh?
What are you doing to me? What are you doing, oh?

What are you doing to me? What are you doing, love?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never getting over you
