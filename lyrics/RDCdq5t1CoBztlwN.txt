it's always the same
always the same story
"tell me what, when i can come in"
to a hopeless troglodyte
but one more time
my answer stands
i swear i mean "no opens"
but you better learn to read
it's all 'bout membership

hey, for you to note
ugly girls and boys
i put you on my list
and make you clap to this[?]
but, man, i just don't need that trip
my only one commune
and soon you're saying different

d v n o
four capital letters
printed in gold
'cause details make the girls sweat even more
while they're shaking their belt
no need to ask my name
to figure out how cool i am

can anyone read, anyone feel
that i'm losing my patience
i just came here to bounce
ladies are all waxed
they all now i'm coming
i'm losing my patience
i just came here to bounce
