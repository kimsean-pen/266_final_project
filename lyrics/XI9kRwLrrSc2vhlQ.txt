Hear one thousand screams
Hear one thousand voices
A solitary echo
Feel one thousand pains
But one is receiving
A bloody invitation
Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
Do you want taste the life?
To taste the life, to taste the life flow
Go, go
Feel one thousand lost
Sinking into soft skin
Ingest rejuvenation
One to consume
One to renew
Demanded invitation
Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
Do you want taste the life?
To taste the life, to taste the life flow
I offer grace
I offer blood
I offer everything till my heart is crystal clear
I offer grace
I offer blood
I offer everything till my heart is crystal clear
Let me taste the life flow
Do you want to feel the warmth?
To taste the life, to taste the life
I want to taste the life
To taste the life, to taste the life flow
Go, go, whoa, go
