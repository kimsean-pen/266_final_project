Well, we came up from the gutter
The wrong side of the tracks
Yeah, we came up from the gutter
Wrong side of the tracks
You know the music brought us out, babe
And we ain't never been back

'Cause we went city to city
All around the world
Yes, we went city to city
All around the world
You know it never looked like enough, honey
Even after thirty years

'Cause we come blazing like a shooting star
We light you up real good
We come blazing like a shooting star
And we light you up real good
We're gonna hit you like a flash of lightning
Just like a bad boy would
Make your name

You know the only thing that's missing
Is a little mouth harp blues, mouth harp blues
You know the only thing that's missing
Is a little mouth harp blues, that's how we do it
And you know life's full of surprises
You know we do that too
Oh yeah
Come on

You know we ain't too good looking
But we are satisfied, satisfied
No, we ain't never been good looking
But we are satisfied, satisfied
We should've opened up a little whorehouse, honey
Get a little booty on the side
