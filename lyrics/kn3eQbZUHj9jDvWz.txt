You've given me affection,
It's never enough,
Reflections to hold,
Abilities to hold in the mind,
A memory,
A memory to keep,
To know by heart,
What's precious to me,
I can't remember you but you know it,
I've forgotten everything.

Finding out the actual year made me realize how much happier I was not knowing,
I'm heavily distracted is this just an illusion is this romantic dreaming?
I've forgotten everything.

Blow my sorrows away,
Warm my cold heart,
I want to recognize you but I don't know who you are,
Is this romantic dreaming?
Is this just an illusion?
Is this romantic dreaming?
A memory?
I've forgotten everything.
