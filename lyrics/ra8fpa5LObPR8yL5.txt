I can't get off my high horse and I can't let you go
You are the one who, you are the one who
Makes me feel so real, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, what I'm I supposed to
Oh, what I'm I supposed to do baby
When I'm so hooked-up on you then I realize, oh, I realize
That you are somebody else's guy

Oh yeah
Why you wanna do this to me boy

Can you remember the times we spent together
Sharing the days in the sun
Then I found out you were somebody else's lover
After all the plans were made now they're shattered

Still I can't get off my high-horse I can't let you go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh, what I'm I supposed to do when I hooked so on you
Then I realize that you're somebody else's guy

That day in September I'm sure you can remember

That's when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi
But baby yet I still care

You know I loved you so baby that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And realize you're somebody else's guy

You know I loved you so baby that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And then realize you're somebody else's guy

You know I loved you so baby that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Oh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And then realize you're somebody else's guy
