You don't know
Who you are
The rose gonna take and
Make you walk too far

You are a liar
You are a thief
You are a star
But you don't know who you are

You are just a kid
With a sentimental heart
Fade away what happened
Before you were a star

You don't need the package
You don't need the stuff
You don't need nobody
To feel your empty cough

Ta, ta, ta
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Baby you're a star
Ta, ta, ta

Never give up, caught a train
Never been a slave to your own name
You are a poet, you are a fake
You are a star
You don't know who you are

We could shout a lie
Here inside the dark
Get a little closer to loneliness' back
There's nothing left to win
And you could only lose
What's giving you for duel
What you always wanna do

Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Baby you're a star
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are

Lately I've been feeling
Like the stars were rolling out for me
Stars were rolling out
Lately I've been feeling
But the stars were rolling out for me
Stars were rolling out
But maybe the misleading
Is just a lie reflecting off the street

You are just a kid
With a sentimental heart
Do you feel self?

You don't need the package
You don't need the stuff
You don't need nobody
To feel your empty cough

Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Be, be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Baby you're a star
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Be who you are
Ta, ta, ta
Baby you're a star
Ta, ta, ta
