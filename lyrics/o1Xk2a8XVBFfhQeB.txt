There was a time when I tried to hold the ocean in my fists
When I mistook the language for the light
There was a tightness that gripped my soul and bubbled at my wrists
And choked me within inches of my life

But now I'm letting go
And I can finally breathe, I can finally breathe

And my hands are open, reaching out
I'm learning how to live with doubt
I'm learning how to lean into the grey
'Cause I've had enough of black and white
I'll find another way and I will lean into the grey
I'll lean into the grey

There was a time when I tried to bind and bottle up the sea
I tried to hide my heart inside my head
There was a maze of these vicious lines that cut through everything
I pulled against them till my body bled

But now I'm letting go
And I can finally breathe, I can finally breathe

And my hands are open, reaching out
I'm learning how to live with doubt
I'm learning how to lean into the grey
'Cause I've had enough of black and white
I'll find another way and I will lean into the grey
I'll lean into the grey

I will find, I will find another way, way
And I will lean, I will lean into the grey, grey

Now I'm letting go
And I can finally breathe, I can finally breathe

And my hands are open, reaching out
I'm learning how to live with doubt
I'm learning how to lean into the grey
'Cause I've had enough of black and white
I'll find another way and I will lean into the grey
I'll lean into the grey

Yeah, I've had enough of black and white
I'll lean into the grey
I'll lean into the grey
I'll find another way and I
Will lean into the grey
I'll lean into the grey
