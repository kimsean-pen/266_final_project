Father pray for me now
I'll bleed my God damn eyes
And fill my heart with spite
Now's the time and the place
God save me
The dawn of hate, all light erased
Complete me
Complete me
Stop breathing
Die slowly

I despise living lies, so I ask myself
Why I even try?
Why God, why?
All these thoughts in my head wishing I was dead
Why'd I even try?

Why God, why?

Fool me once yeah shame on me
Fool me twice you'll wish you never fucking met me

Begging for your life, we all die tonight
Genocide, burning on a cross, hope is fucking lost
Begging for your life, we all die tonight
Genocide, burning on a cross, hope is fucking lost

What, what...
Begging for your life, we all die tonight
Genocide, burning on a cross, hope is fucking lost

I despise living lies, so I ask myself
Why I even try?

Why God, why?
All these thoughts in my head wishing I was dead
Why'd I even try?
Why? Tell me fucking why?

Father forgive me for I do not give a fuck
He pushed me to the edge and now he's out of luck
Father forgive me for I do not give a fuck...
He pushed me to the edge and now he's out of luck
Fuck!
Take my life with my knife
Cut me deep inside
Righteousness denied
Why God, why?
No more thoughts in my head
I found peace in death
Why'd I even try?
Why God, why?
