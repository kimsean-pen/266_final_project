She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood, flow concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood, concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms, thunderstorms, thunderstorms
