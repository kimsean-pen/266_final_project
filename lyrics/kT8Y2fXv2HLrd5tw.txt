Another lost cause
She's messing with a lot of things
She wants the applause
She's gonna give up everything... off we go
Into the wild and dangerous side
Been through a lot of pain... help
Another lost cause
She's messing with a lot of things, a lot of things and now she turns it up!
All night, we breakin' off
That's why, she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm 18 in the clutch
Woman, who you callin'? Captain love
Yea, I'll be your captain, we can't slow this thing down
She'll make your jaw drop
Despise the fashion but you wear the shoes
Don't let your heart stop
You'll be ready once you pay your dues
Into the wild and dangerous side
Where there's no one to blame
Another lost cause
We're messing with a lot of things, a lot of things and now we turning up!
All night, we breakin' off
That's why, she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm 18 in the clutch
Woman, she's calling captain love
It's not a lost cause
You know we all want everything
It's just some old laws
That keep us judging, breaking wings, but so what?
It's time to turn it up!
All night, we breakin' off
That's why, she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm18 in the clutch
Woman, aren't you? Captain love
Calling captain love, o' calling my number baby
Yea yea yea... they call me the captain
Woah woman, ill be your captain on this ride.
