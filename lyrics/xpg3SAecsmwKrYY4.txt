Tell me where we're going tonight
Home is better than wandering in our heads
We tried everything to save our love
The best was always waiting to come
Did we dig too deep
For fifty-one reasons not to lose our souls?
And it's not that you're not the one
And it's not that you're not the one
We all need a little peace

Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?

Tell me where we're going so fast
Never used to run when we were young
And I'm running out of words
I still love you like the very first time

Pack your bags with all the lives you've been before
And leave behind what you don't want no more
Sometimes sometimes you wanna wanna go back
But it don't work like that

Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?

Memories come and then they go
You just learned how to let go
Sometimes sometimes you wanna wanna go back
But it don't work like that

Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
Do you feel a little broken?
