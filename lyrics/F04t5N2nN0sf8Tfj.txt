Did you ever think of me
As your best friend?
Did I ever think of you?
I'm not complaining

I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel
This vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach
Your eden

Did I ever think of you
As my enemy?
Did you ever think of me?
I'm not complaining

I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel
This vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach
Your eden
I never tried to feel
I never tried to...
Your eden
