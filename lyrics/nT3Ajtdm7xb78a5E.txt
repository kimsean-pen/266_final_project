Dear Daughter
Hold your head up high
There's a world outside
That's passing by
Dear Daughter
Never lose yourself
Remember that
You're like nobody else

Life throws you in
To the unknown
And you feel like you're
Out there all alone

These are words
That every girl should have a chance to hear
There will love
There will be pain
There will be hope
There will be fear
Through it all year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here
For you

Dear Daughter
Don't worry about those stupid girls
If they try to bring you down
It's cause they're scared and insecure
Dear Daughter
Don't change for any man
Even if he promises the stars
And takes you by the hand

Life throws you in
To the unknown
And you feel like you're
Out there all alone

These are words
That every girl should have a chance to hear
There will love
There will be pain
There will be hope
There will be fear
Through it all year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here
For you

Dear daughter
I was just like you
And just like me
You're gonna make it through

These are words
That every girl should have a chance to hear
There will love
There will be pain
There will be hope
There will be fear
Through it all year after year
Stand or fall, I will be right here
And after all, I will be right here
For you
