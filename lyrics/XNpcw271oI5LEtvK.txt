A lifeless struggle now
In time doesn't matter what is done
No way to winâ€”slaves at best
Manufactured to serve
Pictures of this perfect world
Programmed which way to look
All talk yet no recourse

Stare into lights
Dull senses don't ignite
Time to look that way now

Take me from this place
No need to pretend
This life that we lead
Careful balance to the end

Always wanting more
Not a minute to waste
No challenge too wide
Forever chase that bait

Stare into lights
Dull senses don't ignite
Time to look that way now

Take me from this place
No need to pretend
This life that we lead
Careful balance to the end
In time all will be clear
The fools teaching the wise
The young inherit the earth
And balance all the lies

Stare into lights
Dull senses don't ignite
Time to look that way now
