I'm scared of dying
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar? Ooh
(I can't be quiet)
I'm scared of dying
No gun required, ooh
My skin is fire, so desired

Is that designer? Is that on fire?
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?
I'm scared of dying, it's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief! And say something

Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so, we know
Being young in the city
Belief! And say something

Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so, we know

Council, being listed
Man, I kinda miss it, hey!

I'm a designer, unite pariahs
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
Kids don't want rifles, they want Supreme
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?
We're scared of dying, it's fine
What's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief! And say something

Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so, we know
Being young in the city
Belief! And say something

Gone off designer, it's all on fire
And we're all liars
So won't you help me lie down
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, won't you help me lay down?

I'm scared of dying, it's fine!
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief! And say something
And saying something
And saying something
