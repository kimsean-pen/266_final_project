Some people get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit
Scaring the pedestrians for a minute
Crossing up progress driving on the grass
Leaving just enough room to pass
Sunday driver never took a test
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the West

Yes and it's no use saying that you don't know nothing
It's still gonna get you if you don't do something
Sitting on a fence that's a dangerous course
Ah, you could even catch a bullet from the peace-keeping force
Even the hero gets a bullet in the chest
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the West

Mother Mary your children are slaughtered
Some of you mothers ought to lock up your daughters
Who's protecting the innocenti?
Now heap big trouble in the land of plenty
Tell me how we're gonna do what's best
You guess, once upon a time in the West

Oh yeah, once upon a time in the West
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the West
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the West

Once upon a time in the West
Once upon a time in the West
Once upon a time in the West
