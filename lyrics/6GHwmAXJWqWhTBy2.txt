With it all before you how could it ever go wrong
When water mirrors for you and all that you look on
Just a glimmer from the way beyond
But you're lost today

In each and every tide things are lost
Things we must not lose sight of
No matter if you're tired
Why suppose oracles can let you know

With it all before you
How could it ever go wrong
When water mirrors for you and all that you look on
Just a glimmer from the way beyond
But you're lost today

Between you weigh the cost against damage of
And shore it up against the flood
She's the whitest of your wave through it all

But you're lost today

With it all here for you
How could it ever go wrong
Couldn't bear to carry couldn't lay upon
Saw a glimmer from the way beyond where we
Helped today
