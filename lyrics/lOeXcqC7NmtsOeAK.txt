Life is sweet in the belly of the beast
In the belly of the beast
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down
It can never bring you down
Lost in a maze of a thousand rainy days
Of a thousand rainy days
But when I heard her voice
Oh it lead me to the end
Yes it lead me to the end

Cause when she sings, I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echos through me
I'm renewed,
Oh how I feel alive
And through autumn's advancing
We'll stay young go dancing

As the music plays
Feel our bodies sway
When we move as one
We stay young

Life is sweet in the belly of the beast
In the belly of the beast
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down

Cause when she sings, I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echos through me
I'm renewed,
Oh how I feel alive
And through winter's advancing
We'll stay young go dancing
Stay young go dancing
Stay young go dancing
