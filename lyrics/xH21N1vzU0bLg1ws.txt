Don't go sendin' me those three dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do
Don't go tryin' to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm makin' money too

(Uh)
Don't go throwin' those stones outside my window
(Uh)
You don't gotta be callin' three times a day
(Uh)
'Cause if you do then when we get together
I'll be bitin' my lip 'cause there's nothin' else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes the heart grow fonder, aah
(Uh)
(Grow fonder)
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight, oh
(Uh)
I'm tellin' you straight baby, just in case you wonder
(Uh)
It's turnin' me off, crowdin' me out it's not right

Less is more
(More)
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe
(Aah, breathe)
Cause you too much of a good thing can be
(Aah, be)
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
(More)
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
(Aah, out)
If you want me to still be around
(Aah)
Remember

If you wanna be showin' your affection
(Uh)
(Uh hu)
Don't you know a simple kiss will do
(Uh)
(Just won't do)
So many beautiful ways for love's expression, yea
(Uh)
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't gettin' through
(Through)

Haven't you heard a little space makes the heart grow fonder, aah
(Uh)
(Grow fonder)
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight, oh
(Uh)
I'm tellin' you straight baby, just in case you wonder
(Uh)
It's turnin' me off, crowdin' me out it's not right

Less is more
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe
(Aah, breathe)
'Cause you too much of a good thing can be
(Aah, be)
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
(Aah, out)
If you want me to still be around
(Aah)
Remember, yea

It would be somethin' if I had a chance to be missin' you
(Uh)
(Missin' you)
Too much for takin' it's drivin' me crazy
(Uh)
That's all you do
(Uh, uh)
It needs rearrangin', it's so suffocatin'
(Uh)
That I can't move
You gotta take two steps back
Believe what they say
It's true
(Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea)

Less is more
(More)
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe
(Aah, breathe)
(Let it breathe)
'Cause you too much of a good thing can be
(Too much of a good thing)
(Aah, be)
Bad
Be so bad
(Too right less is more)
Less is more
(More)
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
(Aah, out)
If you want me to still be around
(Aah)
Remember
(Remember)

(More)
Gimme a chance to miss you
Boy I don't mean to dish you, but
(I need)
I tell you I need some space
And still you call me up three times a day
You know, baby you crowdin' me out
(Crowdin' out)
Haven't you heard less is more, oh
(Less is more)
(Less is, less is)

Less is more, ah
Listen me boy
Less is more
(Auh, auh, auh, auh)
Less is more
