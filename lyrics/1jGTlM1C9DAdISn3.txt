No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
So it seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy

No one wants a troubled boy
All they know is trouble boy
And I've learned
No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you're a stronger boy

No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
So it seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
And I've learned
No one wants a troubled boy
All they know is trouble boy
And I've learned
No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you're a stronger boy

No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you're a stronger boy
