Glory, glory, glow, glow

Eye for an eye, ten thousand eyes
Bone for a bone, don't pass me by
Don't you know? Don't you know this?
I got soul but I'm soulless
Tit for tat don't make me mad
Run for your lives, don't follow back
I got hope but it's hopeless
Feed the ropes, cutting my wrists

No sleep for the hungry hearts
No sins when we get this far
Don't do it, do it for the money
Do it, do it for the glory
No love for the wicked ones
Can't stop 'cause it's all or none
Don't do it, do it for the money
Do it, do it for the story

For the glory
For the glory

Babe, you took the blood from the bone
Babe, you put the shade in my soul
How many times I tried to let it go
But I need it (I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it)
All of your stress and your drama
The sickness and sauna
Like [?]
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming

No sleep for the hungry hearts
No sins when we get this far
Don't do it, do it for the money
Do it, do it for the glory
No love for the wicked ones
Can't stop 'cause it's all or none
Don't do it, do it for the money
Do it, do it for the story

For the glory
For the glory
