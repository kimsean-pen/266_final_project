I'm gonna walk to the water's edge
Refuse to be cleansed but struggle in
Your crown don't fit so vacate the throne
And off with your head, I need a shoulder to cry on

I got a heart, I got a reason
To love you all, every single person
It's not at all our conversation,
I'm looking for total dislocation

I always wake to the sound of your voice
And I am floating on an ominous cloud
This dark land looming over the hill
Maintain a holy stance and protect your children

I got a heart, I got a reason
To love you all, every single person
It's not at all our conversation,
I'm looking for total dislocation

I got a tree, it's time to cut it
To its knees, don't wanna rush it
We got to please, we have to glisten
As I remain in splendid isolation

I got a heart, I got a reason
To love you all, every single person
It's not at all our conversation,
I'm looking for total dislocation

I got a tree, it's time to cut it
To its knees, don't wanna rush it
We got to please, we have to glisten
As I remain in splendid isolation

Hey, you can be lost at the same time as being found
