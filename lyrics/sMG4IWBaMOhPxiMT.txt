Written and Composed by _____________________.
We've been together for such a long time now music
Music and me
Don't care whether all our songs rhyme now music

Music and me
I know where ever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers like music

Music and me
Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find

A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather
Will fly together
Now with music, music and me
Music and me
