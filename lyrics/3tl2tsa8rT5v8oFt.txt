But what it is was always meant
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

Who knows where this all will go?
I've got my fears for sure
I'm giving you all I got
I'm giving you a home in my heart
Ooh

Because I'm crazy over you

Sometimes, I may be crazy
But I'm still your baby
No, I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm gonna be right here
Sometimes, I be crazy
But you're still my baby
No, I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm gonna be right here

Over you
I'm crazy over you
I'm
