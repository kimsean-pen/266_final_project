I belong to no one like the watermelon
Rolling with momentum
Spitting out its seeds
Buried under snow and waiting just to show us
How it grows and knows how yummy it will be
I belong to no one, a song without an album
Long forgotten maxim spoken to the sea
I belong with no one, I belong with no one
I belong with no one, you belong with me
When I was a boy I wished that I was older
Wished that I was taller, tall enough to see
See the things I see today, now I wish they d go away
Out and let me far astray, astray from what I need
Needle in the hay, lost but in my place
Peaceful in my way, hope I never have to sow again
Tumble, tumble down as I take the ground
Make a mighty sound, know what I am, know when I found a way
A way, a way, a way to always belong
Belong, belong, wont be long until I am gone

Belong, belong, wont be long until I am gone
I am just a no one, I m the same as everyone
Spinning underneath the sun, head between my knees
I belong to no one, I am a minimum
Rolling into bigger sums adding them to me
Needle in the hay, lost but in my place
Peaceful in my way, hope I never have to sow again
Tumble, tumble down as I take the ground
Make a mighty sound, know what I am, know when I found a way
A way, a way, a way to always belong
Belong, belong, wont be long until I am gone
A way, a way, a way to always belong
Belong, belong, wont be long until I am gone
A way, belong
A way, belong
