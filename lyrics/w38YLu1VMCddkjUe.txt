Oh, let's go!

Been a long time coming for a while now
Love or hate it, but I'm trapped in your mind now
No patience for reputation
If you say it, you better mean
No exceptions taken, yeah
They can tell us turn down
Never been louder
They can try and shut us out
But we shine brighter
Just a bit different, so resilient
Win or lose just admit that you're feeling it

Why you do it like that?
Vibe it like that?
When the lights come on do you notice I'm mad?
Should I do it right back?
Do it right back, right back?

Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(and its keeping you up all night)
Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(And it's keeping you up all night)

What now?
Say it out loud
You think you know it all
(People often say)
Let it all out
Tell me what, tell me when, tell me how now
You thought you had us figured out
Maybe not now
But regardless, let's be honest
You can talk the talk while we walk it

Why you do it like that?
Vibe it like that?
When the lights come on do you notice I'm mad?
Should I do it right back?
Do it right back?
Should I do it?
Should I do it?
Right back

Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(and its keeping you up all night)
Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(And it's keeping you up all night)

They can tell us turn down
Never been louder
They can try to shut us out
But we shine brighter
Just a bit different, so resilient
Win or lose just admit that you're feeling it
HA! YEAH! HA!
And let me hear you say
S-H-DOUBLE O-K!
One more time
S-H-DOUBLE O-K!
Yeah! Hahaha!

Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(and its keeping you up all night)
Yeah, you know we got you shook
(We got you shook)
Yeah you know we got you shook
(And it's keeping you up all night)
