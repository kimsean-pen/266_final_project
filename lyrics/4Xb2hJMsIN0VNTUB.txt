I don't regret the times I spent spilling problems down my neck
Blood of christ gone straight to my head
Like-minded negative influence
You've probably heard it all before but I'll say it again

I'll put my trust in poison
The smoke signals, it's time for change
The smoke signals, will you rescue me

We're all fathers to a grave, we'll kill ourselves in our own way
And mothers to a faith that let's us learn from our mistakes
We'll always just remain the serving saviours of decay,
Turning up our noses to spite our face

Still I'm no better off than I was
Still at the bottom no matter how high
We are still at the bottom no matter how high
The smoke signals, as I lay below

The smoke signals, tearing at my throat and I'm spitting blood
Won't rest compulsive, dependant on delusion
I'm getting tired of the same excuses
I set myself to self destruct because the truth hurts too much

I'll sleep in recovery
My heart beats same
Facing the devils smile
Still I'm no better off than I was

Still at the bottom no matter how high
A heart full of love that I lost
A hand full of hope that'll get me by
All our needs will fade, we'll sleep in recovery

Suffer to save
This is my request for forgiveness
My blood has spilled
I confessed to my demons and they don't regret a fucking thing.
