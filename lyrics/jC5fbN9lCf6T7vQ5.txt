Will the dust ever settle on us
The flames hiding in the smoke
Will there ever be enough
Will the flames choke
Will our skins ever be dry
From the blood of the stillborn
Will the rain wash out my eyes
And drip from my thumbs
As it falls all around
You see it hit the ground
I say to you,
"Let it come"
(Let it come down)

The acorn loses its grip
Away, farewell from the branch
Past the trunk it slips
And descends into chance
Your tree is near the riverbed
Where the black water sleeps
Oh it's sinking into the ground
Unto the water seat
And as it falls all around
You see it hit the ground
I say to you,
"Let it come"

(Let it come down)

The nails, they're broken
Chips, they're down
The times they have chosen
Your time has come
As it falls all around
You see it hit the ground
I say to you,
"Let it come"
(Let it come down) x3
