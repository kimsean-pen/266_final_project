Time is torment and my flesh is cold
I walk the path of undead damnation
I hunger for the true kiss of the scythe
Dead flesh walking

Bloodless
Lifelessly deprived and forgotten
Deadness
A holocaust soul

The black moon witnessed a soul entombment
Lifeless, faded and forever damned
My flesh still seeked the tombworld
But the path of damnation seemed endless

Bloodless
Lifelessly deprived and forgotten
Deadness
A holocaust soul

In the darkest chamber of my soul
The poisoned fire my only light
A dark embrace and madness prevail
The final filthy katharsis
