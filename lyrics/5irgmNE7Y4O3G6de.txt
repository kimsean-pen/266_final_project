I thought that I knew about 'em
Thought that they would never do me wrong
Well well they smile in your face
When all the time they wanna take your place
Them backstabbers

Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come well
Don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space

That's when I decide to say
Goodbye goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice

Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people

A case of the fake people
I thought that I knew about 'em
The only ones that really care for me oh yea
No but they shouldn't be that way
Only down for as long as

You can give security
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come well
Don't want you to win that race

'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say
Goodbye goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me

So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down

No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
Goodbye goodbye
To all the fake people in my life (in my life)

I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice

Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
You got a case of the fake people

Case of the fake people yea
Got a case of the fake people (case of the fake people)
Goodbye goodbye
To all the fake people in my life

I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life

'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
Case of the fake people

Goodbye goodbye
Case of the fake people
Goodbye goodbye
To all the fake people in my life.
