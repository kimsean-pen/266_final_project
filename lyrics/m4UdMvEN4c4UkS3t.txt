I got a mind full of aggravation
I can take it if I just relax
I say a prayer for the motivation
Keep me solid so I stay on track
But there's a monkey on my back
And it don't know how to act
Got me climbin' up and down the walls
Now I gotta make a choice
Maybe then I can rejoice
'Cause I'm sick of all the same withdrawals
I got a mind full of inspiration
And I ain't livin' in the past no more
So feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
Pay the price
Gotta roll those dice
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
From a long, black Cadillac (Cadillac)
I hear the sirens of redemption
Screamin' out like never before
And there's a roadblock in every direction
But I ain't stoppin' 'cause I'm in control
And there's a monkey on my back
So I gotta set a trap
'Cause I'm sick of all the same withdrawals
I got a mind full of inspiration
And I ain't livin' in the past no more
So feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
Pay the price
Gotta roll those dice
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
In a long, black Cadillac
I ain't living in the past no more
I ain't living in the past no more
Screaming out like never before
Screaming out like never before
(1 2, 1 2 3 4)
So feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
Pay the price
Gotta roll those dice
And wave bye bye
From a long, black Cadillac
Feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
Feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
Feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
Feast your eyes
On the big, blue sky
Ridin' high in a long, black Cadillac
