All the casualties that I've left behind.
And I, and I hide them in the corners of my mind
All the memories, nothing I could sing.
I've learned so many things, but the bitterness remains.

I'm sick of drying everybody else's tears, with nobody to dry mine.

Don't, don't forsake me.
Why do you break me everytime?
I'm asking you, don't, don't forsake me. Why do you break me? Again and again.
I can't make it alone.

All the judges and all the disarray.
You keep on trying me, but you're only pushing me away.
I don't want you to go, but I can't tell you're here.
You're just another soul that I'm making disappear.

I'm sick of drying everybody else's tears, with nobody to dry mine.

Don't, don't forsake me.
Why do you break me everytime?
I'm asking you, don't, don't forsake me. Why must you break me again and again?
I can't make it alone.

I'm sick of drying everybody else's tears, with nobody to dry mine.

Don't, don't forsake me.
Why do you break me everytime?
I'm asking you, don't, don't forsake me. Why must you break me again and again?
I can't make it alone.

Don't, don't forsake me.
Why do you break me everytime?
I'm asking you, don't, don't forsake me. Why must you break me again and again?
I can't make it alone.
