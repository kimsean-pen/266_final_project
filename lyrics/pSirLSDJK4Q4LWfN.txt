When I was born the seed was sown
I will not obey, my life is my own
Battle those who wish to enslave me
Expose the lies that enrage me
I don't believe in heaven, I don't believe in hell
Never joined the herd, could not adjust well
Slave and master, it's not for me
I chose my own path, set myself free

I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the pÎ¿wers that be
The eagle flies alone

Reject the system that dictates the norm
This world is full of lies and deceit
I have felt betrayal, cut so deep
Suffered defeat only to rise again

I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone

Alone!

I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
I... I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone
