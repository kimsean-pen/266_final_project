Lil TJay
Niggas gon' hate I don' care about it
Niggas gon' hate I don' care about it
Not at all

No one can stop me I feel like the greatest
Dont say be humble I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for bros my imma make it
They want me gone I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught in the 80
No one can stop me I feel like the greatest

Hop in the foreign i'm driftin' all stupid
Niggas be broke like the fuck is you doing
Started off strong but there's room for improvement
I ain't for nothing, move whocky I'm booming
Lovin' for me now it's static with Cuban
Bitches in love with the way that I sing
They ain't want TJ before this whole movement
Now they dick ride because I'm doin' my thing
Stay posted up on the block with the gang
Spin through your hood I ain't tuckin' my chain
Bro got a choppa with a whole lotta range
Shit be consistent ain't nun' gon' change
Now that i'm speaking out honestly
I be flexing but i'm still in poverty

Move my mom out the hood do it properly
Give a fuck if you look at me awkwardly
No Monopoly i'm about property
I don't owe niggas shit but respect
Yea one day i was going through stress
Matter a fact i'm just wasting my breath
And now i'm just gonna talk about all these bands
How I'm so grateful i'm not in the can
How I'm so grateful for all of my fans
How I'm so grateful i am who I am
Balmain the sweater
True on the pants
He did it again

Looking forward to a show in Japan
I think Dexter better lay off the xans
Throwin' water on my chain cause I can
Applyin' pressure now they shakin' my hand
Niggas ain't gettin' no paper I know that's
the reason they hate that's my gun on my waist
Text Guapo get shot in ya face
N' there ain't no room for debate
I know these niggas gon' hate
But my life is still goin' great
Pop out Da vinci and bape
We from the trenches it's easy to hop over fences
The d's tryna build up a case
Stay with a weapon its either a Glock or a
Wesson that bitch shoot you right in your face

No one can stop me I feel like the greatest
Dont say be humble I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for bros my imma make it
They want me gone I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught in the 80
No one can stop me I feel like the greatest

Feel like the greatest I think I'm the goat
Please dont get naked I just want the throat
Outta my burkin' I feel like its workin'
yea bitches be birdies ain't even a joke
Feel like a star when i hop in the wraith,
it don't matter the place I ain't tuckin' my chain
Only my brothers ain't fuckin' with lames
I dont care what you tell me ain't nothin' gon change
Ran up some bands now I'm up like a plane
I was just hungry, ain't nothin' was funny
I do what ya do imma stay in my lane
Hop in the booth and im spittin that cane
I was a yougin that couldn't be tamed

Thinkin shit funny like TJay a stain
And imma get money regardless, can't a nigga be easy I'm heartless
I'm so young with a whole lotta charges
In the booth I be workin my hardest
Dont try to diss me I swear that shit garbage
It won't be long till i walk down the carpet
Got me a ladder i took off the market
Red and green beam i ain't missing my target
Run if you stupid
Run if you stupid

Word to smelly I won't hesi to shoot shit
Told my niggas we gon ball like im hoopin
In the streets I'm a fighter Hadoken
Starting winnin i got tired of losin'
No a body dont know they accusin'
3 lines got me deady im snoozin'
Backed up cause I'm seeing or losin'
Bro told me grind
Bro told me grind

All this fake love I don't pay it no mind
Gotta story and its one of a kind
Independant but i could've got signed
Cooking fire baking soda combined
Do the math I turn 80 no 9
17 and ya boy in his prime
Free bro he got off with a dime
Free verse is you outta ya mind
Only gang do whatever for mine
Running running trynna get me a bag
Running running trying to get to it fast
Niggas talkin like they bitches they chattin
Spin the block then we spinning it back
I was in the field cookin a crack
Running the head i ain't cocking it back
G sides jackin static they smacked
Sb put my hood in a map
Gang gang

No one can stop me I feel like the greatest
Dont say be humble I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for bros my imma make it
They want me gone I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught in the 80
No one can stop me I feel like the greatest
