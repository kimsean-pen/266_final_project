Are you not the slightest bit confused
Just the truth
The speed at which we move blends so well
It's too soon

Separate yourself from what compels you to relinquish us
Push your weight on to me... entirely
Stay away from me, stay away from me... now
Less your gonna see, Less your gonna see me out

No, I can't dance less it's slow or sad
To a song that's far less obvious
If your using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go

Trust me when I say just a few more weeks
Don't move
Resist temptation
Or do you see fit, just choose

Separate yourself from what compels you to relinquish us
Push your weight on to me... entirely

Stay away from me, stay away from me... now
Less your gonna see, Less your gonna see me out

No, I can't dance 'less it's slow or sad
To a song that's far less obvious
If your using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go

No, I can't dance 'less it's slow or sad
To a song that's far less obvious
If your using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go

No, I can't dance 'less it's slow or sad
To a song that's far less obvious
If your using me, do it slowly
Make it last until I have to go

Stay away from, stay away from, stay away from me
Stay away from, stay away from, stay away from me
Stay away from, stay away from me
