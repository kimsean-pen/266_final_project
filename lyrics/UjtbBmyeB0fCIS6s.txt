All these bitches out here tryna be a playmate
But I wanna be Hugh Hefner
I wanna throw bands on these hoes

Fuck on your bitch like I'm Hefner
I take 10 percent like I rep her
No fake in my tits but I'll check hers
Your bitch give me brain like her neck hurt

I could count higher than twenty-one
My bank is just fine, get your money up
Gold in my blunts, it be rolling up
Red on my shoes and we pulling up
You used to dropping panties now you drowninn' in them Xaanies
Got my name all in your mouth, yeah your tweet just gave me clout
I'll drop 5k on a drop of fucking water
More ice on my wrist than tuition for your daughter

Yo, I fucked your bitch
I'm sorry I'm rich and you're not
Tana, Tana, Tana, Tana, Tana, Tana, Tana
Playmate of the month
Cash come in lumps
Keys full of bumps
Mans all on my humps

Fuck on your bitch like I'm Hefner
She say she in love but I left her
She sip on my pussy like nectar
She say he was good but I'm better

Hoppin' in this bitch like a mother fucking bunny
Playin' all these boys like I'm catchin' bears with honey
Sign NDA's, keep 'em quiet
We out here in these streets like a riot
I want Gucci shit so I buy it
Can't catch my flow so don't try it

Tana, Tana, Tana, Tana, aye
Woah, yeah
