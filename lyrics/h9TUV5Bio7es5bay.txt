You are the quiet one;
You don't have to say very much to get what you want.
You're small but I am much smaller than you could have recalled.
And we don't want to go when you come back in the fall.

I am like a child and you're like a mother
And you've got a house and you live with another
But he won't want to stay when you tell him where you've gone.

I am the shy one;
I don't have to say very much to get what I want.
But it does nothing if you tell everyone.

I am like a child and you're like a brother
And we'll have a house and you live with another
But he won't want to stay when you tell him what you want.

You're small and you're much smaller than they could have recalled.
And we don't want to go 'till everyone is gone.

Oh, oh oh oh. Oh, oh oh oh.
Oh, oh oh oh. Oh, oh oh oh.
La, oh, oh.
La la la la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la la la.
La la la la. La la la la. La la la la. La la.
