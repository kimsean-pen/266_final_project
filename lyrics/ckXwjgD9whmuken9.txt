I got wind beneath my wings
I think this time I'm gonna make it 'til morning
I got strength within my heart
I'm gonna sing for all the heroes who've fallen

Yeah, I'm gonna take the long, the long way home
Yes, I'm gonna take the world, the world by storm

We got magic in our bones
Just like the stars, we're gonna shine, bright and golden, ooh
We go bang down all the doors
Make sure we take back all the things that were stolen

Yeah, we're gonna take the long, the long way home, yeah
Oh, we're gonna take the world, the world by storm

See, with the heart of a sparrow
Oh, tell me what arrow could ever bring you down, mmm, yeah
Oh, the escape, it was narrow
But what a gift, the, the courage you found, mmm
See, with the heart of a sparrow
Oh, tell me what arrow could ever bring you down
Oh, the escape, it was narrow
But, but what a gift, of courage you found, yeah

I got stars within my soul
I think the dust the end is gonna finally settle, but hurry
Pure as rivers, strong as mountains
We spread love like the flowers give petals

Oh, we're gonna take the long, the long way home
Oh, we're gonna take the world, the world by storm, yeah
We're gonna take, take the long way home, that's right
Then we're gonna take the world, the world by storm

Yes, we're gonna take the whole wide world by storm
