You ran out looking for a fight
You left your head because sometimes
You know what's gonna happen next
You don't want nobody pushing back

Now I'm all torn up about it
'Cause I know you can't help yourself
I know that he was breathing it
I've seen it in myself
I've tasted that devil's water
Outta home but didn't bother
Calling what it is
This is calling what it is

Oh I was living and you weren't listening
It didn't matter cause you were leaving
You were all ready to go (you weren't listening)
You were all ready to go (cause you were leaving)
You were all ready to go
Already gone

Yeah I remember last I saw you
In the hallway tangled up in blue
I was living and you weren't listening (you weren't listening)
But that didn't matter 'cause you were leaving

Yeah there's moments that I miss you
(Yeah it happens all the time)
And at the moment that I miss you
(I just can't remember why)

Oh I was living and you weren't listening
It didn't matter cause you were leaving
You were all ready to go (you weren't listening)
You were all ready to go (you were leaving)
You were all ready to go
Already gone

Yeah there's moments that I miss you
(Yeah it happens all the time)
And at the moment that I miss you
(I just can't remember why)

You were all ready to go
You were all ready to go
Ready to go

Now I'm all torn up about it
'Cause I know you can't help yourself
I know that he was breathing it
I've seen it in myself
All ready to go
All ready to go
All ready to go
All ready to go

Yeah there's moments that I miss you
(Yeah it happens all the time)
And at the moment that I miss you
(I just can't remember why)

You were all ready to go
You were all ready to go
You were all ready to go
Already gone
