You become a word for it
You are accepting
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
Commit to the work of both
If you love first energy
Not chemistry
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come home to me

It's frightening
Exciting
Something shakes up my whole understanding
The truth is not perfect
But it fools and confused to say
I'm not angry
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come to peace
I remember my secret
I'll write it down but never tell it
It's not harm free
Outside of myself
What has saved me?

C-c-c-c-can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You c-c-c-c-c-c-can work through the p-p-p-p-pain
And come home to me
You can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
