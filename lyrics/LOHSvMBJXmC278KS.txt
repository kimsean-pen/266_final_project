I just felt a wave, an emotion,
and right then I knew that everything had changed.
A whole side of you that went missin's
gone and all I'd thought of you is wrong.
Gotta step away, for perspective.
Need to take a chance to clear my head.
Don't wanna understand your position,
oughta wash my hands of you and run.

Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you.
Held trapped by what we were.

No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.
No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.

Spent time today reminiscing
think I learned a lot about who we are.
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind.

Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you.
And the truth remains unheard.

No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.
No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.

Some roads you can't come back from, when you extract truth from the lie.

No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.
No, I'll never feel the same.
Same about you.
Same about you.
