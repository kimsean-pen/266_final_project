Lost in thought
Yeah, you're stuck on repeat
Get out of your head
And get back on your feet

Now, you say
You don't know where to start
Swallowing each day
With an ache in your heart

So let's put our torches out
Run into the dark and we'll
Raise our arms and shout:
This is how we face the night!

Turn the page
Let your words overflow
All of this will change
Can you learn to let go?

Now, you say
This is not what you planned
But so much more gets lost
Tryin' to keep what you have

Though at times it feels absurd
This is what it takes to see what your fighting for

So let's put our torches out
Run into the dark and we'll
Raise our arms and shout:
This is how we face the night!

Oh there's such a lot to see
We'll wander, you and me
Yet sometimes it's hard to leave
But this is how we face the night
