Looking out, looking in
Going where
Never been running round
Hiding in stairs

Unafraid felt the grain
Open doorways full of shame
My own life
I resented

Winter sigh summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow

Brushing out, brushing in
Losing out, losing thee
Didn't take my heart

Didn't fold, chase the tear
Never let go, now I'm there
It's over, it's over

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow

So I don't want anymore

solo

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I don't want anymore
