Downtown Vancouver
Digging through your bag
Ripping out the pages
Of the local music mag

You missed the show last summer
But now you've got your chance
They're playing at The Railway
With another emo band

I'm ambitious when giving up
Never thinking clear enough

But we're not Elvis anymore
We're not Frankie in his wild years
We're not Tina's glorious comeback
We're not us, we're not us

Sold my soul to the devil
For nice penmanship
And now I write real pretty
But I'm starting to regret it

If all of this was easy
It wouldn't matter how it ends

I'm ambitious when giving up
Never thinking clear enough

But we're not Elvis anymore
We're not Frankie in his wild years
We're not Tina's glorious comeback
We're not us, we're not us

We're not us, anymore
We're not us
We're not us, anymore
W'ere not us

We're not us
