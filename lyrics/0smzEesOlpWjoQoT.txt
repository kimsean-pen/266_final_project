O-oh how come,
a knock on the door
and it's devastating news
An astronaut
still young to the core has heard
his dream being achieved
but he said

I know that I'm not the same
though the similarities
I'm gonna go, make my way
they got the Moon but I'll conquer Mars

As time flew by,
big disks in the sky appeared,
glowing near the clouds
One night near dawn
the boy saw one of them
take off from the ground
so he said

I know that I'm not the same
though the similarities
I'm gonna go, make my way
they got the Moon but I'll conquer Mars

"Headline Edition, July 8th, 1947.
A flying disk has been found and is now in Roswell, New Mexico"

Space in your mind,
feel the tides,
magnet waves,
paradise
crawls right by
for some light,
we must fight
for some light

I know that I'm not the same
though the similarities
I'm gonna go, make my way
they got the Moon but I'll conquer

No matter where
Mars may be
I can feel what is right for me
there are more ways than we think
and to trust our way is what sets us free
