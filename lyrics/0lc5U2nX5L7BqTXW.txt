I never really felt that I
would ever fit inside your circle
every time I try and try
I never really best in

calling, calling it all
fighting and fighting
tire, tire, felt it all
I want to

go back to another life
a life that's never been fractured
and safe from the open lies
a life that's not been fractured

travel on your way
the words don't mention place
go back to another life
a life that's fully been fractured

they never really let me in
and whip before the chest to show it
I took a chance and I dug deep
searching for the truth for a purpose"
