We've only just begun
But I think you're the one
Breathing life in me
So much more the eye can see
Passing through my veins
Is the love i have for you
Take it if you please
My heart beating for you

We've only just begun
But I think you're the one
Breathing life in me
So much more the eye can see
Passing through my veins
Is the love i have for you
Take it if you please
My heart beating for you
