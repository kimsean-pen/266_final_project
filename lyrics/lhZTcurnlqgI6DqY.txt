Got out of bed this morning, I didnt sleep at all
Today I'm makin history I'm pickin' up my call,
I'm going into space, man, don't know when I'm comming down
But I'll send you all a message when I'm passing my ole town.
So tell me, why is it, we're never happy?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars.
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got.
Everybody wants to be an astronaut.

I can feel my body shiver, the lights are everywhere,
They marvel at my heartbeats inside the atmosphere.
And I'm looking at the world, in a way you never could
I knew I'd be a traveling man, but I misunderstood.
So tell me, why is it, we're never happy?

Cause everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars.
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got.
Everybody wants to be an astronaut.

Don't you tell me that I never
I will show you what Im made of
Ready for the EVA come on, let's go outside and play
What you say?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars.
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got.
Everybody wants to be.
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Everybody wants to be an superstar
Rock the world and make the cover at The Times
Cause everybody 's happy when theyre playing the guitar.
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be an astronaut.
