Once we were young, we had no plans
What simplicity of love
We used to get it, to get it all
We weren't scared to fail and fall

Now all I can do is to stand
And watch those new boys in the game
How they're laughing and having fun
Making rules under the sun

I won't win her pretty eyes tonight
It's been so long since I played it right
I'll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before she'll even notice I'm around

They used to call me the city queen,
But now God's playing his jokes on me
I'm all alone, far from the city
I've got no room, no time for dreams

I won't win her pretty eyes tonight
It's been so long since I played it right
I'll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before she'll even notice I'm around

Once we were young, we had no plans
What simplicity of love
We used to get it, to get it all
We had no time to fail and fall
