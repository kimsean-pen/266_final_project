It doesn't take much to see what you face inside when the fire is leaving
It doesn't take long to me when your heart grows cold
It's never too hard to be when your faith inside it's left to screaming
With everything push the side no heart no soul
Take my hand or let go

I'm left no choice we live in a black hole
So let's go destroy the obvious
I'm left no voice I live in your echo
So let's go destroy the obvious

It's a god you can live beneath
It's a place in time where fall time meaning
With everything beautiful turn sharp, grows cold
You're the fake, you're the powerful
You're the tear, you're the hate
You're the lie you're feeding
A life you can justify
Where the dark won't show

Take my hand or let go

I'm left no choice we live in a black hole
So let's go destroy the obvious
I'm left no voice I live in your echo
So let's go destroy the obvious

I know you're holding on to me
Your words won't let me go
I think you're gonna find that
When you find your hate defines you
When defeat has left you blind, then you'll know

I know you're holding on to me
I feel the fire in control of everything
I know you're holding on to me
I feel the fire in control everything

I'm left no choice we live in a black hole
So let's go destroy the obvious
I'm left no voice I live in your echo
So let's go destroy the obvious
