I let go my words to make room for your temper traps
the air dances to the furthest melody as we live only
through our transparent skin
We travel far to try to understand but no one will
ever break this
no one will ever break in our promised land

I let go my voice
its fragility will only make me strong
your heart dances at a speed Ill never know,
your heart dances leaving mine out of control

We travel far
to try to understand
but no one will ever break this
no one will ever break in our promised land

We travel far
to try to understand
but no one will ever break this
no one will ever break in our promised land
