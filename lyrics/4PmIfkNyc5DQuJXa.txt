I hope you'll understand
That I can't always come
When you call
Understand, everybody
Has their faults

Please understand, not to worry
Who I'm with or what I do
'Cause I understand
That I'm in love with you
Do you understand
That I'm in love with you?

I keep our song
On repeat
On my i-pod
Even when I sleep
And in my dream
I'm holdin' you
Alone on an island
Just us two

I hope you'll understand
That I can't always come
When you call
Understand, everybody
Has their faults

Please understand, not to worry
Who I'm with or what I do
'Cause I understand
I'm in love with you
Do you understand
I'm in love with you?

The last guy
Had me so wrong
He kept complainin'
I was away too long
Don't treat me that way
'Cause in your head
You've got to trust me
I won't be led

I hope you'll understand
That I can't always come
When you call
Understand, everybody
Has their faults

Please understand, not to worry
Who I'm with or what I do
'Cause I understand
That I'm in love with you
Do you understand
That I'm in love with you?

I hope your mind
Ain't workin' overtime
I hope your memories
Full of good times with me
Don't trip if right now
I can't answer the phone
'Cause you know that
Soon I'll be comin' home

Hope you'll understand
That I can't always come
When you call
Understand everybody
Has their faults

Please understand not to worry
Who I'm with or what I do
'Cause I understand
That I'm in love with you
Do you understand
I'm in love with you?

Do you understand?
'Cause I understand
Do you understand?
(Understand)
That I'm in love with you boy
(Do you understand?)
I'm so in love with you
So in love with you
'Cause I understand
Do you?
(Do you understand?)
Do you understand?
(Do you understand?)
That I'm in love with you?
(Do you understand?)
Do you understand?
(Do you understand?)
I'm in love with you
