Comeone and now be faithful,
I got something to share!
Guaranteed to make your lumber dissapear.
I gotta a reason,
to the season.
Got the U tied into You.
Comeone Mary,
lets get merry.
Change your attitude!
No, this ain't your momma,
it's Christmas Carol.
So comeone, comeone and go,
get up, Carol!
Rejoice, it's a Holiday
when you're near baby!
All boys,
will be loud and proud,
and saying: Gimme!
These words got you
rumpumpum and feeling cheery!
Have yourself a Merry Christmas, Mary.
Rejoice!
It's a holiday, when you're near baby.
All boys,
will be loud and proud,
and saying: Gimme!
These words got you
rumpumpum and feeling cheery!
Have yourself a Merry Christmas, Mary.
Decked the halls in balls
and Hollywood decor.
New Year in the window,
old one out the door.
We can make our own traditions,
we can choose our family.
Cause a party, ain't a party,
if you ain't here with me!
No, this ain't your momma,
it's Christmas Carol.
So comeone, comeone and go,
get up, Carol!
Rejoice, it's a Holiday
when you're near baby!
All boys,
will be loud and proud,
and saying: Gimme!
These words got you
rumpumpum and feeling cheery.
Have yourself a Merry Christmas, Mary.
Rejoice!
All boys.

Lets all get,
Merry, Merry, Merry
Lets all get,
Merry, Merry, Merry
Lets all get,
Merry, Merry, Merry
Let's get Merry, Mary.
Rejoice!
It's a holiday, when you're near baby.
