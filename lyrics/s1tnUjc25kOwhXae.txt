for the same thing.
Do we come together to love
or do we come together in order to break apart?
Again it's come to greet me,
this happen ending.

Rich

She, who wanted to fly like a bird, bought a plane ticket.
He, who wanted the skies and the seas in the palm of
his hands, bought a large globe.
Everyone hangs a price tag on their dreams,
but no matter how much you spend,

your hearts are empty shopping carts.
You'll max your credit cards to buy what you want,
but won't max your dreams to live how you want to.

Looking for answers where your pocket is.
Baby, you don't even know what the problem is.
Your bucket list is a shopping list.
But the life you miss leaves you with no memories.
But you've got plenty of pictures.
Better hungry than distasteful.
But your tastes are only trends.
Easy come and just as easily gone.
I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
Baby I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
My Drive Rules Everything Around Me.
Dream.
A friend of mine buys, sells,
and appraises her dreams and ideals.
Her account balance is off but her pride,
or so-called buydentity, is unshakeable.

No stamps in her passport
but her fashion treads New York and Paris.
Life is a photo shoot.
Every hood, campus, office, wherever.

Young boys on a rush for their golden ladies.
Yeah, I'm envious.
All I can be is envious.
I'm the loser.
I'm the loser.
I only dream on weekends,
lottery ticket gripped in hand every Saturday.

It's Friday night, but I'm standing

in line with my lucky numbers.

When I was young, my dreams were a factory,
but now they are a dime-a-dozen convenience store.

I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
Wanna live without worries.
Baby I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
Wanna live like a human being.
As much as you earn,
as much as you burn,

is you happy?
As much as you earn,
as much as you burn,
are you happy?
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
I wish. I wish I was rich.
Baby I wish. I wish I was rich.
Put your gold up in the air.
Put your diamonds in the air.
And wave 'em like you just don't
care.

'Cause baby, I wish I was.
I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
Baby I wish. I wish. I wish. I was rich.
My Drive Rules Everything Around Me.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
Rich, rich, rich. Yeah.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
Rich.
I'd like to be rich in heart,
but my heart is just as empty as my wallet.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
Rich, rich, rich. Yeah.
'Cause baby, I wish I was.
'Cause baby, I wish I was
