Where was God when I needed a friend?
And where was God when I came to an end?
Where was God when I lost my mind?
Where was God when I can find?

I don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down

Where was love when I felt like hate?
Where was hate when I felt like love?
Where were you when you said you'd be there?
Where was the fear when I said I was scared?

I don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down

Tell me what you believe
(Tell me what you believe)
I'll tell you what you should see
(I'll tell you what you should see)
'Cause I don't know who to trust
(Tell me what you believe)
My heart is filled with disgust

I can't take this!

Tell me what you believe
(Tell me what you believe)
I'll tell you what you should see
(I'll tell you what you should see)
'Cause I don't know who to trust
(Tell me what you believe)
My heart is filled with disgust
(I'll tell you what you should see)

Tell me what you believe
(Tell me what you believe)
Tell me what you believe
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention
Are you ready for the joke
Are you ready for the great deception
Tell me what you believe (God) 6x
