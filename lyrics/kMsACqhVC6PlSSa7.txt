The time has come to realize,
What you are, what you've done inside.
The time has come,
All have something to talk about, I will too.

Looking back,
And now I realize,
How much you really liked him,

This child's mind you terrorized.
You came to him,
He really didn't know your lies.
Now his innocence's gone,

He's that child you terrorized.

This fucking thing that I feel,
It came to me from you.

This fucking thing that I,
Because of you.
My childhood is gone,
Because I loved you.

My childhood is gone,

Because I loved you.
Be my neighbor!

Looking back,

And now I realize,
How much you really loved him,
This child's mind you've hypnotized.
You came to him,

He really didn't know your lies.
Now his innocence's gone,
I'm that child you terrorized.

This fucking thing that I feel,
It came to me from you.
This fucking thing that I feel,

Because of you.
My childhood is gone,
Because I loved you.
My childhood is gone,
Because I loved you.

Be my neighbor!
Be my neighbor!
My neighbor.

Fred told me everybody was my neighbor,

They took advantage of me,
You let them take their turns hitting me.
I wish I would have never watched you,
You really made my childhood a failure,
What a fucking neighbor.
