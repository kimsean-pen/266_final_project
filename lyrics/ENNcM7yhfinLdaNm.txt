Never used to wanna get out of bed
But this morning, this morning
I woke up with an idea in my head
And I'm soaring, yeah, I'm soaring

Everybody before
Pinned my wings to the floor
And they walked away
But baby now that I'm yours
I know I'm worth so much more
And I gotta say

That I got a new perspective
All 'cause you respect this
Finally liking what I see
Got me thinking all my exes
They can leave a message
I got everything I need
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you
No one's ever loved me the way you do
Giving me a new perspective
Seeing my reflection
From a better point of view
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

Something about the way
You looked at me on that first day
It felt different, felt different
And I can tell by the words that you say
That you get it, yeah, you get it

Everybody before
Pinned my wings to the floor
And they walked away
But baby now that I'm yours
I know I'm worth so much more
And I gotta say

That I got a new perspective
All 'cause you respect this
Finally liking what I see
Got me thinking all my exes
They can leave a message
I got everything I need
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you
No one's ever loved me the way you do
Giving me a new perspective
Seeing my reflection
From a better point of view
And it's all because of you
(And it's all because of you)
Yeah, it's all because of you

When I look at you (Look at you)
I feel like the whole world just got a little lighter
(A little lighter)
When I look at me through your eyes
I realize that maybe I'm a fighter
When I look at you
I feel like the whole world just got a little lighter
When I look at me (Look at me)
Through your eyes (Through your eyes)
I realize that maybe I'm a fighter, oh-uh-uh-uhh
And maybe I'm worth fighting for

'Cause now I got a new perspective
All 'cause you respect this
Finally liking what I see
Got me thinking all my exes
They can leave a message
I got everything I need
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you
No one's ever loved me the way you do
Giving me a new perspective
Seeing my reflection
From a better point of view
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all (It's all) because of you
And it's all (It's all) because of you, you
And I got a new perspective, yeah
