Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love

But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
Caught around the houses with your trousers down
A head rush in the bush
You know I cherish you my love
Oh how I cherish you my love

Tell me what can you want
Now you've got it all I've seen is obscene
Time will strip it away, a year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

Yes it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
And it's all
It's all in my hands
It's all up the walls

The stale chips are up and the hopes stakes are down
Its these ignorant faces that bring this town down
Yeah I sighed and sunken with pride
You know passed myself down on my knees
Yes I passed myself down on my knees

Now tell me what can you want
When you've got it all I've seen is obscene
Time will strip it away, a year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

There are fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
And we'll die in the class we were born
That's a class of our own my love
A class of our own my love
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
And I cherish you my love.
