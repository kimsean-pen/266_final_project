Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what I'm saying
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night, oh

Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh

Keep dancin' hard, give this groove more feeling
Dance, dance, dance more feeling
In out up down all around
On the dance floor gettin' down

Take time just to show them who
We can make your body move
Totally, yes the party's started
Sweet dreams keep comin' harder

Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night

When your body is movin' the music is groovin'
I want to take you home tonight
Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night

Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night, oh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night, oh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh
Ola ola, eh, ola ola, eh
