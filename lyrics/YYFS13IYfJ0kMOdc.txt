Music can be such a revelation
Pass around and do the sweet sensation
We might be lover if we tried
I hope this feeling doesn't end tonight

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove your love to me, yah
Get up on your feet and step to beat, boy what will it be
Gotta know you in a special way
Do it every day
I see the fire burning in your eyes
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free

(by myself)
Wanna dance with some else
Get into the groove, boy you've gotta prove your love to me
Get up on your feet, yeh, step to the beat, boy what will it be, yeh
Live out your fantasies here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body

(now I know you're mine)

Get into the groove, boy you've gotta prove your love to me
Get up on your feet, yeh, step to the beat, boy what will it be, yeh
You've got to.
Get into the groove, boy you've gotta prove your love to me
Get up on your feet, yeh, step to the beat, boy what will it be
You've got to... get...
