I was blind I was lame
I was nothing till you came
You said babe make you sing
Make you feel like some queen
Said I'll take you kathleen
To your home and mine
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

And rolled in like him back
With a halo of deep black
Till my love made me gag
Called him daddy take my hand
Said I'll take you kathleen
To your home and mine
Good lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

I'm hooked
I'm too far
Oh beautiful

I'm bound and I'm lame
Life is nothing with his chain
Daddy wait she can't sing
She can't feel she's no queen
Said I'll take you kathleen
To your home and mine
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line
Said I'll take you kathleen
To your home and mine
Good lord he hooked me
We are untied
