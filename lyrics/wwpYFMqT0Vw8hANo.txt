From where wheat is, from where breezes
Find kids to frustrate
On all horizons, all your life, it looms
Ecstatic night in the city of moons

Metropolis won't slow to welcome you
Swathe yourself in software, see machinations move
Good strut and tie, splinter below the roof
A church collapsing proudly beneath a thousand dunes
Building your life may topple all your dreams
But if his wristwatch finds your cheekbone and his schedule is free
I let the fulcrum buckle under me
Deny my inhibitions and find modernity

From sunrise of worried hooves
And soot mixed with sweat
Seek a moonrise of lighted rooms
And a developing wealth of men

Are you with the city yet? I bet I'm with the city yet
I think I'm with the city yet, are you with the city yet?
Are you with the city yet? I bet I'm with the city yet
(It beckons, it beckons)
Are you with the city yet?
Are you with the city yet? I bet I'm with the city yet
(It beckons, it beckons)
I think I'm with the city yet, are you with the city yet?
(I beckon, I bet)
Are you with the city yet? I bet I'm with the city
(It beckons, it be...)

Metropolis won't slow to welcome you
Swathe yourself in software, see machinations move
Good strut and tie, splinter below the roof
A church collapsing proudly beneath a thousand dunes
Building your life may topple all your dreams
But if his wristwatch finds your cheekbone and his schedule is free
I let the fulcrum buckle under me
Deny my inhibitions and find modernity

Thrust into dissonance and urgency
I always knew this was the life for me
I let the fulcrum buckle underneath
Deny my inhibitions and find modernity
