Mama! mama!
someone said they made some noise
the cops have shot some girls & boys
you'll sit home & drink all night
they looked too weird . . . it served them right
Never take a minute just to show a real emotion
in between the moisture cream & velvet facial lotion?
ever tell your kids you're glad that they can think?
ever say you loved 'em? ever let 'em watch you drink?
ever wonder why your daughter looked so sad? (so sad!)
it's such a drag to have to love
(oh, it's such a drag to have to love)
a plastic mom & dad
Mama! mama!
your child was killed in the park today
shot by the cops as she quietly lay
by the side of the creeps she knew . . .
they killed her too.
Fz: thank you!
mark: there's lots of dance on this, you know, it's k-, kinda like off broadway, way off . . .
