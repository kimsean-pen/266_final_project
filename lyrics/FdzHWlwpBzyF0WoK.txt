Die
Die

Broken mirror
Seven years of stolen luck
I try to fix you one more time
But I must let it die
The dream that we'd survive
Cut my throat if I tell a lie

Set it free, lost ambition
I overthrough my place in our lives
Set it free, superstition
I gave upon this fairytale
Die

Blind man's wisdom
Cross my heart
but it's a lie
I kept us going
the last time
You used one of your nine lives
I gave up all of mine

Cut my throat if I tell a lie
Set it free, lost ambition
I overthrough my place in our lives
Set it free, superstition
I gave upon this fairytale
Die

In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated

Set it free, lost ambition
And now I won't look back
I've turned my back, I'm off the ground
Set it free, superstition
And now the air I'm breathing is poison free
I'm freedom bound
Set it free, lost ambition
I overthrough my place in our lives
Set it free, superstition
I gave upon this fairytale
Die
