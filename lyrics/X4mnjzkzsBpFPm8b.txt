Time, it moves so quickly
When you're near me, or not at all
I'm not thinking clearly
But I know how we should be, I could be wrong

I am waiting
So tell me what you need
'Cause I can't take it
The way this is changing me

Ooh, too good of a feeling
Stay in this memory, however long

I am waiting
So tell me what you need
'Cause I can't take it
The way this is changing me

Whenever you're away, I miss you
I hate when you're away, come back to me
Whenever I'm away, I want you
I hate when you're away, come back to me soon

I am waiting
So tell me what you need
'Cause I can't take it
The way this is changing me
I am waiting
So tell me what you need
'Cause I can't take it
The way this is changing
I am waiting
So tell me what you need
'Cause I can't take it
The way this is changing me
