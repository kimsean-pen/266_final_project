For a thousand days
You've been staring away
Are you phased?
Are you thinking?

Crack a smile and wink
It doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes
I feel like cruising with you too

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze
That I'm under
Come to wake me up
Soon

Take a bow and wave
As you're carried away
It was great
But I'm not leaving

Crack a smile and wave
It still doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes
I feel like cruising with you, too

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze
That I'm under
Come to wake me up

For a thousand days
We could get carried away
Are you in?

I'm anxious and I feel like cruising with you

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze
That I'm under
Come to wake
So I gaze
And I want her
Can you take me on?
