I was wrong, I take it back
Now can we get along? Pick up the slack
You know it all could be much easier
But I'm still traveling, I'm still traveling

And all the while, the people talk
About the unsung shit that they then start
And use to please the crowd, the swarming hordes of fun
That was in in-turned glasses

So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take your guest, I'll check out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time

Take your time, make up your mind
Though it won't change the world, you'll be more inclined
To have a point of view that makes it through
And keeps you traveling, keeps you traveling

So pick your friends, forget the rest
You can't live life being second best
The critics talk of stubbornness
But you're just passionate, you're just passionate

So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take your guest, I'll check out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take your guest, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take your guest, I'll check out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take your guest, I'll check out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
