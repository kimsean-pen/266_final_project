Call my phone, baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone, I've been waitin' to hear your ring tone
Call my phone, baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone, I've been waitin' to hear your ring tone

Lost without my other half
How can I live without you?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about you

Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe?
And everything is off without you
Guess it's all my fault, lady sing the blues

No one could deny it
We were flying like united
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was

Inseparable, if you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought that y'all was inseparable

Thought we'd stay together always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable
Except for us, one of us just got to pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable

Got photos of us on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone, boy, I just cant erase them
The first text I ever got from you still saved in my inbox
And I read it like time after time

Boy, I'm lost, can't you look? Won't you please find me?
I'm down to my last tear, come, rescue me
See it's broken my heart to the point where I don't need it
Has no reason now to beat
'Cause I just ain't the same without you

Boy, I know we're inseparable, if you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought that y'all was inseparable

Thought we'd stay together always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable
Except for us, one of us just got to pick the phone up

It's been sixteen days since I held you tight
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night
Boy, I just wish you show up and make everything alright
So what you waiting for? 'Cause both of us still know that we're

Inseparable, if you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable

Thought we'd stay together always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable
Except for us, one of us just got to pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable

If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought that y'all was inseparable

Thought we'd stay together always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable
Except for us, one of us just got to pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable

If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought that y'all was inseparable
