It's alright
Maybe she loves you in a different way
Just hang on
And wait
Long enough of for her to say
Will you be mine
And call me every single day
Will you be mine
If you feel this way
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
Please talk to me
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
If you feel this way
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
Please talk to me
When he's gone
You'll just be left here on your own
Setting sun
Steals away
But the shadow of it stays with you
You say you'll be fine
But the ocean washes you away
You say you'll be fine
If you feel this way
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
Please talk to me
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
If you feel this way
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
Please talk to me
If you feel this way
If you feel this way
I need but I just can't tell you
Please talk to me
I need you but I just can't tell you
If you feel this way
I need you but I just can't tell you
Please talk to me
I need you but I just can't tell you the truth
Talk to me If you feel this way
Talk to me
Please...
