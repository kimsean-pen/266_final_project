Beauty over wisdom to fit in with their styles
Cinderella stories for a price
Vanity's a business built to fleece the unique
Silicone and stars collide, the rest will fall in line

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have see this coming
All along

Visually you're stimulating to my eyes
Cinderella syndrome, full of lies
Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your ego will, kill what's left inside

Just as beautiful as you are
It's so pitiful what you are
You should have seen this coming
All along

You're everything that's so typical
Maybe you're alone for a reason,
You're the reason

So pitiful is what you are,
You should have seen this coming all along,
Just as beautiful as you are,
It's so pitiful what you are,
You should have seen this coming all along

It's so pitiful what you are,
As beautiful as you are
You should have seen this coming
All along
