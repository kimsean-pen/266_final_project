This can't be right
There's no delight
I know I'm hurting you too
I feel ashamed
When you say my name
Like there's somethin' I can do

I don't need this to feel
Like I've become
Something real
Your beautiful eyes
And your blank stare
I can't make myself care

Holding my breath
Not there quite yet
Dear God, I hope it comes soon
Got too much time
To figure out why
I'm so unhappy with you

I'm sure you don't understand
Who the hell I think I am
Your beautiful eyes
Are sad and scared
But I can't make myself care

Where will I find the answer
To what you're dying to know?
Am I wasting your time?
'Cause I can't cope
Every kiss is perfect
But why does
It feel like goodbye?
I promise you I'll try
One last time

This can't be right
There's no delight
I know I'm hurting you too
