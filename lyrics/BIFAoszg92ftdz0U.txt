When I first saw you, the end was soon
To Bethlehem, it slouched and then
Must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you, the best of you
Honey, belongs to me

Ain't it a gentle sound, the rollin' in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?

Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?

Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin' can get a look in on my baby
Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you, held by you
Fuel the fire of your enemies
Ain't it warmin' you, the world goin' up in flames?
Ain't it the life of you, you're lighting of my blaze?
Ain't it a waste to watch the throwin' of the shade?

Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?

Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin' can get a look in on my baby
Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothing', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin' can get a look in on my baby
Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin' can get a look in on my baby
Nothin' fucks with my baby
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
