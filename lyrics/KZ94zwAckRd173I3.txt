Hello, Sevaqk

Being broke ain't never been on her agenda

Made her join the team, now she a member

My granny said music don't pay
So granny, how'd I go and put an Audi on my chains?
I was doing missions in the rain
And now I'm steady pissing out Henny and champagne
See, music is a money campaign
You'll get smoked for moving funny, I was bummy back day
And now I'm tryna make the tracks pay
No more running through the gutter like my name was Max Payne
Take my girl shopping, streams still popping
That means anything that she's grabbing, you know I'm copping
Sevaqk straight dropping, killed the beat, coffin
Look inside my calendar, bookings just like a boffin
And I'm still putting liquor in my lemonade
Romantic when I'm liquored, I'ma serenade
I ain't cuffing on these yatties, I'm a renegade
I'm picky with the pengers I'm picking now that I'm getting paid

This girl was tryna diss my fashion
This is DSQ and my bits are matching
I can't walk with her on road, but this girl's a bad ting
And her pink gloss lips and my kicks are clashing
I put six on the petrol, I ain't got a car, though
Couple man sent for me, never heard a bar, though
I'm from West London where they ship the cargo
And my Royce on the left like my name was Marco
West 10, baby, tryna get the pounds in
Moncler coat cost a mountain, plus it's got a mountain
All up on the front of the jacket
I know man in tennis chains that will swing round a racket
Beef? Fam, I back it; tool? Man'll pack it
I told man I'm quarterback already, let me sack it
Me, I've got this aura that these other rappers lacking
You're lipsing up a rippers, I'll snap her and blow her back in
