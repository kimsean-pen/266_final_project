One, two, Pikachu
Wanna peek at you
Cause I'm a looky boy
Lookie-loo puppy with a toy
You know you're all good Hollywood
Party like you should
I'll be that quiet boy in the back
Quiet in the back

Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, I'm good to go
Pikachu
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, and I'm good to go
Pikachu

One, two, Pikachu
What you gonna do
I'm gonna hit you up
Type you in
Tap and follow you
Cause you in top ten
One percent
Living like you can
I'm at the window looking in
Window looking in

Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, I'm good to go
Pikachu
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, and I'm good to go
Pikachu

Cause I'm a quiet boy
The quiet don't fit the club
Find me at the window looking in

One, two, Pikachu
Wanna peek at you
I'm on the outside different place
Staring at your face
You know it's all good Hollywood
Party like you should
I'm at the window looking in
Finger licking in

Pikachu

I'm at the bus stop
Pikachu
Outside the club
Pikachu
I'm in the bathroom
Pikachu
In bed at night
Pikachu
Hey

Pikachu

Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, I'm good to go
Pikachu
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, and I'm good to go
Pikachu
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, I'm good to go
Pikachu
Whip it, whip it, whip it out
Tap it, and I'm good to go
