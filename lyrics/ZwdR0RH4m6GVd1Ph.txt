Looking up to the mountain
I can see the top
Though I'm frozen and broken
(I will never stop)
Gonna find the direction
But I don't know when
Heaven knows what I took there

But baby I know
It's so beautiful, sensational
(And it was before)
And there's no looking back
'Cause I'm on track
(?)
No time for sorries, my glories
(Well, I share no worries)
But it's a lonely road

One day at a time
I'm learning how to climb
One day at a time
I'm learning how to climb
I stumble, I survive
One day at a time
One day at a time

___? of the motion
That I nearly drowned
But my heart is an ocean

But baby I know
It's so beautiful, sensational
(And it was before)
And there's no looking back
'Cause I'm on track
(?)
No time for sorries, my glories
(Well, I share no worries)
But it's a lonely road

One day at a time
I'm learning how to climb
I stumble, I survive
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day at a time

Looking up to the mountain
I can see the top
Though I'm frozen and broken
Gonna find the direction
But I don't know when
Heaven knows what I took there

One day at a time
I'm learning how to climb
I stumble, I survive
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day at a time

I stumble, I survive
One day at a time
One day at a time
