Did it ever cross your mind boy?
Did it ever cross your mind boy?

Things that I would face
Knowing that I would never see your face
I miss you baby every day and night
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind boy?

You would break my heart
Knowing that you would break this soul apart
These tears of mine I cry so hard at night
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind that I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think you'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind I'd probably save the light?
Did it ever cross your mind, no and that just ain't right?

No no, it just ain't right
No no, it just ain't right

Listen now you're gone
Be done and tryin' so hard to move on
I face it now I'm lying to myself
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind boy?

It's not that kinda thing
I know I don't know what you're tryin' to say
Nothing that I can do to help
It's just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind that I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think you'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind I'd probably save the light?
Did it ever cross your mind, no and that just ain't right?

No no, it just ain't right
No no, it just ain't right

Now you're gone
I'm trying, trying to move on
Now you're gone
I'm trying, trying to move on

Now you're gone
I'm trying, I'm trying to move on
Now you're gone
Did it ever cross your mind baby?

Did it ever cross your mind that I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think you'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind I'd probably save the light?
Did it ever cross your mind, no and that just ain't right?

No no, it just ain't right
No no, it just ain't right
No no, it just ain't right
No no, it just ain't right
