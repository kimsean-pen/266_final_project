Me and my friends in a hundred dollar Volvo
BustinG down the street while cruisinG Alvarado
Getting fucked up on the 101
Shootin' our guns and having fun
Forty beers later and a line of speed
Eight ball of blow and a half pound of weed
Heading down the track to Mexico
Fucked on beer and staying gold

I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!
I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!

As I was saying, all that shit like that Vietnam shit
Beer's always better with a bag around it
Dan's in the back pukin' on my seat
But he was drinking cheap beer, it's okay by me
Supposed to be in Santa Monica at 8 AM
Fuck the clock and drink red again!
Twenty three years I've been drinking cheap beer
Sixty one more, but from a liquor store

I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!
I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!

I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!
I drink cheap beer!
So what? Fuck you!
