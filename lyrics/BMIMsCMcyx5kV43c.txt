Far away you've gone, and left me here
So cold without you, so lonely dear
May June July I count the time
Every minute I go takes the smell of your clothes further away

'Cause you've gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

I have saved every piece of paper
Like grocery lists and note cards
To-do lists and race scores
So just in case you change your mind and come back
I've kept everything safe

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

Get me out get me off
Get me out get me off
This is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
That you've left behind

For this is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
To keep me company in my old age

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
Why don't you write to say goodbye?
Goodbye
