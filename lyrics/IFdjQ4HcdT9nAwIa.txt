...
i crossed a clearing yesterday
somewhere that i recognised
counted all the paths along the way
further than i've been before
touched your hand but nothing more
no one's ever looked at me that way
no one's ever looked at me that way
no one's ever looked at me that way
...
soon your touch will dissapear
it's something that i recognise
something that i should have come to fear
trace the lines upon your face
they tell the tale you can't erase
no one's ever looked at you that way
no one's ever looked at you that way
no one's ever looked at you that way
