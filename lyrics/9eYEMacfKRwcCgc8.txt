Please, take me
I'm sorry, I think
I didn't say those things
It's me
Please tell me
You're kidding
Oh, please, oh, please
Take me, I'm sorry
I know I'm mean
But, please, I'm begging
Oh her, who's she?
She meant nothing

Oh, oooooooh
What am I, am I supposed to do?
Why do this to me?
I think I need to sleep

Baby please
Oh, please forgive me
I swear, I won't drink
I think you're amazing
Oh, please, oh, please
Take me, I'm sorry
Please, oh, please
Take me, I'm sorry

Oh, oooooooh
What am I, am I supposed to do?
Why do this to me?
I think I need to sleep

And sleep and sleep
Because we aren't what we used to be
I think I need to sleep
I think I need to sleep
Oh, oooooooh
What am I supposed to do?
Why do this to me?
I think I need to sleep
