Posted on the corner like a trapper
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper

My whole life I just wanted to be a rapper
Then I grew'd and the boy became a rapper
And my older sister made me wear with a golden rapper
She said: "watch out, cause you know the hoes will trap ya"

Uh huh
To the- to the- to the block
To the- to the- to the block
Bloc, word
Word, word, word, word, word

Got my first pager, that was 1998
Sneaking, talking to my girlfriend way up late (hello)
Mama on the mothafuckin' line, boy you cry
I was trapping since a young nigga by the way
Way back then I was a different dude (dude)
Standing at the corner like I ain't got shit to do (do)
Now-a-days feeling like I ain't got shit to prove (prove)
All the beeper look him in the school (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I modelled Dior, but I'm still a rapper
Took a little detour, but I'm still a rapper (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be d-boy but I'm still a rapper
My whole life I was living like a trapper (trapper)
Shacked next to Casanova, locked up on the island
I don't brag about it cause it never really matter
I would never go back, don't hold back
Just shine my golden teeth
Just throw my dubs sack, that boof pack
That specimen, I could beef with OG beepers (woah)

All I ever wanted was some money and some jewels
Pray my YouTube reach a hundred million views
Pray I make a little extra cash for my dues, like
All she ever wanted was some ass for her boo
Sneaking, uh, why she freak you, uh, why she geeking
Uh, when she see me, why she kinky, uh
Why she wanna be my
Twenty years later and God still ain't make no errors
You could be authentic, it's just living trial and error
Sitting on the cell, just from snitching on your celly-phone
But cozy beeper, all I needed
OG beeper, all I needed

My whole life I just wanted to be that nigga
Then my ex hoes, they was turning into stripper
Then the whole time they was fucking other nigga
I paid no mind, fuck them other niggas (fuck 'em)
