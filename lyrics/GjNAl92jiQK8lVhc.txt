You're nobody until somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
Now you may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold
Gold'll never buy you happiness when you're growing old

You know the world is the same, you'll never change it
Just as sure as the star shines above
Now you're nobody until somebody comes and loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

I said the world it still is the same, you'll never change it
Just as sure as the star shine above
Good God baby, you ain't nobody until somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody, I have got me that body
So go and look about and find yourself somebody to love
