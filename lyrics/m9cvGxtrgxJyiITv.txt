It can do just what you want
Summer tan these little symptoms you got
Water cool these burns down you're so hot
Waves can't break these feelings like they're not, so

Sweetly lover won't ya let me know
Like a circle, round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna regret
How did the water get so cold?

So we soldier on
with burning feet we run
and here our bodies lay with Harrow road so far away.
Water cool these burns down it's so hot.
Waves can't break these feelings like they're not, so

Sweetly lover won't ya let me know
Like a circle, round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna regret
How did the water get so cold?

Sweetly lover won't ya let me know
Now we see what we're gonna forget,
Never know what we're gonna regret
Like a circle, round and round we go
Now we see what we're gonna forget
How did the water get so cold?
