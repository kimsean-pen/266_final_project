No time like the present
I've waited so long to be near to this
So much expectation
Is staring me right in the eyes

So I'm still standing with my eyes closed
Did I get what I wanted?
Too still, standing all alone
Had I been so demanding

'Cause you're the exception
I've tried every way to be sure of this
If I could just see
I'd open my eyes to the light
And then we'll free fall
Straight into the trap you set for me
Free fall
I'm not going back now that I see

Standing with my eyes closed
Did I get what I wanted?
Too still, standing all alone
Is this love that I'm feeling?
