Is it sick of me
To need control of you
Is it sick to make
You beg the way I do
Is it sick of me
To want you crawling on your knees
Is it sick to say
I want you biting down on me

Are you sick like me

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest, you always say

I'm beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at your ugliest, I always say
You're beautiful and sick like me

Is it sick of me
To feed the animal in you
Is it sick to say
I teaze the hunter like I do
Is it sick of me
To watch the wicked way you thrill
Is it sick to say
That I live to break your will

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest, you always say

I'm beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at your ugliest, I always say
You're beautiful and sick like me

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest, you always say

I'm beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at your ugliest, I always say
You're beautiful and sick like me
