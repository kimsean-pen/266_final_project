There's a first time for everything
It's definitely one of them nights
I knew when I looked in his eyes
That he was gonna be trouble for me
I never wanted to lie
I knew that my baby would cry
If he knew what we were doing
But if his love don't pass the test
I gotta get it from somewhere else
Well I'm gone and I need a man
Hope he understands, forgive me baby

But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doing me, myself and I
Can't wait no more, sitting all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

Been a long time since I
Did something good for myself
But why should I be put through hell?
When he's doing what he wanna do
I finally found somebody else
Who really wants to make me feel
Things that I've been missing so long
And his love always passed the test
It's a shame I had to look somewhere else
Well I'm gone and I need a man
I just hope that he understands
(Forgive me baby)

But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doing me, myself and I
Can't wait no more, sitting all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

Forgive me but I need to be loved too
Forgive me but I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man
Who understands just what I need, oh

Forgive me but I need to be loved too
Forgive me if I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Forgive me baby

But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doing me, myself and I
Can't wait no more, sitting all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, hope you forgive me
Oh oh, I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me

But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doing me, myself and I
Can't wait no more, sitting all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me
