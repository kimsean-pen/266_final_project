We are all insane
Counting down every single living day
We are prisoners of fate
I smile at the way everybody accepts the pain

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't feel
Just because I don't feel doesn't mean I don't understand
We are one in the unified field
We are one in the unified field

We are not in the dark
Our animal anger is eating our human hearts
How come everything hurts if nothing lasts
I smile at the way everybody lives in the past

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't feel
Just because I don't believe doesn't mean I don't understand
We are one in the unified field
We are one in the unified field

(Everybody loves
Everybody leaves
Everybody hurts
Everybody heals
Everybody needs)

We are all the same
Counting down every second every living day
we are prisoners of fate
I smile at the way everybody accepts the pain

I don't care
I don't believe
But I feel, I feel
