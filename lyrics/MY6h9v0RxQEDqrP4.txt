Giving me love
All on your canvas
All of the girls
All on the mattress

Lock the door
Dim the lights
Bottoms up
I'm in love
And you too

You're the best i can do

Pushing and shoving
Hugging and kissing
All of the time
All over again

Lock the door
Then we'll die
Bottoms up
I'm in love
I love you

You're the best i can do

And she told me
That she loved me
And she gave me my money back
