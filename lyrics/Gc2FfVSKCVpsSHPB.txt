Darknes and Death!
What are your secret enchantments?
Where lies the beauty of your oppression?
For I am entranced...

What innocence could have such splendour?
No naked beauty nor a warm smile.
But the Power to leave stars and worlds
in lifeless silence...

Sublime is the hand of no pity.
That wields a merciless Death.
To judge not by deeds
but by the approval of a god!

Victorious heart of deceit.
Shaped in red beauty yet carved in black stone.
Killing not to win, but to ensure a loss.
Mendaciously poundering through Death...

Darkness and Death!
Your blessed art lives through me.
Through entranced submission.
By the love of God!
