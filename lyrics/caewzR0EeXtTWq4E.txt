Oh my love, I'll wait
I have been waiting here all day
[incomprehensible]

Oh my love, I am low
'Cos you are asking me to go
And I know I am holding onto dust
But my heart is telling me I'm right

Take my hand if you care
I can be your girl
You'll be my man
But you don't love me anymore
And I've never felt so broken up before
(I am well, I am well, I am well)

Ooh, baby darling
I will wait before
Ooh, baby darling
I will wait before

Ooh, long night
I will wait before
Ooh, every night
I will wait before, before

I die, I die, I die, I

Oh my love, I am low
'Cos you are asking me to go
And I know I am holding onto dust
But my heart is telling me I'm right

Take my hand if you care
I can be your girl
You'll be my man
But you don't love me anymore
And I've never felt so broken up before

Da da da da da da [repeat]
