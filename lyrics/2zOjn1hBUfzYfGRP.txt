Dreams are like a primal love
And the chance that I might sing low
Will you ask me, am I waiting outside?
The taxi is red and I'm ready to ride
My legs are dancing past the doorways along
The streets that I love, and I'm all alone
Oh, some big buildings are hazy in the fog
Here I am
Stuck here thinkin' about you again
And in the end
I will try not to think of you again
