You're tellin' me "I can't take this shit no more, baby"
How does it feel every time I let you down?
You're tellin' me "I can't take this shit no more, baby"
How does it feel every time I let you down?

I still wanna know
Have you ever been emotional?
Can't fight this feeling, dust off my side
I'm tired of being polite

You're tellin' me "I can't take this shit no more, baby"
How does it feel every time I let you down?
You're tellin' me "I can't take this shit no more, baby"
How does it feel every time I let you down?

The second I slip away
I let it go and feel alright, another level overnight
Can't fight this feeling, dust off my side
Another reason to try, you've got me thinking I'm...

Clueless
Can't be the only
Words that you told me
Making me feel like I'm
Clueless
Can't say I doubt it
Don't talk about it
I'm tired of feeling so...

(Clueless)
