he is the last we'll know mercy for you
he is the last you'll know

all revealed in our solace see three eyes
all our crimes trial waits everyone
the presence of old eyes is here
grant me the pure heart we've lived through
in times of light fire is water
breath and reach to home

all answer, transcendence all present
to guide us through terminus and feed us to light
