When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll see (you) tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk (away)

When you say 'I do'
Oh, I don't (believe) you
I can't forget it

When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
When you make me smile

When I look at you
Oh, I don't know what's real
Once in a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll see (you) tomorrow
And it won't be long
Once in a while
Then you take me down
Then you walk (away)

When you say 'I do'
Oh, I don't (believe) you
I can't forget it
