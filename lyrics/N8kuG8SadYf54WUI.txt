Do you applaud fear? Do you hold it near?
Are you afraid to live your life the way I perceive?
In my arms I'll catch you, do you mind If I'll always love you?

Do you mind If I'll always love you?
Do you mind If I'll always love you?
Do you mind If I'll always love you?

Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Now Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes

You'll see in my dream I'll catch you
Into my arms I'll catch you, do you mind if I'll always love you?
Do you mind If I'll always love you?

Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes now
Heaven's gonna burn your eyes
