Like a child's hand
Take and just demand
How can it be so hard?
Don't let the world depart

Are we set to learn?
Watch as cities burn
We're just at the start
Don't tear our world apart

Fate can't seal the world
Life breeds in the light
We'll change just who we are
Let us ignite
Take our first flight
Let us dispel this condition of ignorance, violence and bliss

To act like this so young
Look how far we've come
Actions speak our words
Don't let our fate be cursed

This life is not my own
This world is not mine
How can it be so hard?
Don't tear our world apart

Fate can't seal the world
Life breeds in the light
We'll change just who we are
Let us ignite
Take our first flight
Let us dispel this condition of ignorance, violence and bliss

Why
We
Share our own prosperity

Can't
See
As these shadows start to

Lean
Over
As the nights grow colder

Oh, this speaks to me
We'll sail away to brighter shores
Oh, we'll walk away
We'll sail away
We'll pass away

We'll make amends
To what we've done
For what we've done

Oh, this speaks to me
What have we done?
Where have we gone?

Oh, this speaks to me
We'll sail away to brighter shores
Oh, we'll walk away
We'll sail away
We'll pass away
