This is an insight
Into my life
This is a strange flight
I'm taking
My true will carries me along

This is a soul dance
Embracing me
This is the first chance
To put things right
Moving on guided by the light

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

Wisdom of ages
Rush over me
Heighten my senses
Enlighten me
Lead me on, eternally

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

I'm talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now
The world still turns

I'm talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now
The world still turns

I'm talking to you now

You gotta give love
You gotta give love
You gotta give love
Give love
