Well, get down, woman
Before I have to go.
Well, now get down, woman
Before I have to go.
You know ya hurt me with your bad mouth
An' I just don't wanna know.

Well, slow down, baby
And gimme a little time.
Well, now slow down, baby
And gimme a little time.
If you want me hangin' 'round
Gotta give me some peace of mind.

Oh, get down, boy.

Well, get back, woman
Before you bring it down.
Well, now get back, baby
Before you bring it down.
Or you can tell it to the wall
Without me hangin' around.
