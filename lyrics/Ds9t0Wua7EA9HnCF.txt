Born in Maryland, let me make that known
The county of P.G.'s my home sweet home.
Yo, I gotta put it down for my home town,
MD, the B.C.'s my stompin' ground.

Home to some of the wildest brothas on the planet,
From blue collar workers, to thugs, and bandits.
Got our own slang that we use in our grammar,
Corny individuals, we call them "bammas."
If a nigga's trippin', we say the dude is lunchin
Good lookin' women translate into youngin's.
A hoopdee is a bucket, so act like ya know,
We don't care what your name is cause everybody's Joe.
For real though, gogo's the music we invented
Jump around the junkyard, et cetera, don't you forget it.
Who do you think had the world doin' The Butt?
D.C. to P.G., recognize, nigga, what?
