To forgive is to suffer

Throughout our time a thought escapes us
To enforce a word, no
Holdin' on to pain it may seem to some

The easy way to say okay
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp actions dark
Hide your blade like a [Incomprehensible]

Enforce the words no more
Be free
Alone you might just find serenity

To forgive is to suffer
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life
To forgive is to suffer

Once or twice is kind
Three or four is blind
It is not the end, yet a way to begin
The power of words both good and bad

The easy way to say okay
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp actions dark
Hide your blade like a [Incomprehensible]

Enforce the words no more, be free
Alone you might just find serenity

To forgive is to suffer
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life
