Let the killer go, don't let your mother know
Don't go out tonight, don't even try to fight
'Cause I can see, I've got the thing you need
And I'm here to stay, it's gonna be that way

Don't try to run, don't try to scream
Believe me, the hammer's gonna smash your dream

I'm in your life, just might be in your wife
Could be behind your back, I might be on your track
And it might be true, I might be onto you
I'll scare you half to death, I'll take away your breath

Don't try to see, don't you try to hide
Believe me, the hammer's gonna make you die
Ain't that right?

There ain't no way, you'll see another day
I'm shooting out your lights, bring you eternal night
And your eternal tricks begin to make me sick
The only thing I know is that you've gotta go

Don't you panic, babe, don't look around
Believe me, the hammer's gonna bring you down

Believe me, the hammer's coming...
Down, down
