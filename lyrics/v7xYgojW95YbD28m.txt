Gone from your side,
break one lie
with a sigh, with a sigh
In your words, burned since long,
seasons change as I wait

Radiant radiate,
all but here

Guiding light dims the dawn,
posed appease cause to seize
all the signs faith misled,
come the tide doubts subside

Lost in yourself, empty words,
forsaken what used to be within me
Scars on your hands from nails that are worn,
our loss resign in failure
Source of deceit.
