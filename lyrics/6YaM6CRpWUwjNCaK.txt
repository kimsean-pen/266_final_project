Had ten dollaz but I put it away
Don't know where I'm goin but the wind is blowin
Smokeless but no way of knowin
I'll be fine when the wind stops blowin
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your gaze
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your gaze
Had ten dollaz but I put it away
It's been a long, loveless day
You look at me like I'm crazy, Baby
Lay back at ease...
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your gaze
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your pain
