So you think I'm bad, babe
And you keep acting like you want me I don't need a little boy
You better turn it up just a little more
Get my attention, I'm ready to go
My only intention's to give you a show Light it up I know you want it
Take a bow Let's get high of our love High of our love
Do you wanna get high off my love?
Can you hear me?
I'm on a venus trip You from mars, baby?
The night is young It's time to kill it
Let's turn it up
I know you really want it
I wanna see you (ooh) Go hard as you can And let it show
You're making me dance
Get my attention,
I'm ready to go
My only intention's to give you a show
