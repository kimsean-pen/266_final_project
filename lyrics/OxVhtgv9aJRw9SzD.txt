You keep saying you're the talk of the town
Baby all I can hear is talking
You like telling me that you'll take me down
Baby when will you just start walking

If you like the fast lane don't be slow
Cause I'm giving you the green light to go
If you got something you wanna show

Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me

You keep saying you got something to prove
Baby why are you hesitating?
You like telling me that you'll make a move
Baby I'm just no good at waiting

If you like the fast lane don't be slow
Cause I'm giving you the green light to go
If you got something you wanna show

Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me
Show it 2 me
