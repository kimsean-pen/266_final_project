When all our tears have reached the sea

Part of you will live in me

Way down deep inside my heart

The days keep coming without fail

A new wind is gonna find yourself

That's where your journey starts
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore

Your gonna keep on coming back for more

'Cause we don't ever wanna stop

Out in this brave new world you seek

O'er the valleys and the peaks

And I can see you on the top
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walkin'

When snow falls high outside your door

Late at night when you're not sleepin'

And moonlight falls across your floor

When I can't hurt you anymore
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Please remember me
