You don't know what I feel, I get behind the wheel
A feeling in my soul
I hyperventilate as I accelerate
Till I've lost all control

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

My supersonic machine
Get out of my...

Fast lane
Like a jet plane
Like a freight train
I'm driving insane

Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain
This is my domain
Addicted to the fast lane

I look into the mirror, red lights are drawing nearer
They think I've met my match
But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear
You can't jail what you can't catch

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

I hear the engines screaming
I'm burning up...

The fast lane
Like a jet plane
Like a freight train
I'm driving insane

Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain
This is my domain
Fast lane

Fast lane
Like a jet plane
Like a freight train
This is my domain
Addicted to the fast lane
