Oh Babe
I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're giving
'Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here

Combustible, and I can't wait to finally explode
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang

The big big bang
Some people like to talk, but I'm into doing
What I feel like doing, when I'm inspired
So, if we take a walk down, the beach tonight

I bet we that could light up the sky
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang

The big big bang
Hmm Give Me To Breath
Take it from me, I don't wanna be mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die
And now take it from me, if you got it
Every time
So baby bring your body here, next to mine
Next to mine
I don't wanna dream

I just wanna live
So baby, lets not miss this thing
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang
Hit me, big big big bang.
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
