I've got love, I've got love, I've got love, love
I've got love, I've got love, I've got love

They want to try reprimand you
Tell them you don't understand
Kindness is a secondhand truth
You pass it down from man to man
You pass it down from man to man
(I've got love)
Don't let fear overtake your plan
(I've got love)
I want to show you how to love
(I've got love)
Hate can be an empty drug

I've got love
Running through my fingers in my bones
I've got love
Running down my spine and in my clothes
I've got love
Coming off my pores to give my cold
I've got love
I've got love, I've got love I've got love

When ever I feel water rising
I become the blazing sun
And if you feel the roof is caving
I'll help you build another one

Oh, you can build a better one
(I've got love)
Don't let fear overtake your plan
(I've got love)
I want to show you how to love
(I've got love)
Hate can be an empty drug
I've got love
Running through my fingers in my bones

I've got love
Running down my spine and in my clothes
I've got love
Coming off my pores to give my cold
I've got love
I've got love, I've got love I've got love
I've got love
Running through my fingers in my bones
I've got love
Running down my spine and in my clothes
I've got love
Coming off my pores to give my cold
I've got love
I've got love, I've got love I've got

Sometimes we fall and sometimes we fly, that's how life goes
Chin up to the sky, let your brown eyes light up, they glow
Don't let you heart consume all the hate they love to feed
I've got something that you need, I've got something

I've got love
Running through my fingers in my bones
I've got love
Running down my spine and in my clothes
I've got love
Coming off my pores to give my cold
I've got love
I've got love, I've got love, I've got love
I've got love
Love, I've got love, I've got love
I've got love
Love, I've got love, I've got love
I've got love
Love, I've got love, I've got love
I've got love
I've got love, I've got love, I've got love
