No more sittin' at home at night
Waiting for you to come home
No more will I cry for you
I've found somebody new
No more late night phone calls
Don't even bother at all
When I was there for you
You took me for granted

Now he loves me
The way, I wanted you to love me
He is always thinkin' of me
He is notin' like you at all
I don't know why
I stayed with you for so long
I should have been gone
He is nothing like you at all

Thats why I say, "Wow"
Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun

He is here and all my hurt is gone
Every night he is loving me
I feel like I'm inside a movie
But his love is always real to me
He is here and I finally found someone
That I can call my own
Now that I'm not with you
You want me to come back

Now he loves me
The way I wanted you to love me
He is always thinkin' of me
He is notin' like you at all
I don't know why
I stayed with you for so long
No no, I should have been gone
He is nothing like you at all

Thats why, I say, "Wow"
Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun

Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun

No more trouble, since you came in to my life
I'm so full of you
Your the reason, why I am so happy lately
You and me together, is my like fantasy clearly

This is why, I say, "Wow"
Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun

Never felt a love so good
I looked up and my world is brighter now
There's no more rainy clouds
Since loves here and now
Everyday I wear a smile
He came in my life and the clouds are gone
I only see the sun
Thats why, I say, "Wow"
