Why do I gotta do?
Tell me, why should I care?
I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you

I know that you could see your breath of air
I never blink when you're not there
I hold another, another lover but you are not aware
I wanna hope that I can find, to ease my broken mind
I wanna hide under, undercover till I don't recognize

Why do I gotta do?
Tell me, why should I care?
I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you
I need another dose
'Cause you're black when you stare
I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you

Someone give me suddenly the sign
We run this clock, replace my time
I wanna find another, so I'll recover
Recalibrate my eyes
I wanna fell from great to good, replace the things you do
Fake this love, hard to cover
Becomes more live with you
I can't see

Why do I gotta do?
Tell me, why should I care?
I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you
I need another dose,
'Cause you're black when you stare
I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you

Over, over you
Over, over you

I wanna get over,
I wanna get over you
