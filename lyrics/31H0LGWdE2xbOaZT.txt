Creeping up a wall of glass
I'm entirely made of sand
Lurching up. Feeding back
What the canyon wants, the canyon gets
And the canyon craves an apology and a pound of flesh

I thought I felt
I thought I saw
I thought I knew
So much chatter

Let there be shade
Un-illuminate
Nothing will change
If you don't lead with your shadow

Let there be shade
Un-illuminate
Exhale the plague
Cloud your vision

An unpainted corner
My kingdom come
Silence tells me I can't escape it

Now we write our names on the moon in blood
I have set us back twenty centuries
All the letters sent with no address
Is he talking to or talking down to me?

They'll kill us
They'll kill us
They'll kill us, if they have the chance
I hear their conversations
They'd kill us if they had the chance
I'll be the first to take it

I still feel like someone is watching
Though I'm not sure if that someone is listening
It don't matter much to my suffering
Because I know for a fact no one's answering

Let there be shade
Un-illuminate
Nothing will change
If you don't lead with your shadow

I was on the shoulders of leviathans
But I couldn't see through the fog of anger
And I failed myself like I did before
My work is lost. All my reckoning
Back to sin. Back to shame
Back into the quicksand

Guarding an empty house
Guarding an empty house
I have lost everything I had found
Sorrow will overcome
Sorrow will overcome
