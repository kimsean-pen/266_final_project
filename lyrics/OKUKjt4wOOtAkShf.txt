i'm not punk
how can i be?
show me the way to conformity
try to be different
but it's always the same
end up playing someone elses game

i'm just a square goin' nowhere
i'm just a square goin' nowhere

you used to walk
by my side
now you see me coming
now you hide
i see you here
i see you there
i can see that you don't care

i'm just a square goin' nowhere
i'm just a square goin' nowhere

i'm just a square goin' nowhere
i'm just a square goin' nowhere
i'm just a square goin' nowhere
square goin nowhere
