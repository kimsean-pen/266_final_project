Ohh ah
Let me say something
Pays to remember
A little bit of effort
You get the number
Ohh ah
You can practise
You know the M.O
Think you're gonna hold this
I got the veto

Dance Dance
In the morning maybe
Dance Dance
If I want to baby
Dance Dance
Boy your bones are lazy

Woah

Yeah you got to
Work
Tonight
You got to earn
Your right
Or access is
Denied
That's what I'm worth
Two times
Two times

Ohh ah
I'm gonna call it
Just being honest
And If you don't do it
You're not down on my list
Ohh ah
Pity you poor fool
You don't see the picture
Don't go by my rules
You won't know what hit ya
