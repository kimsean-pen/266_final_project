when i feel ashamed
i get so scared
it makes me wanna hurt you
shamemaker

my body aches
and i feel alone
i'm in a very defensive place
shamemaker

oh oh-oh ooh!
feel the feeling oh!
process feelings
feel it in the belly
like a yellow worm with teeth

oh oh-oh ooh!
bring it down, don't think too much
feel the feeling
let it have its way til it says good bye
Go!

i need to breathe

just need to breathe
don't walk away
shamemaker

touch me
you need to touch me
but i'm afraid
shamemaker

oh oh-oh ooh!
feel the feeling oh!
process feelings
feel it in the belly
like a yellow worm with teeth

oh oh-oh ooh!
bring it down dont think too much
feel the feeling
let it have its way til it says good bye
let it have its way til it says good bye

let it go
shamemaker
