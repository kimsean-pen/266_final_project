You're burning your bridges
You're building up walls
You can't see what you got now
Too busy wanting it all

The doctor gave me something
Just let me show you how
I know you're tired of running
From the here and now
Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now
Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now

We're looking for trouble
If we keep asking for more
It's a mountain we're climbing
So high that we can't breathe anymore

The doctor gave me something
Just let me show you how
I know you're tired of running
From the here and now
Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now
Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now

Something about me and you that I can't help but hold on to every night
There's something about when I'm with you that lets' me know it's gonna be all right
Maybe I'm crazy to think we can make it
But I know that now is the time

Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now
Start living in the moment
Start living in the moment with me now
