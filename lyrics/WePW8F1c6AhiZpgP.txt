I want the end of summer
So I can wear my thickest jumpers
I want the dark when I wake up
It's been a year since I kissed her
A while since I missed her
I want the dark when I wake up

I hope you're miserable

I guess I'm feeling better
I left home and left a letter
I took those smokes for myself
I guess back then I loved her
couldn't bring myself to touch her
she wanted someone else

I'll keep you in mind from time to time
like the rain in the summer
and those clothes you wear with the ripped holes
ain't the same in the winter

I'll keep you in mind from time to time
like the rain in the summer
and those clothes you wear with the ripped holes
ain't the same in the winter

I'll keep you in mind from time to time
like the rain in the summer
and those clothes you wear with the ripped holes
ain't the same in the winter
