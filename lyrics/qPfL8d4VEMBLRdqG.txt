Here we are in the room full of strangers
Im standing in the dark where your eyes couldn't see me
Well, I had to follow you, though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my love for you, I just can't stay away

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs, singing them straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds to that crazy town

In my place there are so many others
Well, standing in the line, how long will they stand between us
Well, I had to follow you, though you did not want me to
But I just cant stop loving you, you see I just cant stay away

Im blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs, singing them straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds to that crazy town

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway

Well, I had to follow you, though you did not want me to
But that wont stop my love for you baby, you see I just cant stay away

Im blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs, singing them straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds to that crazy town

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs, singing them straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds to that crazy town
