Ring the mighty line
Sign in by letter
Or go to mothers eyes

Diversity
Captured by names 'cause you see I have another mans name
I was never the one

You treated me so carelessly
You kept imagining the one
The one

Silence sends all it's love
The silent nods
The silent settlements

It's hard for me to keep up
When someone other just picks you right off the ground

If i'm not the right one
Tell me what you're waiting for something's on your mind, babe
i can tell that somethings wrong

Life is not always about keeping your promises
Life is about following your heart
