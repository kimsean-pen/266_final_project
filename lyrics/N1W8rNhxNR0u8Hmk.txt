No boundaries can hold
The things that can't be told
In the absence of language
No cure for the curious
You know what you know
The places you'll go
I know what I know
The places I won't go

Touch, touch me real
Touch is the strongest
Touch is the strongest sense

Distilled listening
Keeps me intrigued
We stand in the doorway
Of a love made easy
I know what I know
The places we'll go

Touch, touch me real
Touch is the strongest
Touch is the strongest sense
