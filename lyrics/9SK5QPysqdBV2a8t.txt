I need you here by my side
I've been contemplating days
This panic resonates
An echo never fades away
I've been contemplating days

We are terrified
In this little life
Running out of time
In this little life
We are terrified
In this little life
Night after night
I'll hold you until your lungs start breaking

I tried my best to make a sound
I'm too choked up to spit it out
Don't loose your focus now
You know that I love you
Please tell me you do

I'll hold you until your lungs start breaking
Piece by piece we are fading away
Into a new place
Into a new space

Wherever it may be
It's forever you and me

Wherever it may be
It's forever you and me

By my side (I need you)
By my side (I need you)
By my side (I need you)
I need you

There are mammoths in the Atlantic
We'll never know until we go swimming
There are mammoths in the Atlantic
We'll never know

There are mammoths in the Atlantic
We'll never know until we go swimming
There are mammoths in the Atlantic

You know that I want you
Please tell me you do
I'll hold you until your lungs start breaking
Split your doubts with love, believe me
You're all that I have
