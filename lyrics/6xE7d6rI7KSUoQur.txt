Let's take a walk down memory lane
When I was just a boy and I wasn't insane
Back before the world got inside of my heart
Before all the sickness almost tore me apart

Corruption, deception
A natural progression
Denial was a drug that I couldn't refuse

Now I'm just a puppet
Always singin' for my supper
Blame it on myself
But I know it was you

I know it was you

Here we go again
Life turns another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind

Here I go again
Life makes another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind

You're not my kind

My dad was a killer, a cold blooded guerilla
Something I can never perceive
Mom was just a survivor, worked till it broke her
She always landed right on her feet

Rejection, infection
Down the wrong direction
Could never walk a day in their shoes

From a child to a leper
Feels like I've been severed
Blame it on the world
Cause I know that it's true

I know it's true

Here we go again
Life turns another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind

Here I go again
Life makes another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind

You're not my kind

HAHAHA
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind

You're not my kind

Here we go again
Life turns another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind

Here I go again
Life makes another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind

You're not my kind

You're not my kind
