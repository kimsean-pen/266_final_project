Where do you turn
When you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules
These are the sounds of the underworld

Drug infested streets
Feeding on penniless dreams
Children of a lesser god
Never thought it could be so hard

Where do you turn
When you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules
These are the sounds of the underworld

I call out for the just
The cries of the underdogs
A threat to your perfect world
The enemy of mankind

Where do you turn
When you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules
These are the sounds of the underworld
Underworld

So sick of shit thrown in my face
This world don't give a damn
I walk the line of truth and honor
And stick tight to my friends, stick tight

Stick tight
I stick tight to my friends, stick tight
