Had too much I slipped
I'm boarding a sinking ship
Everyone is wrong
And what have I done wrong?

The last to go
The last to go
I couldn't know
Where can I go?
Where can I go?
I'm so alone

Bottles on the floor
I can't take no more
Had too much to drink
And no one is here with me

The last to go
The last to go
I'm so alone
Where can I go?
Where can I go?
I just don't know

Oh, I'm sitting here alone
With nowhere I can go
Oh, I'm sitting here alone
With nowhere I can go

Oh, I'm sitting here alone
With nowhere I can go
(I could just go home)
