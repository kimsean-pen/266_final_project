Hey, again
I thought that you were my friend
Take the dream glasses off
And see again

Like before
When I opened the door
And let the happiness in
And closed again

Someday someone
Is gonna see you
Someday someone
Is gonna come through

Death decides
When to open your eyes

Go away
Would you just go away
Go away, go away
They go away

Someday someone
Is gonna love you
Someday someone
Is gonna need you, too

And they said
When you empty your head
You can actually see
Without your sight

Hey, again
I thought that I was this friend
Took the dream glasses off
And saw again

Someday someone
Is gonna come through
They're all out there
Waitin' for you, too
