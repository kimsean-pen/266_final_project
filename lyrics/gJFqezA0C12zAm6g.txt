Write my name in blood
Let it scar your lungs as it rolls off your tongue
Write my name in blood when all freedom is gone
Write my name in blood
Spell it out for all to see

Now listen
The moment that the pen hurts more than the gun is the moment that I lost my mind
Losing faith in humanity and faith in equality
It's time to shine light on these blackened times

Speak my name
Suffocating in this world I'm lost for words and I can't breathe
I'm lost for words
Scream my name
I'm suffocating
I can't breathe and I can't speak
We are lost for words

I'm lost for words

Locked up and shot down for speaking our minds
Paying the price to live but living to die
Living to die!

You put your hand over my mouth
I put my pen to this paper
Now I'm a murderer for speaking my mind?
We've been censored at mouth shot down dead for speaking out
Who knew that free speech was a crime?

Speak my name
Suffocating in this world I'm lost for words and I can't breathe
I'm lost for words
Scream my name
I'm suffocating
I can't breathe and I can't speak
We are lost for words

I'm lost for words

You can replace my tongue with the barrel of a gun
But you won't shut me up
Burn my name into the earth as I dance on the lips of the world
