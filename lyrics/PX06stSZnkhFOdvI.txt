Take this silver lining, keep it in your own sweet head
And shine it when the night is burning red
Shine it in the twilight
Shine it on the cold, cold ground
Shine it till these walls come tumbling down

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

Step into the silence take it in your own two hands
And scatter it like diamonds
All across these lands
Blaze it in the morning wear it like an iron skin
Only things worth living for are innocence and magic, amen

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleep

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleep
