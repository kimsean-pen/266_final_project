The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my heart broken, black and blood lined
The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my bones thrown back into the fire
The cut of open that did not bleed
All the wanted out of me
And the unspoken and how it feels
Into the vein, into the seed

The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my heart broken, black and blood lined
The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my bones thrown back into the fire
Can not live with you, can not live without
The fuck of you of me and in my mouth
The blood and bone of you and every sound
Is how I have lost what I had been the found

The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my heart broken, black and blood lined
The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my bones thrown back into the fire
All of my heart you own in blood and sound and bone
The weight of your mouth
All of my heart you own in blood and sound and bone
The weight of your mouth
All of my heart you own in blood and sound and bone
The weight of your mouth
All of my heart you own in blood and sound and bone

The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my heart broken, black and blood lined
The weight we were, the weight we are
All of my bones thrown back into the fire
