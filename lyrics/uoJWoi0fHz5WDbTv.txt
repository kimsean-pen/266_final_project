Breathe
I feel it in my bones it's coming to
Coming to

Change
Donate all the flaws that I outgrew
I outgrew

Stay
Suddenly I'm drifting into you
Into you

Wait
All my hidden visions coming true
Coming true

Take me to the roof and tell me I should jump with you
I know that I shouldn't, but I really want to
Jump

I can't help it
I can't help it
No, no oh
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
No oh oh oh

Crash
Breaking all my bones just to love you
To love you

Free
Falling into you it hurts so good
Hurts so good

Take me to the roof and tell me I should
jump with you (I should jump with you, yeah)
I know that I shouldn't, but I really want to (I really want to)
Jump

I can't help it
I can't help it
No, no oh
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
No oh oh oh

We tango high up and we'll never look back
Even though we know we'll imminently crash
We're dancing closer to the ledge
Ooooh
Jump

I can't help it
I can't help it
No, no oh (no no no no no)
No, no oh (no no no no no)
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
No oh oh oh

Oh I cannot help it baby
Oh I cannot help it baby
Oh I cannot help it baby
Baby
Oh I cannot help it baby
Oh I cannot help it baby
Baby
I can't help it baby
