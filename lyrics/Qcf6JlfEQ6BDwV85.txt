monster at the end.

This ain't just another dream with a
monster at the end.
Down in under where the
damned are rotting down in
under where you pay your
golden halo is burned and
melted crown the monster at the end.
The wall of sleep is crumbling
and your consciences are tumbling
a massive gaping serpent uncoiled
and wake. In the face of something's
hell sins of yours an angel fell a
monster hiding in plain sight its a
monster at the end.
Down in under where the
damned are rotting down in under
where you pay your golden halo
is burned and melted crown the
monster at the end.
Its coming... Its coming... Its coming
the monster is unleashed!!!!

Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
you're that monster at the end.

Its coming... Its coming... Its coming.
Down in under where the
damned are rotting down in under
where you pay your golden halo
is burned and melted crown the
monster at the end.
Its coming... Its coming... Its coming.
Down in under where the
damned are rotting down in under
where you pay your golden halo
is burned and melted crown the
monster at the end.
