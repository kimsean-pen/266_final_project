I feel the magic burning deep inside of me
No one can change the path about your destiny
Don't be ashamed about the way we are
Another life awaits beyond the stars
They're calling, we're falling

A flood of passion, now I feel the urge in me
A generation shamed by our reality
But now the sky's a raging battlefield
Then what makes human truth will be revealed
The final judgement day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
With the guidance of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

Forever walking cold inside and all alone
Our raging thunder far beyond their icy home
We hold the right to feel the tears so cold
Here comes the vengeance of the barren souls
Our one true judgement day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
With the guidance of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

We reached for the moon
We conquered the stars
We cried for the tears of yesterday
Still strong to the end
'Til we'll meet again
Remember the glory of the brave

We reached for the moon
We conquered the stars
We cried for the tears of yesterday
Still strong to the end
'Til we'll meet again
Remember the glory of the brave

We stand at the dawn
Our kingdom reborn
And wait for the sun to rise again
A light in the sky
So free and so wild
A light from our last eternal flame
