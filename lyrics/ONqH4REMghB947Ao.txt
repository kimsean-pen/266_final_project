Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...

If I'm with you, then rest assured that I'm in love,
In love with you...

If I'm with you, then rest assured that I'm in love,
In love with you...

Baby, baby, please don't let me down...

I-i-in love with you...

Baby, baby, please don't let me down;
If only broken hearts live all above...
Baby, baby, please don't let me...

I can't get up (I can't get up...) - I moved the mountains in my mind,
In my mind...

You bet your luck I'll write your name in city lights,
To brighten up your blue, oh...

Baby, baby, please don't let me down;
If only broken hearts live all above...
Baby, baby, please don't let me...

Spell out all of your love for me;
Tell 'em all I'm your lover, baby...
(In my mind...)

Spell out all of your love for me;
Tell 'em all I'm your lover, baby...
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)

Baby, we got time for time to wait;
I put you on the line, no choice to make...
Running only slows you down the way
When every minute moving's yours to take...

We turn time into shapes, the way you're loving me;
Turn hours into space, oh-oh, oh...
Put seconds into stars, the way you're loving me;
Turn circles into hearts, oh, baby...
