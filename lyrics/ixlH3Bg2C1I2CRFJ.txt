Amelia
(Stay, stay)
Amelia

I swear if you reach that door
You're not welcome anymore
(Stay, stay)
Amelia

Plates and bottles on the floor
I can't fix them on my own

Gee we had it figured out
Limitless in love
We even broke into a warehouse
So no one would find out
Your father chased us down
We even packed that suitcase
Are you really walking out?

(Stay, stay)
Amelia
If you reach that door
(Stay, stay)
Amelia

I swear if you reach that door
You're not welcome anymore

Gee we had it figured out
Limitless in love
We even broke into a warehouse
So no one would find out
Your father chased us down
We even packed that suitcase
Are you really walking out?

Amelia
(Stay, stay)
If you reach that door
(Stay, stay)
If you reach that door

I need you with all my heart
Need for you to decide to stay here
Before I fall apart
Need for you to decide to stay

Gee we had it figured out
Limitless in love
We even broke into a warehouse
So no one would find out
Your father chased us down
We even packed that suitcase
Are you really walking out?
