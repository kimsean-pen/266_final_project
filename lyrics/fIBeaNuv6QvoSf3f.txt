(If I lose it all)
(If I lose it all)

I got my back to the wall
And now I'm slippin'
Been tryna deal with the thoughts and my condition
And still I try to hang on to what I'm missin'
But something's setting me off, somebody listen
(Listen)

I been running from fate without a lifeline
But now I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time
Tryna find an escape, looking to get by
From never getting a break, cutting the brake lines

I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall

(If I lose it all)
(Nothing's gonna break the fall)

I got my head in the game, I'm on a mission
But every day is the same, a demolition
We are the marginalized but not the victims
Fighting the fight of our lives to make you listen

You got me losing my breath
It's been a long run
I'm trying hard to forget
But I know the outcome
I got a thousand regrets
And now I'm on one
I might be losing my head
Before the sun's down

I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall

Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together, beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together, I'm beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together, beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together, I'm beat down

I've been hanging by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all
Nothing's gonna break the fall
Break the fall

(If I lose it all)
(Nothing's gonna break the fall)
