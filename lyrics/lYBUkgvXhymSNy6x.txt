Within your mind, you feel a force
Striving to gain control, it burns you deep inside

No one can help you now

You try to focus on reality, feel your mind slipping
An outside air of composure, but inside you're screaming

Inside you're screaming

White blinding lights, now turns your world to black
Alone in silence, you prepare to meet the final attack

Your mind now out of control, a psychological disease
Your greatest fears envelop your mind - infect it with torment
Now totally insane, you cannot remember your life before
A final vain hope, as you grasp for the shreds

The shreds of sanity
The shreds of sanity

You cannot hide the fear, confusion eats at your will
You lived your life on a knife edge of sanity
As your grip begins to fail, the words echo through your mind
Look what has become of your world
Our world

The shreds...
The shreds of sanity
The shreds...
The shreds of sanity
