Monkeys on their back... on yours
You know their hearts are black, they can't follow the course
You'd only take a life, that was already over to save another
No guns or bombs or knives
Your hammer, your hands, your heart is full

And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me

They say you have no name, they say you show no signs
And who you are by the day, isn't the same in the night
But you'd only take a life, that was already over to save another
No guns or bombs or knives
Your hammer, your hands, your heart is full

And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
