Shoot me down, baby look at your move
I know you ain't got a thing to lose
Dancing fool, fight for breath
The way you look you scare a man to death

I can't speak, my heart's on fire
You're the focus of my desire
Can't be real, can't be true
Just like a virgin, make me feel brand new

I know you're a bad, bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad, bad woman
Good enough for me

Here I come baby, watch my smoke
I gotta get you and it ain't no joke
I hope your body ain't telling me lies
You bring a tear to my lying eyes

I wish I could, I wish I might
Get the wish that I wish tonight
Drive me crazy, turn me inside out
I gotta have you baby, ain't no doubt

I know you're a bad, bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad, bad woman
Good enough for me

Give it up baby, let me jump your bones
I'm fired up and I'm almost grown
I can't believe you want me too
Here I come honey, woop-dee-do

I know you're a bad, bad woman
One look and you set me running
I know you're a bad, bad woman
Good enough for me

I know you're a bad, bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me running
I know you're a bad, bad woman
Good enough for me
