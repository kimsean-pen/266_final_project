My breaking point
My breaking point

I'm not close to the edge
I'm standing right at it
When I turn, turn the page
It is still unwritten

I'm giving up...

I'm at my breaking point
Cannot take it another day
I'm at my breaking point
Never gonna make it out alive
This is me giving up
Because I've had enough
I'm at my breaking point
My breaking point

My breaking point

I can't imagine tomorrow
Being a part of my life
I'm at the end of my rope
A broken man at his breaking point

I'm giving up...

I'm at my breaking point
Cannot take it another day
I'm at my breaking point
Never gonna make it out alive
This is me giving up
Because I've had enough
I'm at my breaking point
My breaking point

If my body was on fire
I would let it burn
'Cause I just don't care anymore
There is nothing more to say
This is me giving up
'Cause I just don't care anymore
You can't save me
You can't save me
You can't save me
You can't save

My breaking point

Cannot take it another day
I'm at my breaking point
Never gonna make it out alive
This is me giving up
Because I've had enough
My breaking point
