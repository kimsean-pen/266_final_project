True hearts rely on never getting lost in the night
There's a million lights that lead us on the way
The more we follow them we fall in love
So get us home

Say what you mean
Do what you will
Brother you'll reach inside yourself tonight

On this is where we
Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we begin
On our way home

True hearts will wipe away the tears right from your eyes
There should be no more without the pain
The former things have passed away beyond
So get us home

Say what you mean
Do what you will
Brother you'll reach inside yourself tonight

On this is where we
Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we begin
On our way home
On this is where we
Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we begin
On our way home

On our way home, way home
On our way home, way home
On our way home
On our way home, way home
On our way
On our way home, way home

Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we begin
On our way home
On this is where we
Oh this is where we
Oh this is where we begin
On our way home

On our way home, way home
On our way home, way home
On our way home
On our way home, way home
On our way
On our way home, way home
