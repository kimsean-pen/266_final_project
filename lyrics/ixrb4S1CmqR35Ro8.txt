Oh, my stomach's tied in knots
I'm afraid of what I'll find if you wanna talk tonight
See the problem isn't you, it's me, I know
I can tell, I've seen it time after time
And I'll push you away
I get so afraid, oh, no

And I can't live without you now

I can't even live with myself
And I can't live without you now
And I don't want nobody else
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
'Cause I can't live without you
Oh, my stomach's tied in knots
I'm afraid of what I'll find if I see you again tonight
See the problem isn't you, it's me, I know
I do this every single time
I'll push you away
I get so afraid, oh, no
And I can't live without you now
I can't even live with myself
And I can't live without you now
And I don't want nobody else
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
Let's start again
Let's start again
I can't live without you
And I can't live without you now
I can't even live with myself
I can't live without you now
And I don't want nobody else
'Cause I can't live without you now
I can't even live with myself
And I can't live without you now
'Cause I don't want nobody else
Nobody else Nobody else

I can't live without you
