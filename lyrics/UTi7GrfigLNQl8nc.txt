I see you standing at the front of the land
Waiting for something I can't make out
But I wanna talk to you, to pull you aside
I wanna ask you to come with me tonight
I wanna stay by your side

While we untangle
World around
It's unfair
I'm hearing sirens
Calling me closer to you
There's no place I'd rather be
There's no place I'd rather be

There's no place I'd rather be
I feel myself with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I feel myself with you

You run your fingers through the palm of my hand
Pulling me closer, I'm drawn by your command
It's like I've seen you, like I've known you before
An intuition that this is where I belong
Standing with you in my arms

While we entangle
World around
It's unfair
I'm hearing sirens
Calling me closer to you
There's no place I'd rather be
There's no place I'd rather be

There's no place I'd rather be
I feel myself with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I feel myself with you
