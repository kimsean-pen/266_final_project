Just stop the act
You've been climbing on my back to weigh me down
But I adapt
Keeping you and all your baggage off the ground
You're not just another nail in my coffin
You're the box I'm laid to rot in
I'm all in
But don't be surprised if I don't make it out alive

So get a grip
You're losing it
Your time is fading fast
I won't waste another second picking you up when you're falling

Back away I'm anything but okay
What's the point of living if you're already dead?
So take the best of anything I have left
I won't waste my days hating myself to death

What's left to say?
I've been heading down this road, or so I'm told
Apparently I'm out of control
Apparently I'm about to explode
I never thought that I'd be giving you up
I never thought that I'd be giving you up
I never thought that you'd be holding me back
I never thought that you'd be holding me back

So get a grip
You're losing it
Your time is fading fast
I won't waste another second picking you up when you're falling

Back away I'm anything but okay
What's the point of living if you're already dead?
So take the best of anything I have left
I won't waste my days hating myself to death

There will be nothing left of you when I'm through
Because of you the air I breathe is suffocating
I won't waste another second on you
Picking you up when you fall

Back away I'm anything but okay
What's the point of living if you're already dead?
So take the best of anything I have left
I won't waste my days hating myself to death

So take the best of anything I have left
I won't waste my days hating myself to death
