our finds beneath the cloak of night
has our minds in control
we guard them with our weary eyes
and we watch them grow
when the time is right
and we're ready to begin
at the first tide
your patience's wearing thin

we scatter in the night
like scarlet red on winter white
melting into thin

the kind of which i came to be
after being swallowed whole
by offering a piece of me
to any given fool

we scatter in the night
like innocent sheets of white
spreading by the wind

she goes high
leaves no sound

they turn to us
they ask us why
who say they are to trust what we define
