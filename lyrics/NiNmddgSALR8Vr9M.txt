Somebody save me
I need a Jesus
Somebody save me
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

It's gonna explode
It's gonna explode
It's gonna explode
Every time I turn it up I think I'm gonna pop

Somebody save me
I'm lying in pieces
Somebody take me
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

The radio is here to stay
Turn it off and walk away
The radio is here to stay
Turn it off
Turn it off

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3

The radio is here to stay
Turn it off and walk away
The radio is here to stay
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
