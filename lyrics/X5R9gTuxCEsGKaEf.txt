She was the girl with the string around her neck
Hanging with the boy who could only give her less
It could be more if she learned to never expect
And now she's her and him, and then a baby next
The wedding bells won't ring, but she could care less
How you exist
When you're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)

He grew up drinking milk from the cow, from the farm
And was the trade his father's father's father's father
Made him go givin' back to his country
He gave his both knees, he's overseas to fight the disease
That's spreading fast over maps, and it don't look back
When you're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
When you're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)

It is a lion's science fiction wings
Just like a jolly dizzy for zero, one, three times
The size of the people that came before
Me and you and what we'd do for money
This greed and jealousy turn to need

See, I'm a man with a plan to use my hands
Touching yours, you're the girl who wanted more
Likely the story has faded from love to lie
The clover under your feet, a shooting star in the night
The people under your feet are shooting stars in the night
The people, all that you meet
They're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
Living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
They're living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
Living in a dreamworld (Dreamworld)
