I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me up, and cut me up
There's an empty space inside my heart where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free, I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart where the weeds take root
Tonight I'll set you free, I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what it is, just to see what is I can't kick the habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head, listen to your heart

We will shrink and be quiet as mice while the cat is away
Do what we want, do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart where the weeds take root
So now I set you free, I set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if, just to see what is
Put the lotus flower into my room
Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit, the darkness is beneath, I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head, listen to your heart
