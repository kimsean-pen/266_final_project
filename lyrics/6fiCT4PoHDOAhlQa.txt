Don't keep me any longer I can't hold my breath
It's cold beneath the water but I understand
At least we had a story, wasn't that the plan?
I always wear your sweater, please don't hold my hand
So can we call it over if I'm still beneath
The weight of primavera when you finally sneaked
Into my little bedroom when I had to pee
At least you said goodbye

Take me out tonight
I really want to know that it's alright
That maybe we could talk, I'll buy your flight
Don't tell me no

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)

I danced upon your table to your quiet laugh
You called me Miss America when you would pass
You're still beneath the pear tree every time I dream
Ognuno volar√°

Take me out tonight
I really want to know that it's alright
That maybe we could talk, I'll buy your flight
Don't tell me no

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)

I can't hide all the utter pain
I'm probably much too ashamed
I can't think of saying your name, I, I, I, I
I honestly feel I've not changed
I know when we met it was fate
I hope that you'll hold me again, I, I, I, I

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)
What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)
