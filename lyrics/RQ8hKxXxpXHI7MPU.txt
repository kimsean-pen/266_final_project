I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I tried to call my mother
But she didn't get where I was going
I called my boyfriend and he said
"Call me back a little later, baby"

I hung up the phone, I felt so alone
Started to feel a little pity
That's when I realized that
I gotta find the joy inside of me

I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here, yeah

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I'm gonna take off all my clothes
Look at myself in the mirror
We're gonna have a conversation
We're gonna heal the disconnection

I don't remember when it started
But this is where it's gonna end
My body is beautiful and sacred
And I'm gonna celebrate it

I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

All my life
(All my life)
I've been looking for
(I've been looking for)
Somebody else
(Else)
To make me whole

But I had to learn the hard way
True love began with me
This is not ego or vanity
I'm just celebrating me

I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

Sometimes I'm alone but never lonely
That's what I've come to realize
I've learned to love the quiet moments
The Sunday mornings of life

Where I can reach deep down inside
Or out into the universe
I can laugh until I cry
Or I can cry away the hurt

I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday

I'm having a private party
Ain't no body here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I'm having a private party
Ain't nobody here but
Me and my angels and my guitar singin'
Baby, look how far we've come here

I'm having a private party
Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah
