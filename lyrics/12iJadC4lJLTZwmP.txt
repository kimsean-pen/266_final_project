Tonight I fall from far below
I'm ready for
Dimension know, connection go
I'm highest from

Tonight I walk with matter gone
I'm ready for
Some mystery lost and died alone
I'm highest from

Tumbling Lights Come
Tumbling Lights Go
Tumbling Lights Come
Tumbling Lights Go

Tonight I call and shock the phone
Already gone
Dimension 'round the spirit fall
I'm highest...

Tumbling Lights Come
Tumbling Lights Go
Tumbling Lights Come
Tumbling Lights Go
