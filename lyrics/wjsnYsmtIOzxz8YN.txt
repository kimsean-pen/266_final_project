Yellow light on the wall
I can close my eyes and return
To the home i remember in a blur
Of sights and smells
And sounds of old

But it's not what i wanted to hold
When i learned that i would have something of my own

What is love if not violet
A beam of light on an autumn afternoon
That slowly fades to blue
I have always wanted you

When the summer goes long
When the water stays warm
I remember the faces of everyone i've loved
And the places i have lived
And the places i have visited

You're alive and i'm alive
You're a dream that i had when i was young
I'm alive and i'm okay
The air is light blue today
The air is light blue today
The air is light blue today
The air is light blue today
The air is light blue today

I want a place where i can stay warm
Deep inside my body of this earth
And a mouth that says soft things
Or just breathes in my ear
And a heart i can speak back to
For no one else to hear
