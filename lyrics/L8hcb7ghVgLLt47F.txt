It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm countin' all the moonlit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found

Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away
I saw her face and I could tell
My ghost had left the town as well

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found... I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found
I'm a little lost at sea

I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway
Baby, I'm a runaway train

Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long grey game
But maybe that's a good thing
Cause I will be found, I will be found
When my time comes down, I will be found
So I keep runnin' 'til my run is gone
Keep on ridin' 'til I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found
