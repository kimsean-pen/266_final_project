Ayy
We got London On Da Track
Ayy

Rose gold Rolex, who you are
They don't know, who you are
Vroom, adiós, I steer a foreign car, ho
Shawty mine, finesse her right out a barcode
She get clean like Windex when she want to
She read a nigga's texts when she want to
No tats up on your shirt, she'll never want you
Hop out the Benz coupe

Fuck me, suck me
L-O-V-E, do you love me?
In the tubby, poppin' bubbly
Smokin' musty, I love me
Love, lo-lo-love, love, love, love me
Fall deep in love, love, love with me
Baby girl come suck me and fuck me
Drankin' bubbly, we get thuggish and rugged

To the moon, you are
Don't you know who we are?
These women know who we are
Plenty Benjamins on me and my squad
When you a prince, nigga, your doors ajar
Actin' like you don't know who we are, but you do
I know you know who she was
Twerk it, babe, real slow, move your hips slow

Roll slow, roll slow, move shit
Lick your body while I give you a massage
Ain't talkin' Nicki, I'm 'bout to have a Ménage à...
Trois, on my face, all day
Hold up, got a K, 'bout to spray
Hold up, bust in her hair, Milky Way
Hold up, kick shit, Johnny Cage, yeah
Hold up, she the bomb like a damn grenade
Hold up, light skate, intake
Turnt, outta state, in state
Burnt out bitch, stop, ayy
You need, yeah, lessons, watch, bae (watch bae)
You thinkin', yeah, I'm broke, you need to, awake (fool)
A hundred, racks, three, a week (cash)
Say love the freaks, I count it, like geeks (yeah)
It's mounted, with tease
I ain't gotta remind these hoes

They know who we are
Do you know who we are?
These women know who we are
Plenty Benjamins on me and my squad
When you a prince, nigga, your doors ajar
Actin' like you don't know who we are, but you do
I know you know who she was
Twerk it, babe, real slow, move your hips slow

Money green like camouflage
STD, I'm takin' over your ward
Homegirl fine, body smooth and all
Planned on havin' more kids than God, damn
I draped up her closet, now she look like a Barbie
Now my drinks are clean, I fill 'em up with that oil
Bumped my self esteem and now I think I'm adored
Let me through the door or else I'll come through the walls (walls)
I haven't slide in days, for you
Treatin' myself like I got AIDS for you
I ain't fuck none of these girls like I got AIDS for you, ayy
I got nine lives, I'll blaze for you
I'll set it down in days for you
Shawty pubics, shave it
Her eyes hazel, too

Rose gold Rolex, who you are
They don't know, who you are
Vroom, adiós, I steer a foreign car, ho
Shawty mine, finesse her right out a barcode
She get clean like Windex when she want to
She the reason nigga's text when she want to
No tats up on your shirt, she'll never want you
Hop out the Benz coupe

Fuck me, suck me
L-O-V-E, do you love me?
In the tubby, poppin' bubbly
Smokin' musty, I love me
Love, lo-lo-love, love, love, love me
Fall deep in love, love, love with me
Baby girl come suck me and fuck me
Drankin' bubbly, we get thuggish and rugged
