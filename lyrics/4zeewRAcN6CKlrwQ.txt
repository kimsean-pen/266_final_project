I was standin' in the jungle, I was feeling alright
I was wanderin' in the darkness in the middle of the night
The moon began to shine, I saw a clearing ahead
But what's that goin' on? I think I'm out of my head

(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)

A hundred animals were gathered 'round this night
And they were singin' out a lovely song under the pale moonlight
I stood and stared for quite a while
Then a lion sang to me and smiled
"Come join us if you so desire"

They sang
(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
That's what they sang
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)
And then turned away
(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
That's what they sang
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)

I said, "Now, please, explain the meaning of this song you sing"
("Wondrous is our great Blue Ship
That sails around the mighty Sun
And joy to everyone that rides along")

Oh, they sang
(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
That's what they sang
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)
Oh, that's nice
And they danced

Pretty soon I knew the tune
And we sat and sang under the moon
And the jungle rang in joyful harmony

They sang
(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
That's what they sang
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)
And then turned away
(Chooka-chooka, hoo la ley)
That's what they sang
(Looka-looka, koo la ley)

Wondrous is our great Blue Ship
That sails around the mighty Sun
Joy to everyone that rides along
