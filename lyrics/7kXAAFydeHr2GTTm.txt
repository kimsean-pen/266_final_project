The Stars are bright tonight
And I am walking nowhere

I Guess I will be alright
Desire gets you nowhere

And you are always right
Admire you are so perfect

Take you as you are
Have you as you are
Take you as you are

I love you just the way you are
I have you just the way you are
I take you just the way you are
Does any' wanna love the way they are
Aaa aaa aaa

The Stars are bright tonight
A distance is between us
And I will be okay
The worst I've ever seen us

'II still I have my weaknesses
'II still I have my strength
'II still I have my ugliness

But I I I
I love you just the way you are
I have you just the way you are
I take you just the way you are
Does any' wanna love the way they are
Aaaa Aaaa Aaaa Aaaa Aaaaa
I love you just the way you are
I have you just the way you are
I'll take you just the way you are
Does any' wanna love the way they are
Aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa
