You will think you've seen me
You haven't seen nothing
I'm looking for something more than this
I'm feeling no limits
I'm seizing each minute
Don't wanna
Don't wanna just exist

Don't want my feet on the ground
Wanna feel the speed of sound
I want it now
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky

Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
I'm climbing, I'm rising

I'm striking like lightning
Write my name in skywriting
For all to see
I'll do something epic
And they won't forget it
Good enough's not good enough for me
I want the ride of my life

Want to reach the speed of light
Want it tonight
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles

And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
Never gonna make my way down
I'll make the galaxy my playground

It's gonna be one hell of a ride
I'll fly

Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
Ohhh
