Don't leave
Don't leave
I want you to realise when I'm gone.

My My, My My
You are the only thing I wanna own.

There's sugar on your soul
And your like no one I know
You're the life of another world.
You swallow me whole
With just a mumble, hello.
And it breaks my heart to love you
It Breaks my heart to love you.

Don't leave, Don't leave
When your lost in a moment, I'm home
I'll try, I'll try
To make you realise when I'm gone.

There's sugar on your soul
You're the life of another world.
Your the light from another world.
You swallow me whole
With just a mumble, hello.
And it breaks my heart to love you
It Breaks my heart to love you.

There's sugar on your soul.

There's sugar on your soul.

There's sugar on your soul
And your like no one I know
You're the life of another world.
You swallow me whole
With just a mumble, hello.
And it breaks my heart to love you
Breaks my heart to love you.
Don't leave, Don't leave.
I want you to realise when I'm gone.
