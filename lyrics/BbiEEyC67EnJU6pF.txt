Johnny's in the basement mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out, kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed book
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says, "The man, he say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A."
Look out, kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
Look out, kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hangin' 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters

Ah, get born, keep warm, short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out, kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles
