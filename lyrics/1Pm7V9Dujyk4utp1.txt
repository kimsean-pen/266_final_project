Everything that you say to your closest one
Makes you feel like a pain toward everyone
When the words are unkind, you'll regret the choice
For as long as you choose there may be rejoice

In the colour of day when you see the truth
Take a step to the front to the brunt of youth
Understand what they mean when they say the words
When sorry is said, feel it to your bones
