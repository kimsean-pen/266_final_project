Light is fading, it's jagged, I'm shattered back home
Light is fading away and the [?] won't go

Make the sound
Make the sound

Mess of wires in my eyes and they're closing on me
Throw yourself in the fire 'cause you're [?]

Make the sound
Make the sound

Like the cannibal silence
Dragging on for so long
Let them preach only violence
Tired of losing, tired of losing, tired of losing

Nothing left but the hole in my soul after you
All you have doesn't carry away the things you should leave behind

Make the sound
Make the sound

Like the cannibal silence
Dragging on for so long
Let them preach only violence
Tired of losing, tired of losing

Like the cannibal silence
Dragging on for so long
Let them preach only violence
And it feels so long
And it feels so long
And it feels so long
And it feels so long
Tired of losing, tired of losing, tired of losing
Tired of losing, tired of losing
