All my love was lost
In a sea of light
All of my soul was gone
In the darkest night

In a way you were on my side
And I will hold you when all is done
But the weight stays on my mind
For I've been told, to carry it on
Carry it on

Slow down, closer now
Did I pass you by?
Go, go, run to the sound
Where the pretty girls fly

In a way you were on my side
And I will hold you when all is done
But the weight stays on my mind
For I've been told, to carry it on
I'll carry it on
