Skylarking, skylarking
That's what youths do today
Skylarking, skylarking
Before they stand up firm on their feet

Get a little work, a little work
And earn their bread honestly

Beggin' you a five cent, sir
Beggin' you a ten cent, sir
Cannot help, no, cannot help

So if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up up in chains

Beggin' you a five cent, sir
Beggin' you a ten cent, sir
Cannot help, no, cannot help

So if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up up in chains
So if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up up in chains

Skylarking, skylarking
That's what youths do today
Skylarking, skylarking
Before they stand up firm on their feet
