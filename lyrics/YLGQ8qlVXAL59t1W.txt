Yeah
Bitch hit me when I was on my way to this mothafucka
She was like, nigga, "Meet me at the mall"
I'm like shit, bitch
Bitch whatchu gonna buy me?
You know what I'm sayin', bitch?

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

I might pull in that Benz and your fist blows
Cut so clean I make the bitch take of her shoes
Drippin' water nothing monkey on my jewels
Give me good brain but that pussy do the fool
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
All my smokers smoke it on the spot and get they shit to go

Had them left on Long Beach out them bricks up and let them low
I played withe their cages
Liek Scarface on the Banana boat

I jumped off the porch and jump straight on the plane
Smokers on that D block kept a nigga paid
Gucci on my runners put that on the gang
I know some famous rappers snitchin' I won't say no names

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

Buckingham Palace with the palates on, I'm high as fuck
15 grams of yayo on the table, bitch come line 'em up
Brought 2 pounds of killer on my tour bus, but that ain't enough
She want my committee
Throw that pussy, but that ain't enough

Ain't enough, bitch you lame as fuck
Heard yo' nigga Siggy rode the bitch while I was layin' up
4 AM your ho be stayin' up and still be waiting up
My racks so loud I wake the neighbors up
I'm whippin' babies up like

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

Buckle coat, buckle coat
