Girl, that should be me driving to your house
Knocking on your door, kissing you on the mouth
Holding on your hand, dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start

But now when I see you with him, it tears my world apart

Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

Girl, that should be me calling on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go

I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes

But now when I see you with him my whole world falls apart

Because I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first

First touch (first touch), first kiss (first kiss)
First girl who made me feel like this (like this)
Heartbreak (heartbreak), it's killing me (k-k-killin' me)
I loved you first, why can't you see?

I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
Nothing could be worse

Baby, I loved you first

Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing.
That's what hurts the most
Girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah

Baby, I loved you first
