In the desert of unknown tales
Gold temples of war disgrace
From the secret vault of Holy Power
Magnified field blasting tower
Psychotronic weapons are being used on you!
All of you!

You'll never notice the effects of the waves
But soon enough it will reach into your brain
The frequencies will make you fit in a frame
You will become a modulated social slave

Aim for masses

Deep inside an obscure tunnel
Circling around an underground channel
Machiavellian accelerator
All controlled by the lords of terror
Psychotronic weapons are daily use on you!
Yes it's true!

Why?
Such a coincidence, no evidence, nor signs of a crime
Why?
Of course no one survived, witness suicides, all proofs denied
Why?
An Iconspiracy, why can't you see, I'm blind but I foresee
Why?!

Lies!
Everything's rigged from within
You'll never win, and you don't decide
Lies!

Another act of god triggered by satellite
Instant starvation and the world to divide
A new imposter got elected overnight
But Psychotron keeps us focused on our lives
