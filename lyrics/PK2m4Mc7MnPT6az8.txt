Noisy in my head.
Voice rings like a bell.
And try as I might, I cannot forget. Try as I might I cannot love you less.
Say how long you'll stay.
Wrapped up in the hour.
Marking up to the day.
Maybe we both, knew it all the time. Maybe we both, knew it at the time.

Well, I don't know about you, but for me, it's a bell. The passin' of measures.
But for me, it's a bell. All of life's little pleasures.
And I feel your takin' away the most he can from our lazy days.

Maybe we both...
Maybe we both...
Maybe we both...
Knew it at the time.
Maybe we both, knew it at the time.
Maybe we both knew it at the time.
