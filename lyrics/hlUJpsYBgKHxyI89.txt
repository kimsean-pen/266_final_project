Clinging to love, escape a father and mother
She offers some other way out of the whole
She's overachieving, chasing her dreams
And comedy slowly, it's out of control

It's time to glow, lose your way
Flash deep inside out
It's time to glow, lose your way
To make you feel better just forget these new words

All of the books and all in a boat and
Nowhere to run, God, this is out of control
You wait for something to undo these feelings
Waiting and waiting but, it's out of control

It's time to glow, lose your way
Flash deep inside out
It's time to glow, lose your way
To make you feel better just forget these new words

You're never losing life
No, you're never losing life

You're never losing life
No, you're never losing life
