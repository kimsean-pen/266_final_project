While you're watching from the window waiting
I've been spilling my guts out on the stage
I spent the best years of my life
Drinking myself to sleep at night
And now the glory days have all but faded
Everyone I used to know is jaded
Where is the passion that you used to have
When music was the only thing that you had?

All my pictures have faded over time
I burnt the negatives of you
What have I got here left to prove?
Cause all I got, all I really got is this music that's left of me
And all I want, all I really want is a reason to believe

Some day I know that I'll be fading
Everyone I used to know is getting afraid, afraid, afraid of getting older
And every heart I love grows colder
I love when time slips by
I'm not afraid to die
Remember the passion that you used to have
When music was the only thing that you had
This still is the only thing that, that is worth my breath
This still is the only thing that, that is worth my breath

All my pictures have faded over time
I burnt the negatives of you
What have I got here left to prove?
Cause all I got, all I really got is this music that's left of me
And all I want, all I really want is a reason to believe

I've been trying so hard to make the best of my time
Instead of waiting around hoping that someday I'll find
All the things that I need and all the love that I get
Wasted till all the days become numb again

All my pictures have faded over time
I burnt the negatives of you
All my pictures have faded over time
I burnt the negatives of you
What have I got here left to prove?
All I got, all I really got is this music that's left of me
And all I want all I really want is a reason to believe
