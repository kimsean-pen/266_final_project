Console me when you want control
Roll me in those lies you've told

(Don't run and hide, stand up and fight)
I'm feeling like just letting go
(It's shaking your mind with cause and divide)
It's taking everything I know
(Don't run and hide, stand up inside)
The wheels keep burning
I'm about ready to blow

When I get angry, I feel weak
And hear these voices in my head
Telling me to fall beneath
Cause they'll make everything okay
How did I get here?
Everything's unclear
I never meant to cause you pain
Give me a reason I can believe in
I need it all this time
Send me a lifeline

Wave if it makes you look good
Smile when you feel like you should
It's hard not to treat this like I could
Heaven help me, it's overwhelming
