Mirror in the bathroom
Please talk free
The door is locked
Just you and me.
Can I take you to a restaurant
That's got glass tables
You can watch yourself
While you are eating.

Mirror in the bathroom
I just can't stop it,
Every Saturday you see me
Window shopping.
Find no interest
In the racks and shelves
Just ten thousand reflections
Of my own sweet self, self, self...

Mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom...

Mirror in the bathroom
Recompense
For all my crimes
Of self defense.
Cures you whisper
Make no sense
Drift gently into
Mental illness.

Mirror in the bathroom
Please talk free
The door is locked
Just you and me.
Can I take you to a restaurant
That's got glass tables
You can watch yourself
While you are eating.
