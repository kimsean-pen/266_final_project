Okay

Never thought that I could take these steps
But I kept the focus on myself
I feel that I am heating up
Fuming myself to the top

Many people I shall leave behind
Focus on the ones who've stayed beside
Cause even though I know I'm small
Not too short to reach it all

I am feeling the heat
Leaving my skin
I can't fight off the
I let it in

Let's be one of those who set the sails
Take a risk even though we could fail
But I am willing to set fire
Just to get what I desire

I am feeling the heat
Leaving my skin
I can't fight off the
I let it in
I am feeling the heat
Leaving my skin
I can't fight off the
I let it in

Oh I see my friend
It is getting out of hand

This is
Feel the heat
I'm on fire
Can you feel the heat

This is my
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(Feeling the heat)
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(I'm on fire)
(Feeling the heat)
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(I'm on fire)
(Feeling the heat)
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(I'm on fire)
(Feeling the heat)
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(I'm on fire)
(Feeling the heat)
(Can you feel the heat?)
(This is my)
(I'm on fire)
