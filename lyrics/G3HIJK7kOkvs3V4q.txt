You're my disintegration!
(You're my disintegrati-)-on!
(You're my disintegration)

My salvation or my damnation?
Disintegration of everything I am
(Disintegrate)
(Disintegrate)

Rotate, I separate from the comfort of reality
Fixation feeding intoxication, locks me to your gravity

Stimulate! Resonate! Activate!
(You're my disintegration)

My salvation or my damnation?
Disintegration of everything I am

Seduction in your atmosphere
Siren sings a song divine
Although I know the more that I draw near, I fear
The more you steal my life â€“ my disintegration
(Disintegrate)
