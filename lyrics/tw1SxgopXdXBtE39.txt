Spice girls, dark child
Let's dance
Ooh
We could have had it all
But you turned your back

It started with dreams
It started a team
But you weren't as true as you always seem
You promised to love
No matter what
Yet you turned your back and walked out on me

What made you think
That without me
Your life would be so much better but now you see
That's without me
Your hopes and dreams
Will never be as good as what you had with me

So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way

You never thought
That I would find out
All of the things you said about us
When you're the one who
Decided to
Erase all our plans and said you are through

What made you think
That without me
Your life would be so much better than now you see
That's without me
Your hopes and dreams
Will never be as good as what you had with me

Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way

Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way

Now tell me was it
Your plan all along
To try and use me
And then let go
Now where is the trust
We had between us
I guess that you never played by the rules

(Can you tell me?)
Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way

Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way

Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
And we try, we try
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
But we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
