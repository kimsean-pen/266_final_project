You're a fucking poser, that's all you'll ever be!
Don't get any closer, or you'll meet the real me!
I am who I am, you can't destroy me!
I am what I am, you can't deny me!

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and break me down, but I won't let you win.
You can call me out, but I know you're a pretender.
You may think you're god, but I know that I am sin!

I am SIN! I am SIN!
I am SIN! I am SIN!

I won't fucking buy it!
I never have and I never will!
Keep fucking trying!
I'm just waiting for the blood to spill!

You are, who you are, I can't explain it!
You are, what you are, to me you're not shit.
No!

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and break me down, but I won't let you win.
You can call me out, but I know you're a pretender.
You may think you're god, but I know that I am sin!
I am SIN!

If there was ever a time you needed to walk the fuck away,
It's right fucking now, right fucking here!

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and break me down, but I won't let you win.
You can call me out, but I know you're a pretender.
You may think your god, but I know that I am sin!

I am SIN! I am SIN!
I am SIN! I am SIN!
