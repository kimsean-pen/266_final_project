Listen baby, baby listen
I know I was wrong
I made you leave
Trouble, oh I was in trouble
If I told you how, would you believe

But your eyes see right into my soul
That's how I feel
Here with you I lose my self-control

It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here by my side
It's gonna rain anyway
All I want to do is to move my body with your body
I can't wait until the storm is over
It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here

Don't stop, honey, honey don't stop
I just wanna dance, dance with you
Let's go honey, honey let's go
Leave the bags behind
My dream came true

Something's going on inside of me
Because, you see
Something in your eyes has set me free

It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here by my side
It's gonna rain anyway
All I want to do is to move my body with your body
I can't wait until the storm is over
It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here

I just got to get strong again
I can't run away from all the pain
I'll find strength and race into the rain
To the rain
Anyway

It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here by my side
It's gonna rain anyway
All I want to do is to move my body with your body
I can't wait until the storm is over
It's gonna rain anyway
Nothing matters now that you're here
It's gonna rain
Oh, it's gonna rain
