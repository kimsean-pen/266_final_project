Eyes on the water
Between the continents
This is Laurasia
It smells so different

A strong breeze blows out here
The ocean is pitch black
Let's not seek shelter
I wanna freeze and smell your neck

Soon every one of us will be dead
In the great scheme of things
It makes no difference

It's all the same
But let's not get sentimental...

Eyes on the water
Between the continents
This is Gondwana
It smells so different

A cold wind blows out here
The sea's already dead
Let's get in the water
Let our bodies be the last

Feel the cold
Feel the night
Creep up to me
Let's stop and wait
Until we freeze together
And rest like this forever
Creep inside my bones
Where you have lied
Since the day that we were born
Since the day that we were born

Sea level rise:
We'll be among the 5 percent
We'll survive the Great Dying
There is no denying
As the chosen few...
Because that's all we've got to know
And that's all you gotta know

I am not here but you can
Still write me
Like in the beginning
You're no longer next to me
But this is
How it's always been:
You were a ghost
Before you became real
That's how we got to know
That's how we got to know

Now that you are not here
Now that we no longer talk
I can't stop to remember
How you've been offended
When you realized
That I'd kill to relieve a load
Yes I'd kill to relieve a burden

Feel the cold creep inside
I am losing you to your fears
Grown way out of scale
Yes it's true what they say:
I don't love humanity
Not a bit
But I do value empathy
While retaliating iniquities

Sea level rise:
It's the beginning of the Great Dying
Soon it will be over
Long time to recover:
30 million years
Yes I'd kill to relieve the load
Yes I'd kill to relieve a burden

I am not here but you can
Still write me
Like in the beginning
You're no longer next to me
But this is how it's always been:
You were a ghost
Before you became real
That's how we got to know
That's how we got to know

Contemplating, trouble making
Even now... the air is getting hot and dry
Sticking to your skin and your open wounds
The sun burns us alive
That's how we got to know
That's how we got to know
That's how we got to know
