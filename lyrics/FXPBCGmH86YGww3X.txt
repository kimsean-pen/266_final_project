This girl moved into my apartment (One day)
One look at her my heart was stopping (Heartbreak)
I did whatever she was asking
She said "maybe later catch you in the elevator"

A couple days we got to hanging (Real close)
Turns out she wasn't even taken (No no)
I made a move she said "baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon"

She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why, tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl

I should've known to walk away then
I should've left it alone
But when she called me on the phone we'd be hanging again
Under the premise of friends
But now she only talks to me about some other woman
She says

She got that smile
And that body is to die for
One of a kind
And that's why it makes me cry

'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why, tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
I found a girl
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

I can't believe I met somebody like you
And now I feel like a fool
Anatomy is so cruel
I can't believe it I just think like a man
That you just wanted me bad
But you had different plans

'Cause I found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why, tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl

Found a girl
Who's in love with a girl
She said, that she tried
But she's not into guys
Oh, why, tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice
But she's not into guys
I found a girl
