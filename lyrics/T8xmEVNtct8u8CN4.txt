I don't wanna feel down
'cause my name is gettin' around
I said the whole world is lettin' me down now
'cause I don't know where I'm bound
yes, I guess I'm goin' down, down, down
and I feel I'm gonna drown
yeah, I guess I'm goin' down, down, down
and I feel I'm gonna drown
once I used to be high
now all my friends pass me by
I got teardrops in my eye
somebody else got all the smile
because I guess im goin' down, down, down
and I feel im gonna drown
I guess im goin' down, down, down
and I feel im gonna drown
