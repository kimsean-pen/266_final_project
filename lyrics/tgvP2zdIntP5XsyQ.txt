Hearts gone astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away, just when you, you need me so
You won't regret, i come back beggin' you
Won't you forget, welcome love we once knew
Open up your eyes then you realize
Here i stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show
The way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine, it's eternal love
When ever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'll have our very own everlasting love
Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever
Open up your eyes then you realize

Here I stand with my everlasting love

Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love...(fading)
