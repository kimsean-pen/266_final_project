I am an ex offender
They let me out in the Summer
I think I was in a coma
I didn't know what to do
Oh no

You go hang around go round
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the Bugman
You go hang around around
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the Bugman

I got no sent of existence
I know the nodding dogs
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah

You go hang around around
I watch myself look out
Look out for the Bugman
You go hang around around
I watch myself hang on
Look out for the Bugman

The bu uh uh ug man

I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah
la la la la la oh oh...

I go out in the city
I go out in the city

I stay away from the buh uh bugs...
