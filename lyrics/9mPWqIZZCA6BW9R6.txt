I got a woman
With plenty of money
She got the money
And I got the honey
Called my baby
Late last night
She told me
Daddy everything
Was all right

She got the money
And I got the honey
She got the money
And I got the honey
She got the money
And I got the honey

I don't have to worry
About her she's real fine
I know my baby
And she's all mine
She give me a cadillac
A diamond ring
She told me daddy
Don't you worry bout a thing

She got the money
And I got the honey
She got the money
And I got the honey
She got the money
And I got the honey

She's all mine
And I'm so glad
She's the best woman
That I ever had
She's all mine
And I'm so glad
She's all mine
And I'm so glad
She's all mine
And I'm so glad

Ah, stop your train
Ah, mama stop your train
