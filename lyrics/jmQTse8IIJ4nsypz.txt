Friday night you and your boys went out to eat (Uunnhh)
Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out (Aannh)
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 2-1-3
Show up on your caller ID?

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

I have been through all of this before (I've been through all this before)
So how would you think (Don't think about, don't think about it)
That I could stand around and take some more? (Get goin', get gone)
Things are gonna change (Things are goin' to change baby)

'Cos I don't wanna be a fool anymore (You don't stand no chance, boy)
That's why you have to leave (I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh)
So don't turn around to see my face (Don't turn around)
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that?
Tell me
Was it really worth you going out like that?
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back (Yeah)
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me

It's not right, but it's okay (It's not right, it's okay)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeahhh)
Pack your bags up and leave (Close the door and leave your keys)
Don't you dare come running back to me (I'd rather be alone than unhappy)
It's not right, but it's okay (It's not right, it's okay baby)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I can pay my own rent)
Close the door behind you (Pay my light bills)
Leave your key (Take care of my business)
I'd rather be alone (Oh, oh)
Than unhappy (Ohhh)
