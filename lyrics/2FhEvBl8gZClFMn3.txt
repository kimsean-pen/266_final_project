As I walking through the shadows of the night
A black raven screams, he's ready for the fight
And I feel the change, the change from white to black
The wolf in me is going to attack

Soon, it will be the end
My life's a waste, let the morning be my friend

Above the stars there is a place called paradise
I hope that one day I will make it there, somehow
But with this creature in me living its own life
I'm not sure I'll have the right to have a peaceful afterlife

It all starts again, the evil voices in my head
They are here to stay when the night is closing in
As a thunderstorm, blazing fire in the sky
Takes me to the danger zone, I wonder why

Without a halo on my head
I hope the morning light will save me once again

Above the stars there is a place called paradise
I hope that one day I will make it there, somehow
But with this creature in me living its own life
I'm not sure I'll have the right to have a peaceful afterlife

Without a halo on my head
I hope the morning light will save me once again

Takes me to the danger zone
Without a halo on my head

I'm not sure I'll have the right to have a peaceful afterlife

Above the stars there is a place called paradise
I hope that one day I will make it there, somehow
But with this creature in me living its own life
I'm not sure I'll have the right to have a peaceful afterlife

Above the stars there is a place called paradise
I hope that one day I will make it there, somehow
But with this creature in me living its own life
I'm not sure I'll have the right to have a peaceful afterlife
