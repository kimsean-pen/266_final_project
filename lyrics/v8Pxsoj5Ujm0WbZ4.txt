In my defence all my intentions were good
And heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
You know I'd give you blood if it'd be enough
Devil's on my doorstep since the day I was born
Its hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
But I'm a dreamer by design and I know in time we'll put this behind

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, "I made my own mistakes"
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

Behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
And lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
Cause I've been crucified for just being alive
Somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
Seems that I've forgot just what I was fighting for
But underneath my skin there's a fire within
Still burning
For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, "I made my own mistakes"
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

The first bird to fly gets all the arrows
Lets leave the past behind with all our sorrows
I'll build a bridge between us and I'll swallow my pride

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, "I made my own mistakes"
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth
