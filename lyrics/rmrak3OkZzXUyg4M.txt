So here we are again at the start,
Lets get stuck.
These rooms are all reminders of you.

Your feelings aren't in touch
with the words that are coming out of your lungs.

Calm now, lets both cool off.
We've both said things that we are not proud of.

How did we get so tired.
Those pills were no good for you.
They've turned you into something you are not,
something I just can't stop.

I'll wait.

For you to come back home.
Forget about all that keeps me from you.
This house built from bricks and stone
stands as a monument to the lies we told.

How did we get so tired.
Those pills were no good for you.
They've turned you into something you are not,
something I just can't stop.

I'll wait.

For you to come back round again
and fall in to our bed.
