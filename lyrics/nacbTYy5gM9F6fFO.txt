Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD

Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and I will show you something

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD

Turn around, have faith in all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Beyond The Invisible, Prism of Life
The Child In Us, Gravity of Love
Morphing Thru Time

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD

Turn around, you're feeling all the changes
Turn around and you will feel
No more age of loneliness
You are a part of me

Principles of Lust, The Eyes of Truth, TNT for the Brain

Ne irascaris, Domine - Ne irascaris, Domine
Ne irascaris, Domine - Ne irascaris, Domine

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD

Turn around and I will show you something
Turn around and you will see
Life is like a roundabout, a kind of LSD
