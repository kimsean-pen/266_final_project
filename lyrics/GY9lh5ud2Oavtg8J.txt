There's ice in my water
And when I drink, it cuts my tongue
There's glass on the playground
It cuts my skin when I run

And from the dark, into the light
I saw a star burst into life
And in the corner of your eye
I saw a dream that never died

Speak to me, speak to me
With love in your words
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe

My body falls off the side of her bed
And now I know what love feels like
Don't let me turn into pain
All of this is loveliness

Chaos came, we laid our head
Down on the feather cotton bed
You find a heart and catch your breath
Let the universe go red

Speak to me, speak to me
With love in your words
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe

Hm, hm, hm, hm hm hm
Hm, hm hm, hm, hm hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm hm hm
Hm, hm hm, hm, hm hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm hm hm
Hm, hm hm, hm, hm hm
Wooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Speak to me, speak to me
With, with
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe

Soft universe
Soft, soft universe
Soft universe
Soft, soft universe
Soft universe
Soft, soft universe
Soft universe
Soft, soft universe

Soft universe
