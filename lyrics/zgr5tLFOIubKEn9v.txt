Yea, Phife
For your life

Now, in the time when niggas wasn't supposed to be gone
That's the place left for dead, and cities end up war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that ass just for running through their lawn
Watch that shallow shallow man walk
Trinidadian love sprout into the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, the silver lining and joy
It's a bouncing baby boy, a king's name they would enploy
And before he even squeaks it's decided it's Malik
Now, give him hope, give him care, raise him while his grandma there
Watch out mama, if you stare [?] keep him there
Let's progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fist
Sometimes overbearing, though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spastic shit and cinematic we documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times, fight it out
Made race face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out
Damn

Have you ever
Lost somebody
(Phife dawg, man)
Way before you
(Bow wow, woof woof)
Got to dream
No more crying
He's in sunshine

Never thought that I would ever be writing this song
Hold friends tight, never know [?]
Soul so beautiful, [?] indisputable
Heart of the largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took the grip to Granny's house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans leak, I's never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue upstairs
Mailbox, bears, all our rhymes was never there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn't care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I'mma flash forward, well took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I'm at
Standing on the side of black, Malik Izaak

Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream
No more crying
He's in sunshine
He's alright now
See his wings
Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream
No more crying
He's in sunshine
He's alright now
See his wings
Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream
No more crying
He's in sunshine
He's alright now
See his wings
Have you ever
Lost somebody
Way before you
Got to dream
No more crying
