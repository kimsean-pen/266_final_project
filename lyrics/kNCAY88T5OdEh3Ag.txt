Don't go, so slow
You're wasting time
You're right, I'm wrong
We're still tongue-tied

Lately, have you ever wondered why we're put here?
Playing each and every game
Day by day

We're stuck, now look
We've got it down
Dig deep, you're cheap
So help me out

Lately, have you ever wondered why we're put here?
Playing each and every game
Day by day

Lately, have you ever wondered why we're stood here?
Will we do it all again
Every day?
