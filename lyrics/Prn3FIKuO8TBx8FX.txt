It all started with a stumble
And I get old and I get humble
The sky cracked a million ways
Making me blind

And as the trees grew higher and higher
And the fish began to fly
I went and stole some wings
And thought why can't I

Get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise

Put the world upon your shoulder
I'll stay young while I watch everyone getting older
You can take a million years
Out of my head

But I'm starting to lose my place
In the circles that I trace
And if I let go only then
Will my face

Get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise
