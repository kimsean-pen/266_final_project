No sir I ain't been drinkin'
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whisperin' in my ear

Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doin' my best

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say "girl take it easy"
She laughs, says "it'll be fine"
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines

Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control

All over the road
Somethin' 'bout these wheels rollin'
Radio playin' gets her goin'
I'm tryin' to get her home as fast as I can go

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee

Have a little mercy on me
Sir I'm sorry I know
I'm all over the road
All over the road
All over the road
