You're walking up with your eyes on me
It's looking good but I just don't know
I need a girl who can keep her head
All night long
You didn't come just to see the show
I guess you know what you wanna see
The way you smile let's me know I can't go wrong

Wanna touch you, wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

I saw you standing down by the stage
Your black stockings and your see-through dress
Your mouth is open but I don't wannna hear you
Say good night
You're sorta young but you're over age
I don't care 'cause I like your style
Don't know about your brain but you look alright

I wanna touch you, wanna feel you
Wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

Your mind is dirty but your hands are clean
You're short of class but your legs are long
I know I can't stand another night
On my own

Hey girl, would you like some wine?
What's your name? Are you by yourself?
Are you the one, what's your sign, can I take you home?

Wanna touch you, wanna feel you
Wanna make you mine

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long

I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long...
