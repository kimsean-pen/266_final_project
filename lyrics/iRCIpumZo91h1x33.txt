...You're everything I want
And I am everything you need
This night is cutting in to me
You tie me down, you watch me bleed
And we risk everything
Tonight

I, I am the misery you crave
And you, you are my faithful enemy
This hunger seems to feed on me
Our secrets and our dying
Risk everything

They can never know just what we've done
And I can never know that what we've done
They will never know all the blood we've she'd
The spotted course we've led until the bitter end
They can never know just what we've done

Nothing good will come of this
I'm screaming out with my untaken breath
I'll be yours until my dying day
I can never see you bleed

We knew how this would end
And we, we would die before we'd live
But I'll never let you go!
I will never let you go!

They will never know all the blood we've she'd
The spotted course we led until the bitter end
They can never know just what we've done
(I will never let you go)
They can never know just what we've done
(I'll never let you go)

You knew how this would end
