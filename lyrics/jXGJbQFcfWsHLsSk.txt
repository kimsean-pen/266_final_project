You're the veil in the morning blue
I couldn't sleep, I was thinking
Of you, of you
You'll be the keeper of trees and light
The elemental residing
With a cool wind blowing

Keep something back
Something back
Keep something back
Something back
Beast that never was
Here between two worlds

You threw the arrows, you threw the knife
They spun around and went back in
To you, to you
Shimmering in the full moon's path
All blood and rhythm, you're running
Through trees, to me

Keep something back
Something back
Keep something back
Something back
Beast that never was
Here between two worlds

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh

Do the love thing, your hands tied
Pull your mind, if you see

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh
