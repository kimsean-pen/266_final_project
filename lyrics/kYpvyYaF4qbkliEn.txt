I've been waiting
Give me a sign
There's nothing left to face
Only the time
I see shadows
Devils, decline
I've lost my faith in us
Found my design

So now
Where is the enemy?
I can feel no bite
Where is the enemy
When death is on my side?

Something building
Raging inside
This hope gave me release
Gave me a why
Can't shake this ground beneath
I came to fight

So now
Where is the enemy?
I can feel no bite
Where is the enemy
When death is on my side?
Where is the enemy?
I can feel no bite
Where is the enemy
When death is on my side?

Consuming victory
The trumpets calling out to me by name
By name
No looming debt for me
No, death his will find his aim to be in vain
In vain

So now
Where is the enemy?
I can feel no bite
Where is the enemy
When death is on my side?
