Hey
Oh yeah

You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches
You can't make me think like you, mundane
I've got a message for all those who think that
They can etch these words inside my brain
Inside my brain!
No way!

T.V., what do I need?
Tell me who to believe!
What's the use of autonomy
When a button does it all?
When a little button does it all
Does it all

So listen up, glisten up closely all
Who've seen the fuckin' eye ache too
It's time to step away from cable train
And when we finally see the subtle light
This quirk in evolution will begin
To let us live and recreate
Recreate!
Oh yeah!

T.V., what do I need?
Tell me who to believe!
What's the use of autonomy
When a button does it all?

T.V., what should I see?
Tell me who should I be?
Let's do our mom a favor and drop
A new god off a wall
uhhhh ahhh ohhhh
uhhhh ahhh ohhhh

Let me see past the fatuous knocks
I've gotta rid myself of this idiot box!
Let you see past the feathers and flocks
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box!

From the depths of the sea
To the tops of the trees
To the seat of a lazy boy...
Staring at a silver screen!

T.V., what do I need?
Tell me who to believe!
What's the use of autonomy
When a button does it all?

T.V., what should I see?
Tell me who should I be?
Let's do our mom a favor and drop
A new god off a wall
Wall!
