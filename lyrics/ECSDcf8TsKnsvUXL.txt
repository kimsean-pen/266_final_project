Black and white
The colors unite
And it should end now
But inside you fight

It's one by one
And it's a tunnel til the sky is brown
And all had lost
You're taken by surprise

Oh
Such a beautiful fall
Oh
And it's moving me too

It's one by one
And it's a tunnel til the sky is brown
And all had lost
You're taken by surprise

Oh
Such a beautiful fall
Oh
And it's moving me too

And it's one step back through the ocean
And one step back through the bottom of the sea
And it's one step back through the ocean
And one step back through the bottom of the sea
And it's one step back through the ocean
And one step back through the bottom of the sea
And it's one step back through the ocean
And one step back through the bottom of the sea

Oh
Such a beautiful fall
Oh
And it's moving me too

Oh
Such a beautiful fall
Oh
And it's moving me too
