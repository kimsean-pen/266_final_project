You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone
Pick up the phone
To hear my swan song

I'll admit I'm impressed
By your vanishing act
Place your bets on your best guess
Of when you're coming back

Draw the curtains
Take the stage
Smoke and mirrors underway
Hold your breath here comes the turn
This is where we all got burned

Promises are broken
Tell me are you happy now
Drowning in the hourglass
I guess our time ran out

You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone
Pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone
I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong

Should I turn on the floodlights
To shine in your eyes
Just to get you to speak
And explain why you let it die
This new chapter in your life
Read it over once or twice
Burn the pages not the bridge
Sew your wounds without a stitch

Promises are broken
Tell me are you happy now
Drowning in the hourglass
I guess our time ran out

I hope you're listening

You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone
Pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone
I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong

Tell me where we all went wrong
Tell me where

Tell me where
Tell me where
Abandon the people who shaped who you are
Selfish and thoughtless, you drown in the dark

I hope that you realise the damage you've done
You could not see light even staring at the sun
Promises are broken
Tell me are you happy now

Drowning in the hourglass
I guess our time ran out
You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone
Pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone
I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong
Tell me where we went wrong
Tell me where we went wrong
You don't even bother anymore.
