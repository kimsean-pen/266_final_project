There at these ominous shores of river Saone
There at these shores the die has been cast
Valour and honour were stripped off their meaning
We will not know innocence again

This dead black night
Our destiny revealed
Meet the enemy
It will... never be the same

It's not us to go under the Yoke.

We will not bow
Meet the enemy
Meet the liar
Meet the enemy
