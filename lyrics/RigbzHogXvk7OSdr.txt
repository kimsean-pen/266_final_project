Here I am again
Wandering
What road will take me where
I'm not turning back
Not this time
How high can I go？
I'm not coming down
Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know what's begun
I will find my higher ground
So close I could touch a star
Oh so long, oh so long
So long left to go
Searching for my higher ground
If I fall, please catch me now
I know it's alright
Here with you
Here with you

Here I am again
Wandering
What road will take me where
戻れない夜や日々に
How high can I go？
すがれないなら
Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know what's begun
憧れとhight ground
そこに意味はなくても
Oh so long, oh so long
So long left to go
手を伸ばした higher ground
今は届かなくても
I know it's alright
Here with you
Here with you

I will find my higher ground
So close I could touch a star
Oh so long, oh so long
So long left to go
Searching for my higher ground
If I fall, please catch me now
I know it's alright
I know it's alright
Here with you
Here with you

Here I am again
