Bless my heart
Bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to 22 years old
There must be someone up above sayin' "Come on Brittany

You got to come on up!"
You got to hold on

You got to hold on
So, bless my heart and bless yours too

I don't know where I'm gonna go, don't what what I'm gonna do
Must be somebody up above sayin' "Come on Brittany

You got to come on up!"
You got to hold on

You got to hold on
Yeah! You got to wait!
Yeah! You got to wait!
But, I don't wanna wait

I don't wanna wait
So, bless my heart
Bless my mind
I got so much to do, I ain't got much time

So, must be someone up above saying "Come on girl!
Yeah, you got to get back up!"

You got to hold on
You got to hold on
Yeah! You got to wait
I don't wanna wait
Well, I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
