Afterlife
Oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath
And the dirt
And the fires are burnt

And after all this time
And after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on
Are done hanging on
In the dead light
Of the afterglow

I've gotta know
Can we work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?
Can we just work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?

Afterlife
I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you
Like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?

And after all this time
It's like nothing else
We used to know
And after all the hangers-on
Are done hanging on
In the dead light
Of the afterglow

I've gotta know
Can we work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?
Can we just work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?

But you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And where do we go?

And after this
Can it last through the night?
After all the bad advice
That had nothing at all to do with life

I've gotta know
Can we work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?
Can we just work it out
If we scream and shout
Till we work it out?

But you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say
Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?
Oh, we know it's gone
But where did it go?
Oh, we know it's gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Is this the afterlife?
It's just an afterlife
With you
It's just an afterlife
It's just an afterlife
With you
It's just an afterlife
