Long legs taking you somewhere
Catch your reflection in a window pane
The universe is startin' to feel ya
Drinking tequila like its the name of the game
Oh, oh, well I know it hasn't happened yet
You're relying on your next cheque
I know that you're a glamour puss
And your explanation's useless
So you choo-choo on the roof
In your beautiful high heeled shoes
Of Miss Glamour, Glamour Puss
Baby juggles fire in a blindfold
Riding a motorcycle through a hoola hoop
But it sounds like dust on your record
Showing the pressure after a loop to loop
To loop to loop to loop
Oh, oh, well I know it hasn't happened yet
You're relying on your next cheque
I know that you're a glamour puss
And my explanation's useless
So you choo-choo on the roof
In your beautiful high heeled shoes
Of Miss Glamour, Glamour Puss
Push a little longer, dance a little harder
Never give yourself away
Love a little less to keep yourself together
Everything will come your way
Push a little longer, dance a little harder
Never give yourself away
Love a little less to keep yourself together
Everything will come your way
Oh, oh, well you know it hasn't happened yet
You're relying on your next cheque
I know that you're a glamour puss
And my explanation's useless, useless
I know it hasn't happened yet
You're relying on the next cheque
I know that you're a glamour puss
And my explanation's useless
So you choo-choo on the roof
In your beautiful high heeled shoes
Of Miss Glamour, Glamour Puss
Of Glamour, Glamour Puss
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Of glamour, glamour
