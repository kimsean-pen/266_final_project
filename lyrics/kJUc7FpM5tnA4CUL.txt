Alright!
Basic answer
Kiss me in the dark
In between the light, and dust

Alright
Life in a basement
I'm trapped like a rat
Living with no shame
'Cause we know we are right
Call us useless deviants

Rapapapapa rats revolution
You've been waiting loo long
Now remember

That your life is shit
The only choice is the way of love
Only choice is the way of love

The only choice is the way of love
Never forget the way of love

Kicked me in the back, boy
Let's go up
Burn down the city

Alright!
The fire is so pure we're coming tonight
Destroying everything we're starting a fight
Rise up, strike back, represent

Rapapapapa rats revolution
You've been waiting loo long
Now remember

The only choice is the way of love
Only choice is the way of love

Never forget the way of love

Life is so pure I'm leaving tonight
Redemption, there's no turning back

Alright!
Feel insecure we're coming tonight
War is declared, we're starting a fight
Rise up, strike back, represent

Shut up and make love
Real heroes never die
