A lifetime of emptiness.

A landmine underfoot, a shining light, awash and lifting.
Tone burnt brain, whispering and wandering.
Flesh slabs stacked, in stance belonging.
Oculum hallucinantur.
Grasped at chance, baleful yearning.
The restlessness of pining servants.
Fidem mendaces, fidem stulti.

Shining light awash and stark shone against a black whippet trunk.
Beaming white, "All matter is just the devil crawling back to God."
Turn away and turn towards tone burnt beings crawling and probing.
Beaming white, All matter is just the devil crawling back to god.

Faith redoubled, distance standing.
Blistering against the miles of desert.
Spiritual deprivation, spiritual destruction.
No God or harmony. No bliss. No empathy.
Just a lifetime of emptiness and a belly of regret.
