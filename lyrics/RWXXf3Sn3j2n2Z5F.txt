They'll drop us broken and bleeding
On the rocks and sand
Seems half the world is fleeing
And word gets around
What caused your heart to turn?
What made you want to burn
It all down with as lie?
I know you'll feel the shout
Gagging your mouth with sound
This at least we must try

He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all
He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all

One must know when to take shelter, mother
And the time is now
One must know when to run for cover
And cheat death somehow
The patience of the knife surely won't suffice
One lie burns all
As every inaccurate word is strewn of the surface
Brace for the fall

He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all
He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all

Hold me now, I am breaking...

He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all
He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all

He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all
He who dares at all must dare it all
But now, hold me, I'm breaking
He who dares at all must dare all
