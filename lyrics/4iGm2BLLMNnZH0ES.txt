I am restless and I keep trembling
Everyone watch me as I descend
Into a feeling that's overwhelming me
I finally stopped
Stopped making sense

I can't stop talking to myself
I'm a desperate cry for help

Run, don't walk
The sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight
I'm so confused
I'm lost
I'm lost with you
I don't care
Where we are
Or where we're headed to
But I know I'm lost
I'm lost with you
With You

Your mouth keeps moving
But I've lost focus now
Clock keeps ticking, time's running out
Where we're headed, there is no heading back
Tripping ugly, I'm losing ground

I can't stop talking to myself
I'm a desperate cry for help

Run, don't walk
The sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight
I'm so confused
I'm lost
I'm lost with you
I don't care
Where we are
Or where we're headed to
But I know I'm lost
I'm lost with you
With You

For the record
When I'm with you
Things are looking better
For once
Everything is brighter
Than the darkness
Before you

Run, don't walk
The sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight
I'm so confused
I'm lost
I'm lost with you

Run, don't walk
The sky is falling through
Don't talk tonight
I'm so confused
I'm lost
I'm lost with you
I don't care
Where we are
Or where we're headed to
But I know I'm lost
I'm lost with you
