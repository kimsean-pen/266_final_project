Welcoming with open arms and, with open hearts
In the end they found their arms in shackles and their hearts torn out
This country named "America", is built on graves
Of the natives who lived here before, genocide took place

The word "America" means "Freedom" as in, "Free to kill the free"

Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me, for me

It's the same today as then, as U.S. dollars are spent
To rid the native insurgence in Mexico
And any other U.S. corporate interests
The 3rd world is a modern day playground, for multinational companies
And the tax dollars we're forced to pay
Fund these heartless U.S. policies

Their explanation "It's national interest, national security"

Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
They stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing I believe
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me

At little big horn national cemetery
There's a monument that reads
"To the soldiers killed in Montana while clearing
Hostile Indians away"
And there's a flag there flying high, over the fallen killers' graves
When they call on me to die for them I'll say "Not me!"

Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
They stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing I believe
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me

Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me
They stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing I believe
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me

Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
They stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing I believe
Don't fly those stripes
Those stars-and-stripes for me, me, me
