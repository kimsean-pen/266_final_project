You've got a new tattoo
Dead on arrival types
Outplay me
You only like bad news
Sleep in your car, feelin'
Like a baby
Beautiful trees outside
Sky isn't bright blue,
You see storm clouds
Storm clouds

You think it's hot to be sad,
But it's not
You're an ex punk slippin'
Stones in your Docs
You're in a circle of people
With fun that's illegal
You act like a cop,
You're the sequel that sucks
Doors always have their locks,
Like why even try
When we're fucked
Got your hands on a laptop,
Facing the mud, just stop

You give me-
Bad vibes, bad times,
Bad nights with you
Yeah I get- bad energy
Sick pleasure from you

Rollin' a cigarette
When you know that
Smoking causes cancer
Say that it's just depressing-
When basic girls sing "Tiny Dancer"
Sip all your drink on ice,
Not surprised
Your backyard is filled with stray cats
And that's sad

You think it's cooler
To have bad thoughts
Never eat ice cream,
Only take white drugs
In a circle of people without
Any reason to love, you're a guy
I've been screaming a lot,
"How is the earth so hot"
Like why even try when
It's already fucked?
Got your hands on a laptop,
Facing the mud, just stop

You give me-
Bad vibes, bad times,
Bad nights with you
Yeah I get- bad energy
Sick pleasure from you

You can't drag me down,
You can't drag me down
You can't drag me down,
You can't drag me down

'Cause I feel good
Yeah I'm real good
I said I feel good
Damn I feel good

You give me-
Bad vibes, bad times,
Bad nights with you
Yeah I get- bad energy
Sick pleasure from you

I said you give me-
Bad vibes, bad times,
Bad nights with you
Yeah I get- bad energy
Sick pleasure from you
