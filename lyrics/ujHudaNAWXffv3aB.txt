I'm so good at forgiveness
Cause I found it for you so many times
When I think I've hit my limit
You push a bit further
And I draw the line

I keep waiting, no I'm waiting for the tide to change
But I know I'm the one to blame
Cause I always choose to stay

I should be leaving
You've given millions of reasons
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Cause you know you're my weakness
And I should be healing
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't

When I'm almost close to leaving
(To leaving)
You become who I always hope you be
(Who I always hope you be)
But it doesn't last 'til morning
You pull me back into
Our reality

I keep waiting, no I'm waiting for the tide to change
But I know I'm the one to blame
Cause I always choose to stay

I should be leaving
You've given millions of reasons
(But you know I don't)
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Cause you know you're my weakness
And I should be healing
(But you know I don't)
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't

You're runnin' out of answers
And I'm out of second chances
But I give you another if you say you tried
No I know that the truth is
Tryna change a man is useless
And I know

I should be leaving
You've given millions of reasons
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Cause you know you're my weakness
And I should be healing
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't

But you know I don't
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
But you know I don't
But I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
