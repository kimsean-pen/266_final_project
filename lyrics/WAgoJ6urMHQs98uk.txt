Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me
Let me see you go
Six sounds more
Through the pay phone
I don't need to beef
We don't need to go that road
I don't need to speak
You know that I'm bad with the words
God damn how you just heard
Held up in the sky with the birds
I like the way you do it right there

The way you flip it back with the stares
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now now

Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me
Let me see you go
Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me

I hit up the girlfriend
I hit up the girlfriend
I hit up the girlfriend

You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now (on this)
You know I want you now
You know I want you right now now

Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me
Let me see you go
Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me
Let me see you go
Baby drive it down for me
Let me know you're gon' do it
Baby drive it down for me
Let me see you
