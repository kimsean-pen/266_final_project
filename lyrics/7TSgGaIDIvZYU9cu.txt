First thing Monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day
You see the thing 'bout love is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain

There comes a time when we could
All make a change darling

Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go baby

Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want no two time losers oh no
And ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way, oh no no no
You see the thing of it is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change

There comes a time when
We must go our own way

Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go

'Cause sometimes a love
Can work out right by now
And sometimes you'll never know it
You never ever gonna know it
But if it brings you pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go

Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
And everything's gonna work out right you know
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go

Just let go let
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go
Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go
Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
