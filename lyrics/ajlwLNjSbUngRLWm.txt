Contact was questioned from the boulevard
Head colds in frozen weeks of summer holds
I'm fine, I'm fine, wait-waiting on the line
We sent ourselves in on the gray card scale

Hold my head
Where storms are sand
And sand is said
To be sad

Long winded Cambridge medicative care
Head first, the motor runs, the motor must run
They confiscated every accident
And turned ourselves in on our selfish turns

With visitations from the underwhelmed
Five years, she fears to hold my broken head
Why were you gone, why were you gone so long
She is the reason that I still believe

Hold my head
Where storms are sand
And sand is said
To be sad

Cover your eyes, in the pouring rain
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same
Cover your eyes, in the pouring rain
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same

Far away, far away, far away
