Ooh yeah
I'll, I'll never stop

I don't know, will you believe me
After all is said and done
All the lies, how I regret them, baby

Now, I am the loser
And you're shining like the sun
Tell me why can't I still be the one?
Alright

I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
'Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?

I'll never stop
I'll never stop

How could I ever
When my heart is in your hands
And I know, baby
There is no turnin' back

I say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare
To end, oh yes

I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever till the end of time
'Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?

I'll never stop, yeah
I'll never stop

Do you believe me?
When my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?

(I'll never stop)
I will never stop
Till the end of time
(I can wait forever)
Heart is in your hands
(My heart is in your hands)
I'll never stop until you're mine
(I'll never stop)...
I can wait forever till the end of time
'Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop
