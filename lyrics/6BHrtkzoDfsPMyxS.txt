Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The Sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me

Huh!

I reached inside myself and found
Nothing there to ease
The pressure of my ever worrying mind
All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely
Looks the mirror's sending me these days

Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The Sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me

Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of the way I'm drifting
Gloomily through time
I reached inside myself today
Thinking there's got to be some way
To keep my troubles distant

Touch me
How can it be?
Believe me
The Sun always shines on T.V.
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me

Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me
