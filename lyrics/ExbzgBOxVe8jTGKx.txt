I remember like yesterday
I carried a heart without hope
Had given up on mystery
I only saw mirrors and smoke

Thought I was fine alone
That's just because I didn't know

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces

Sitting with you on a crowded bus
It seemed like just the two of us
That night everything was changed
I remember like yesterday

I was living in black and white
A careful and colorless life
You are like a neon light
Shined through my closed eyes

All the right ones, they turned out wrong
But you were here all along

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces

Little folded up love letters
Sweet songs written for each other
Everything was about to change
I remember like yesterday

You came just in time for me
You changed my mind so easily
Now it's you and me

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces

With a first time I love you
On a Paris afternoon
And now everything has changed
I remember like yesterday

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
Thought I could live without you
So glad I finally found you

On the street in the pouring rain
Our hearts both found their ways
I love how everything changed
I remember 'cause it's today

On a stairway in the park
In the starlight after dark
Sweet kisses in the pouring rain
