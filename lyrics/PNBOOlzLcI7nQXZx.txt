I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Though you treat me badly
I love you madly

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need to
Though you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

I love you
And all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend, another day here oh
I want to split now
I can't quit now

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

I love you
And all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
I said, "You really got a hold on me"
(You really got a hold on me)

You know, you really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Babe, you got really tight hold on me
(Really got a hold on me)
Really got a hold on me
