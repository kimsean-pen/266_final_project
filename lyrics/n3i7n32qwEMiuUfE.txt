All of us believe that this is not up to you
The fact of the matter is that it's up to me

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Let's go

How can we fake this anymore (anymore)
Turn our backs away and choose to just ignore (choose to just ignore)
(Some say) Some say it's ignorance
It makes me feel some innocence
(Some say) It takes away a part of me
But I won't let go

Tell me why can't you see, it's not the way
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
What will it take

If nothing could ever be this real (be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never fell)
(Some say) This future's not so bright
Some can't make the sacrifice
(Some say) It's more than just black and white
And I won't follow

Tell me why can't you see, it's not the way
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
What will it take

Times like these I've come to see how
Everything but time is running out

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
What

All of us believe in what we need
What we have's what we don't see

Tell me why can't you see, it's not the way
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame

Tell me why can't you see,
it's not the way (so how long, has this gone on)
(I don't see this ending)
When we all fall down,
it will be too late (it's too late, we can't change)
(What has now begun)
Why is there no reason we can't change (we
act like, its not right, why are we pretending)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
(we've been wrong, for so long)
What will it take (we've known this all along)
