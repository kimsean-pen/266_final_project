No one sees the difference in the land
Where the sky meets earth
Form horizons
Hand of stone
Arm of strength
Nature's fire
Fist of gold

Venom stains the lips and burns the tongue
With vengeance and hatred
Extremities forged in nature's fire
Unrelenting vigor
Carve the future

Feast or famine
Drink deception
The wells run dry
The need for temptation
Falling through brain field

Head for divide

The hand that matches
The hand that leads the way
To kill the shepherd
Just to see his face
Heed the warning
Ingest the rotten bone

The hand that falters

The hand that turns to stone

Chew on the root that gives us sight
Cranium shatters
Feed the needles as they fall
The truth
The mask
Brain divided
