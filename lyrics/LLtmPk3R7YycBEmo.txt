You float along the air, with teardrops in your hair.
Up and out the window before anybody hears.
So wear your warmest clothes, because you're so cold.
Set fire to yourself and yet still your heart it froze.

Now.

Suzanne, I want to die holding hands, running from this worlds demands.
All those radio bands never made me feel.
You were the girl that the world swung for, I was just a boy who sung until his lungs were sore.
And in your diary you had an entry listing all your enemies, what you'd do to them and what you'd do it for.

Now.

Suzanne, I want to die holding hands, running from this worlds demands.
All those radio bands never made me feel.
Suzanne, "do you believe in Rock n Roll? Can music save your mortal soul? Can you teach me how to dance real slow?"

And in your hospital room at the midnight hour, you had your boyfriend back just for half an hour.
Past the landscaped shrubs and the rusted iron gate.

So let's start a siege, you make a list of demands.
Set the hostages free and we'll die holding hands.
