Out on the corner on your soapbox looking down
Waving your flag like this is a battle ground
Your fancy words try to cut me down to size
Hey mister, mister, you're in for a big surprise

You can't stop us now

Soldier of fortune tried to shoot me down
Beating his chest only to hear the sound
Pumping his fist saying that our cause is dead
Go put your lies in somebody else's head

You can't stop us now

You say you're teaching wrong from right
I say you're preaching only to start a fight
Blood on your hands and mud on your face
Our time has come and you're standing in the way

You can't stop us now
