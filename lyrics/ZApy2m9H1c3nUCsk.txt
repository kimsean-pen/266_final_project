The war is over
The crypt we now taste
In the late 1900's, there is no human race
We split the planet with atomic bursts
Man has died
We seal the urn.

Negotiations are over
Troops are marching to their doom
All that I see is gonna hate me
The smoke is blotting out the moon
No, God please stop this bloody slaughter
Well, it's on the streets (attack?)
All the masses are rebelling
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?

Tanks are rolling in millions
See them come, and now they're gone
All the mountains are blackened
They said it came from just one bomb
No God please stop this bloody slaughter
Let it all repeat - attack
All the masses are rebelling
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?
Will we make it back beyond?

Out of the face and aim for the heart
We unite as one
[inaudible line]
The war has just begun
Look out!
Fools who are blind got their worthless guns
Turn the young into old
Blinded by the knives in their hearts
I bet you fear the loss
Look out!
[Screams]
Watch out!
Beyond the black!
