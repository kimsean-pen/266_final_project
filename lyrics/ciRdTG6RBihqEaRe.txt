Eres una obra de arte
Con solo mirarte
Algo que da paz

Cariño, eres un amor
Cariño, pintas en color

Quiero, tanto devorarte
Esta vez besarte
Si es que soy capaz

Cariño, eres un amor
Cariño, pintas en color

There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe

I can be your babe
If you won't let go
You can talk to me
But you already know
I can be your babe
If you won't let go

Cariño, eres un amor
Cariñito, pintas en color

There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe

Cariño, eres un amor
(There's something about you babe)
Cariño, pintas en color
(There's something about you babe)

There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe
There's something about you babe
