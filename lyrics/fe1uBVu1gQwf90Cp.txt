I am comfortable with silence,
I am glad their voices end.
I need something, anything to get me by.
I need something, anything just to get me HIGH! go-

NO!

I have left my mark I'm VICIOUS!
I've had all that I can take.
I need something, anything to get me by.
I need something, anything just to NUMB THIS LIFE!

Hold and don't let go,
when you feel left in the cold,
it will haunt you like a ghost,
when you feel love like you never did,
you never did...

I feel maliciously unstable.
I feel the pain inside me grow!
I need something, anything to get me by.
I need something, anything just to NUMB THIS LIFE!

Hold and don't let go,
when you feel left in the cold,
it will haunt you like a ghost,
when you feel love like you never did,
you never did... x2

You never did,
you never did,
you never did,
you never did...

Fists turn to hands,
stretched in the air,
I realize I can't do this alone!

Something supernatural take ahold of me,
give my last breath, lungs for you to breathe x2

Hold and don't let go,
when you feel left in the cold,
it will haunt you like a ghost,
when you feel love like you never did,
you never did... x2

You never did,
you never did,
you never did,
you never did.
