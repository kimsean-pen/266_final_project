I sat at your bedside
Mumbling to sorrow
Holding onto your hand
My back against morrow
There's a beauty in this
A privilege in parting I know

The years turned to days
The days turned to hours
Penitent in black
Pressing flesh amongst the flowers
I regret a lot and said a lot of things
I never thought I would say
But I think about her
I think about her everyday

Well the night was ours
We were swinging in the stars
When the lights went out
She was burning bright
When we said goodnight
Then the lights went out
Oh honey when the lights go out
Will I see you again?

Plucking out their heartstrings
Rattling their cages
Butter fingered lovers
Ripping out the pages
To the rules of the game
They're never willing to play
But I think about her
And I think about her everyday

Well the night was ours
We were swinging in the stars
When the lights went out
She was burning bright
As we said goodnight
Then the lights went out
Oh honey when the lights go out
Will I see you again?

We traced her steps across linoleum in kitten heels
And pressed our faces in the crush of velveteen and satin trim
She kept her faith on windowsills in plastic figurines
Dedicated to a life spent letting go go gone

Well the night was ours
We were swinging in the stars
When the lights went out
She was burning bright
When we said goodnight
Then the lights went out
Oh honey when the lights go out
Will I see you again?
Well the night was ours
We were swinging in the stars
When the lights went out
She was burning bright
Into the middle of the night
When the lights went out
Oh honey when the lights go out
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
