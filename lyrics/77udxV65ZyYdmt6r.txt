and it always goes
on and on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on and on it goes

and there has always been laughin, cryin, birth and dyin
boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
and heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
but then hurt from - time to time(s) -
like these
and times like those
what will be will be
and so it goes
and there will always be
stop and go and fast and slow action reaction
sticks and stones and broken bones
those for peace and those for war
and god bless these ones not those ones but these ones made
times like these
and times like those
what will be will be
and so it goes
and it always goes
on and on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on and on it goes
hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm
somehow i know, it wont be the same
somehow i know, never be the same
