All the waiters in your grand café
Leave their tables when you blink, oh
Every dog must have his every day
Every drunk must have his drink

Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

All your life you've had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet, oh
All your choices make you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete

Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

Mmm, you can say the human heart is only make believe
I am only fighting fire with fire
You are still the victim of the accidents you leave
Sure as I'm a victim of desire

All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet, oh
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street

Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away, oh
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you parlez-vous français
Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
