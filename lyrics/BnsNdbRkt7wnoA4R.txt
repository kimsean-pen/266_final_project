Woop Woop! Ha

Junior paints that old cafe
He's gotta change those girls around.
Westbound drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound.
Hustlers get what they deserve
But its always half the date.
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date.

See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
I lead all your mind games astray.
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.

Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you got no flag to wave.
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have it's day.

See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray.
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around

I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.

See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you arou-hound!
Aw yeah

Aw yeah
Aw yeah
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
I lead all your mind games astray.
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around.
Goodbye and Hooray
Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around oh nah nah nah no!
