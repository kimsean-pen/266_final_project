Didn't think you'd take my story and throw it in my face
That's a real nice way to throw me away
Don't you even worry,
I didn't really need a friend
I was just pretending to be lonely

The jokes on you
How do you feel?
I feel cool
Now those butterflies all seem bubblegum,
The only thing you knew to make my feet go numb
This ain't a love song
No, you don't deserve one
How did you feel with your hands up in the clouds?
What did you have when you brought them down?
Hopefully something accountable

I swallowed your knife
You won't be feeding the fear in my new life
My instincts are so much better than yours
My windows are open and you've closed all your doors

How time flew
I can't recall when I thought you were cool
Now with those butterflies all seem bubblegum,
The only thing you knew to make my feet go numb
This ain't a love song
No, you don't deserve one
How did you feel with your hands up in the clouds?
What did you have when you brought them down?
Hopefully something worthwhile
