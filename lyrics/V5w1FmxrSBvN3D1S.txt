Feeling like a fool
Just all on my own
Chilling in the sun
I tried to heat my bones
Feeling like the sun
Above no zone
Didn't think to clean the mirror
Since you're gone

I've been in love
This kind of love that makes you
Singing "what I need is love"

Where can I go
Who can I be
Looking at my day and I just long to see
You don't let go
I cannot breathe
We can have a party, baby
Wait and see

Counting all the stairs behind your door
Never knew somebody I could feel so cured
Bridging I'm a sinner
Praise your lord
You don't fool me darling baby
Ain't no more

I sing it loud
Wherever I would go
Singing "all I need is love"

Where can I go
Who can I be
Looking at my day and I just long to see
You don't let go
I cannot breathe
We can have a party, baby
Wait and see

Put your hands on me now
Put your hands on
Put your hands on me now
Lay your head on

Where can I go
Who can I be
Looking at my day and I just long to see
You don't let go
I cannot breathe
We can have a party, baby
Wait and see
Where can I go
Who can I be
Looking at my day and I just long to see
You don't let go
I cannot breathe
We can have a party, baby
Wait and see
Where can I go
Who can I be
Looking at my day and I just long to see
You don't let go
I cannot breathe
We can have a party, baby
Wait and see

Where can I go (Ooh)
