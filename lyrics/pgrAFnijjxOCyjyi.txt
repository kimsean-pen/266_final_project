Everything is beautiful...

Everything is beautiful...

Everything is beautiful...

Everything is beautiful... Everything is beautiful...

Everything is beautiful
Let the music carry you
Maybe I will follow you forever

Nowhere else I'd rather be
When you're lying next to me
Let the music carry us together

(X5)

Everything is beautiful...

Everything is beautiful
Let the music carry you
Maybe I will follow you forever

Nowhere else I'd rather be
When you're lying next to me
Let the music carry us together
