When I was told
You lied to me
I hung my head in shame.
When I was told
You were cheating me
I bit my lip in pain.

So back up,
Back away.
And you better know now,
Just for a little while,
So it one more time,
Just for a little while.

Oh, back up,
Back far away.
And you better know
Just for a little while,
Do it one more time,
Just for a little while.
