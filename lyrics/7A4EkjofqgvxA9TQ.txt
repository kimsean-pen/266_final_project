Waiting for your piece of pie to drop out of the sky
(Gotta go get it)
Hesitating for somebody else to run and pass you by
(But they never let you shine)

There ain't no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life (do your thing)
There ain't no excuse for coming up short
The ball is in your court (ooh)
So reach up and touch the sky

Are you doing your thing and doing it well
Are they looking at you, hating saying ooh
Are you doing your thing and doing it good
Do you thing thing baby girl, do you thing thing baby girl (do your thing)
Do your thing... ooh (oh)

Keeping yourself from taking on your perfect dream
(you gotta free your mind)
And being something somewhere that you read in a magazine
(but you never let you shine)

There aint no excuse for losing your feet
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life. (do your thing)
There ain't no excuse for coming up short
The ball is in your court (ooh)
So reach up and touch the sky

Are you doing your thing and doing it well
Are they looking at you, hating saying ooh
Are you doing your thing and doing it good
Do you thing thing baby girl, do you thing thing baby girl

Are you doing your thing and doing it well
Are they looking at you, hating saying ooh
Are you doing your thing and doing it good
Do your thing thing baby girl

Are you doing your thing well
Are you letting your dreams come alive
Are you doing your thing good

Believe can't nobody do it better than you

Gotta rock

Gotta take everything that I bring
Never did fall
Gotta hump

Never sit

Never quit from the swell of a lump... ah

That you can't never drag
Your feet to the beat
Of the sound of defeat
And even if you got heat... Whoa
Never take your mind off of the beat

(There aint no excuse)
There aint no excuse for losing your feet (for losing your feet)
Drowning in your defeat
On this road of life (do your thing)
There aint no excuse for coming up short
The ball is in your court (ooh)
So reach up and touch the sky. (Sky, yeah, yeah, yeah)
