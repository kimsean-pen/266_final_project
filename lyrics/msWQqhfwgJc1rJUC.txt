I wrote me a book
I hid the last page
I didn't even look
I think i locked it in a cage
wrote a novel
cause everybody likes to read a novel...

It started with a word,
and it started pretty well
about a rare and fragile bird that I couldn't even spell
on the table
i think i left it on the table...

I found the last page in the sky,
cold and sweet, like an apple

Oh hello,
will you be mine?
i haven't felt this alive in a long time
all the streets are warm today

I read signs
i haven't been this in love in a long time
the sun is up, the sun will stay

The very last breath of the hero of our tale
would you only to guess
did he truly prevail
in the the sequel?
I guess I'll have to write a sequel...

My favorite part's when I die
in your arms like a movie
it's tragic, but now the story has it's proper end.

Oh hello,
will you be mine?
i haven't felt this alive in a long time
all the streets are warm and grey

I read the signs
I haven't been this in love in a long time
the sun is up the sun will stay
all for the new day

Will you be mine?
the days are short and I wrote me my last rhyme
all the streets are warm today
I read the signs
I haven't been in this love in a long time.

It's been a long time
