Oooh
Outside you are waiting for me, hiding
You catch me when I am
Needing a friend to hold
You can soothe me, lie above me
Press hard
Then you strike
And I think that I'll die
'Cause I can't breathe, can't breathe
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming

Oooh
Please let me start screaming
Eyes are open seeing nothing
Hands are tied and I can't function
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
Please let me start screaming
