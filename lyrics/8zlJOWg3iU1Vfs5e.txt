It's late and I'm feeling so tired
Having trouble sleeping.
This constant compromise
Between thinking and breathing
Could it be I'm suffering
Because I'll never give in
Won't say that I'm falling in love
Tell me I don't see myself
Couldn't I blame something else
Don't say I'm falling love
Some kind of therapy
Is all I need
Please believe me
Some instant remedy
That can cure me completely
Could it be I'm suffering
Because I'll never give in
Won't say that I'm falling in love
Tell me I don't see myself
Couldn't I blame something else
Don't say I'm falling love
(don't you say I'm falling)
(theres no way I'm falling)
'Cause I've been there before and it's never enough
So nobody say it
Don't let I say it
I've got my eyes shut
Oohh not enough
Could it be I'm suffering
Because I'll never give in
Won't say that I'm falling in love
Tell me I don't see myself
Couldn't I blame something else
Don't say I'm falling love
(don't say I'm falling love)
Could it be that I'm
Suffering something
(don't say I'm falling love)
'Cause no no, won't give in, give in
(don't say I'm falling love)
Ooh, falling in love
Oh yeah
(couldn't I blame something else?)
Dont say that I'm falling in love
Dont say that I'm falling in love
