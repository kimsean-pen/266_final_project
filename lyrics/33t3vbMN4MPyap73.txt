I'm starting to believe it's a little... What?
Sleeping with your bag in the back of a cab
I'm starting to believe it's a little... What?
I could really feel my bones on fire
I'm starting to believe it's a little... What?
Another day I nearly sold my soul for nada
I'm starting to believe it's a little... What?
I said I'm starting to believe it's a little...

I'm starting to believe it's a little heinous
The progress we're making has taken my patience
If we could find another way to make it work
Or a different path I'd be down to take it
See that world that you're making?
Hold my beer while I shake it
Those along for the ride know that the pleasure was mine

And I know my way out, I know my way
And I know my way out

Don't forget that I'm real, not another weapon of mass appeal
It's time to turn off
(My supernova windowsill, my supernova windowsill)
You must forget that I'm real, reciprocate the hands that I deal
It's time to jump off
(My supernova windowsill, my supernova windowsill)
Take it or leave it. Who's learning? Who's preaching?
Everybody's on their shit, I'm feeling life
The cycles repeating, my strange love is fleeting
Everybody's on their shit, I'm feeling life

Turn the radio on, do you like what you hear?
It's the pain that I've tasted, with the freaks I hold near

So tell me what's with the pressure that we are made to consume
Fight for purpose, we've got no future locked away in our rooms

And I know my way out, I know my way
And I know my way out

On my vertebrae I stand, gazing brand new to the cos'
What's more important? Who I am or who they think that I was
I'll find comfort in the day, when its flesh to decay
I'm on a hypersonic rocket floating lightyears away

Don't forget that I'm real, not another weapon of mass appeal
It's time to turn off
(My supernova windowsill, my supernova windowsill)
You must forget that I'm real, reciprocate the hands that I deal
It's time to jump off
(My supernova windowsill, my supernova windowsill)
