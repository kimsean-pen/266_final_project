I wish I could forget you
But it's out of hand
I wish I was aggressive
And had a plan

I could write a couple words
That'd string into a phrase
But I'm afraid I'd go on and on
For days and days and days

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb
Of you

For the past couple weeks I've felt kind of great
But this kind of great don't come without its share of grey
I've been chewing off bites from my day to day
But by night I'm left with nothing but a sour taste

I wish I could forget you
But it's out of hand
I'd give all kinds of something
To have a plan

I could write a couple lines
That'd fall into a phrase
But I'm afraid I'd go off for
Days and days and days and days

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb
Of you

I wish I could forget you
I wish I could forget you
I wish I could forget you
I wish I could forget you

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb
Of you

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb
Of you

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded
To the, carpet in my room
My quiet blue tomb
Of you

I'm cravin', a getaway from the
Smooth talk, a getaway from the
