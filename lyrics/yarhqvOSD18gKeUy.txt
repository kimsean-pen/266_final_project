I'm becoming less defined
As days go by
Fading away
Well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kinda drifting into the abstract

In terms of how I see myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
I think sometimes I can see right through myself
Less concerned

About fitting into the world
Your world that is
'Cause it doesn't really matter
No it doesn't really matter

No it doesn't really matter any more
None of this really matters any more
Yes, I am alone
But then again I always was

As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because

Because you were never really real
To begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself

Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself
Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
And it worked

Yes it did
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you

There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you

There is only me
Only
Only
Only

Only
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling

Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone
Pickin' at that scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through
Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I never really shoulda seen
And now I know why
And now I know why
Things aren't as pretty
On the inside
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
