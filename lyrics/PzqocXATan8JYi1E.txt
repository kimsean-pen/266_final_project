Ice that cannot be felt
A storm that cannot be heard
A light that cannot be seen by anyone
Warmth that will never soothe
Words that will stay occult
A pain that won't be relieved by anyone

You're a crazy dancer in an empty stage (You're alone, you feel lost)
Can't be touched and can't be held
Consumed in hell (Being consumed in this hell)

Invisible, no one seems to care
A silent ghost, an innocent
Invisible, nonexistent
A smothered spark damned in this farce

In the ocean a drop
In the mist just a cloud
In this song nothing but a silent chord

You're a crazy dancer in an empty stage (You're alone, you feel lost)
Damned to go back to a world where you remain

Invisible, no one seems to care
A silent ghost, an innocent
Invisible, nonexistent
A smothered spark damned in this farce

Warmth that will never soothe
Words that will stay occult
In the ocean a drop, in the mist just a cloud
Warmth that will never soothe
Words that will stay occult
In the ocean a drop, in the mist just a cloud

You're a crazy dancer in an empty stage (You're alone, you feel lost)
Damned to go back to a world where you remain

Invisible, no one seems to care
A silent ghost, an innocent
Invisible, nonexistent
A smothered spark damned in this farce

In the ocean a drop
In the mist just a cloud
In this song nothing but a silent chord
