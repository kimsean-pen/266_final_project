I've just about had enough
I'm drowing from too much stuff
I get scared when the telephone rings
Someone talking about one more thing

One more thing
Yeah, it's one more thing
One more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that I can't take
One more thing I'm gonna break

You need more, well get in line
Too many things grabbing at my time
I'll tell you, brother, right out flat
I'm gonna have to throw you back

One more thing
Yeah, you're one more thing
Yeah, your one more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that I can't take
One more thing I'm gonna break
Yeah, you're one more thing
Yeah, you're one more thing

I fix my engine and the tire goes flat
It's one more thing that I can't have
Politics messing with my rights
There's nothing fun to do tonight

One more thing
Yeah, it's one more thing
Yeah, its one more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that I can't take
One more thing I'm gonna break
Yeah, its one more thing
Yeah, its one more thing
Yeah, its one more thing
Yeah, its one more thing
