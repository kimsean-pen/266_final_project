Come with me
Come with me, it's the time now
You won't see
You and me gotta find out

Always free
Almost free, almost maybe
On your own
All you know, time is fading

Now there she is
What should I do? What should I give?
Start to breathe
Now you're almost there, get on your knees

And come with me
Come with me to be alone now
Go with her
All you learn, eyes'll show her

It's the past
Were the last words you say
Always there
Always fare, make your own way

Now there she is
What should I do? What should I give?
It all disbands
She's walking out now, touch her hand

Come with me
Come with me, it's the time now
You won't see
You and me gotta find out

Almost there
Always fare, do it over
Go with her
All you learn, eyes'll show her
