In the middle of the night, you hold me tight
Said, "It's alright, I'm yours forever"
I'll do what you want, if you don't hurt me
I'll cook and clean, I'll make you happy
And

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
And ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

Got a chills in my bones, and it's all for you babe
Can't leave you alone, I'm so addicted
I can't sanctify, it's the sweetest pain
So who's your girl?
You better say my name

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
And ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

What you do to me is just a mystery?
It's hard to believe, that you are here with me
Makin' all my dreams, have seen reality
All my life I've tried to find what's best for me

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
And ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
And ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
Ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

What you do to me is just a mystery?
It's hard to believe, that you are here with me
Makin' all my dreams, have seen reality
All my life I've tried to find what's best for me

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
Ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you

Ooh, what you do to me?
Ooh, you're my everything
Ooh, I'm so glad I found you
Ooh, I can't be without you
