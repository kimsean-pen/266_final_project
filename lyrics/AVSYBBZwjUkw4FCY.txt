I found [?]
I felt two placed against my skin
I saw the face of God, I know
You're more than me, I know I need you

It's the sound that makes you live
[?] the needle breaks the skin
And all I want to keep you safe
But how can we go on this way?

Wide awake, staring at the ceiling
As time is counting my days
Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces
As I pray for rain to carry me away

It's a simple life we live
Where every moment's like a gift
And just a song could help you sleep
But it's hard to sleep with broken wings

Wide awake, staring at the ceiling
As time is counting my days
Like a tidal wave, tearing me to pieces
As I pray for rain to carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away

It's moments like these
Where I feel like I'm tied to the tracks
A train is barrelling towards me
I can feel its rumble and I can see its lights
But somehow I'm not too scared to die
I don't pray for it to stop, I don't pray for escape
All I can do is close my eyes and wait
And just moments before it decides to
Take my heart and take my blood
I tell myself that it's only love

Oh, oh

Just take my heart, take my blood
'Cause after all it's only love
Take my heart, take my blood
It's only love
Who took your time, who took the pain
Now it's all that still remain
You found the lies, you found our name
I hope we find ourselves again
You broke me down, you fucked me up
And still it never was enough
So take my heart, so take my blood
It's only love

Love!
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
To carry me away
