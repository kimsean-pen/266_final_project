Hit the ground, baby
It's all right now
Hit the ground, baby
Take your veil down

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby,
'Cause I want to love you now

Hit the ground, baby
I said it's all right now
Hit the ground, baby
You're gonna make it somehow

Baby, why so lonely?
The day has just begun
Hit the ground baby
Hit the ground and run

See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground, baby
Hit the ground and run
