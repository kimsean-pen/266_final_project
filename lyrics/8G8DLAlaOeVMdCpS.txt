When nothing could be done
To salvage what was lost
The chosen one
A victim of passion
He feels the hate rise up
A war that can't be won
The mourning son
Survives through disaster
The soul that suffered

All that's left behind
Is a memory that fades
Like a rope around your neck
Binds you to a resting place
And the price that I have paid
When I watched you pass away
Is the everlasting pain
And a memory that fades away

When all he had was gone
A place we once belonged
The chosen one finds an existence
Second coming life
Daylight pushes on
The mourning son
No longer a victim

All that's left behind
Is a memory that fades
Like a rope around your neck
Binds you to a resting place
And the price that I have paid
When I watched you pass away
Is the everlasting pain
And a memory that fades away

The soul that suffered sleeps tonight
In the ashes of his demons
Demons
Daylight holds no salvation
From this labyrinth of desolation
The fiery hells in his mind
Will burn to the ground in time

All that's left behind
Is a memory that fades
Like a rope around your neck
Binds you to a resting place
And the price that I have paid
When I watched you pass away
Is the everlasting pain
And a memory that fades away
