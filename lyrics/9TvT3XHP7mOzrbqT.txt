Let's take a trip together
Headlong into the irresistible orbit
Breathe in the cold black space
With the glistening edges

Let's take a trip me and you
Let's go the scenic route
Get to finally
Get to finally
Get to finally
Get to know each other

Just to be alone with thee
Just to be alone
Just to be alone with thee

Somewhere there's no distracting breeze of information
Leaking through the windows, dripping from the trees
Somewhere there's no earthquakes
Of other people's anxious questions
No nervous wrecks
Going down
No nervous wrecks
Going down

Let's take a trip together
Headlong into the irresistible orbit
