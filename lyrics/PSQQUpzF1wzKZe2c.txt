You stare at the broken mirrors
Shattered reflections of the past
I think we may be standin' in the same
Shadows that been cast

Darkness, no more darkness
The broken days have beat the dead of night
Darkness, no more darkness
No more darkness, no more light

And a trail we choose to follow
It's as cursed as it is blessed
Is there mercy that we all must face
Before the dead can raise?

Darkness, no more darkness
The broken days have beat the dead of night
Darkness, no more darkness
No more darkness, no more light

And if you listen to the song that settled on the breeze
A woman sings unto our baby boy
I won't live to see the day that you'll be lifted off your knees

Some days it feels so hopeless
Nothing's makin' any sense
Flags we raise in praise of ruthless
Supposes innocence

Darkness, no more darkness
The broken days have beat dead of night
Darkness, no more darkness
No more darkness, no more light
No more darkness, no more light
No more darkness, no more light
