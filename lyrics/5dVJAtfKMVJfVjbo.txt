I could be like you, I could be alone and jaded
Wonderin' what to do 'til they say
And I could be like you, angry and intoxicated
Wonderin' what to do to make them pay

Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Can I make them say?
Can I make them say?

Make them all believe they're wrong
They're really wrong
Their cruel intentions don't belong

And I, and I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say
And I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say

I could be like you, I could be alone and jaded
Wonderin' what to do 'til they say

Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Can I make them say?
Can I make them say?

Make them all believe they're wrong
They're really wrong
Their cruel intentions don't belong

And I, and I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say
And I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say

Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Will I find a way? Will I find another way?
Can I make them say?
Can I make them say?

Make them all believe they're wrong
They're really wrong
Their cruel intentions don't belong

And I, and I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say
And I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say

And I, and I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say
And I hear you talk the talk but I don't see you walk the walk
Still don't believe a thing you say, you say
