Callin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago (chicago echo)
Down in New Orleans (down in New Orleans echo)
In New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere

There'll be swingin' and swayin' and records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on ev'ry guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

There'll be dancing
Dancing in the street

It's just an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing and music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget the Motor City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin', swayin' and records playing
And dancing in the street

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

There'll be dancing
Dancing in the street
Way down in L.A., every day
Dancing in the street
Across the ocean too, me an you
Dancing in the street
