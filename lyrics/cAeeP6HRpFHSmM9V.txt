Yesterday, just a photograph of yesterday
And all it's edges folded and the corners faded, sepia brown
And yet it's all I have of our past love
A postscript to it's ending

Brighter days, I can see such brighter days
When every song we sang is sung again
And now we know this time's for good
And we're lovers once again
And you're near me

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves are brown on the ground
In Spain I did love and adore you
The bright lights and songs were our joy each day
And the nights were the heat of yearning

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see that Spain again

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves are brown on the ground
Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The night fill with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime see you gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine
And they dance to the melody
And we live again, as if dreaming
The sound of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we know their meaning

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see that Spain again

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see you gaze at me

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see you gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine
And we dance to the melody
And we live again, as if dreaming
The sound of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we know their meaning

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see that Spain again

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves are brown on the ground
Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The night fill with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

I can recall my desire, every reverie is on fire
And I got a picture of all our yesterdays
Yesterday, I can say. I got a kick everytime I see that Spain
that Spain again
