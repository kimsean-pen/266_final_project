Take me to the city lights
Can go but not when I'm at home
I need to go where I can see
Can hear things in stereo

Your own life is fraught with shame
Mirrors in disco balls
I never never never tense
Think I understand it now

I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.

Forget about the things you want
Forget about your hopes and dreams
Focus on the here and now
Just think who we could have been

Boys from the magic show
There's girls from the magazine
Take your opportunities
And be who you wanna be

I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.

It's tough times, we gotta to go
Where nobody knows your name,
Leave all the things we knew,
And learn how to start again.

And learn how to start again.
And learn how to start again.
And learn how to start again.
And learn how to start again.

I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
I go hard, I go home.
