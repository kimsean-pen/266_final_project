I was a boat driftin' out into the sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
That you would see me

I was a stone's throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away
From reaching your hand

The waves, they crashed upon the rocks
That you were trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me, yeah

The waves, they crashed upon the rocks
That you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us

Lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us, yeah
