All night
And I don't want no questions, not right
About the 3rd time that you asked me
All night
What the fuck have you been drinking
All night
Like you never meant to mean it

All night
In a sport room back in kansas
All night
Our requirements do differ
All night
The decision was made for us
All night

We've locked our eyes don't weaper
Only our lights have blown or gone
It's taking all night to get you alone
Sometimes I try for our plan to grow
Feels like you might like me to be wrong

All night
All night

Only our lights have blown or gone
It's taking all night to get you alone
Sometimes I try for our plan to grow
Feels like you might like me to be wrong

All night
And I don't want no questions, not right
All night
