You know he's moving fast
But he's still going slow
He's ahead in the race
And there's not far to go
And your load is so heavy
And your legs want to rest

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

You think he's way up in front
But he's so far behind
He's asleep in the grass
And he's run out of time
While your load was so heavy
You never wanted to stop

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Your friend is heavy, but he was ready
And never stopped for a while
While you were sleeping, he went on keeping
The final line in his mind

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Your friend is heavy, but he was ready
And never stopped for a while
While you were sleeping, he went on keeping
The final line in his mind

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
