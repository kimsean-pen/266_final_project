Have you ever thought
Where your soul will be
When you'll lie to rot
Die physically

Being so fascinated
By those mysteries
I've began some weird
Out of my body

I saw a light
In front of me
It blinked my eyes
Invited me in

Forever will shine
This tremendous light that drives me blind
When I got behind
Control was no longer mine
Meeting those who dies
Those who've been here before I arrived
I should have stayed behind
Only incarnation can now bring me back
To mankind

[Lead: Luc Lemay]

I'm where souls are lost
For eternity
I shall never come back
To reality
