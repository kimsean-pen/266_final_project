This is my song
And no one can take it away
It's been so long, but now you're here,
Here to stay
And I wonder if you know what it means
To find your dreams come true

This is my song
And no one can make it a lie
It's been so long since someone
Could make me cry
And I wonder if you know what it means
To laugh as tears go by

I may not always sing in tune
And sometimes you don't hear me
But you don't have to be near me
To know that I'm singing

This is my song
And nothing can make it die
It's been so long and it's stronger
I know why
And I wonder if you really, really know
That as long as I live I will sing my song for you
