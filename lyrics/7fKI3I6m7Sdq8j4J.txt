I'm going out tonight, and I don't care who knows.
I recognize my Siamese self, and he's ready to go.
I'm going out tonight, and I don't care if you're coming.
I sent a message in a telepathic grin and I know how to keep running!
I sit inside and hide from a better man.
I cut and run and it slips right through my hands.
I'm going out tonight, and I hope that it hurts.
I realize my body's a lie and I don't know which is worse.
I'm going out tonight and I don't care if you're coming,
I sent a message in a telepathic grin and I know how to keep running!
I sit inside and hide from a better man.
I cut and run and it slips right through my hands.
I have these terrible dreams.
I fall from the nest.
I fall from the nest, I break and I'm free.
Nothing works out like a plan.
I don't know what it takes to be a modern man.
My body's a bullet.
My life is a gun in my hands.
I have these terrible dreams.
I fall from the nest.
I break and I'm free.
I have these terrible dreams.
I fall from the nest.
I break and I'm free.
