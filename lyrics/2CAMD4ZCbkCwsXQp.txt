There sat a new test
Much harder that you bought in
As for the unseen, just take care of what you will
Light the silent alarm
We never think that we're missing much 'til

I gasp and hold my breath
These needs had changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake for...

I need a new test
Then I set out to choose someone to
Light the soul like a kiln
Just imagine us chasing this with
Eyes scorned from sleep apnea
A slight of tongue as the seas are empty

I gasp and hold my breath
These needs have changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake for...

Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

Try to read off a letter that's falling apart
The sun and the moon I count sheep
Escape like an animal I'm ready for my sleepless stroll

I felt these shifting hours mistakenly used up

So I gasp and hold my breath
These needs have changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake for years

I gasp and hold my breath
These needs have changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake for...

Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
