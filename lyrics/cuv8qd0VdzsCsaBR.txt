Cascading down there's a sound that's a rising into vision
It's a sound in my head that I feel and it shuts me in a prison

Say it won't last
Say it will pass
Always this sound in my brain
Can you hear it?

Water on glass
Running down again
Water on glass
That sound
Water on glass running 'round again
Help me, 'cause I got running water running down

Dancing away like the lights on a dark and shiny river
Sounds in my head seem to run and I get up and I shiver

Say it won't last
Pray it will pass
Always this sound in my brain
Can you hear it? (Can you hear it?)

Water on glass
Running down again
Water on glass
That sound
Water on glass running 'round again
Help me, 'cause I got running water running down

Cascading down there's a sound that's a rising into vision
It's a sound in my head that I feel and it shuts me in a prison

Say it won't last
Say it will pass
Always this sound in my brain
Can you hear it?

Water on glass
Running down again
Water on glass
That sound
Water on glass running 'round again
Help me, 'cause I got running water running down

Water on glass
Running down again
That sound
Running down again
Water on glass
Water on glass
