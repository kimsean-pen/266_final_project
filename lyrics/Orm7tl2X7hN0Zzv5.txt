I've been meaning to tell you what I saw in you
When I got so lost in your presence
The tides that you ride in the dark I have known
The steps that you take make the distance

The voices talk notions -I owe them my life
They'll take my no for an answer
Away you will walk with a smile and wet eyes
For my dreams to be sold in art auctions

I've been meaning to tell you what I saw in you
When I got so lost in your presence
Your darkness is mine for what seems that I hold
In silence my line of resistance

The voices talk notions -I owe them my life
They'll take my no for an answer
Away you will walk with a smile and wet eyes
For my dreams to be sold in art auctions
