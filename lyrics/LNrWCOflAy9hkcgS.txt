Stay out of trouble if you can, boy
Don't let your mind set fool around
Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, around
Lay down your troubles if you can, girl
Don't let anybody steal your crown
Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around

Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around

You don't have to serpentine
Both highways to feel it
You don't have to sabotage
Both side lanes to feel it
(oh no)
'Cause I want anybody's neon experience
I want anybody's neon experience

Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around

Lay down your troubles if you can, ja!
Don't let your mind set settle down
When this whole world steals your crown
That day will come, come around

'Cause you are the one and only
Neon experience
'Cause you are the one and only
Neon experience

'Cause I want anybody's neon experience
I wan't anybody's neon experience

Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around
Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around

Don't let the whole world break you down
New day will come, come around
