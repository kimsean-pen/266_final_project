Chemical, dripping dark, dark, out of my soul
Cynical, with a cry I'm out of control
You say I'm too far gone
Dug a hole, and you cut straight down to the bone.
I'll remind you, the night you left me alone
Today I beg for numb

Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away.
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain
Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain

Chemical, dripping dark, dark, down in my veins
Drifting far, disregard dead thoughts in my brain
The light escapes my eyes
Skeptical of the place you're taking me now
Kill me slow, I remain complacent with how
I've let you bleed me dry

Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain
Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain

It's on your hands, the blood
You asked for it, because
You wanted to take control of a vacant home
You thought I let you in
But I never will again

Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate the pain
Out of sight, out of mind
Took what's mine and you threw it away
And for the sake of you, find someone new,
To medicate your pain
