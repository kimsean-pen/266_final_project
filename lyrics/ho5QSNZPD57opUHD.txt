It eats your soul
Like tears, you fall
My slave
You steal, you heed the call
My slave
The keys, the keys are gone
My slave
You keep me beating on

[Hook]
You keep me, you keep me, your slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave

On my own
You keep me, you keep me
On the throne
Heads down all day

[Hook]

Come feed on your love
