I'm on a high and I don't even know why
I'm gonna shin myself before your innocent eyes
You're ready now to forget what we have
You'd better seal it tight before the memories go bad

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
It's all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me
For a girl like me

It's getting late and I pretend not to see
I'm planning my move in, just you sounded creepy
I I I I I I I I I heard you're leaving and I'll never know why

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
It's all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me
For a girl like me

I I I I I I I I I heard you're leaving and I'll never know why

Between devil in the deep blue sea
I saw you dancing with a girl like me
I watched in silence as you held her hands
It's all down the river for a girl like me
For a girl like me
For a girl like me
