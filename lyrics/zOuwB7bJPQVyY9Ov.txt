Niggas don't know, they don't need to know
Roll up on 4, slide through the 4, ride through the slope,
damn my lil hoe, she roll up my dope,
we get hot and we float, don't smoke on no pole, she askin for more
I'm givin her more
More of my love
Hop inside my car and take control of my love
For her I would kill, For her I would drill
She know that it's real, she know that I feel, However she feel
