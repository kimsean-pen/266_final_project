Watch a movie I've seen 5 times before,
Falling asleep with my head
On the emergency door

Food tastes good a 50, 000 feet
Red wine and cognac,
Makes me feel complete

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my plane
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my plane

The snow and ice
A green hill below
One more place
I would like to go

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my plane
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my plane

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my plane
Keep me in my plane
Make me feel safe
