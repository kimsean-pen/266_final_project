Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Fisherman row, to reep what you sow now
Tell you all I know, you've got to let me go now
All you've got to do is

Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know

You keep on knockin but you can't come in
I get to understand you been livin in sin
But if you love me woman walk right in
I've got a notch for your safety-pin
Bend down low

Keep on knockin but you can't come in
I get to understand you been livin in sin
But walk right in woman, sit right down
I will keep on lovin you, I will play the clown

Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
