Electric, I feel you
I feel you, oh
Start line, fall down
For you, oh
And I never wanted to let you go
To hold someone
Somebody else, no
Breaking hearts everywhere you go
Tell me where you go
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold

I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love

Star sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold

No one, before you
No one, no
Sky falls, around you
Before I, let go
And I never wanted to let you go
To hold someone
Somebody else, no
Breaking hearts everywhere you go
Tell me where you go
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold

I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love someone
I keep giving it all, just to love

Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold

Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Ill be giving it all
Stop sign, I think I love you
Giving my heart to you
Cause paper hearts were meant to unfold
