Two and one, making three
Intertwined like the links that make a chain
'Round the anchor, round a ship
'Round the bottom of the sea
'Round the world, you and me

Back again and then it's us
With a lot in a hand
Making one, then making us
To be more, to be sure
That what is here is here for you

Here for me, on and on
Into the night, into the day
Into the years that are to come
Before you know that I know

It's on and on and on and on
You and me, you and us
To know and love and love again
On and on, on and on

The tiny thing that makes us live
Through the day, through the night
Through a week or through our lives
Hand in hand, don't get up
Just sit and watch to wonder why
Is that a girl, is that a boy

Can't think a life can go so far
On and on, on and on
To know and love and love again
On and on, on and on

Two and one, making three
Like a chain, an anchor
And the bed of the sea
Being close is where to be

We're two minds, two bodies
And the rest you don't see

You've got to see what we've got to see
You've got to find what we've got to find
What you see is what you get
What you say should be from your own mind

Tiny things make us live
Through a day, through a night--a week
We've got time to forgive
And live how we want to live

You've got to see what we've got to see
You've got to find what we've got to find
What's right, what's free
What's you, what's me

This life to live
Wastes time and you don't forgive
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
Whether you be glad, sad or bad

You've got to know that there's fun to be had
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
Forget all that you're told
You are young, they are old
Control is all they've got to give
Just live how you want to live

Tiny things that make us live
Two and one, making three
Like a chain, an anchor
And the bed of the sea
Being close is where to be
We're two minds, two bodies
And the rest you don't see

You've got to see what we've got to see
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to find what we've got to find
(On and on, on and on)
What you see is what you get
(On and on, on and on)
What you think should be from your own mind
(On and on, on and on)

What's right, what's true
(On and on, on and on, and know and love and love again)
Just think for you
(On and on, on and on, and know and love and love again)

Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
You've got to know that there's fun to be had

Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
You've got to know that there's fun to be had

Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
(On and on, on and on)

Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
Whether you be glad, sad or bad
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
(On and on, on and on)
You've got to know that there's fun to be had
(On and on, on and on)
