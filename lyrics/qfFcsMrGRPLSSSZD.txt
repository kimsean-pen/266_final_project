I've been waiting for tonight
You give me fever deep inside

Its you and me together
I feel it in my soul
We can last forever
You just make me loose control!

I can't get you out of my mind
It's silly but i think about you all the time
All you have to do is give me a sign
To make me fall in love, love, lo-o-ve

I can't get you out of my mind
It's silly but i think about you all the time
All you have to do is give me a sign
To make me fall in love, love, lo-o-ve

When you're dancing close to me
It's for everyone to see

Its you and me together
I feel it in my soul
We can last forever
You just make me loose control!

Its you and me together
I feel it in my soul
We can last forever
You just make me loose control!

I can't get you out of my mind
It's silly but i think about you all the time
All you have to do is give me a sign
To make me fall in love, love, lo-o-ve

I can't get you out of my mind
It's silly but i think about you all the time
All you have to do is give me a sign
To make me fall in love, love, lo-o-ve
