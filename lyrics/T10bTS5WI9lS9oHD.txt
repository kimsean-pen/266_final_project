They say don't be reckless. Think twice, think real hard
Oh, what do I say? Think of the state of your heart

They say hold back, don't be careless
Hold tight. Keep your guard up
What do they know? I want to know who you are

So I'll go running through the dark with my heart on fire till everything ignites
I want everything now, I want to know what it's like
If it's real and if the beat stays when I lose my motion
If you keep me warm
When I'm lost in your eyes, I want to know what it's like
What it's like

And I won't be jealous, I won't do that, but I will be ready
So take my hand
Take me over, take the words I say
Take me all of the way and take me

Into the night, into the day, into the eye of the storm and
Take me into your heart, into, into your heart
Leave me shocked by your love, shocked by your kiss
Shocked by how easy it is
To fall into your arms, into, into your arms

Don't wait, don't be careful. Come full speed
And hit real hard â€“
I won't break, I want to know who you are

I want to run through the streets with my heart on fire so everyone can see what you made me
I want them to know how it feels to know that when I'm not strong and my heart's wide open
You keep me warm
When I can't fight, you keep me up on my feet, on my feet

And I won't be jealous, I won't do that, but I will be ready
So take my hand
Take me over, take the words I say
Take me all of the way and take me

Into the night, into the day, into the eye of the storm and
Take me into your heart, into, into your heart
Leave me shocked by your love, shocked by your kiss
Shocked by how easy it is
To fall into your arms, into, into your arms

One step to me, then you can take the lead
I want to know what it's like by your side

I won't be jealous I won't do that, I won't be jealous
I won't hold back
I won't be jealous I won't do that, but I will be ready

So take me into the night, into the day
Into the eye of the storm, and
Take me into your heart, into, into your heart
Leave me shocked by your love, shocked by your kiss
Shocked by how easy it is
To fall into your arms, into, into your arms
