Then policemen in the tone of depression
Half of people they are living in depression

All them being saying smile your teeth right
All them being saying teeth the future is bright
Telling your smiling won't make it right
If you won't stad up and take up the fight
Many smiling and [?]
Many smiling [?] Chipaya
