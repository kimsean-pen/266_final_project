(Joan Jett/Kari Krome/Kim Fowley)

Shades of gray don't fade away
They're waitin' for the night
Goin' out is what we're about
We're waitin' for the night

Friends and foes movin' fast and movin' slow
We're waitin' for the night
Hangin' around so astounded
Waitin' for the night

Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Days are taken
Waitin' for the night

At the hall havin' a ball
Waitin' for the night
Don't care, don't care at all
Cause we've seen, we've seen it all
Waitin' for the night

Waitin' for the night
Waitin' for the night
Days are taken
Waitin' for the night
