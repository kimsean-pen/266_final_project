I'd say it was the right time
To walk away
When dreaming takes you nowhere
It's time to play

Bodies working overtime
Your money don't matter
The time keeps ticking
When someone's on your mind, on your mind

I'm moving in slow motion
Feels so good
It's a strange anticipation
Knock, knock, knockin' on wood

Bodies working overtime
It's man against man
And all that ever matters is, baby
Who's ahead in the game
Funny but it's always the same

Playing, playing with the boys
Staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys

Said it was the wrong thing
For me to do
I said it's just a boys' game
But girls play too

My heart is working overtime
In this kind of game
People get hurt
I'm thinking that the people is me
If you wanna find me I'll be

Playing, playing with the boys
Staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is the boys

I don't wanna be the moth around your fire
(With the boys)
I don't wanna be obsessed by my desire
(You're shining, you're smiling)
(I'll see it now)
With the boys
(I'm staying, you play too rough)
Playing, playing with the boys
I'll be staying, playing with the boys
After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playin' with the boys
(Playing with the boys)
Playing
(Playing with the boys)
