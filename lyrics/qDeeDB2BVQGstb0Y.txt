Gotta get up, get down

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby can't you read the signs

I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Lets just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
Fast love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
Some fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about baby? (ooh ooh, baby baby)
Hey baby, oh yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
But I just want to have some fun

I won't bore you with the details baby
You gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind

Baby I aint Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fast love
Fast love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
Some fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)
What's there to think about baby? (ooh ooh, baby baby)

So close I can taste it now baby, so close

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah
I miss my baby tonight

So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW, babe, searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh you really oughta get up now, that's right
Oh you really oughta get up

Looking for some affirmation
