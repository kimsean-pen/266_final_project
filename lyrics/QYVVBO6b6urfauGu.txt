I heard you're living baby
I heard you're going for
I wanna ride with you in a back seat of your car
I heard you're tired of it
You know, I'm tired too
I'm sick of empty pockets
Can I, can I come with you?

If you wanna run and hide
We're the new bonnie & clyde
You should team up with me
Let me be your company
I wanna hear they sayin'

Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
You and I, come take me far away
Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
We'll be gold and safe forever baby
Bon voyage

I wanna see the coastline
For where we are
I wanna see the sunlight
Through the window of your car
I heard it's something different
Different point of view
I wanna go there since
Can I, can I come with you?

If you wanna run and hide
We're the new bonnie & clyde
You should team up with me
Let me be your company
I wanna hear they sayin'

Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
You and I, come take me far away
Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
We'll be gold and safe forever baby
Bon voyage

Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage

Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
You and I, come take me far away
Bon voyage, bon bon voyage
We'll be gold and safe forever baby
Bon voyage

Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage
Bon bon voyage
