And the trees blow around
In the gathering gale
(?)
Upon the trail
And the rains came heavy from the north
And they were all outside
But I was not
I was in the kitchen looking out over the fields

Standing in the doorway, the doorway
Watching the lightening and the trees sway
(?)

And the rains came heavy from the north
They were in their little boats
But I was not
I was in bed
And I pillow bite
In my dream I sleepwalk
And I drink a beer
(?) stay at the caf√© down the block
So drink your beer
Drink your coffee
In the fear
Of the great nothing

Standing in the doorway, the doorway
Watching the lightening and the trees sway
Singing (?)
Standing in the doorway, the doorway
Watching the lightening and the trees sway
Singing (?)
