It's simple and eternal
The sum of where were made
Across the land we circle,
Inside is where we rest
As nations keep on marching,
This boat is breaking forth
The guardian eye is watching,
The hawk who sees it all

(Pre-1)
I know you're aching to move on
It doesn't where you are when you belong

()
Something close to love
But more mysterious
I'll hold you in the shadows
Of my arms
Always close to love
More victorious
Can you feel this empire being born?
The pull of where you're from
Is far too strong

()
It's honest and it's brutal
There's beauty in its strength
It's never less than truthful
It's born from innocence

(Pre-2)
Break through the web that I have spun
It doesn't where you are when I am gone

()
Something close to love
But more mysterious
I'll hold you in the shadows
Of my arms
Always close to love
More victorious
Can you feel this empire being born?
The pull of where you're from
Is far too strong

(Bridge)
Always, close to...
Always, close to love
Always, close to...
Always, alright

Something close to love
But more mysterious
I'll hold you in the shadows
Of my arms
Always close to love
More victorious
Can you feel this empire being born?
The pull of where you're from
Is far too strong
