Can it be true?
Nobody warned you.
Nobody told you,
to make up your mind.

Nobody told you,
That I could just waltz through
And shake up your style.

I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside.

Strange and far
All this hardware
Sum of time
And night one's for me

Go inside
Going somewhere
Hopeless tag time
No one's for me
Open wide
Yard like new year

Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind

Nobody told you
That I could just walk through
And shake up your style

Strange and far
All this hardware
Stroke of time
And no one's for me

Go inside
Going somewhere
Hopeless tag time
And no one's for me
Open wide
Yard like new year

Stay and fight
Stay and fight
Stay and fight
