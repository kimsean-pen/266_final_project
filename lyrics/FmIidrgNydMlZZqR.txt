Ay, boy, whatcha say, boy?
You tryna play coy like a Gameboy?
Hit my phone boy, is you home boy?
Are you alone boy? Come give me dome, boy
Got a boy with degrees, a boy in the streets
A boy on his knees, he a man in the sheets
Sheesh, it's all Greek to me
Got this boy speaking Spanish, ay Papi!

Baby, I don't need you
I just wanna freak you
I heard you a freak, too
What's two plus two? (Four, three, two, ow)

Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy
(Four, three, two, ow)
Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy
(Four, three)

I like big Boys, itty bitty Boys
Mississippi Boys, inner city Boys
I like the pretty Boys with the bow tie
Get your nails did, let it blow dry
I like a big beard, I like a clean face
I don't discriminate, come and get a taste
From the playboys to the gay Boys
Go and slay, boys, you my fave Boys

Baby, I don't need you
(I don't need)
I just wanna freak you
(Want, I want it bad)
I heard you a freak, too
(That's right)
What's two plus two?
(Four, three, two, ow)

Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy
(Four, three, two, ow)
Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy
(Four, three, two, ow)

(Four, three, two, woo!)
Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy
(Four, three, two, ow, done lost your mind)
Boys, Boys, Boys
Make a girl go crazy, ow
