Weaken the wicked I'm whipping the weekend I'm sipping the wata (the wata)
Spilling and steaming and dreading the ending tonight is macaba (macaba)
Babylon devils and December rebels I'm licking the carpet (carpet)
Tempting temptation and Satan sensations I'm drinking the lager
I spit on your prada

I'm thinking that you're thinking that I'm thinking that you're lying
I'm lying
I'm drinking and I'm drinking and I'm drinking and I'm crying (aaah)

Toss me out tonight
Take my light like Nepa
Hold me daddy
Treat me like you never
Burglar Bill
Rob me rob me
The old bill requires proof

If the Devil lay there (lay dead)
To revive a recluse
To revive a recluse
Nothing for the pure
Reap death from thy lips
Lurking like an apology (hey hey)
Fighting to be heard (hey hey)
Add pepper then mix your words
Boiling the heart
Hoping for the best
Planning for the worst

Dressed in burden
Living with a curse
Checkpoint chale
Driving in a hearse

If the Devil lay there (lay dead)
To revive a recluse
To revive a recluse
Nothing for the pure
Reap death from thy lips
Lurking like an apology (hey hey)
Fighting to be heard (hey hey)
Add pepper then mix your words
