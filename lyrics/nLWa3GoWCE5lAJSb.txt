Well, the streets are empty where we used to run,
and the cars are all on fire
Yeah, we fall like leaves in the garden of Eden, Eden
Now remember how it felt being in the sun, when I heard the ancient choir
And the dead of night like an angel singing, singing

'Cause time doesn't love you anymore
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey we can run forever, if forever it's what's install
Oh, time to take me home

On a tree in the garden I carved your name,
an word is spelled desire!
Like an ocean deep with the waters even, even
And the love pours down like a waterfall, and I can't escape the tide
Here's my hand, baby take it or leave it, leave it

'Cause time doesn't love you anymore,
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey we can run forever, if forever it's what's install
Oh, time to take me home-ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Now we're too young to recognize
Nothing stays the same
Promise I won't be the one to blame!

'Cause time doesn't love you anymore,
But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
Honey we can run forever, if forever it's what's install
Oh, time doesn't love you like I love you!
So take me home-ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Let me hear you say, let me hear you say
