I've always been the kind of girl
That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say

But I have this dream
Bright inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time
To let you know, to let you know

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

Do you know what it's like
To feel so in the dark
To dream about a life
Where you're the shining star

Even though it seems
Like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself
It's the only way

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the missing piece I need
The song inside on me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me

Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
(This is me)

You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me (this is me, yeah)
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing

Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me
