(chorus)
Don't make me bring you back to the start
You can run but you won't come far
Don't let me show you how weak your are
Hurts like bullets between these walls.
(x2)

Hurts like bullets between these walls

seen less with powder drippin' of the led
angels in my snow breathing at the end (fading echo)

(chorus)
Don't make me bring you back to the start
You can run but you won't come far
Don't let me show you how weak your are
Hurts like bullets between these walls.
(x2)
