'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around you, around you, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey eh
And nothing even matters, hey

It's like one for the haters and two for all of those
Who try to shut us down?
They don't really know
There ain't nothing they can do that can tear us apart, no

I don't care about the money, don't care about the clothes
When we're together, baby, anything goes
And we don't even need to prove what we're feel in our hearts, no

This wall we built together, there ain't no way of knocking it over
And we'll be here forever
Getting closer and closer, baby

'Cause the world stops
Ehen I put my arms around you, around you, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey eh
And nothing even matters, hey

They can all talk, say, what they want about us, about us, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey whoa
And nothing even matters, hey

It's like the sound goes off and the people all freeze
They disappear and it's just you and me
Anything you wanna do, anything that you please, oh whoa no

Forget about our problems and forget about our past
I've seen the future and I know we're gonna last
Every second I'm with you just go so fast, whoa oh

This wall we built together, there ain't no way of knocking it over
And we'll be here forever
That I told ya, that I told ya, baby, 'cause

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around you, around you, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey eh
And nothing even matters, hey

They can all talk, say, what they want about us, about us, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey whoa
And nothing even matters, hey

Nothing even matters (matters, matters), whoa (whoa whoa)
And nothing even matters (matters, matters, matters)

Whoa, we don't even need to fight (don't to fight)
Everything will be alright, oh yeah
Nothing even matters, but you and I

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around you, around you, oh whoa
And nothing even matters (nothing even matters)
And nothing even matters, yeah

They can all talk, say, what they want about us, about us, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, hey whoa
And nothing even matters, hey

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around you, around you, oh whoa
And nothing even matters (nothing even matters)
And nothing even matters, baby

They can all talk, say, what they want about us, about us, oh whoa
And nothing even matters, whoa
And nothing even matters
