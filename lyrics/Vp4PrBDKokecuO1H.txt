Diamond life, lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require a streetcar of desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
Sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending, but somewhere to start

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago, Western male
Across the North and South to Key Largo, love for sale

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
He melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels, his heart is cold

No need to ask
