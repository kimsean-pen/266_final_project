Like a bolt from the blue, descending from the sky
My brain collapses in the dead of night
Too much for my psyche, another crack-up
If you're awake, join me
All the things you see, the same as what I see
We listen to the sound of nervous breakdown
A death that blends with a will to live
One of the things that freaks me out

I'm waiting for a sign, have to leave this place behind
Where no one knows my name
Then later we'll calm down, we'll both break down and cry
(And say) our last goodbye...

I'll break the chains, I'm out of line
I'm living on my nerve, last days of ninety-nine
Nightmare, conspiracy, depression and lunacy
I need to feel, walled up inside
Locked up, messed up, maybe there is no tomorrow
All this thinking does me no good
I'll miss you my love, but it's about time that this world goes up in flames
