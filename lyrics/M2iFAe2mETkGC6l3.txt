Yeah
Last night I saw you
First time since we broke up
I tell you baby
It all came back to me
When I looked into your eyes there was something more
That I never really noticed before
Could it be?
That I was wrong
I was so wrong
When I realized
And turned around and you were gone

Chorus
If I say I want you back
Would you turn around and say you want me too
'Cause I say I want you back
This time I really mean it

It hurts so much
I want to tell you I changed for you
But I don't know what to say or do
We grew apart but I still want you in my heart
I believe it's time to make a new start
Could it be that I was wrong
And I was so wrong
When I realized and turned around and you were gone

Repeat Chorus

It's a thing
I want you
Want you back
Will you turn around and walk away
From me
It's a shame
I want you back
With me
Believe

Repeat Chorus

And if I say I want you back (I want you back)
And if you say you want me too (Do you really want me too?)
And if I say I want you back (I want you back)
And if you say you want me too (Do you want me too?)
And if I say I want you back (Want you back)
And if you say you want me too (I need you by my side)
And if I say I want you back (I want you back)
And if you say you want me too (Do you want me back?)
(Fades Out)
