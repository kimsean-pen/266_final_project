Brothers, sisters, young and old
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Jet black hearts and abandoned souls
We're all to blame for the wounded world

Brothers, sisters, young and old
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Jet black hearts and abandoned souls
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Lock us down in the catacombs
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Singing songs of forgotten hope
We're all to blame for the wounded world

So raise your white flags up
And let surrender eclipse the sun
Will we never learn?
We're pointing the finger
That's pulling the trigger
And in case you haven't heard
We're all to blame for the wounded world

Time ticks down to a tragic end
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Turn it back 'til we're great again
We're all to blame for the wounded world
Witch hunts cull the forever young
We're all to blame for the wounded world
We're the hell that we're running from
We're all to blame for the wounded world
We're all to blame for the wounded world

So raise your white flags up
And let surrender eclipse the sun
Will we never learn?
We're pointing the finger
That's pulling the trigger
And in case you haven't heard
We're all to blame for the wounded world

Alright, listen
I know this isn't something you're going to like to hear
Which is exactly why you need to hear this
Because we have failed our ancestors, ourselves
And the future inhabitants of the wounded world
You can't pull back the trigger and then point the same finger
You can't pull back the trigger and then point the same finger

So raise your white flags up
And let surrender eclipse the sun
Will we never learn?
We're pointing the finger
That's pulling the trigger
And in case you haven't heard
We're all to blame for the wounded world
