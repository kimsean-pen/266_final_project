Heavenly Father, watchin' us fall
We take from each other and give nothing at all
Well, it's a doggone shame
But never too late for change
So, if your luck runs low
Just reach out and call His name, His name

(Chorus)
Yah Mo B there, Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there, Yah Mo B there

Whenever you call...

(Verse 2)
Never be lonely, lost in the night
Just run from the darkness, lookin' for the light
'Cause it's a long, hard road
That leads to a brighter day, hey...
Don't let your heart grow cold
Just reach out and call His name, His name...

(Chorus) x 2

(Bridge)
Yah will B there
You can count on it brother
'Cause we're all just finding our way
Travelin' through time
People got to keep pushin' on
No matter how many dreams slip away
Yah will b there

Well, it's a doggone shame
But never too late for change
So, when your luck runs low
Just reach out and call His name
Just call His name

(Chorus/Vamp Out)
