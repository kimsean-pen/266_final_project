Oh, won't you stay?
Stay a while with your own ones
Don't ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones

'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
That you share
With your own ones

Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
Just one more day
One more day with your own ones

'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
That you share with your own ones

There's a stranger
And he's standing at your door
Might be your best friend
Might be your brother
You may never know

I am going back
Going back to my own ones
Back to talk
Talk a while with my own ones

'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
You share
With your own ones

Why won't you stay?
One more day
With your own ones
Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones

This old world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share
With your own ones
Oh tadatadatatadata
Tadtadattatatada
Tadananananananann
