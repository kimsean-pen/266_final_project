Top shelf
Girl is made of gold
Step into it
Close enough to feel the cold
While i wait
Days with no return
The sun won
Loves to make me feel the burn, the burn

She's my holiday only here for the game
My favorite mistake
Living inside the maze

Night fall, she's a painted face
Not the only one who wants to win the race
While I wait days become the same
Heart still, in the end she calls my name, my name

She's my holiday
Only here for the game
My favorite mistake
Living inside the maze

We can make it together
And I know
We can make it on our own

Always finds a way to run
Only when the heart begins to sound a drum
As we play I can feel the way
Half gone must be close to her escape, escape

She's my holiday
Only here for the game
My favorite mistake
Living inside the maze
She's my holiday
Only here for the game
My favorite mistake
Living inside the maze
