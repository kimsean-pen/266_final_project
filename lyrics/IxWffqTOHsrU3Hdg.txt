All your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down
Oh all your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down

She's just like you
So why keep doing what you do?
Why cut a friend
Why cruise that mean lean to an end?

You could have heel-toed
To another place
You could have peeled slow
To a better face

But your heart can't grieve (all your dreams are over now)
For your little dreams (and all your wings have fallen down)
I know your heart can't grieve (all your dreams are over now)
For your little dreams (and all your wings have fallen down)

Broke trust in two
Now no one's looking out for you
Why keep it cruel?
Why waste so much to play the fool?

And maybe I'm the fool but I think we'd find
That we could all be so so kind
If you'd just leave your tread mill powertrip behind
Oh, leave your treadmill powertrip behind

And maybe it's best that you're so, so blind
It's best that you're so, so blind
Because your heart can't grieve
I know your heart can't grieve

I know your heart can't grieve
What your eyes won't see
But you were my favorite moment
Of our dead century

I know your heart can't grieve
What your eyes won't see
But you were my favorite moment
Of our dead century

But all your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down
Oh all your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down

(All your dreams are over now)
Oh warfarin parepin
Unconfined undesigned
Undersigned bantering
Bartering bellowing

(And all your wings have fallen down)
Barracking blundering
Pillaging plundering
Living and lavishing
Hammerings harrowing

(All your dreams are over now)
Flourishing flattening
Levelling reveling
Wrecking and ravaging
Savoring savaging

(And all your wings have fallen down)
Oh warfarin parepin
Unconfined undesigned

(All your dreams are over now)
You've got me
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering

(And all your wings have fallen down)
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering

(All your dreams are over now)
(And all your wings have fallen down)
(All your dreams are over now)
