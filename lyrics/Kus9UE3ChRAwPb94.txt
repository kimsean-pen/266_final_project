Come and take me to the river
Hold my body, while I float away
Am I lonely? Or do I need you?
Cross my fingers that you are here to stay

Say what you need to say
Make me feel some type away
Do what you need to do
Make sure I don't run away
Hold me, you are holy
Touch my body before I lose my mind

Why don't we be friends? (Be friends)
Why don't we make out?
Why don't we pretend? (Pretend)
No one needs to know about
All the times that we hung out

Why don't we be friends? (Be friends)
Why don't we make out?
Why don't we pretend? (Pretend)
No one needs to know about
All the times that we hung out

When you told me you were too scared
And your mother wouldn't care for me
Tattoo my name all across your leg
Number seventeen, won't you promise me

Say what you need to say
Make me feel some type away
Do what you need to do
Make sure I don't run away
Hold me, you are holy
Touch my body before I lose my mind

Why don't we be friends? (Be friends)
Why don't we make out?
Why don't we pretend? (Pretend)
No one needs to know about
All the times that we hung out

Why don't we be friends? (Be friends)
Why don't we make out?
Why don't we pretend? (Pretend)
No one needs to know about
All the times that we hung out
