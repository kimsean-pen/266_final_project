You, were always just a friend to me
But I felt something change that night
Yeah, you brought me home on Christmas Eve
And we laughed so hard, we cried

That's the moment when we kissed
I closed my eyes and made a wish and...

I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
Your sweet love and kisses
Are just what I wanted
So, Merry Christmas, Darlin'

Snow, falls softly on the street at night
Making the whole world look brand new
The stars, were twinkling like the Christmas lights
As I moved in close to you

I knew right that when we kissed
That I had one thing on my list and...

I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
Your sweet love and kisses
Are just what I wanted
So, Merry Christmas, Darlin'

Don't need to check twice
To be naughty is nice
I can't have too...
Much of the stuff that you give me
You give me so good
One taste of your lips
One song that it slips
To all, all, all

I, I got love for Christmas
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I wanted, Darlin'

I got love for Christmas
It's just what I wanted
It's all that I wanted
Oh, your sweet love and kisses
Are just what I wanted
So, Merry Christmas, Darlin'
