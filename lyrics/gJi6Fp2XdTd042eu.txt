They say you like the torture honey
But don't forget the whip
My left hand's getting loose
But don't let me slip
You say you got some handcuffs
We'll throw out the key
I don't need a safe word
You ain't gotta save me

If pain's what you like
Torture me all night

burnin'
Love how you keep me hurting
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me

Would you pay them bills
Some brand new positions
Someone's gotta [?] be mean

whisper
She wanna hear me scream
Lookin' so smokin'
Honey I can hardly breathe

If pain's what you like
Torture me all night

burnin'
Love how you keep me hurting
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me

Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?

Got that arctic poison from your lips
Touch you with my burned out fingertips
I could learn to love, I must commit
If you want, then I'll submit
If you want, then I'll submit

burnin'
Love how you keep me hurting
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So ooh-ooh be mean, be mean to me
Be mean to me

Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
