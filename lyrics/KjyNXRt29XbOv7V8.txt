I guess I should stop
Looking out for you
Like I always do
When will you
Start looking out for me too
Instead of leaving me staring at my shoes
Just the way you're glancing at me
Something about you
Just makes me feel guilty for
Liking you
When you're with him
When you're with him
This is a love song for a girl
Who will never know it's about her
Know it's pretty stupid
But I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beaming that smile all the while
I'm all tripped up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope
...
When you're walking out in the snow
I say I guess I should go
And we're talking about someone else
When we should be talking about ourselves
It's the same old situation you've always got me waiting
Come on dear I think times a wastin'
Before we have to go back inside
And return to our normal lives
This is a love song for a girl
Who will never know it's about her
Know it's pretty stupid
But I'm much too shy to tell her
She's beaming that smile all the while
I'm all tripped up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope
