Life is getting harder day by day
And I I don't know what to do or what to say yeah
And my mind is growing weak every step I take
Its uncontrolable now they think I failed yeah

cause i'm not alone no no no
But I'm not alone no no no
I'm not alone

And I I get on the train on my own Yeah
My tired radio keeps playin tired songs
And I know that there's not long to go
Oh And all i wanna do is just go home
Yeah Yeah

But I'm Not Alone no no no
But Im not alone no no no

People rip me for the clothes i wear
Every day just seems to be the same
They just swear Yeah
They just don't care
They just don't care
they just don't care

Coz I'm not alone no no no
But I'm not alone no no no

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
No No
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
No

But i'm not alone
La La La La
Yeah Yeah
I'm Not Alone
