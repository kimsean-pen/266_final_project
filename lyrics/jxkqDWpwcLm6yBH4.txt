When I awaken
And I'm achin'
'Time for sleepin', yeah

When I'm sayin'
Time to go and
I've been hurtin', yeah

When I'm layin'
I'm still trying
Concentrating on dyin', yeah

You're right as rain
But you're wrong to blame
Agreed my crime's the same

My sins I'll claim
Give you back shed pain
Go find a place for own shame

So you can deal
With this thing unreal
No one made you feel any hurt, yeah

Body's movin'
Only provin'
No one needed to move

Still believin'
Yet mistaken
All God's children, yeah

And I must say
I was stupid
Selfishly she consumed, yeah

And you must change
Patterns all we trained
Or n'er regain peace you seek

Now you hear me
For the things I see
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah

Throw out
Blow up
Hold in

Show fine
No signs
Grow blind
