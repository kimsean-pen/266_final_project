When you first saw
You should've known
There was no more
Than what was shown
The way the flowers
Will bloom at night
The fancy thinkin'
That makes it right

What you see is what I am
Take a look, at the invisible man
Satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
When you don't know just what you see

From purple flowers
Shoot silver sparks
In solid air
They make their mark
Across the room
Before they fall
Through the eyes
Of antique dolls

Take a look at what I am
You're looking through an invisible man
Satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
When you don't know just what you see

The dusty book
That no one reads
The pages torn
The letters read
Upon the cover
These words are penned
Please go away
Don't come again

Oh what you see is what I am
You're looking through an invisible man
Satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
When you don't know just what you see
So take a look at what I am
You're looking through an invisible man
Satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
When you don't know just what you see

So take a look at what I am
You're looking through an invisible man
Satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
When you don't know just what you see
