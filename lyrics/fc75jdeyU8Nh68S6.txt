Waking up together on a Sunday morning

Turning me insane, can't do this no more
Call me on the phone and say that you're alone
Have you got a minute?
I know you're feeling good cos it's a Friday night
And it's only a couple lies you say, every time
Trying to justify the feelings that you hide
But you know it ain't right...
Cos I know

Oh, she's the greatest at it
And I know
Oh, she's the greatest at it
And I know that it's all my fault
She's the greatest at it
And I know where it all went wrong
She's the greatest at it
