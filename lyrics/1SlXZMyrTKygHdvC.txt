The barflies chatter
They don't know any better
It doesn't matter
You're hanging on to a dream
To your own dream
They're laughing and talking
One or two are clapping
But nobody's walking
And you're hanging on to a dream
To your own dream

Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one day

Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one day

A beer glass shatters
The bar staff clatters
It doesn't matter
You're hanging on to a dream
To your sweet dream
You don't hurry, don't worry
They're going to know your story
It doesn't matter
You're hanging on to a dream
To your sweet dream

Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one day
