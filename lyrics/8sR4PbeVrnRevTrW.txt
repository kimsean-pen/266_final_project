How does it feel
When everyone surrounds you
How do you deal
Do crowds just make you feel lonely
What do you say
When people come and try to pin you down

Aquaintainces smile
But that's no understanding
How after a while
You keep falling off the same mountain
Try to explain it
But nothing really gets them that high

Steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
This moment's madness is sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
Who knows you might find something to last

Emotion's a game
Saved up for a rainy Monday
But you laugh just the same
'Cause it's been pouring on Sunday
Call up your numbers
And never let the zeros bring you down

How does it feel
Is time too heavy to hold
Whatever you decide
For the moment is holy
Whenever you slow down
To see life is passing by
Steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
This moment's madness is sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
Who knows you might find something to last

You can steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
This moment's madness is sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
Who knows you might find something to last

A matter of feeling
A matter of feeling
(He comes to steal the world)
A matter of feeling
(He comes and steal the world)
A matter of feeling
(He comes and taste the blood)
A matter of feeling
