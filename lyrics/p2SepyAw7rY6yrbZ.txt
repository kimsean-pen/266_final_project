Is this the kind of sound that you want to hear?
Is this the kind of vibe that you want to feel?
Well I'm the type of guy that you'll never fear
You can do your thing then come near
Maybe I'm, I'm caught up in the thing that you know I like
See we can make time baby overnight
Or we could make a grand escape
We can roll high on our break
I'm all about the look that you're giving me
I'm all about the dance moves you're letting free
I'm all about a sweet sounding loving spree
So listen for my melody
Maybe I'm caught up in the thing that you know I like
We can make time baby overnight

We could make a grand escape
And we can roll high by the way

When we come down oh yeah yeah yeah

We'll be dreaming safe and sound
You better know why

Check it one time, what's the deal?
