FALSE BELIEVER
TRUE DECEIVER
SHE'S THE FEVER
...STEALING THE LIFE FROM YOU

hail to the slave, to the fool
who obeys the order
will he stand - all the worlds misery
king of the word, yet unheard
still keeps - laughing, waiting
like a dog - for the day he'll be free

FALSE BELIEVER
TRUE DECEIVER
SHE'S THE FEVER
...STEALING THE LIFE FROM YOU

hail to the grave, to your wet dark eternity
on the ground, between bones, gold and pearls
countess of lies, in her eyes dark eternities
welcome home, here at the end of the world

TRUE DECEIVER
SHE'S THE FEVER
