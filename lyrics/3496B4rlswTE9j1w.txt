The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
As we slowly awaken from slumber

The malpractice of the spirit ends (gateways)
When the gift is once again attained (gateways)
No rules or restraints are longer valid (gateways)
When the ancient future is reclaimed (gateways)

No rules or restraints are longer valid (gateways)
When the ancient future is reclaimed (gateways)

It's all there for the eyes that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen of what lies submerged (breeding)
Untouched within us (bleeding)

The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution and sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forevermore (forevermore)

Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own masterplan
