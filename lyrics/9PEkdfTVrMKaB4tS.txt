This reign must end right now
How can we still stare at the stars
How can we listen to the sun
My friends, my men, till the end
Our luminous gladius swords will be our words

The cry of the broken wings
The crack of the burning skins
To the ones who were once slaves
Thou shall kill them and dig their graves
I swear I'll rise again
Lucifer in this very war
The parade of the dancing flames

The revenge of the fallen star
I swear I'll rise again
Lucifer in this very war
The parade of the dancing flames

The laughable dimension of such a tragedy
The miserable scum that erodes the rock of destiny

(These woods will burn from a blaze
Which lives in the heart of a thousand eyes)

We'll tread upon this mountain
From this place we call Inferno

The primitive philosophy of a tyrannic group of cowards
Will never rule on this pure and fragile place we call earth
The time of slavery must end right now
This time of tyranny must be the last
We will crush the weaver, he will taste the bitter
And on this unreachable fortress we call Heaven
He will taste the anger of the gods we are
We will sit on this throne
And the fallen god, the exiled one
Will rest in a place we call Inferno
We will sit on this throne
We will sit on this throne
We will sit on this throne
We will sit on this throne
