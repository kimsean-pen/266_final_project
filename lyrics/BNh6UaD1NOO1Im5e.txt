You're really getting close to me
So far so close to me
So point me to a yes no yes no yes
Don't tell me maybe

You think you're there to hold my hair
To come and drag me home
You think you're gonna dress me up
From head to toe
And then I'll go?

Well I'm a hard hard habit to break
I'm a hard hard habit to break

Your mind's playing tricks on me
You got me where you want me
I'm going left right left right left right
Through the city

And I can't get enough of the heat
And I can't shake it off in a beat
You gotta fix me up or let me go
And I'll quit it

It's a hard hard habit to break
It's a hard hard habit to break
A hard hard habit to break
It's a hard hard habit to break

It's a hard hard habit to break
It's a hard hard habit to break
A hard hard habit to break
It's a hard hard habit to break

Always talking about change
What change, what change?
Maybe when the lights fade
Maybe it's my mistake
Always talking about change
What change, what change?
Maybe it's your mistake
Always talking about change
What change, what change?
Maybe it's our mistake

What change? What change?
