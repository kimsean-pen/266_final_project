I could watch you for a lifetime, you're my favorite movie
A thousand endings, you mean everything to me
I never know what's coming, forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop running to me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

My cinema

Stars spell out your name like in a science-fiction drama
Romance growing like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing, forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing all my dreams and take me under

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up, get down
Lose that sound
Drop the bass

My cinema

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
My cinema...
