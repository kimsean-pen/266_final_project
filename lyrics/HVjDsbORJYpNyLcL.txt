These words were thrown together
When I still had my faith in hand
Kept it in my back pocket
With the change I had to spare

Swim through the skies when it's night
Let the stars be my sea breeze
I love when the record echoes
Reminds me of the trees

But I shouldn't have to say this to you
No, You know how to live life

This compilation of sayings and tunes
Means everything to me now
I cut me open
But you did all the pouring out

I've discovered more and more
Of this world that I've been calling mine
I don't care what it takes
Blood, sweat or all my time because

I shouldn't have to say this to you
No you, know how to live life

And I shouldn't have to sing all these tunes
No, you make me feel alive

I'm not one to point fingers
But you got me in a bind
Ripping through all our nights
All es aside

Swim through the skies when it's night
Let the stars be my sea breeze
I love when the record echoes
