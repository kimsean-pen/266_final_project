She's no good for me, I know that she's a wildflower
She's got a restlessness, a beautifulness, a thing about her
But here I am again calling her back
Lettin' her drive me crazy

It's like I love this pain a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Something 'bout her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away, it's like I love this pain

It's just an on again and off again situation
It's a striking match, a tank of gas combination
But here I am again lightin' it up
Knowing that she'll just burn me

It's like I love this pain a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Something 'bout her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away, it's like I love this pain

It's like I love this life
When nothing's right, yeah something's wrong
It's like I'm just not me
If I can't be a sad, sad song

It's like I love this pain a little too much
Love my heart all busted up
Something 'bout her, we just don't work
But I can't walk away, it's like I love this pain

Oh yeah, it's like I love this pain
I can't walk away, oh no
It's like I love this pain
