Hiding away
Losing the day
As if it doesn't really matter
Saying goodbye
Scared to say why
Afraid it will shatter our world
Show me some faith now
Trust me somehow

Why are we keeping our secret?
Why are we hiding ourselves away?
Anywhere we can hide away
I don't wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe what I say
I won't let you
Hide away

Where do we go?
How do we know
What we're ever really after?
Sometimes it's clear
When you are here
Nothing can shatter our world
I need some faith now
To trust you somehow

Why are we keeping our secret?
Why are we hiding ourselves away?
Anywhere we can hide away
I dont wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe what I say
I won't let you
Hide away

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm losing
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm okay
Turn around, look around, go around in circles
Dont run away, drift away, don't hide away

Why are we keeping our secret?
Why are we hiding ourselves away?
Anywhere we can hide away
I don't wanna fake it
I wanna make you believe what I say
Oh what I say
Believe what I say
I won't let you hide away
Hide away

Hiding away
Losing the day
As if it doesn't really matter
