I wish to forget everything i know
I will burn it lighting up darkness of my soul
I wish to erase your face from my head
I will burn your image together with myself

I wish to forget everything i know
I will burn it lighting up darkness of my soul
I wish to erase your face from my head
I will burn your image together with myself

Show me some more pain, baby
Give me some more pain, baby
Show me some more pain, baby
Give me some more pain, baby

I don't know how to stop you
I don't know how to stop you

I don't know how to stop you
I don't know how to stop you

I wish to forget everything i know
I will burn it lighting up darkness of my soul
I wish to erase your face from my head
I will burn your image together with myself

I wish to forget everything i know
I will burn it lighting up darkness of my soul
I wish to erase your face from my head
I will burn your image together with myself

Everyone is coming after me paranoia
I can't let you get inside my head
everyone is coming after me paranoia
I can't let you get inside my heart

Show me some more pain, baby
Give me some more pain, baby
Show me some more pain, baby
Give me some more pain, baby

I wish to forget everything i know
I will burn it lighting up darkness of my soul
I wish to erase your face from my head
I will burn your image together with myself
