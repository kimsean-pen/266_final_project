The seconds run away
Minutes pass,
At speeds we can't run at

As hours start to fade, deep into the night
I'm not in the mood for laughing

It's slipping away
There's nothing we can do
It's slipping away
There is no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh in these 24 hours wish the clock had no hand
In 24 hours, we still have time
For 24 hours, you're still mine

If this isn't real
Just can't deal in the way you can say I was always a cynic
Hopeful for a while
Lost in denial
I wish this could last forever

It's slipping away
There's nothing we can do
It's slipping away
There is no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh in these 24 hours wish the clock had no hand
In 24 hours, we still have time
For 24 hours, you're still mine

I wish these 24 hours would never end

I... I... I... I...

I won't tell on, I won't tell on, I won't tell on
Cause in 24 hours, cause in 24 hours
You'll be gone, you'll be gone, you'll be gone
In 24 hours

In 24 hours, we still have time
For 24 hours, you're still mine

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh in these 24 hours wish the clock had no hand...
