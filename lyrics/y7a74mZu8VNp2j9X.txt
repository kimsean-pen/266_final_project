You'll be who I could be
And I'll keep finding reasons
To say what you don't say
For fear of people seeing who you are

Keep on talking and we might just make it through until tomorrow
I'm moving up into the night with no light, Oh won't you follow
We are falling through the sky, we are half way to the stars
What do we ever know what can we really see
Oh are you really you, or is it only me

And the Earth's a distant point among the stars
How will we ever find just where we are

You're not feeling so good
But you don't talk about it
So that I won't have to tell you
That I don't know why I feel, how I do

Keep on breathing through the pain, don't hold on to the sorrow
I'm reaching up into the night, just say we will make it 'til tomorrow
(Just say we will make it 'til tomorrow, now)

We are falling through the sky, we are half way to the stars
What do we ever know, what can we really see
Oh are you really you, or is it only me
(Well I just don't know now)

We are falling through the sky, we are half way to the stars
What do we ever know, what can we really see
Oh are you really you, or is it only me

And the Earth's a distant point among the stars
How will we ever find just where we are
