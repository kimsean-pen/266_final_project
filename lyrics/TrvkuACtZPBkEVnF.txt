Me and her 'till night, look at my babies shining eyes
Look at her highlight shining brighter than bright skies
Under common hopes I hope you could get to know
The green lights showed the unknowns
So exploring we should go

Notice, maybe
Neon Baby
You could sway me
Being wavy
Neon City Baby
Neon City Baby
Maybe you could sway me
Maybe you could sway me
Neon baby in her neon city
Neon baby in her neon city

I've been looking for you and your absence was made clear
I don't even know you but I know I want you here
Pink cars take us far just if you know who you are
Dressed up like a star, you were staying after dark

Notice, maybe
Neon Baby
You could sway me
Being wavy
Neon City Baby
Neon City Baby
Maybe you could sway me
Maybe you could sway me
Neon baby in her neon city
Neon baby in her neon city
