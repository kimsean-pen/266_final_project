Young renegade

I am the fury of a bomb
Agent Orange, tiger print, Vietnam
A thousand words in the cracks of my palm
Just one death sentence written in a fucking song
We are the ones, the ones you're always calling faceless
But we got the guns, the guns are gonna make you face it
Don't even run because the run is getting wasted
Young renegades, we're gonna make some changes

You're just a live grenade, young renegade
You're just a live grenade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade

Coming out the gate, I got your number, better pray
It's not a revolution but they both sound the same
Yeah, you're always starting fires, put 'em out a little late
You're, oh, such wicked motherfuckers, can't take the pain
It's sunset in ghost town, hold your Holy Ghosts now
There's blood in the streets with your grave underneath nailed
I'm hanging by a thread, I got a crucifix bed
My eyes are open wide, so I'll sleep when I'm dead

You're just a live grenade, young renegade
You're just a live grenade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade

Man down, shots ringing out loud
Man down, shots ringing out loud
Man down, shots ringing out loud
Man down, everybody, get the fuck down
Get the fuck down
Get the fuck down
Get the fuck down
Get the fuck down

You're just a live grenade, young renegade
You're just a live grenade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade
Young renegade, young renegade
