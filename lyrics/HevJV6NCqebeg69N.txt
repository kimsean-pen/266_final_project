She said, "I know that there will come a time
When I get nothing from the blood and the wine"
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine

You'll find me a silver chain
They'll deny me and whisper my name
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine

I'll carry myself half way blind
Through each and every doorway I can find
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna lose my lonely mind for you

Well there's an answer if only I knew
It'll carry my heart home to you
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm digging the dirt for a sign
And pray to let my little light shine

I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you

Tell a woman that's beautiful, lie for me
Make all of your promises right in front of me
Keep me in line but do it honestly
Make it real, make it slow, stay alive for me
Come on, babe where the line goes dead
I'll be fire, I'll be rain, I'll be joy, I'll be dread

Come on, baby don't be shy
All I want is you and I
Out on the street I'll be every face
There'll be no man alive
That can take my place

Give it up, let it go
The sooner you do the sooner I'll go
I'm digging the dirt for a sign
And I'll pray to let my little light shine
And set my heart on the line

I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine
I'm gonna sell this soul of mine

I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
I'm going to lose my lonely mind
I'm going to lose my lonely mind
I'm going to lose my lonely mind for you
