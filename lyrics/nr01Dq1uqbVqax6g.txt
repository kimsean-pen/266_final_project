Holy great guillotine, I gave you a part of me
Not my head, not my chin
Holy great guillotine you ate almost all my dreams
I'm condamned to lose something I cherish

And to let it all go in a mutual contentement
Watching the floor getting closer to my face
And there has been no trial, something to get what happens to me
Nothing but silence
And silence signs my end
Death to guillotine

We lose and share the emptiness of all passions and cares
In the end am I just allowed to breathe?
Among no head bodies, other no head boides
On our necks a better people would sail and they would have fun for sure
And we would endure it without wanting to know more
My end will be where it's supposed to be
I know
