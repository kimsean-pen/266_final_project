Someone to hold me tight That would be very nice
Someone to love me right That would be very nice
Someone to understand Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand To be a team with me

So nice, life will be so nice
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand And samba through life with me
Someone to cling to me Stay with me right or wrong

Someone to sing to me Some little samba song
Someone to take my heart And give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to Give love a start with me
Oh, yes

That will be so nice
I could see you and me
That would be nice

Should it be you and me I could see that would be nice
