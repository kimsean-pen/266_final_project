I got sixteen days
One for every time I've gone away
One for every time I should have stayed
You should have worn my wedding ring
I got sixteen days
Fifteen of those are nights
Can't sleep when the bed sheet fights
Its way back to your side

The ghost has got me running
The ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away from you.

The ghost has got me running
The ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away from you.

I got sixteen days
Got a Bible and a rosary
God, I wish that you were close to me
Guess I owe you an apology

I got sixteen days
Fifteen of those are nights
Can't sleep when the bed sheet fights
Its way back to your side

The ghost has got me running
Yeah, the ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away from you.

The ghost has got me running
Yeah, the ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away...

Old tin cups, little paper dolls
All wrapped up, in ribbons, bowed with hearts
Old tin cups, and little paper dolls
All wrapped up, in the ribbons of your heart

The ghost has got me running
Yeah, the ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away from you.

The ghost has got me running
Yeah, the ghost has got me running
Away from you, away from you, away from you.

Sixteen days
I got sixteen days
It's like before I hang
