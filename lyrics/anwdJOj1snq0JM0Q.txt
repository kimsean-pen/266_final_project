Heavenly choirs, the sinners in fear
Harvest the souls for salvation is near
Grant me a place and I'll hallow thy name
The earth it will perish in thunder and rain
The earth it will perish in ashes and flame

Dies irae, iudex, salva me
Dies illa, pie domine
Dies irae, iudex salva me
Dies illa, pie domine

Days of damnation, the end has begun
Worthless the prayers as judgement goes on
Open the book, whom to bless, whom to blame
The earth it will perish in ashes and flame

Dies irae, iudex, salva me
Dies illa, pie domine
Dies irae, iudex salva me
Dies illa, pie domine

We will prevail
On the fields of paradise
Burn out the past
From the ashes we will rise
Wipe out the dark
And the children of the dawn
Live on, live on, live on

Heavenly choirs, a new day begins
Gone is the nightmare, forgiven the sins
Grant me a place and I'll hallow thy name
Remember forever the days of the flame

Dies irae, iudex, salva me
Dies illa, pie domine
Dies irae, iudex salva me
Dies illa, pie domine
