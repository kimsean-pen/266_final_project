Welcome to the anarchy
Enigmatic entity
The grand illusion destitution
Infecting one and all
Forces they're oppressing me
Lords of mediocrity
An iron will shall break the still
Some will rise and some will fall

Oh yes, we ride
Through stormy skies
Of fire

Evil lies that mesmerize
From the dragons' tongue they slide
A fury lashes from the ashes
Never losing sight
Pounding down the wicked ones
Tyrants now are overcome
A final yell from hounds of hell
Rising we unite

Oh yes, we ride
Through stormy skies

The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
And stand together one and all
And when the flames grow dim
Look within
Unleash the fire

A time will come when all will see
In the end, it's just a game
Time will tell when all these things that have come to pass
Still remain

The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
And stand together, one and all
And when the flames grow dim, look within
Unleash the fire
