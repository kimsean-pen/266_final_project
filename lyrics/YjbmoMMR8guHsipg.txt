I'd like to thank you for being there when I needed you most.
It was nice of you to stick around.
I'd also like to thank you for watching me drown,
Not saving me, or bringing you down.
I should have walked all the way home,
Forgotten all your names, and not answered the phone.
Well I guess this brings us to where we are now.
I can't stand you anymore.
Can't you get that through your head?
I think it's funny that you talk like we are still best friends.
I think I'd rather be dead.
Tell me what you want, because what I want is what you can't have.
I'll take everything.
I'm taking it back.
Call me what you want, because I'm not calling you anymore.
I'll take everything.
I'm taking it back.
All those times I told myself I'd never end up all alone,
I guess I lied.
