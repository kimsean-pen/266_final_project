There is a hunger that is stirring up inside of your mind
It keeps on twisting and a turning to the sound of desire
You wanna taste and see and drink from the cup
You cannot rest, there is no giving this up I'll spin a silver string and hang up all the stars that you find
I will move Give you rhythm
Speak in tongues
Til you listen, listen, listen
You feel my words, they hit like thunder coming down from the sky
You wanna give in to the song that keeps repeating inside
it goes 'Oh can you save me from the sickness of love'
Tussle with angels but you're not strong enough
Rest on my shoulder til it's over and the battle is won
I will move Give you rhythm
Speak in tongues
Til you listen, listen, listen
I will move Give you rhythm
Speak in tongues Til you listen, listen, listen
