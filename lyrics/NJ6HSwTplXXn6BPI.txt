in the song I use the term "galvanistic".
Galvanism is the concept... the obsolete scientific theory that there
was a kind of electricity flowing through our bloodstreams and that
was our life force.
I used the term because I came across it in Mary Shelley's
'Frankenstein'. And that book is sort of an exploration of the theme
of creating a character, of making up a person.
So I used the term "galvanistic" to allude to that book,
as a sort of symbol of how I, like, created you as a character,
and I'm pretending that I know a lot more about you than I actually
do. And also to refer to the fact that I've fallen in love
with the characters you've created in, uh, your body of work

You should've seen my cursive back then
Every letter was above the line
My p's and q's raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

Most people are jokes but you're so real
Most of the time that I use the word "you"
Well you know that I'm mostly singing about you

You swore you'd never use
The face that your ex invented
So let's meet up in
Uncanny valley

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve
