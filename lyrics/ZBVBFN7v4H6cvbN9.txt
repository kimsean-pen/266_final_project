Come, I show you the end
You're damned
Cause no one can defy me
Just watch these maddened creatures
Like you they all once reached out
A war to win
But I'm gonna burn this vision down

Call me the father of lies
Just watch these saddened creatures

They've turned you into the savior
You hold your ground
Until your last breath
You'll twist then turn

And now you're falling down
The battle rages on
And forever and ever

The wheel will turn
Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now

The wheel will turn
And I'm driven to obsession

All these dying men
Try to understand
They all followed the sign
It's the cycle's end

There's no hope
For a while
From the ashes arise

Can't save her
Enjoy the flames
So precious, so pure

And you try
You're sure to fail
And madness
Is the price you've to pay

Unholy grounds
Witness your last breath
The cycle ends

And you're stumbling
The battle willl go on
And forever and ever
It's raging on
Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession

I am reborn
The wheel will turn now

The wheel will turn
And I'm driven to obsession
Through the flames you'll see me

You'll be mine, believe me
This is the moment I long for

Wake up there's a storm to face and
Right now while the land lies bleeding

It's me, I conquer your soul
Still I'll be on my way
Oh light, let me out here I pray

And over and over and over again
There is no beginning
No end
This war, it still goes on
And forever and ever
I will return

Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another you ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession

Light - so serene
True source reign over me
There's no end and
There's no beginning
"You will never be alone"

There's no end and
There's no beginning
"You will never be alone"
