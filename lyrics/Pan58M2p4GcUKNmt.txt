Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road!

Black thunder
White lightning
Speed Demons cry

The Hell Patrol...!
The Hell Patrol
Night riders

Death dealers
Storm-bringers
Tear up the ground!
Fist flying

Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The Hell Patrol...!
The Hell Patrol

Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke Then they'll vaporapeize you

Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you!

Chrome monsters
Steel warriors
Soul stealers
Ripping out hearts!
They're Devil dogs
The Hell Patrol...!
The Hell Patrol
