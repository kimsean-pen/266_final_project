I will still be up by fall
I'll still be up by fall either way
Still be up by fall
I'll be still to hear the call either way

Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place and
Save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Wait for grace
It's time

Mind over time
Mind over time

Sleight of fate
And borrowed clothes
Songs of places
No one knows
Draped in lace we all lean over
To greet the great
It's time

Mind over time
Mind over time

Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place
And save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Greet the great its time

Mind over time
Mind over time
It's mind over time
It's your mind over time
