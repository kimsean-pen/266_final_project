True ring true ring
Gonna make this crystal sing
Other ways other ways otherwise
We're just going backward

True ring true ring
Gonna make this songbird sing
Get a load get a load
Get a load, get a load of it

True ring true ring
For the one that's listening
Sound advice, sound advice
Empty hands and tired eyes

True ring true ring
Giving up and giving in
Little arms little arms
Little arms on a big body

And I hold you to the light to see
And keep you safe inside of me
Oh, restore this crack so

I want nothing tonight to hold but you
I keep this pillow it's such a poor substitute
For a soul, a soul,
For a soul, a soul

Truth told, truth told
Tear the tear and fold the fold
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up when it's yours to hold
Truth told truth told
When you hit the ground just roll
Bend your knees bend your knees, bend your knees
When you're lifting these

And I hold you to the light to see
And cotton wool you safe in me
Oh, restore this crack so

I want nothing tonight to hold but you
Keep close the cold compress
Such a poor substitute

For a soul, a soul
For a soul, a soul
