Something better than this
Someplace I'd like to go
To let all I've learned
Tell me what I know
About the kind of life
I never thought I'd live
Till the ugly truth
Showed me what it did

Let it pass on the side of the road
What a friend could tell me now

On a borrowed dime
In a different light
You might see what
The other side looks like
In a random room
Behind an iron door
Kick an empty can
Across an empty floor

Let it pass on the side of the road
What a friend could tell me now
