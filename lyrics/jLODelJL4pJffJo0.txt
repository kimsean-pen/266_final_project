Everybody, get up
Everybody, get up (hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
(Turn it up)

If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf (hey, hey, hey)
Maybe I'm going blind (hey, hey, hey)
Maybe I'm out my mind (hey, hey, hey)

Okay, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature (meow)

Just let me liberate you (hey, hey, hey)
You don't need no papers (hey, hey, hey)
That man is not your maker (hey, hey, hey)
And that's why I'm gon' take a

Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted

I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

What do they make dreams for when you got them jeans on?
What do we need steam for?
You the hottest bitch in this place

I feel so lucky (hey, hey, hey)
You wanna hug me (hey, hey, hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (hey, hey, hey)
Hey! (Everybody, get up)

One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to (come on)
Go, from Malibu to Paris, boo
Yeah, had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you

So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable

In a hundred years not dare, would I?
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair for you (you like it)

So I'm just watching and waiting
For you to salute the truly pimping
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimping

Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work?
Hey! (Everybody, get up)

Baby, can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur

No more pretending (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause now you winning (hey, hey, hey)
Here's our beginning (hey, hey, hey)
I always wanted a

Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it

I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

Everybody, get up
Everybody, get up
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
