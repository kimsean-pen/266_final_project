This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives

Cold night, step into the light
I'm getting in touch with the way I'm feeling
One talk, listen to the walls
Ghost in the hall so I keep on thinking

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Yeah, I don't sleep at night so maybe

When I get up
I get down
When I get lost
I get found
Like the man on the moon
And the pace of the groove
And the feel of the beat
And the sand on my feet
'Cause I will always be the man that you love
When you're gone
And I pray that you're safe
To a God I confess
That I came from his flesh
If it keeps you alive
Keeps you safe in my eyes
Keeps your love on my mind

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Yeah, I don't sleep at night so maybe

This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives
This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives

When I get up
I get down
When I get lost
I get found
Like the garden of truth is the eden of youth
And the fear in my head
And the fire in my chest
Says I will always take your hand
When you're lost and you stray
And I beg you to stay if means that I'm brave
Until death do us part
God, it tears me apart
Know this love is my verse from my heart 'til I burst

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Yeah, I don't sleep at night so maybe

This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives
This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives

Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the Starcruiser
And now a message from your captain:
"Hello, can you hear me?
Is this thing on?"

I wanna make you happy
I wanna learn your name
I wanna make you famous
If only in my heart and brain
I wanna make decisions
I wanna travel the world
I wanna know you mean it
When you say that you'll stay for good
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you happy
Even when you make me sad

This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives
This is our song
I sing it at night
These are the best days of our lives
When you come home
Everything's right
These are the best days of our lives

This is our song
