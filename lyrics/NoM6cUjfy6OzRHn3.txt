Maybe it's been years
Since I genuinely smiled
And maybe it's been years
Since I wanted to be a part of anything
Well, lately I've been good
You know, I've actually been great
Man, I even laughed a little today
Oh, so strange, so strange

Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay

I thought it was my right
To be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years
Being a misery factory

But something had to give
I had to finally see the light
I think at 23
It's time to practice what I preach
And what I preach is

Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay

All my wasted hope
I let go
When I should've held tighter
And now when the sun is out
I let it burn
Not afraid to feel it shine on me

It's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay

Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out, so

Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay, to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out, so

Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
Tell me it's okay, tell me it's okay-aye-ay
