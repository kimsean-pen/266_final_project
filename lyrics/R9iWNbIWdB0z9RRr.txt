You can hold her hand
And show her how you cry
Explain to her your weakness
So she understands
And then roll over and die

You can brave decisions
Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking
Everyone else's permission
Then run away and hide

Or you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your eyes
No need to know
What you're doing or waiting for
But if anyone should ask

Tell them I've been licking coconut skins
And we've been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by
To forgive our sins
And relieve us our doubt

Oh, you can hold her eggs
But your basket has a hole
Or you can lie between her legs
And go looking for
Tell her you're searching for her soul

You can wait for ages
Watch your compost turn to coal
The time is contagious
Everybody's getting old

So you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your eyes
No need to know
What you're doing or looking for
But if anyone should ask
Tell them I've been cooking coconut skins
And we've been hanging out
Tell them God just dropped by
To forgive our sins
And relieve us our doubt
