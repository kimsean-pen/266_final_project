Over there at the lavender fields
Where the world's still full of purity
Won't someone please move in with me
This old farmhouse shall be our shelter

Oh but it's so hillbilly
So barbarian, so barbarian
Alone here I will drown in ignorance
They try to, try to break me
Tear me down into pieces
With their thinking of low capacity

Between wine yards and mulberry trees
Where the world's still full of clarity
It could be the best thing for our families
To grow a huge bewitched garden

Oh but it's so hillbilly
So barbarian, so barbarian
Our children will have that creepy accent
They try to, try to break us
Try to crush all diversity
Really small towns are catastrophe
