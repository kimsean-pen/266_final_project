all my friends are dead to me now
are dead to me now
all the little things I wanted to shout
I wanted to shout

'cause the life I had in my dreams
was part of me now
if I waited for this long
I knew you wouldn't have let me out

blurry images of your face
captured in dreams
that smoke risin' in front of your eyes
careless teens

and we sung our favorite songs
in our heads
yeah, my best friends
and my secret loves
to me
are all dead
