Little did I know my throat would close
And my body night sky
Little did I know the sound of your voice
Could shake me to my pride
(This has to hurt)

And lately I've been thinking how I need to talk to you
And babe, I feel our miracle fade in you
I feel that miracle fade

I'm watching you die a little
Watching you cry a lot
Haven't we been deserving
Maybe we're not
Any other time my eyes are dry
But I am an ocean
(This has to hurt)

And lately I've been thinking how I need to talk to you
And babe, I feel our miracle fade in you
I feel that miracle fade from you
I feel our miracle fade in you
I feel that miracle fade

Don't tell me its not my fault
Inside there's that part of me
Hold my hands, we feel so small
Nothing ever happens until it happens to you

And babe, I feel our miracle fade in you
I feel that miracle fade from you
I feel our miracle fade in you
I feel that miracle fade
