I wanna tell you somethin'
Never called your bluffed till you called my lie
I've got to show you something, mmh
If you wanna show face we can suit and try

Oh I want ya below me
You're so tight
Tried to cut mine
Shit was too tight
Loaned this shit a long time
Before I cosigned
And let the lights shine
(Trust me)
Bad habits in my hometown
Tryna take a break
Can't take a break
Till my brothers stop livin' like they ain't safe
Breaking bread on a gold plate

Who really knows?
How do we know?
I wanna know
The sign that we go

Raise up
Raise up
Raise up on 'em, huh
Raise up
Raise up on 'em,
Huh
Huh

It's still happenin'
To me, I'm askin' you
There's no need to change

Oh I want ya below me
You're so tight
Tried to cut mine
Shit was too tight
Longed this shit a long time
Before I cosigned
And let the lights shine
Trust me
Bad habits in my hometown
Tryna take a break
Can't take a break
Till my brothers stop livin' like they ain't safe
Breaking bread on a gold plate

Who really knows?
How do we know?
I wanna know
The sign that we go

Raise up
Raise up
Raise up on 'em, huh
Raise up
Raise up on 'em

Uh, we're so happy here
Tell them that I was here
The summer stays fadin'
