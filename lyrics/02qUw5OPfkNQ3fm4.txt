Your golden lies feed my role
This forgotten space race
under my control
Who's returned from the dead?
Who remains?

You wanted more than I was worth
You think I was scared yeah
And you needed proof
Who really cares anymore?
Who restrains?

I don't love you and I never did
I don't love you and I never will
