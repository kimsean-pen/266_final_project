you know i only like it when the lights' turned out
silhouette lover in my clique right now
turns her back to me like she's over it
we don't need to talk about it baby you can show me it
and we were coolin in my car in the parking lot
i had you forever in a second like it never stopped
you know i've got you like down
solitary ways
i was in a past life
everything safe
i couldn't collect myself
i can't remember what i was saying but i remember how it felt
one time, i'm the one
passionate summer
it's my fault that yr gone silhouette lover
and i want you right now and so bad
i was projecting myself onto you in the back
i was pretending that i'm yr man
baby i'm a fan
don't push me away
take me in again

there's a california goth with my jacket on
02 chick in the background
just pass it around, it's going down
eyes on me with the cameras out
and i'm like tell me why you like me through yr cell phone
tell me why you like it when i lose control
just pass it on my way
and take if you want it
it's cool but it takes from my heart and it breaks it

and i'm upset because i lose everything
i lost my title and my passport, everything
i tried to see you and i flaked on everything
i left my mark on it mistakes on everything
and i keep secrets like you don't even know me
i went through everything for you to control me
and when i left the club i crashed into everything

heart like 17

eyes like passionate

i lose everything
