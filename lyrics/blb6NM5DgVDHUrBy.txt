What if I told you that I think you're perfect?
Beautiful sky in your eyes, it's so worth it
I know
You make me feel alive

What if I told you that I'm in forever?
Nothing to hide, yeah, I'll go wherever
You would go
You make me feel alive

And I'll be hanging on
Every word you say to me
Hanging on a feeling that I get
'Cause you make me

Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder

And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time it's something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time

And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside, it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life

What if I told you that I'd never hurt you?
Always be there for you to hold on to
I know
You make me feel alive

And every single second's
A lifetime memory
I'll be holding on each moment
'Cause you make me

Laugh a little louder
Love a little harder

And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time it's something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time

And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside, it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life
And I feel alive when I'm with you
When I'm with you
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Every time it's something new
Never knew what love could feel like
Until I walked away the first time
And I feel alive when I'm with you
Deep inside, it's something true
You're the only reason I fight
You're the best thing in my life
