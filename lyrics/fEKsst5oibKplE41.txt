You were the mother of three girls so sweet
That stormed through your turnstile and climbed to the street
But after conception, your body lay cold
and withered through autumn and you found yourself old

Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
He took a lover on a faraway beach
while you arranged flowers and chose color schemes

Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
Can you tell me why you have been so sad?

The girls were all there; they traded their vows.
The youngest one glared with furrowed brow
as they tenderly kissed and cut the cake.
The bride then tripped and broke the vase
The one you thought would span the years
So perfectly placed below the mirror
Arriving late, you cleaned the debris
and walked into the angry sea;
It felt just like falling in love again.
And it felt just like falling in love again.

Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
Can you tell me why you have been so...
