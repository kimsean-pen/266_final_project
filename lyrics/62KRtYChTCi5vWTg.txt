Leave me to my own devices
It's better when your coca-cola eyes are out of my face
I checked your phone and no surprises
She's grinning from ear to ear in purple lace

So take your orchids
Elsewhere, elsewhere
I loved you to death
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running around over there
Yeah you're running round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running round over there

I'll miss your t-shirt in the rain
The one that makes you look like Gerard Way
Eating grapes in the back of the party
Throwing hands 'cuz she drank your Bacardi
I know it's kinda dumb but I'll miss the way you dressed all punk
With the black and the suds and the ripped up clothes
Bet she loved your tough guy frown

So take your orchids
Elsewhere, elsewhere
I loved you to death
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running round over there
Yeah you're running round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running round over there
And now I don't really care
'Cause you're running round over there
