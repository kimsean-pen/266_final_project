Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby?(Hmmmm)
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby? (Ohhhh)

Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby? (oohh yeah...)
Before I let you go before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby?

Lately I been thinkin'
Somethings going on
'Cause you got an attitude
You're not in the mood
Like you use to...

Girl I can feel it
When I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
And I'd be the one to blame
I don't want to lose your love (hmmm)
I don't wanna say bye-bye (oh nooo)
True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine... and mine
Before I let go...

Before I let you go away
(Can I get a kiss?)
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
(Baby, before I go can get a kiss goodnight?)
Before I let you go away
(Oh baby baby)
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
(Listen baby...)

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We'll make sweet love baby
I know you'll feel it too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I so certain of:

I don't want to lose your love (don't wanna lose ya)
I don't want to say bye-bye (don't wanna lose ya)
It's always the little things
I remember and I can't just let it slip away... slip away
Before... (oh ohhh)

Before I let you go away
(Baby, I wanna know, I wanna know...)
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
(Before I go, I go, I go away.)
Before I let you go away
(I just gotta know, can I have...?)

Don't wanna lose ya
(Baby I get so lonely sometimes I...)

(Baby, my heart is broken, sometimes I need you right now... I don't)
Don't wanna lose ya
