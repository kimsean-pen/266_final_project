Little Jizzo
Little sweetest glob
The restrictions is gone
The worries is gone

When the time is right
I will love you like I should
When the time is right
Come back, come back, come back

The rose elf is stabbed
The rose goblin is vacuumed o-u-t, out

When I look at my thighs
I see death, it's great
I love abortion
You are too good for this life

When I look at my thighs
I see death, it's rad
I love abortion
You are too good for this life

A hyena infected with rabies
Would've given birth to you
There are too many important things
I can't be for you

We will meet again
When the time is right
Or jump head first
Against the side of an outhouse

Don't do it, little Jizzo
Don't be as a frog, don't be like a crab

When I look at my thighs
I see death, it is great, I love abortion
When I look at my thighs
I see death, it is great, I love abortion

You are too good for this world
When I look at my thighs
I see death
I love abortion

I love abortion
Let all you have lived be as if a dream
Let all you have lived be as if a dream
Let all you have lived be as if a dream
