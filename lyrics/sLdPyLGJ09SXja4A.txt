So what's the part that you're playing?
Should I have guessed who you're blaming?
Do I know him? is it me you're naming?

You ain't got time, you ain't got nothin'
You live on a rock, all covered in ocean
We'll all be dead in a few years time
Well, I am fine

Into the darkness we all go
Out of the white light and the friends you know
We'll be spread out like a mushroom cloud
Spread all around

We're all just sheep being herded
Well ain't that the truth, it depends how it's worded
Pay no mind to the others in line you're hurting

All men's thoughts can kill you like cancer
They smash through your head like a German Panzer
It won't be long 'til you'll all be gone
