Evoke the lifesblood of man
The virus we have become
Shedding the skin and bone
Of this species, dead and jaded

In my callous nature
All pity is buried
Flaunt your feigned empathy
Forgotten

I cannot breathe amongst this affliction
Ever more oppressed

Tear away the leeches
And with them, we'll bleed
Strip bare the land, defraud
Or drown within forever

The dust settles on barren dirt
In our chains, we decay

Bound by deceit
The mortal consumed
Beyond death
We are lifeless

The axiom of being
Infinite
