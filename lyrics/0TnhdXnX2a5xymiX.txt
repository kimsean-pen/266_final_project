He is the fire
The keeper of the iron forge
A master of his art
Guardian of the flame (Flame)

He is the thunder
The anvil and the mighty sword
He wields his hammer to forge
The throne of chains

A burn mountain
Home of a God
And we all know his name
Hephaistos

He is the fire God - Hephaistos
A master of his art - Hephaistos
Keeper of the ancient flame - Hephaistos
The betrayal is his pain - Hephaistos

He is the ember
Blacksmith of the Pantheon
A master of the forge
Weapons for the Gods (Gods)

He is the lightning
Thunder and the falling rain
Hear his mighty roar
From the mountain deep

A burn mountain
Home of a God
And we all know his name
Hephaistos

He is the fire God - Hephaistos
A master of his art - Hephaistos
Keeper of the ancient flame - Hephaistos
The betrayal is his pain- Hephaistos

My blood
My pain
My pain

Forge the iron
Fire and flames
Forge the iron
Fire and flames

He is the fire God - Hephaistos
A master of his art - Hephaistos
Hephaistos
Hephaistos
