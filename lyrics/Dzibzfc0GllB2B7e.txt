The only way I could feel okay
Turn it up, let the music save me
If I need to ease my pain
When everyone says my world is changing
I'd rather be deaf, I'd rather be dead than bored out of my mind
I'd rather be deaf, I'd rather be dead than bored out of my mind

If I make sound, it better be loud
Till my voice is blowing out
What if one day everything changed
Will these words have any use to me
I didn't make it here to let anyone drag me down
If I make sound, it better be loud
If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now

So you don't understand a word I say
Either way its probably worth listening
If this whole thing's fading away
You better know it's going down swinging
I'd rather be deaf, I'd rather be dead than bored out of my mind
I'd rather be deaf, I'd rather be dead than bored out of my mind

If I make sound, it better be loud
Till my voice is blowing out
What if one day everything changed
Will these words have any use to me
I didn't make it here to let anyone drag me down
If I make sound, it better be loud
If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now

If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now
If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now
If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now
Turn this riff up!

If I make sound, it better be loud
Till my voice is blowing out
What if one day everything changed
Will these words have any use to me
I didn't make it here to let anyone drag me down
If I make sound, it better be loud
If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now

If rock and roll's dead you can kill me right now
