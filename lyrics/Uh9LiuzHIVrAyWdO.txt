No need to whine boy
Like a wind up toy you stutter at my feet
And it's never the time boy
You've had too much wine to stumble up my street
Well it isn't a problem
Nothing we can't keep between the sheets
Tell me you're mine love
And I will not wait for other bedtime treats

Is there something you lack
When I'm flat on my back
Is there something that I can do for you?
It's always something you hate
Or it's something you ate
Tell me is it the way that I touch you?
Have you found a new mate
And is she really great
Is it just that I'm much too much for you?

Don't feed me a line boy
I can hear that voice you use upon the phone
And there's no need to be coy
That is something you can do upon your own
Well it isn't a problem
Nothing we can't solve so just relax
Am I on the wrong train love
And will I have to tie you to the tracks

Is there something you lack
When I'm flat on my back
Is there something that I can do for you?
It's always something you hate
Or it's something you ate
Tell me is it the way that I touch you?
Have you found a new mate
And is she really great
Is it just that I'm much too much for you?

I really want you to
I really want you to
