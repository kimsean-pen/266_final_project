Maybe I've been searching too far around
I've been hoping I've been praying for a girl like you to come around
And though it seems I don't know what you mean
Am I coming on too strong?
I've been hoping I've been praying for a girl like you to come around

Maybe I've been hanging around for too long
I've been hoping I've been praying for a girl like you to come around
And when I leave, treat yourself to tease, I will always come back
Oh I'm always coming back
Man, I'm always coming back

If not tomorrow, when will it be?
When can I see you, please?
