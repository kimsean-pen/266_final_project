Spirits, taking me with you this night
Shadows, revealing what I left behind
There is no one else living in this loneliness (no one else)
How to share the pain when joy got lost in time?

Ghosts, wearing the face of a child
Memories finding me
Reminding what once was mine
When all hope is gone
They reach into your soul (when hope is gone)
How to share the pain, feel alive

Take me
Let me break free
I'm the soldier who lost the fight
Together we'll embrace the morning light
Find us in a garden
With our ashes covered white
Together we will fly into the night
