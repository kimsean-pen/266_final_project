This weight is so unbearable, caving my lungs
All my life seems to be flashing in
Front of my eyes (in front of my eyes)
Run away from all the pain, all the pain of life
Run away from all the pain of life

Ways of devotion turn to obsession, open your eyes (open your eyes)
I want you to see what you've done to me
Crying out those eyes (crying out those eyes)
Run away from all the pain, all the pain of life
Run away from all the pain of life
Bring my end (bring my end) to an end

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me

Razors kiss the vein overdose for pain
A 12 gauge cross kisses the forehead a savior in a shell

Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown

Run away from all the pain of life
Bring my end (bring my end) to an end

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me
Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me
