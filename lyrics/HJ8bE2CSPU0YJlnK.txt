Well, there's only so much I can take
Half of the day
And it's harder for some to admit
Their irrational ways

I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna have to deny myself of all the things I need
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna have to insist upon the things that I can't change
Oh, I can't change

Well, it's one hell of a push and a pull
Breathing for you
Cause you took all the space that was left
Inside of this room
But...

I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna have to deny myself of all the things I need
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna have to insist upon the things that I can't change
Oh, I can't change

I can't change...
I can't change...
Oh, I can't...

Well, there's only so much I can take
Half of the day
And it's harder for me to admit
My irrational ways
But...

I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna have to deny myself of all the things I need
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna have to insist upon the things that I can't change
Oh, I can't change
