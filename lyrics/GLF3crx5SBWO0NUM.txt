I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm stayin
And make some extra love
That I can save to till tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me
I need something bigger then the sky
Hold it in my arms and know its mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To find me
Call it heaven?

Ooh, I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need to someone to remember me
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere that I can burn?
