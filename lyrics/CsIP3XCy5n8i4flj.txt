We all know quite a number of people
Who have everything that it would take to be happy
And they are not happy
Because they want something else
Or they want more of the same

And we all know people
Who have lots of misfortune
And they are deeply happy
They radiate happiness
(To be)
(Want to be)
Why?
Because they are grateful
(Want to be)

My heart beats
My heart goes
My heart

To be
Be
Want to be
Want to be
(My heart beats)

Want to be
Want to be
My heart beats
(Want to be)
(Want to be)
My heart goes
My heart
