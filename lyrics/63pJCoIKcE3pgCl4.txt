Paint Me SilverPaint me silver and call me Herman Hesse,
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again.
The power to devour all the creeping things he made,
slip up in the shower singing ' home-made lemonade',
bring me Louis Cartier I need a diamond halo,
for me and my seven billion brothers.

I never know what to do, babe,
but that's not nothing new, babe,
I' m the champion of the few, babe,
but I never know what to do, babe.

Soldiers and the children still shivving in the Jago,
and whoever runs the ship for the others.

I never know what to do, babe,
but that's not nothing new, babe,
I' m the champion of the few, babe,
but I never know what to do, babe.

Save me.

Paint Me SilverPaint me silver and call me Herman Hesse,
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again.

I never know what to do, babe,
but that's not nothing new, babe,
I' m the champion of the few, babe,
but I never know what to do, babe.
