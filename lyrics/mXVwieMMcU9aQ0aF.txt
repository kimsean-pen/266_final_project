Night falls overhead
I'd venture time is here for the words of mortals

Don't you leave us left behind - surrender!
Have you gone and lost your mind?

Hey, are you afraid
To say what you're trying to say?
Remain... It's a warrior's way!

Last call as the situation dies
With every choice a view or a world of poisons

Don't you leave us left behind - surrender!
Have you gone and lost me?

(trust me!)

Hey, are you afraid
To say what you're trying to say?
Remain... It's a warrior's way!
Remain... It's a warrior's game!

Hey, you are bound in flame?
You must burn away.

Hey, are you afraid
To pay what you're trying to pay?

So much now... so much now... so much now...
