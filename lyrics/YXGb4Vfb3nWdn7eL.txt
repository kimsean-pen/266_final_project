I'm not gonna waste this
This opportunity's mine
I'm sick of complaining
About a beautiful life

How did we get here?
Did we forget all the things inside?
And how do we stay here?
Do we embrace all the things tonight?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I wanna yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

For my entertainment
You tell a whimsical lie
To keep me complacent
You knock me down with a smile

How did we get here?
How do we pretend everything's alright?
And how do we stay here?
Do we erase all the fear inside?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I wanna yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
These walls are gonna collide
I wanna yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over and we're older

Yeah
So take me
But go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this
Seed grow

Until we finally call this home
So take me
But go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this
Seed grow

Until we finally call this home
If I was to die tonight
Would it tear you apart?
Would you yell it from the rooftops down?

Until it's over
And you're older
I feel so alive tonight
You've got me feeling sublime
I wanna yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older
Like sugar and cyanide
Our worlds are meant to collide
I'm gonna yell it from the rooftops down
until it's over and we're older
Yeah
