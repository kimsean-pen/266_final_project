You and I,
We were on to something,
Now I'm left with nothing at all
And I
Wanna hear your echo,
Got to be the name you call

Every time I do it like that,
Turns out you'll crawl right back

Do you wanna play your heart until it cracks?
Love is not red, it's black

I love it,
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on,
I love it!
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on,

You and I,
We were on to something,
Now I'm left with nothing at all,
And I
Wanna hear your echo,
Got to be the name you call

Whoa! Wanna hear your Echo, oh oh
Wanna hear your Echo

I see trouble and I know
Every thing I do is one big show
Even though you make me glow
I have to move on and grow

I love it,
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on
I love it,
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on

You and I,
We were on to something
Now I'm left with nothing at all
And I
Wanna hear your echo
Got to be the name you call

Whoa! Wanna hear your echo
Wanna hear your echo

I love it,
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on
I love it,
So what are we gonna do?
Your mind is running on

Whoa! Wanna hear your echo,
Wanna hear your echo
