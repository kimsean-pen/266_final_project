Kept it shut, so no one would know
Kept it hush, like you're supposed to
Funny how, we share what we see
But we're so afraid to talk in deep

Yeah
When it gets hard to love yourself
Feel like you're stuck under water
I'll be the one swiming over
When you get dark, swear I can help
Don't leave me hanging
I'm pulling so you open up and let me in
Let me in
Open up and let me in
Cause you were the one swiming over
When I was the one under water
Water

When I've been rough, hiding at home
Put me on, onto your shoulders
Crazy how, you've been there for me
Now let me be the one who help you breathe

Yeah
When it gets hard to love yourself
Feel like you're stuck under water
I'll be the one swiming over
When you get dark, swear I can help
Don't leave me hanging
I'm pulling so you open up and let me in
Let me in
Open up and let me in
Cause you were the one swiming over
When I was the one under water
Water

It's harder for me, but easy for you to forget
But that's something that could be good
Cause we're all made a phase
Can't be hooked up by regrets

When it gets hard to love yourself
Don't leave me hanging
I'm pulling so you open up and let me in
Let me in
Open up and let me in
Cause you were the one swiming over
When I was the one under water
Water
Cause you were the one swiming over
When I was the one under water
Water
