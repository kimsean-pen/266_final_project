Baby it's real

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it
(Ohh)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it

Innocence is what I've got
It'll take true love to hit the spot
Can't control my every move
When we're together, we're in the groove
(Groove)

Don't care about your other girls
(Your other girls)
I'm the only one that rocks your world
Gonna have to keep me satisfied
(Me satisfied)
'Cause my innocence won't be denied
No

Baby it's real
(Baby baby)
So so real
(Baby baby)
That I just can't explain
(Baby baby)
The way that it's making me feel
(Baby baby)
So so real
(Baby baby)
Baby it's real

(I just can't let you go)
Baby, oh baby, it's real
(Keeps me hanging on)
Baby it's real

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, now hit it

My heart is under lock and key
Together we can set it free
Ain't no mountain that we can't climb
All you gotta do is take your time
(Take your time)

Said I'm giving you my all and all
(My all and all)
Be careful you don't slip and fall
It's my innocence that makes you yearn
(Makes you yearn)
For that perfect gift you can't return
Ooh

Baby it's real
(Baby baby)
So so real
(So so real)
(Baby baby)
That I just can't explain

The way that it's making me feel

Oh baby it's real
(Baby baby)
So so real
(Baby baby)

(Baby baby)
The way that it's making me feel
(Baby baby)
So so real
(Baby baby)
Baby it's real

The way you're making me feel
You know that baby, baby
