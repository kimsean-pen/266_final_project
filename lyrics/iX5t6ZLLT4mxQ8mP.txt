[I believe the title was "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States"]

Absolute destruction is the battleground we're given
Strip away the fabric of a thousand years of livin'

Get Out! Get Out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get Out! Get Out!
Bringing down the USA is what it's all about

Revolution's our solution to the life we're given
Retribution is the way of life that we are livin'

Get Out! Get Out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get Out! Get Out!
Bringing down the USA is what it's all about

[The trumpet of freedom has sounded]
Great Satan

[We've begun inoculating troops and first responders against ballistic airports]

Desecration of the concentration camps we live in
Occupation of our nation just won't be forgiven

Get Out! Get Out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get Out! Get Out!
Bringing down the USA is what it's all about

[The trumpet of freedom has sounded]
Great Satan

[Kill. Kill Kill. Kill. Kill.]

[May God continue to Bless America]
