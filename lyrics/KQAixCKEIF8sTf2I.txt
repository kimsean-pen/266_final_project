Tell me have you ever lost somebody?
Well I have and it hurts so bad. I wanna off somebody
I lost a brother he was 18 years old, he was 18 years old

Rest in power, rest in power, rest in power

Now he's living in the sky, so he's looking down on me
Forever having my back and watching over me
But everytime I hear the name, my heart breaks
And everytime I feel the pain, there's no escape

Rest in power, rest in power, rest in power
Gone but not forgotten 'cause you're looking down and watching

Now you're living in the sky so I do it in your name
I'm banging 2 pac's, how long will they mourn me
