Why does everybody always seem to talk some bullshit?
And no one ever says what they mean
It seems like all they wanna do is talk talk talk
To hear the sound of their own voice

I've grown so cold
I've grown, why haven't you?

It's safe, but it's really fucking sad to say
You never put your faith in me
You either talk about it
Or you learn to walk around

I've grown so cold
I've grown, why haven't you?

Right away
Right away we knew it
Right away
Right away it was obvious
Something had changed
Something has made you feel some type of way
Now I can't feel a thing

I've grown so cold
I've grown, why haven't you?

And now I flow like water
Just never under a bridge
And with and icy shell
I just keep moving
I'll just keep moving on

Like moment recaptured just moments to late
I don't feel the same way
I'm moving on
Well I'm moving on
'Cause this is not my dream
This is not how it's supposed to be
I just took to long and I know

I'm not gonna lie or feed you bullshit
I'm not gonna lie
