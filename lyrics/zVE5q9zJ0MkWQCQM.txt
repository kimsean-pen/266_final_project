Yelled:
Get out of it

I saw two shadow men on the Vallance road
They said they'd pay me for your address
Oh, I was so bold
I said, you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show?
You's a way to mean no
Well, they didn't like that much, I can tell you
They said, sunshine, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
And they chased me up three flights of stairs
Caught me in the lift, I sighed and said hello
But you're impossible

But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
He'll wind up like Joseph, bloody in the hole
It's just like she's in another world
How they suit each other, oh
But you never get close
It's impossible

Saw the same two men on the Cally road
Said now they'd double their offer, I was so bold
To say, you see these two cold fingers, I know
These crooked fingers I show?
Oh, you's a way to mean no

But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
He'll end up like Joseph, bloody in a hole
It's just like she's in another world
And how they suit each other, oh, no
Oh, you never get close
Unstoppable

It's just like we're in another world
How we suit each other, oh, no
But you never get close
That's close enough
