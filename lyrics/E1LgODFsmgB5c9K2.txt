Lift me up
Take me high
Take me higher than i've been before
I need time
Time to find
The road to my destiny
Heaven help me
On account to hapiness is where I wanna be
Stealing my mind
I'm running outa time
So heaven lift me up

Scared to laugh
Scared to cry
For fear of
My own contridiction
Maybe I should try
And cover morrow reasons
For god sakes
Heaven lift me up

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got to much of my own to say
Never thought that I'd be standing
At the gates of heaven
At the gates of heaven
Heaven lift me up
Come on and lift me
lift me up (ahhhh)

Take me high
Above the clouds where the birds fly
I'm feelin free
Let heaven do the work for me
Looking over
This crazy city where we live in
we've seen it done it
It's just the way I've been

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got to much of mine own to say
Never thought that I'd be standing
At the gates of heaven
At the gates of heaven
Heaven lift me up
Come on and lift me
lift me up (ahhhh)

Take it move it feel like it just
hopin' you find what you're lookin' for
Baby (baby)
What you lookin' for
Take it move it feel like it just
hopin' you find what your lookin' for
Baby (baby)
What you lookin' for

I won't fail (I won't fail)
I won't break (I won't break)
No way (No way)

At the gates of Heaven
(Never thought that I'd be standing)
At the gates of Heaven
(At the gates of heaven)
At the gates of heaven
At the gates of Heaven
(At the gates of heaven)
At the gates of Heaven
(Never thought that I'd be standing)
At the gates of Heaven
(Heaven lift me up)

Take it move it feel like it just
Hopin' you'll find what your lookin' for
Baby (Baby)
What you lookin' for
(Repeat till fade)
