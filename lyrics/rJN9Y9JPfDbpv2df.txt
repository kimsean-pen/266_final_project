A perfect snowflake
Our needle in the hay
A four-leaf clover
on a lovely summer's day

That's Anna, sweet Anna
Dreams are coming true
One in a million, that is you

A glistening diamond
Our bright and shining pearl
A shooting star above
a rainbow, that's our girl

It's Anna, sweet Anna
Dreams are coming true
One in a million, that is you

Our search was long
Our search was hard
But we would not give up
Now here you are

(Don't go now)
This could be your home
(Don't go now)
You won't be alone
You have our everlasting love

That's Anna, sweet Anna
Dreams are coming true
One in a million, that is
One in a million that's
One in a million, that is

YOU
