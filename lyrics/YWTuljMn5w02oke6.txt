I remember nights out when we were young
They weren't very good, they were rubbish
Running round Highroyds isn't fun
Just teenagers testing their courage

Standing outside nightclubs in the snow
Is not very cool or impressive
They let in all the girls from the year below
No need for IDs with those dresses

Got news from afar
From a girl who knows who we are
She's still got my dinner money
She can keep it

Never had a fight that we haven't lost
But not very tough or athletic
Once I had a boxing champ in a headlock
When he gets out I'll regret it

Got keys to a car
Picked up a girl from Boston Spa
For fast food and the cinema
It's not worth it

Got word from down south
Well, Ian heard about us word of mouth
Haven't much stayed in touch
Since Highroyds

Let it go, let it go and if I'm running I won't know
'Cause no one's gonna tell you but a friend
But he's gone and he is gone and everybody went along
And nobody was left here in the end

Got news from Uncle Hew
Through a second cousin once removed
It's too late there's a housing estate
It's called Highroyds

Got a text from an ex
She wants to know when we're in London next
Will you write a song about me
I don't think so
