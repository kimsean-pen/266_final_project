Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

You made my day
When a dozen red roses came my way
Warmed up my heart
'Cause I know you're thinking of me from afar

Press a petal to my lips, feels like your kiss
Don't you know that's what I miss
To smell the sweet perfume
Reminds me so much of you
There's nothing else that I can do

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

It's been so long
I know our two hearts are strong
There's not a moment
That my spirit isn't in it, don't you know it?

Try to occupy my time
Remember you're mine
Talking to you on the line
Try to get used to this
But long distance loving is
Leaving me to dream of your kiss

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

When I'm feeling scared and lonely
Wonder if I'm still your only
Tell me now, soft and slowly
It's gonna be alright, you'll be by me side

Press a petal to my lips, feels like your kiss
Don't you know that's what I miss
To smell the sweet perfume
Reminds me so much of you
There's nothing else that I can do

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
Holding on to each other, you and me
You will be my only lover eternally

Count the days till we're together, one two three
Though it feels like forever, we will be
