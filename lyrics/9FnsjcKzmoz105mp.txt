Slow decay
I won't stop fighting yet

Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight
I am in the air
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the coast of hypnotic we go

I only call them
When I know
I don't see them

Who do you think that is there?
I show beyond
So beyond compare
I always fall in these fights
I know why
Always fall in these fights
I know why
Controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there?

Only call them
When I know
I don't see them
I only call them
When I know
I don't see them

Slow decay
I won't

Who do you think that is there?
By interest strike
Leading out of despair
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the coast of hypnotic
That won't stop now
If making a taste for me
You're making your own way
Now who do you think
I said, who do you think now?

Oh, how I pass the days
You know how much I care
Oh, through the wax and waning
You know I will be there
Oh, at your faded grace
I know now not to swear

Slow decay
I won't stop fighting yet

Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight
I am in the air
I always fall in these fights
I know why
And from the birth strings of life
I go right
But controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there?

Only call them
When I know
I don't see them
I only call them
When I know
I don't see them
