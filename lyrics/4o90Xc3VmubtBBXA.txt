Another night on the straits
All bug-eyed and babbling
Out on the corner
Of 7th and 8th
I'm in the business of living
Yeah, that's something I'd say
All I need is a new friend
I'm only five blocks away

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer

Beware the man who has everything
Everything that he wants
You can spot him from a mile away
In his gold chain and only one pair of socks
I'm out here testing the maxim
That all good things have to stop
The bar closes at 5
But the big man is just opening shop

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer
But now I'm in trouble

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
I need some company
I swear, just one more night longer
