I like to keep my stories untold
You like to push me around 'til I fold
Our paradise of fools gold
I'd like to know

All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
We'll be, could be?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
Can we be free?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?

By now you're used to my tears
Enough to fake being sincere
We're just draining us dry
This love is draining us dry, dry

I'd like to know
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
We'll be, could be?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
Can we be free?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?

We'll be, could be?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
Can we be free?
All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?

All I wanna know
Is it all for nothing?
I've compromised too many times
The same reprise won't work this time
This love is draining us dry
I'd like to know
All I wanna know
