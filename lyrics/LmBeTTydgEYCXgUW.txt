There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide
What you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
'Cause you make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations
Getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin?

You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that?

You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're steppin' on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love you, love you
With a little L you know
That's the way you make me love you, yeah

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you, with a Little L

You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you, with a Little L

You make me, does it,
With a Little L, that's what you, do
You make me, love you,
With a Little L, that's what you, do
You make me

You, make me,
Love you with a,
Li-ttle L, that's what you do

You, make me,
Love you with a,
Li-ttle L, that's what you do
