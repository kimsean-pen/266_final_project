Oh, what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you
That needs to run with the wind?
And the fire, of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from

The garden of the dark
Stay out of the shadows now
Looks like the change is on
Tommorow's never gone
Today just never comes
Go on and jump, yeah

Into the hurricane
You will forget the pain
It's only there
To excersize your mind

Looking at the world
When you open up your eyes
You've got to see promises they made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silence screams

You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine
Oh, what are you gonna do

When every part of you
Just needs to catch that wind?
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way

To lead you from
The garden of the dark
Looking for the world
When you open up your eyes

You see you got a visible change
They're only lies not what it seems
I hear your silent scream
You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Take it where you've never been
Make it assume when you don't know
You're living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
