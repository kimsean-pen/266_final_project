Please give me a second grace,
Please give me a second face,
I've fallen far down, the first time around,
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly

Please tell me your second name,
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are,
I just need your star for a day

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny,
For it's really too hard for the fly
