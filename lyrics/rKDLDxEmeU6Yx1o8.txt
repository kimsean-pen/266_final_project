Forgive those little rabbits, I forgive you now.
No it's not little, not little too late. And they forgive you too.
I see you in my dreams, you've regrown all your teeth.
You're sniffing flowers all day long and laying in the sun.

Your scent was loving garbage, I really miss it now.
Your silence, snore is deafening.
How am I going to sleep now.
I see you in my dreams, you've regrown all your teeth.
And my mom thinks while she's gone, chasing rabbits all day long.

I think I love you, I know I love you, I always loved you.

My mom still thinks she hears you.
Is it just the wind?
I can see you floating through stardust, happy and fat again.
Did I see you in my dreams? You've regrown all your teeth.
And my mom thinks while she's gone, chasing rabbits all day long.

I think I love you, I know I love you, I always loved you.
