(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)

You and I (You and I)
Two of a kind (Two of a kind)
A meeting of minds
The time of our lives
The perfect night
Out of sight
As I look in your eyes
Never felt so right
Never felt so right

I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you

(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)

Night and day (Night and day)
Come what may
There's always change, nothing
Stays the same (Stays the same)
Who can say? (Who can say?)
What will come our way
Leave it all to fate
Let tomorrow wait

I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
Let the music play on down the line tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

The perfect night
Out of sight
As I look in your eyes
Never felt so right
Ooh yeah

I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really want tonight to last forever (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really want tonight to last forever (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)

I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you...
