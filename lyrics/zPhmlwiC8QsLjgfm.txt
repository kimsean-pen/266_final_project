So it is over; the last day of yearning
Laugh at your dreams while your bridges are burning
Commander of dread; the nightmare nears
Obstructer of wealth, cauldron of fears

LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED

Where is the void, where is the essence...?
The whirling fear, an ominous presence
Crystallized death, an imminent factor
Vacuum the breaths, blow the reactor

LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED

ROCK!

Alright!
Stranded by interference
Entangled golden dreams
Rights are slayed and discarded. UGH!
Deranged paths and empty needs... OH!

UGH!

Listen!
Torn by the menace
Morbid rites abide
Remnants of Cain!...
In vast abundance... OH!

NOCTURNO OCCULTO!

THRASH!

Iron your curtains and rover your lands -
The older the fences, the weaker the lamb
Insistent myriads - nothing you've learned
On your knees - the back of the universe's turned

LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED

So it is over; the last day of yearning
Laugh at your dreams while your bridges are burning
Commander of dread; the nightmare nears
Obstructer of wealth, cauldron of fears

LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED
LEAVE! NO! CROSS!
LEAVE NO CROSS UNTURNED

UGH!
