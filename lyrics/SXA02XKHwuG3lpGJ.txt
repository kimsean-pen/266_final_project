hidden in your every move
are the words that you will never say
stars and moons are not your style
I've known for a while this is not your way

I hear you

I do know you very well
and our time will tell if I read you right
it can be so very hard
looking for a dark horse in the night

I see you

I do know you very well
and I will until you can prove me wrong
maybe I'll find you are not
anything like what I've thought all along

don't think so

one day you'll say what you mean
and will I be seen for a cloud of dust
now I've nothing left to say
and I'll find my way by your light of touch

I'm with you
