I only see myself reflected in your eyes
So all that I believe I am essentially are lies
And everything I've hoped to be or ever thought I was
Died with your belief in me so who the hell am I?

I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know what's real without you
How can I exist without you?

I'm wand'ring 'round confused, wondering why I try
The more that you deny my pain, the more it intensifies
I pray for someone to ache for me, the way I ache for you
If you ignore that I'm alive, I've nothing to cling to

I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know whats real without you
How can I exist without you?

I stare into this mirror, so tired of this life
If only you would speak to me, or cared if I'm alive
Once I swore I would die for you, but I never meant like this
I never meant like this, no, I never meant like this

I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know whats real without you
How can I exist without you?

How can I exist without you?
How can I exist without you?
