Love is a matter of taste
Don't let it go to waste
Love is whoever you wear
Put it on or lay it bare

Love is wherever you want
Pushing on the brightest star
Love is the perfect song
Dance to it all night long

Whatever you feel, it will always be real in love
Whatever you do, it will always be true in love
Whatever you need, it will always be free in

Love is a pair of heels
Click, click and you're on the ceiling
You're dreaming, believing
And everything's so revealing

Love is having nothing to hide
Taking a walk on the wild side
Love is a disco ball
Shining on us all

Whatever you feel, it will always be real in love
Whatever you do, it will always be true in love
Whatever you need, it will always be free in

Love, love, love, love, love
Whatever you need, it will always be free in love

Love is a day in bed
Lying in your lover's t-shirt
Lying in your lover's t-shirt
In love

Whatever you feel, it will always be real in love
Whatever you do, it will always be true in love
Whatever you need, it will always be free in

Love, love, love, love, love
Whatever you need, it will always be free in love
