Bring me the head, rip the heart from my chest
Cause the person that you knew, that you loved is dead
No cure, so tonight is the night
I'm going back on the deals with the devil I signed
Disappear into darkness

Somehow I will break and destroy you
And reveal what was hidden in plain view
This disguise was designed
To deflect all that I couldn't show you

Shatter the glass, step away from the crash
I am slowly suffocating from the weight of my past
No cure for how I feel nothing inside
Cause there's no black in this world dark enough to prescribe
Born in blood

Somehow I will break and destroy you
And reveal what was hidden in plain view
This disguise was designed
To deflect all that I couldn't show you

I'm cursed right to the bone with apathy
A guest in my own home is how I feel
Dear sanity, I miss you so, come back to me
"There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths beneath the surface"
Time is the enemy

When will I let go
Time is the enemy
I can't take the pain, there's blood in the drain
And now the urge is getting stronger and I'm going insane
There's a monster in my head it couldn't be any clearer
For I am truly terrified by the man in the mirror

Somehow I will break and destroy you
And reveal what was hidden in plain view
This disguise was designed
To deflect all that I couldn't show through
To the dearly departed, I'll devour the fate you can't undo
Disappear into darkness
Born in blood, I'm not like you
