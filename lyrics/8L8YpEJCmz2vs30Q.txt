I'm unwell, thanks for asking
Don't mind me 'cause I'm just passing by
In this life, been a while
Thought that you forgot, but that's alright
How've you been? Glad to hear it
Just one question if you can bear it
Do you ever miss me, too?
'Cause I spend my days still thinking of you

Should I take the pill to numb the pain?
Change the chemicals inside my brain
I worry I won't be the same
But I guess that that's the point

Can you medicate a broken heart?
Make your tragedies a work of art
Medicate a broken heart
Build your walls up just to rip them apart
Is this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?
I really couldn't say
Can you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?

Doctor's smile, kill me with kindness
And don't ask about the side effects
Swallow hard, kills sadness with science
But the aftermath might make you sick

Should I take the pill to numb the pain?
Change the chemicals inside my brain
I worry I won't be the same
But I guess that that's the point

Can you medicate a broken heart?
Make your tragedies a work of art
Medicate a broken heart
Build your walls up just to rip them apart
Is this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?
I really couldn't say
Can you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?

Whoa, whoa
Oh, medicate it away
Whoa, whoa
Oh, medicate it away

They say give yourself a break
They told me to medicate
I don't wanna medicate

Oh, can you medicate a broken heart?
Make your tragedies a work of art
Medicate a broken heart
Build your walls up just to rip them apart
Is this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?
I really couldn't say
Can you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?

Whoa, whoa
Oh, medicate it away
Whoa, whoa (Whoa)
Oh, medicate it away

Oh, medicate it away
Oh, medicate it away
