I bet you'd wish that you had played me now
Played me now
Played me now

I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now

You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now

You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out

Been there, done that, seen it all before
Opened all these windows when I closed up all our doors
Spilling your feelings and slipping on these kitchen floors
Try to work it out but working out just got me sore
All your secrets kept in chambers
Close closed doors on my porch, now I'm hanging by hangers
Could've curled your toes instead of pointing them fingers
So now we're back to how we started out... As strangers

I bet you'd wish that you had played me now
Played me now
Played me now

I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now

You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now

You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out

Been there, done that, seen it all before
Opened all these windows when I closed up all our doors
In your basic car with your basic heart
And we're basically apart in your basic apart... ment
Meant to say something as you walked out the door
I'm so done with all your gimmicks, I ain't begging no more
I love the way you hate me, I hate the way you made me
I love the way you slave me but I hate the way you played me

I bet you'd wish that you had played me now
Played me now
Played me now
I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now
You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now
You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out
