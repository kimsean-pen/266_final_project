Tears
Running down her cheek
Are colder than the peak
Of Mount Everest
Oh
We both know
We both know
Who we are
I do not know
How long this body will hold on
No longer than
A moment that
Could last forever
Tears
Running down her cheek
Are colder than the peak
Of Mount Everest
Oh
We both know
We both know
Who we are
I do not know
How long this body will hold on
No longer than
A moment that
Could last forever
My soul swam out to sea
Trapped in the waves
Good thing it doesnt need to breath
Oh
I put our hearts together with solder
My lungs might not fill up with water
Your life may seem
To be struggling
But I promise you
It gets better, Row
Your knee deep in rain
Thats coated in pain
Dont blame the weather
The tears
Running down her cheek
Are colder thatn the peak
Than Mount Everest
Oh
We both know
We both know
Who we are
I do not know how long
This body will hold on
No longer than
A moment that
Could last forever
You're frozen
Your colder than a
Mountain top
I would like to see this stop
But I can't
Get everything that I want
I know
You're trying to buy some time
I know that it's not a crime
I don't mind
Don't mind
No
No
The tears
Running down her cheek
Are colder than the peak
Of Mount Everest
Oh
We both know
We both know
Who we are
I do not know how long
This body will hold on
No longer than
A moment that
Could last forever
