Sally ran with the child
Sally ran for miles
Through the towns and the capes
Oh Sally ran away

She sees the boats boast in the morning hours
And smells the coals that they devour
Inking with the black of nights
Her fortune and the morning skies

Sally time will linger on
It is just a part of you
You can't let go

Sally ran with the night
She was only a child
Oh she ran with the groves
That frame her world in scope

It's just the first step you take
A vivid part of you
I am dying to meet you darling
Dreaming alone

Sally time will linger on
It is just a part of you that you can't let go

Just a part of you
Just a part of you
Just a part of you
Just a part of you
Just a part of you
Just a part of you
