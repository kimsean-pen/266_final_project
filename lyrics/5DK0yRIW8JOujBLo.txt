I've got the snowboard under my feet
I can fly so high, I can fall so deep
But who do I see comin' up the track
A little green man with the snowboard on his back

He said: And now I'm flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burning and I grab into another world

With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown

I can stay behind him if I can
I wanna be a little more than an "also-ran"
Through every curve He's got me beat
And maybe it's time that I accept defeat

And now I'm flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burning and I grab into another world

With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown

The lords of the boards!

With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown

With the lords of the boards!
