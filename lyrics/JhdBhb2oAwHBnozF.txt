Call all your friends
And tell them I'm never coming back
Cause this is the end
Pretend that you want it, don't react

The damage is done
The police are coming too slow now
I would have died
I would have loved you all my life

Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory... now

Where have you gone
The beach is so cold in winter here
And where have I gone
I wake in Montauk with you near

Remember the day
Cause this is what dreams should always be
I just want to stay
I just want to keep this dream in me

Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory...

Wake up, it's time little girl, wake up
All the best of what we've done is yet to come
Wake up, it's time little girl, wake up
Just remember who I am in the morning

Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory...

Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory now
Your losing your memory...
