So long to this cold, cold part of the world
So long to this cold, cold part of the world
So long to this bone bleached part of the world
So long to this cold, cold part of the world

So long to this salt soaked part of the world
I stepped down as president of Antarctica
Can't blame me, don't blame me, don't

So long to this sad, sad part of the world

So long, so long...

So long to this sad, sad part of the world

So long, so long...
