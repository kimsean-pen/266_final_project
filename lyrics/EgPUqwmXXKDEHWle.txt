Oh, dear Amy see you in September
Hope that you remember me next year
Hey Jamie you've been a great friend to me
I hope that I'll still see you around here

'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
No he never wrote me nothing but I can't forget his face

Then tell me where did he go I want to know, where did Johnny go
It says picture unavailable right here
More than sad it makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go

Poor Katie she won't even speak his name
None of us will ever be the same
It's quiet in the halls but I hear echoing off the walls
The rumors of Johnny's mystery

'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
No he never wrote me nothing but I can't forget his face

Then tell me where did he go I want to know, where did Johnny go
It says picture unavailable right here
More than sad it makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go

Oh there's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go
Oh there's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go

Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed
But I keep thinking about Johnny I keep turning to that page

Where did he go? I want to know, where did he go? I want to know
Oh there's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go
Oh there's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go
Oh there's a lying in your silence, tell me where did Johnny go
