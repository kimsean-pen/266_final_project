So has my truth been seen tested by time
Reckoned by age, trialed by fire
Was there wisdom in what I believed
Or was it ghosts by whom I was deceived

So what I found on this trial
The scattered remains of those who have failed
So the world has taught me many things
One I pass onto you
The world that we are looking for
Well, it isn't coming soon

And I climbed one mountain side
To find yet another
An endless sea of darkness for us yet to discover
And my soul pines for rest
In the heat of the flame I so desire
It burns, the heat of the fire
