Mari√©e avec ma fille

I was a castaway
Going against the grain
Running my own campaign
Running in vain
She was a masterpiece
A limited release
Bringing me to my knees
Bringing me peace

When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you, nobody
Nobody else will do
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
Nobody else will do

She said, she said, she said, she said
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
She said, she said, she said, she said
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you

Now there's a gust of wind
To lock me up again
As soon as I let her in
The room will begin to spin
Bending around my bed
Sowing a need in my head
Turning the pale to red
She's raising the dead

When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you, nobody
Nobody else will do
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
Nobody else will do

She said, she said, she said, she said
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
She said, she said, she said, she said
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you

When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you

When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you, nobody
Nobody else will do
When I'm drifting
I'm drifting with you
Nobody else will do
