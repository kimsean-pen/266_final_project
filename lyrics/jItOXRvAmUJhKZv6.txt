I know it's not your time yet but I see you coming over the hill,
Blaming everything on me is that
the way you get your kicks and your thrills,
You should spare a little time for your mind and then your body and soul.
You act a little crazy but I know you've got it under control,
And this is me trying to be kind I want you to know,
This whole banging on the roof and stamping on the floors getting old.

Lets come to an agreement there's no need to get the police involved,
A minor little headache can be cured by a little resolve,
And this is me trying to be kind, I want you to know,
You seem to pardon all my favors now,

Sometimes!

I'm a sober boy and you're a lonely girl,
So lets give it up and stay out of each other's worlds

Is there any need in bringing in the butchers for a bit of a scare
I've had so many hidings in this city that they've stopped being rare,
This is me trying to be kind I want you to know,
You seem to pardon all my favors now

Sometimes!

I'm a sober boy and you're a lonely girl,
So lets give it up and stay out of each other's worlds
I'm a sober boy and you're a lonely girl,
So lets give it up and stay out of each other's worlds
Lets make our peace, stand in one line,
Or hold on to these, grudges for time.
