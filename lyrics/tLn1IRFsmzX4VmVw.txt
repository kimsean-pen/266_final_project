I'm here watching the waves
Just how long can it be
Till that melody strays
Through my mind and I'm cancelled
Can't see no wood for the trees
Can't tell no land for the sky
When you're in up to your knees
You soon find out who your friends are

Hmm
Ah for the taste of it sweet
One more time from the top
Thoughts like crumbs in the sheets
Words thrown as coins in a cup
Just one more house in the rain
Just one more spoonful of salt
And now I'm at it again
Banging on like it's my fault

Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are i long to be
Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are i long to be, hmm
"Third verse":
I gave it all i could give
I took that ghost for my bride
Went day by day trying to live
With my heart on the outside
I watched the shape of it rise
To dance like wind through the wheat
And steal the light from your eyes
In the space of a heartbeat

Everything fills with distance
Yeah everything

Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are, i long to be
Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are, i long to be
Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are, i long to be
Everything you are
Everything you are
Everything you are, i long to be

Songs that push through the dirt
Ploughing these roads into fields
Sounding the notes of the words
Till everything fills with distance
