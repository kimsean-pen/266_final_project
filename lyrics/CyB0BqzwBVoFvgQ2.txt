One, two!

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the morning drivin' rain

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
I was crowned with a spike right through my head

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas
