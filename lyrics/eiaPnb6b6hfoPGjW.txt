I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been cryin' forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you
They're a mirror
I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke my heart

If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart
Oh my heart?
If I stand all alone, will the shadow hide the colors of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The star in the sky don't mean nothin' to you

They're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart
Oh my heart?
I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke this ol' heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart
Oh my heart?
My heart, oh, my heart
