I was born on these Streets
years ago
I was the king
of the neighbourhoood
Fast on my feet
I was elite
I was the star of the show
Ooo yeah
This task must be done
I will not run
I will not lay me down to die
This war i will win
so let it begin
Deep in my heart is a burning fire...
I can't let it go
Alone in the night
I know i must fight for my home
Time has changed the seasons
And i will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And i am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away
What's become of us friend
We were one til the end
Now i'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names
but nothing's the same
The places i played
have forgotten the dream...
I can't let it go
Alone in the night
I know i must fight for my home
Time has changed the seasons
And i will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And i am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away
