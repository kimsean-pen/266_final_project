Hey,
Flow the waterways of letting go
Another day...
Permanently allocate the maximum
And leave it to go...
Change,
And leave without a trace for her to know
A hollow day
Slow it down evenly paced, you've never known
And leave them alone

Hey,
Tell me theres a lot of ways I need to know
Another day,
Terminally out of phase and ill disposed
Just leave it alone

Sane,
You can teach a man better to view with loose control
Another way...
You pick your point, settle to be and let things go...
Just leave them alone...

Hey,
Tell me theres a lot of ways I need to know
Another day...
Terminally out of phase and ill disposed
Just leave them alone.
