Say it like you mean it even if you don't.
Tell me everything I want to hear.
Tell me everything will be the same, that I won't be alone.
Say it will be fine.

I can't take another let down.
Give me something solid I can feel beneath my feet.
Give me something I can stand on before you go.

Know this son, the hard truth of life,
is that everyone leaves and everything dies.
There is no exception to the passing of time.
Every last leaf will fall and light will fade from your eyes.

You never told me that anything was easy.
Sometime I wish you had. It might have been nice
to feel safe inside, but I guess everything is
different looking back.

Know this son, the hard truth of life,
is that everyone leaves and everything dies.
There is no exception to the passing of time.
Every last leaf will fall and light will fade from your eyes.

Fall away.
