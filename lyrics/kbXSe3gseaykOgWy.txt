Sometimes I feel so out of time and place,
Trapped in a maze
As if I was lost in someone else's life...
The values I should keep in high regard don't mean a thing to me

Do you ever feel a need to go back in time?
A dream of mine...
To travel far away and one day steal back my life
In the end all I can do is to learn I live in a dreamland

This time was not made for me,
I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,
Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding
Under the clouds, forevermore

How much suffocated anxiety can be held within?
I was found guilty to a crime against myself
No need to hear the words again,
I live and I'd die for my dreamland

This time was not made for me,
I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,
Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding
Under the clouds, forevermore

I'll never have a chance,
I can't understand
I'm a misplaced man
How could this backward land
Learn to understand my dance?
What it's like, when
Every single smile hurts...

I have never felt like home here
Always missing something
People aren't connecting
Am I a misplaced soul?

I live in a perfect Hell,
I try finding my wishing well
When I drop my last tear,
I have accepted this life

A true saint, that I am not,
You have never seen me
'Cause I have always been there,
Standing by your side

I'll never have a chance,
I can't understand
I'm a misplaced man
How could this backward land
Learn to understand my dance?
What it's like, when

Every single moment pains me...
Never felt like home here
I am missing something
My soul's in a wrong shell?
