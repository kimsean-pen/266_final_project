Summertime,
If I was getting paid
For getting drunk and getting laid.
I'd grab a phone
Just to call you up and say
Quit your job
'Cause I got it made.

Anytime,
Baby let's go
Every day should be a holiday.

Super cool,
The Dandys rule, okay!
Got the dough and
I got the raves.
Anytime call me up if you got the sun,
'Cause I got the waves.

Anytime,
Baby, let's go

Every day should be a holiday.
