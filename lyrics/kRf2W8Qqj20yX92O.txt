You have amazing eyes
The right one's suspicious and the left one wants my love
I don't care what you think I've done
I know I never meant no harm to anyone
I know I never meant no harm at all

Is this wrong or only half right?
You want me gone but I stay the night
When I see you in the half light
It feels so fine
Everybody seems to wonder why
I go right back to you every time
But I don't mind
I don't mind

Cause you have amazing eyes
The right one's suspicious and the left one wants my love
I don't care what you think I've done
I know I never meant no harm to anyone

You're a little bit broken and I'm a little bit broken
When we put ourselves together, my oh my
And you may not understand it
But something here is working
So I don't mind
I don't mind
Cause you're mine, you're mine
I don't mind, don't mind
Cause you're mine
You're mine
I don't mind

You have amazing eyes
The right one's suspicious and the left one wants my love
I don't care what you think I've done
I know I never meant no harm to anyone
I know I never meant no harm at all
You have amazing eyes
The right one's suspicious and the left one wants my love
I don't care what you think I've done
I know I never meant no harm to anyone
I know I never meant no harm to anyone
I know I never meant no harm at all
