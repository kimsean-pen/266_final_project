The weight of my words are like feathers from a bird
my mouth it moves but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep, I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies smell like a big old bucket of bleach
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key you won't open up for me
So brick by brick I am breaking through these walls

Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up, on us
And it feels like you're in China and I am in Peru
When ever I am sleeping next to you, we can hear the crickets singing

Oh all throughout the night oh boy can we just get used to something so right?
and sure I confess, I'm a mess,
I'm a mess of mistakes, but please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away
So brick by brick I am breaking through these walls

Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up, im not giving up, on us
'Cause if you give up then what am I supposed to do?
All of these dreams never will come true without you
So brick by brick I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up, up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving giving, up, I'm not giving giving, up
Oh baby don't give up on this love
