Oh oh you shout me down you left me here on the floor
I left my self wide open
And I shouldn't know

Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart

Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart

Oh oh you shout me down you left me here on the floor
I left my self wide open,
And I shouldn't know

Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
Don't come too close I won't give away my heart
