You call it conviction
I can see right through your game
With no hesitation
You take our rights and yet
We're still killing in your name

The lies are not forgotten!
Can you hear our voices calling?

Everything you say to me has led me to believe
The truth will only get farther, farther away
Everything is like a dream, there's no reality
The truth will only get farther, farther away
We're still killing in your name

You call yourself special
No one will do what you say
We want you to suffer
You take our rights and yet
we're still killing in your name

The lies are not forgotten!
Can you hear our voices calling?

Everything you say to me has led me to believe
The truth will only get farther, farther away
Everything is like a dream, there's no reality
The truth will only get farther, farther away
We're still killing in your name

Everything you say to me has led me to believe
The truth will only get farther, farther away
Everything is like a dream, there's no reality
The truth will only get farther, farther away
We're still killing in your,
Still killing in your name
