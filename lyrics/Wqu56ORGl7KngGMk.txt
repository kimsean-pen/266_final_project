There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait,
The more time that I waste

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way...
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight 'till I find a place of my own

Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hand
Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hand
Get ready to
Are you ready?

I can make it alone
