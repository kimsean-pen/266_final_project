If I were a man
And you a dog
If I were man
And you a dog
I'd throw a stick for you

If I were a man
And you a dog

If I were dog
And you a man
I'd throw a fit for you

If I were dog
And you a man
I'd throw a fit for you

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Potato chip-u
Potato chip-u
Batatabata, batatapata

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Potato chip-u
Potato chip-u
Batatabata, batatapata

If I were a man
And you a dog
If I were man
And you a dog
I'd throw a stick for you

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Potato chip-u
Potato chip-u
