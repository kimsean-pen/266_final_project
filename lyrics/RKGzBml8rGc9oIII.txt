Remember when you watched me sleeping
Oooh
And I'd pretend I didn't know
I gave you everything worth giving
Please don't forget me
Or worse regret me
No
Pretending I'm OK
No regrets today
But your green eyes own me
And I just feel lonely
Oooh
Deep in thought of you
Not you're fault
It's nothing that you've put me through
didn't think that I'd need you
Oooh

I said a prayer for you
Felt I needed to
I was wrong, baby
I wish I'd held your hand
Tried to understand
So here's a sorry from me

Long lost hesitations
Falling from my mind
Should have stayed a moment more
And given us some time

Long lost conversations
Time & time again
Everything we work for
Washed away in heavy rain

Remember when you used to call me phone
Checking I was safe and I got home
Sweetest dreams and then I love you
Oooh
When I didn't even ask you to
Now you won't even return my calls
No memory of me at all
I wonder do you still remember
The 2 years we were together

I said a prayer for you
Felt I needed to
I was wrong baby
I wish I'd held your hand
Tried to understand
Now you're gone baby
When I'm dreaming I see
All the dreams that could be here again, yeah

I said a prayer for you
Coz I needed to
So here's a sorry from me
I want to believe
This ain't for real
And you still love me
But I'm wasting my time
It's not me on your mind
Here's a sorry from me
