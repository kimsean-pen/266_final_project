Darling, please take my hand
Please get up, rise to stand
I can't be the one to sing your song
'Cause I believe it's not your fault
Don't be scared, you are my rock
Nothing's gonna hold you down for long

Sometimes we break so beautiful
And you know you're not the only one
I breathe you in so sweet and powerful
Like a wildfire burning up inside my lungs
I'm burning up, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm burning up, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm burning up

In good time, you'll come to know
When you release, when you let go
You can find yourself where you belong
You're not a curse, you're not too much
You are needed here, you are enough
And nothing's gonna hold you down for long

Sometimes we break so beautiful
And you know you're not the only one
I breathe you in so sweet and powerful
Like a wildfire burning up inside my lungs
I'm burning up, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm burning up, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I'm burning up

Darling please don't give up
Drop your hate and sing for love
Let me be the one who sings along
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Sometimes we break so beautiful
And you know you're not the only one
I breathe you in so sweet and powerful
Like a wildfire burning up inside my lungs
I'm burning up
