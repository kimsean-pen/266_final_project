PCH is where we lay our heads
The ocean beach is where our feet will land
It's 3 a.m., we're out here on our own
So make me home, take me home
The L.A. scene is like a field of dreams
And this field of dreams is made for you and me
It's 4 a.m., we're out here on our own
So take me home, just take me home, home

I feel strange, I feel strange
Every time that I'm away from you
No, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights
I feel strange, so strange
Every time that I'm away from you
When the rest of the world is sleeping
We're up all night

PCH is where we race too fast
'Cause the human race was never meant to last
It's 5 a.m., we'll make it on our own
We're going home, girl, we're going home, home

I feel strange, I feel strange
Every time that I'm away from you
No, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights
I feel strange, so strange
Every time that I'm away from you
When the rest of the world is sleeping
We're up all night

I feel strange, I feel strange
Every time that I'm away from you
No, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights
I feel strange, so strange
Every time that I'm away from you
When the rest of the world is sleeping
We're up all night
We're up all night

I feel strange, I feel strange
Every time that I'm away from you
No, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights
I feel strange, so strange
Every time that I'm away from you
When the rest of the world is sleeping
We're up all night
