We all need to learn,
Learn it the hard way raising the bar too high
Missing that last midnight train,
Getting our hearts broken in different ways
If I only could, If I only could
Let you dance around the pain
If I only could, If I only could
So it won't hit you in the face

Make you strong like a lion, light as air, smart like a falcon
To keep you safe and sound, keep you safe and sound.

So you can climb any mountain, break any wall
Find your way back home again
Safe, safe, safe and sound
To keep you safe and sound

I'm with you, with every breath you take
You learn it the hard way, you'll rise when dawn will break

I promise with every step you'll take
It will get lighter, lighter along the way

If I only could, If I only could
Let you dance around the pain
If I only could, If I only could
So it won't hit you in the face

Make you strong like a lion, light as air, smart like a falcon.
To keep you safe and sound, keep you safe and sound.

So you can climb any mountain and break any wall
Find your way back home again
Safe, safe, safe and sound ... oh yeah

To keep you safe and sound

Eskimo kisses when you go to sleep
You float into a world of make believe
Love you to the moon and back again
Keep my arms around you when you fall asleep
No monsters are unbeatable for you and me
Fear the day that I won't be around to keep you safe and sound

Safe and sound
Safe and sound
To keep you safe and sound ...

Make you strong like a lion, light as air, smart like a falcon
To keep you safe and sound, keep you safe and sound.

So you can climb any mountain and break any wall
Find your way back home again
Safe, safe, safe and sound. oh yeah

To keep you safe and sound
To keep you safe and sound
