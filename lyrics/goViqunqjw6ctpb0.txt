My Sweet Summer is gone,
She left me here
With sand in my bed,
She played me all night long.
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh

My Sweet Summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear,
Her Lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone.

My Sweet Summer is gone.

Warm was the weather outside the day we met
Blue was the color of skies the day she left.
Short was the time we had, it was the best.
'Cause long were the nights we spent with no rest.
I met her on a Friday, she left on a Monday,
Wrote me a letter said she hoped to see me someday.
We had a good time, I can't deny that.
You can be my sunshine every time you fly back.

Cause there's another one you're loving, and
I hate to see you go.

My Sweet Summer is gone,
She left me here
With sand in my bed,
She played me all night long.
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh

My Sweet Summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear,
Her Lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone.

My Sweet Summer is gone.

Yeah she left in the morning, gone without warning.
Fun while it lasted, lost in the moment.
She played me real good, took me for a ride,
Now she's off on an airplane, back to real life.
Yeah she dipped out,
Smoked all my weed then she flipped out.
Left in my slumber, waited 'til I passed out.
And on my dresser was a paper and her number,
I filled up with grass and I burned it, for summer.

Cause there's another one you're loving, and
I hate to see you go.

My Sweet Summer is gone,
She left me here
With sand in my bed,
She played me all night long.
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh

My Sweet Summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear,
Her Lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone.

My Sweet Summer is gone.

Left like a midnight thief.
You ain't no friend to me.
How could you lead me on?
Now my sweet summer is gone.

My Sweet Summer is gone.
Now my Sweet Summer is gone.

My Sweet Summer is gone.
Now my Sweet Summer is gone.
