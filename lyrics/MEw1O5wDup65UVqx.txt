It's just another day of my life
In the high res next gen wonderland
I curse the sun getting out of bed
I hope my sell-by date didn't expire yesterday

The torture porn on the red roy disc
Sweet kiss of liquid modernity
We have no time for your mistakes
Dial, search, accept!

"Here, you have to run as fast as you can
To stay in the same place"

You're too blurry my friend
You're too slow
Too predictable, too below
This is all I can hear in my mind
When I try to believe
I'll stand the pace of this run

Breathe, breathe, breathe in
Breathe, breathe, breathe out

You're too blurry my friend

It's just another day of my life
It's just another day of my life
It's just another day of my life

It's just another day of my life

Dial, search, accept!
