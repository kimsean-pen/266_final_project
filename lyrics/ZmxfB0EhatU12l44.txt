I got you
But it's the craving for the good life that sees me through
Troubled times
When my mind begins to wander to the spoon

And I got you
'Cause you're there to bend and nurture me through these
Troubled times
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave

I got you
But it's the feeling that I get when you're away
Twist my mind
'Cause when I'm alone and cold, I feel like dyin'

And I got you
To fill the craving that I get inside my mind
When you're there
To fill the space I have inside, I feel like cryin'

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

All the slippin' that I slap me
I got you, I got you
All the slippin' that I slap me

I got you
But it's the craving for the good life that sees me through
Troubled times
When my mind begins to wander to the spoon

And I got you to paint the sorrow on my day
And I got you
And I got you to paint the roses on my grave
And I got you

All the slippin' that I slap me
I got you, I got you
All the slippin' that I slap me

I got you
I got you
I got you
