You're taking the fun out of everything
You're making me run, when I don't want to think
You're taking the fun out of everything
I don't want to think at all

There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play

You're taking the fun out of everything
You're making it clear, when I don't want to think
You're taking me up, when I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all

There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play

I'll watch you play
I'll watch you play

There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
