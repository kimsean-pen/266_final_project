Another daybreak
Another dawn to waste away
Another struggle in vain
Out of the empty
From out the void to die again
What is the reason, the gain

Somebody let me out, I'll pay the toll
Somebody free me from this hell
And deliver my soul

Lost in forever
In a world of shattered skies
I am reaching for my life
Lost in forever
While the centuries fall apart
I am searching for my heart
Lost in forever

Is this a nightmare
Am I in someone else's dream
Give me a soul to redeem
Is this the after
An ever endless world of pain
To drive the faithful insane

Somebody let me out, I'll pay the toll
Somebody free me from this hell
And deliver my soul

Lost in forever
In a world of shattered skies
I am reaching for my life
Lost in forever
While the centuries fall apart
I am searching for my heart

Lost in the vast of eternity
Nowhere to go, no one to be
Trapped in the silent infinity
Forever yearning, never free

Lost in forever
In a world of shattered skies
I am reaching for my life
Lost in forever
While the centuries fall apart
I am searching for my heart

Lost in the vast of eternity
Nowhere to go, no one to be
Trapped in the silent infinity
Forever yearning, never free

Lost in forever
