Reforged in the furnace of death
weaves fates in the warp and the weft
dimensional rifts quake in the skies
on worlds born and razed in a blink of your mortal eyes
Master, born of the plasma
siphoning strength from the black twisting nether
a rapture that fractures the cosmos
torn from the womb of primordial chaos

Rhaexorog come forth
hordes of iron must be wrought
Molten shells of steel ablaze
Cast in slime and living flame

Bathe the abyss in cosmic afterbirth
he shall arise to reclaim the multiverse
In noxious sanctums beyond the walls that keep
the cursed sleepers from the beast

feel the blessed touch of the unmaker
into this verdant nightmare you slip farther
stalked and hounded in this dream forever
sport for the beasts of Ankath-Shol

Wallow hopeless under starless nights

Yearn for the return of the creator's flame
Gaze out from the horizon and behold the sundering

Dark blood coursing through our mortal veins
we are unstoppable
infused with arcane power; the boon of Lord Yeth'Shuul

Pandemonium; a war in heaven, cataclysmic copulation
transdimensional astral tentacles
most irreverent fornication

The wheel spins once again
cyclical time, no beginning or end
subject to no known law of nature
in wormholes entangled that hang in the ether
Scatter the remnants hereafter
blacken the stars with the power of the atom
we will shatter the order of aeons
unleashing his infinite legion of scions
