I'm searching for the meaning
You said you'd be my everything
I guess your words mean nothing
So go and prove your loyalty

Go ahead and bury me deep down inside
Cage that longing in your heart
Hold that thought just for a moment
Let your heart feel numb

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything
So go and prove your loyalty

This is what you are
You'll never take me
This is what you'll get
Your separation
This is who I am
You'll never change me
Loyalty

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you said you'd be my everything
Now I see that this is what you mean
When you'd said you'd be my everything
So go and prove your loyalty

Now I see that this is what you mean
When you'd said you'd be my everything
So go and prove your loyalty
