Why is life so precious, when living is but shreds of joy and pain, of loss and gain, of torment and resent
Hanging on a cliff edge, we are clawing for a hold
The weak are pushed, the strong held back, the quiet cowed by the bold
More rain than sunshine, the warm outdoes the cold
Safety in numbers, but now we're all alone
I'm stretching out my arms now, I'm yearning for your love
Mist is all around us now, dark shadows fly above.

The cold can kill you, your body keeps me warm
We survey the view now, in the cold light of the dawn
Out on the cliff edge. moss clings so easily
But now it's not so easy for the likes of you and me
