As they
Dig your ditches
Count my stitches
Generation justice wishes for
World at war
Final score
Media come and abhor us

As these are hard times
We'll work harder harder
Through these hard times
I'll work harder harder

Divided nation
In sedation
Overload of information that
We have grown up to ignore
Mediocrity applauded

In these hard times
We'll work harder harder
Through these hard times
I'll work harder harder
for resolution
Show me some revolution
This battle will be won!

Forced to count the hours
Since two towers
Fell to fiction
Those higher powers
Putting gods to war
Who keeps score?
Ignorance is still adored

And through these hard times
We'll work harder harder
Give me hard times
I'll work harder harder
For revolution
Hard time for some resolution
Time for some revolution
This battle will be won!

Harder harder harder now!

If they only see you with their fear
And they only hear you with their pride
And they only see you with their fear
And they only hear you with their pride
And we'll work harder harder harder harder
Harder harder harder harder
Hard times!
