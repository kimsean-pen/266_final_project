I used to love the way we slept at night
You used to love my naked lips against your spine
But now when the cold night falls
I'm wondering where you are
Now when the cold night falls
Can't hardly sleep at all, all, all

Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
Boy, you gotta know
Forever wasn't meant for us
I'm a fire you're a flood
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go, go, go

You used to love to watch the lightning strike
We used to watch the rain and hold each tight
But now when I see it fall
I'm wondering where you are
Now when I see it fall
Can't help but feel it all, all, all

Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
Boy, you gotta know
Forever wasn't meant for us
I'm a fire you're a flood
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go

Maybe forever wasn't meant for us
A kiss of death
I'm fire, you're the flood
We both saw the end right from the start
Closed our eyes and broke each other's hearts
Don't put it on me

Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
Boy, you gotta know
Forever wasn't meant for us
I'm a fire you're a flood
Don't you put it on me
Don't you put it on me
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
