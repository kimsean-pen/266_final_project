Well, I've been lying here
All alone
Wondering if you are
Ever coming home
I left on the light
By the bed
In case, you could come to call
What is wrong with me?
I said, to myself

I never really thought
It would last
And here I am now
Fading fast
But I will not sleep tonight
No, I could not sleep tonight

Where would you go?
What would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you
If it wasn't me, it was you

If only you could feel
My heart race
And see the light
On my face
Then you would know the truth
And I would know the truth
Then maybe you don't like
What I brought
Well maybe I am not
What you thought
But don't worry
You are not
What I thought you were
...either

Where would you go?
What would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you
If it wasn't me, it was you

No matter how hard it gets
No matter how thick your head is
There's always something
More to learn
Even if you just want to quit

Where would you go?
And what would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
Where would you go?
And what would you do?
If it wasn't me, it was you (x3)
