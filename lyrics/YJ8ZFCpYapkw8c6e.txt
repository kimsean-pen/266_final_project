Top down, get on the wheel
Baby things are better when you just feel
And you do your own thing
Ah, just let it swing

Drive me to I don't care
I'm enraptured take me anywhere
I just wanna fly
I like this CD

Turn the music up and baby don't slow down
If you want me all you gotta do is keep me going now
Listen, can you give me that?
Baby just hit

The cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy

On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride

Oh no, the lights go green
Time out, do you know what I mean?
We're all on our own
I ain't going home

Out there I wanna be
No more bumper-to-bumper cars for me
We're on the highway
Put it on replay

Turn the music up and baby don't slow down
If you want me all you gotta do is keep me going now
Listen, can you give me that?
Baby just hit

The cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy

On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride

Driving on cruise control
Can you give me that, baby just hit that
Can you give me that, baby just hit that
Can you give me that, baby just hit that
Can you give me that, baby just hit that
Can you give me that, can you give me that
Can you give me that, baby just hit that

The cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy

On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride

The cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy

On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride

[Incomprehensible]
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy

On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
