I can't help it I'm a moth to the flame I can't help it I'm a, a
(He's that kind of man, mama)
I should know better than to
Take your love letters to heart
When the game's already lost
Before it starts
But hope hides inside the cliche

Like a nod of understanding
From the power who first felt this way

How can I turn away?

I can't help it I'm a moth to the flame I can't help it I'm a, a
(He's that kind of man, mama)
But every little pull at the end of the golden rope
Fills my foolish heart with foolish hope

That maybe you might feel the same
As if feeling the same was the name of the game

The name of the game
I shouldn't be playing
I can't help it I'm a moth to the flame I can't help it I'm a, a
(He's that kind of man, mama)
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
I shouldn't be playing
I can't help it I'm a moth to the flame I can't help it I'm a, a
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
Close enough, Close enough
Close enough to you I can't get
(He's that kind of man, mama)
