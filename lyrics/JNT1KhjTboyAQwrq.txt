Saved by her grace, oh, so fair without a lock of hair
Grabs her by the waist, lifts her high above
Says: "Behold my love"

With you, I'll never be lonely
Without you I'll never be sane
For you, I shall conquer the oceans
For you, I'll just leave them again

Absinth love affairs, we fill our lungs with hyms of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come

Absinth love affairs, we fill our lungs with hyms of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come

Words so tender, whispered so slowly
Heed her bittersweet caress
Swears he'll never leave, he'll never lie to her again
Never lie to her again, he'll never lie to her again

My dear, forgive me my feelings
My dear, I'll give you my all
Just save me from all these thoughts now
Just spare me, be there when I fall

Woken by her voice
A song she's hummed so many times before
Hear her calling, hear her yearning
For his hand again

With you, I'll never be lonely
Without you I'll never be sane
For you, I shall conquer the oceans
For you, I'll just leave them again

Absinth love affairs, we fill our lungs with hyms of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come

Absinth love affairs, we fill our lungs with hyms of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come

Absent delo lubovi intrigami napolnim
Gordosti i bednost mi preodoleem
Priglasim eyo v nashi serdsa iz moli i kamnya
Tepla darite skorey
