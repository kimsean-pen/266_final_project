Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again

Spend some time alone
Understand its on your run
With better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
It's within that brings that
Lonely feeling

Understand it when you leave here
You'll be clear
Among a better man
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
