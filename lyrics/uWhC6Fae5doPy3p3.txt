Shaking salt in your deep wounds
It's a call about to happen too
Drowning in the punch bowl
She's got an eye for a big beau
So go on read it on the TVs
Lady smell it on the passion

I got all the time so i can't lose it
You keep my heart
choose when to lose it

I call you up when you're not around
keep on listening to the same old habits
calling on the souls in your defenses
Try these words and try again
Talking to yourself and not to no one
seems you're getting very far from your problems

Go ahead, take that pill
You know that I'm used to it
Take your time, see me go
Know you're caught and never know

Go ahead, take that pill
You know that I'm used to it
Take your time, say goodbye
When your limit and your mine

I might have fallen stuck in love skies
Just look ahead, do you see us?
And nothing ever makes sense
When your secrets always stay crushed
So wake me up from my deep dreams
I was someone with a small heart

You threw me and you screwed me and you fed me to the fishes
Like we've never been together and I'm only just a vision so

I call you up when you're not around
keep on listening to the same old habits
calling on the souls in your defenses
Try these words and try again
Talking to yourself and not to no one
seems your getting very far from your problems

Go ahead, take that pill
You know that I'm used to it
Take your time, see me go
Know you're caught and never know

Go ahead, take the hit
You know that I'm used to it
Take your time, say goodbye
When your limit and your mine

Go ahead, take the hit
You know that I'm used to it
Take your time and talk this out
Feelings that are underground
