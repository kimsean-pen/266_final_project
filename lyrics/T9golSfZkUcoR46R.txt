You were a cute girl standing backstage
It was bound to happen
You had a smile on your face
It was bound to happen
What you wore and how you bore it so well What did you expect would happen
You were a cute girl standing backstage
It was bound to happen
I took on heaven to find peace
I took on the world to find me again
I am not my body
I am somebody
I am not my body
I am somebody
