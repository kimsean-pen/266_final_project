If loneliness was our long lost art
I just have to ask
Where did we all go wrong

We were the black keys to every white lie
Basking in the glow
Of a heaven burning bright
And the clouds were ghosts
Of forgotten dreams
Filling voids in absence of all good things

Forgive and forget was the path to regret
And we needed to find a better way out
Who will we be without enemies
Who will we be without
The push and pull

In love with melancholy
Fatally, beautifully
In love with melancholy
Melancholy
