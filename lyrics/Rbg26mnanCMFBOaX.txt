Face to face with the man who says I'm dying
I couldn't plead my case, defend yeah
I'm stuck in the middle trying to figure out where I stand
To all of this, in evidence.

Face to face with the man who says I'm lying
And every other word I say I'll be held against.it.
Leaves me stuck in the middle trying to figure out how I got here
It's little to do with worth and confidence
It's good to see you notice, I'm trying to figure out
Just who I am!

Face to face with the man who says I'm trying
Just a little too hard for love and his affection, yeah
I'm stuck in the middle trying to figure out how this all ends.
As a witness, the accusations, it's time that I confess
It's nice to know you love me, I'm in love with someone else
That's who I am, I'm not in love
That's who I am, I'm not in love
That's who I am, I'm not in love
That's who I am, I'm not in love
Am I dead, am I dead, am I dead to you?
Am I dead, am I dead, am I dead to him?
Am I dead, am I dead, am I dead to you?
Am I dead, am I dead, am I dead to him?
Baby, baby, yeah

I'm not in love, well here I am
I'm not in love, well here I am
I'm not in love, whoa.
