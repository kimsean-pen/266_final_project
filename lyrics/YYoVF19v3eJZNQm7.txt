i feel i'm flying blind when i know that my mind won't relieve me
not much to be said when my heart and my head still deceive me
don't offer up help that you know that i won't be needing
cause i do it to myself like i never get tired of bleeding

can i trust you now
not to pull me out
of this cautionary tale that you know that i won't be reading

make another dime just to lose it in time
what's the meaning
they'll take what they can get before a word can be said
oh believe me
i know i'll be in debt to far more than that
i guess always
if i can make it outside of these narrow minded hallways

can i trust you now
not to pull me out
of this cautionary tale that you know that i won't be reading

cautionary tale that you know that i won't be reading
cautionary tale that you know that i won't be reading
cautionary tale to my own avail i believe in
cautionary tale that you know that i won't be reading
