Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me

And I haven't had faith in such a long time
Am I out of place or out of my mind?
Should it all fall down on me?

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to say so just scream

You'll never know
If you don't let it out
You've had enough
Don't call your bluff

You can't back down, lost in a crowd
You've won the right to scream and shout
Don't talk about it, you've lost your cool
There is no point who makes the rules

So let's get to it
Now you'll do it
Break out

Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me

And I haven't had faith in such a long time
Am I out of place or out of my mind?
Should it all fall down on me?

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to say so just scream

Sound the alarm
Raise your arms
You're on your own
But not alone

Big cities got you on the ground
Afraid to fight, don't make a sound
So let's get to it
Now you'll prove it
Push back

Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout
Scream and shout

Been running in place for such a long time
Stuck in a race in the wrong line
When it all came down on me

And I haven't had faith in such a long time
Am I out of place or out of my mind?
Should it all fall down on me?

It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to live so just dream
It's not enough to say so just scream
