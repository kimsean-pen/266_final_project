I'm hearing the voices in my head
Telling me I should just pretend
But how can I sit around
And swallow all the bullshit, while I'm choking

I just need somewhere to run
I give up, don't give a fuck
Somewhere to run
I'm so sick but I can't quit
I'm saying
Another day, another night I'm getting through
I just want, I just want

Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run

Say "Hello" to the finger in your face
If you're telling me how I should behave
'Cause you keep on walking
While the leash around your neck has got you choking
I just need somewhere to run

I give up, don't give a fuck
Somewhere to run
I'm so sick but I can't quit
I'm saying
Another day, another night I'm getting through
I just want, I just want

Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run

I've been through hell
But I'm running the sound
'Till my feet hit the ground
I'm breaking out of myself
So don't hold me back 'cause I finally found

Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run, run, run
Somewhere to run

Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run

Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run
Somewhere to run, run, run
