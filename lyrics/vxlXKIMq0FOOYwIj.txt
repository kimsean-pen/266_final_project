Looking for the one to blame is tough
Doesn't matter what you're talking about
It's gonna keep calling your bluff
We're not the only ones doing this you see

The buffalo, just another one in the road
Laugh about it in his face
Follow to the route in the other place
I know how this goes
There's always gonna be the boy who gives
There's always gonna be the girl
To please
Did you anything
I'll see it
'Cause you love it all
'Cause you find a way
To keep on

He doesn't seem to get the joke
You still young, as to you
Someone take away his microphone
Push him off the stage 'till he's on his own
Can't feel a thing when he takes a shot
In to take a pain right through the eyes
Cash in when the time is right
Can't stop fight if it ever stops
Get down tonight, out from
Don't make us wait, too long
'Cause you love it all
'Cause you find the way
To keep on

Cause you love it all
'Cause you find the way
'Cause you love it all
'Cause you find the way
To keep on
