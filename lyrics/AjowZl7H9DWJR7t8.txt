My mind has been shut down
My friends have been let down
What is the reason?
There's millions of reasons
Single me out
Single me out
Tear off my front
Make me expose what I conceal
Life Is A Bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me
Now I could explain everything
You casted the fire
Now fuck the flame
What is the reason?
There's millions of reasons
Blindfold me now
Spin me around
Spin me around
Picking me up
When I fall down
Life Is A Bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me
Today I feel blue
My head is in the clouds
Separate me
My soul from my body
Today I feel blue
My head is in the clouds
Separate me
My soul from my body
Feeling so lonely
I'm not the only one
Separate me
My soul from my body
'Cause I'm in love with too many things
And I hate every thing
Single me out
Single me out
Tear off my front
Make me expose what I conceal
Blindfold me now
Spin me around
Spin me around
Picking me up
When I fall down
'Cause Life Is A Bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me
I'm in love with too many things
And I hate every thing.
