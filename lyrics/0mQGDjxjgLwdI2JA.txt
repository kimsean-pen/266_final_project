There's a place I can get to
Where I'm safe from the city blues
And it's green and it's quiet
Only trouble was I had to buy it

And I'll do anything I got to do
Cut my hair and shine my shoes
And keep on singin' the blues
If I can stay here, in Johnny's garden

As the swift bird flies over the grasses
Dipping now and then to take his breakfast
Thus I come and go and I travel
But I can watch that bird and unravel

And I'll do anything I got to do
Cut my hair and shine my shoes
And keep on singin' the blues
If I can stay here, in Johnny's garden

With his love and his carin'
He puts his life into beauty sharin'
And his children are his flowers
And they give me peace in quiet hours

And I'll do anything I got to do
Cut my hair and shine my shoes
And keep on singin' the blues
If I can stay here, in Johnny's garden
