I used to think that you were mine, mine
Now I know it's just a lie, lie
Guess I should've seen the signs, signs
Used to think that you were mine, mine

All you do is take take take
But you're giving me nothing
Giving me nothing
Why you such a fake fake fake?
Always asking for something
Asking for something

Beautiful smile but you lie through your teeth
Bright on the surface, dark underneath
I try not to look but it's easy to see
You are the worst in me
You are the worst in me

I always felt like something's wrong, wrong
I let this go on way too long, long
I won't miss you when you're gone, gone
Always felt like something's wrong, wrong

All you do is take take take
But you're giving me nothing
Giving me nothing
Why you such a fake fake fake?
Always asking for something
Asking for something

Beautiful smile but you lie through your teeth
Bright on the surface, dark underneath
I try not to look but it's easy to see
You are the worst in me

Gotta let you know
Gotta let you go for good
You thought I never would
But that's the old me
Gotta let you go for good, for good, for good

奪われて take take take
見返りは無し なんの話？
嘘つきの fake fake fake
ほらこのパターンで 求めてばっか

引きつる頬が物語る
裏表の神業に
見えないように けどバレバレ
You are the worst in me
You are the worst in me
You are the worst in me
