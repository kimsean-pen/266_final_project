You think you see me in the glass
You think you hear me, you better listen fast
I think I see you, gone to seed
The only reasons, were your guilt and greed
You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
Whatever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time, been a long long wait
And you've caught your fingers in the Pearly Gates
You'd better leave your number and we'll call you
You know your problems ain't exactly new
The wrong side of the fold
Your touch has turned to gold
Whatever happened to your life?

Stone dead forever

You're a financial wizard, you're a top tycoon
A sweet lounge lizard with a silver spoon
You know you never had it quite so good
'Cause you didn't know that you even could
But the time has come to pay
Turns out to have been a play
Whatever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
