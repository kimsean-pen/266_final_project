And
If I lost a map
If I lost it all
I fell into the trap

Then she calls
When you're tired of racing and you
Find you never left the start

Come on, baby
Don't let it break your heart
Though
Heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slow

Burning tide
(Oooh)
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard a call
And she said
When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark
And even if your aims are shadows
Still we never gonna part
Come on, baby
Don't let it break your heart
(Oooh)
Don't let it break your heart
(Oooh)
Don't let it break your heart
Don't let it break your heart
