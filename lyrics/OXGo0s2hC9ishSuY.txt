The flowers you gave me
Are just about to die
When I think about what could've been
Makes me want to cry

The sweet words you whispered
Didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving
Still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere

Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still, what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all, at all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

No, no-oh
How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night
