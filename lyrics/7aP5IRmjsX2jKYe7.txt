When someone becomes nothing to anyone
All feelings have died, anyone would know it
They say those sticks and stones
They say they crushed my bones
I say I don't get mad; I get even, before they do

Spoils go to the victor
And dead on time
Your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

We're all just trying to hold on to innocence
You think they'd notice what we're trying to do
These wounds are invisible
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
Back then when things got bad and we spread our wings and fly away

You'll take all your riches
In the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"
