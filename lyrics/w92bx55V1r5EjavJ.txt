There comes a time, when you should see things clear
Free from my innocence, there is no circumstance too severe
Only the need for us, for us to believe again
There is a time, temptation's on the run
Dreamer you've had your way
Soldier you've had your day, in the sun
Now it's time, for us to begin again

Chorus:

Le Bel Age
Only our love will remain
Le Bel Age
Close to the truth once again

There comes a time (there comes a time)
When you must find your way
Begger has made his bed
Wrapped in a silhoutte, of gold and gray
Now it's time, yes it's time, for us to begin again

(Repeat Chorus Twice)

Standing so close to me, the possibility
To change our destiny, I see it perfectly, moving so naturally
Nothing can stand in our way

(Repeat Chorus Three Times)

Le Bel Age
Only our love will remain (only)
Le Bel Age (only our love, only our love)
Close to the truth once again

(Repeat Chorus)

Le Bel Age (Le Bel Age)
Le Bel Age
