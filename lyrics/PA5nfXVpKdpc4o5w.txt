Slow it down in the night
vote against her vote against her now
we dont talk in the dark
in the black thats where the hearts collide

i get lost in your mind
overnight i saw the bluest skies
you dont want me around
i let my hunger and my heart run wild

do you hear my heart
trembling hard and lonely
you cloud my eyes
like a wind youre here then gone

slow it down in the night
vote against her vote against her now
out of luck I rewind
to the time when i was young and blind to the time when i was young and

do you hear my heart
trembling hard and lonely
you cloud my eyes
like a wind youre here then gone
