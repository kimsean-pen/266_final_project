Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
A little grave we can fill together
I've got myself a problem
That I've been lookin' to sell
Some people die just a little
(Some people die just a little)
Sometimes you die by the drop
(Sometimes you die by the drop)
Some people die in the middle
(Some people die in the middle)
I live just fine on the top
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave
I never said we was equal
(I never said we was equal)
I never wished to be saved
(I never wished to be saved)
If I'm a problem then preacher
(If I'm a problem then preacher)
Let's dig a little grave
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave
Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
Slide off the lid for worse or better
Get right down to the bottom
If one goes so do the other
Some people die just a little
(Some people die just a little)
Sometimes you die by the drop
(Sometimes you die by the drop)
Some people die in the middle
(Some people die in the middle)
I live just fine on the top
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave
