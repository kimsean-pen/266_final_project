I'm tired of my life
I feel so in between
I'm sick of all my friends, girls can be so mean
I feel like throwin' out everything I wear
I'm startin' over new
'Cause I'm not even there

Sometimes
I wanna get away some place
But I don't wanna stay too long
Sometimes
I wanna brand new day
Try to fit in where I don't belong

Hook, me up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook, me up
Where should we go I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough
me up
me up

I like the lights turned out
the sound of closing doors
I'm not like other girls
who always felt so sure
Of everything they are
Of what they're gonna be
Sometimes I'm just a girl who's stuck inside of me

Sometimes I wanna disappear some place
but I don't wanna stay too long
Sometimes
I'm feelin' so alone
Tryin' to fit in where I don't belong

Hook, me up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook, me up
Where should we go I don't even care

Anywhere is good enough
me up
me up

Anywhere is good enough
me up

Not gonna crash and burn
I'm gonna find a way
Nothin' left to say

Hook, me up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook, me up
Where should we go I don't even care
Hook, me up
I wanna feel the rain in my hair
Hook, me up
Where should we go I don't even care
Anywhere is good enough
me up
me up
me up
