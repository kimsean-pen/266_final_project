What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?

Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved good-bye
Eleven is standing still
Waiting for me to free him by coming home

Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in
Showing me where it all began, Eleven

You're too scarred to realize this
You are the voice that's been calling me back home

Under a dead Ohio sky
Eleven has been and will be waiting
Defending his light and wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb, I'm
So glad that I have found you
I am wide awake and heading home

I wish that I could see you
Turn and run to play
Dreams are fading
Carry my ancient soul
Carry me into the light

Aim your body heavenly
Enduring a memory
I'll come to your light
Hold your light
Hold your light where I can see it

Hold it high

Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory, I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together

Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory until
One and one are one, Eleven
So glow, child, glow
I'm heading back home
