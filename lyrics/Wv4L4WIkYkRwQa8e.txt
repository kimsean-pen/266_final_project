It's comin' around again
They're letting it out again
Again

When it comes
It comes abrupt and it feels
It feels like trading brains with an imbecile
For real

Yes
I feel emphatic about not being static
and not buying philosophies that are sold to me
At a steal

Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy
What I'm looking for
cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying

'Cause' what I want and what I need is and will always be free

It's comin' around again
They're letting it out again
Again
It's comin' around again

When it comes
It comes unannounced
And it feels like a matador is taunting me with his reddest red cloth
And I am the bull

Yes
I feel emphatic about not being static
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me no more
Cause now I'm full

Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy
What I'm looking for
Cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying

'Cause' what I want and what I need is and will always be free

It's comin' around again
they're letting it out again
Again

They're letting it out again
Again
