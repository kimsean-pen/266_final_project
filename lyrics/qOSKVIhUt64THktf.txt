I should have never trusted you
I should have never mixed with you
Wish I had ran the other way
How could I not see all the lies
Succubus in a pretty, pretty disguise
At last this heart has finally died
And I killed you

I buried you in a shallow grave
And I place a nameless stone
I buried you in the back of my mind
And I'll let the worms eat you

I should have never fell in love
She devil, that's taken all my pride
I am the fool that's fallen down
I laid with a dog with fleas
Now I've got, got your disease
It's my pleasure, making you bleed
And I killed you

I buried you in a shallow grave
And I place a nameless stone
I buried you in the back of my mind
And I'll let the worms eat you

Three feet deep and covered with leaves
No one is here, here to grieve
Your lifeless body is freezing cold
No one is here to take you home

I buried you in a shallow grave
And I place a nameless stone
I buried you in the back of my mind
And I'll let the worms eat you
