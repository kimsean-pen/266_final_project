I can't take this
Giver to the waves
I have come to destroy
I will lift this inhibition and we dawn the new day
This is a shame calling this name out of reach
Out of mind
And with nothing left to gain, we overcome the mundane
And with nothing left to gain, a new reason to live
And with nothing to gain, we are the new reign
Sacrifice your own inspirations
The price tags on temptations
