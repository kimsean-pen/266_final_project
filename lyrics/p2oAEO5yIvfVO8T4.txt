My life is a musical, I know how to put on a pretty pathetic show
I hide backstage; Keep the curtains closed
'Cause I'm scared, I'm scared
I'm getting pretty good at feeding them the lines they like
But I don't recognize the girl that I face each night
I can compromise till I'm convinced, It's right

What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me

I'm gonna burn this theater down
Pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"this is it!"

They say all the world's a stage
Rewriting your itentity is all the rage,
Well next act please, I'd like a change
I don't really like pretending this way
What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me

I'm gonna burn this theater down and
Pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"this is it!"
I'm gonna burn this theater down
Pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"this is it!"
And the sad thing is we're all in on the action
We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction
You play your part, I'll be playing with matches
And if you'd like a show, you can follow the ashes
I'm gonna burn this theater down
Pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd,
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
"this is it!"
I'm gonna burn this theater down
Pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd,
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line
Like...

"This is it!"
