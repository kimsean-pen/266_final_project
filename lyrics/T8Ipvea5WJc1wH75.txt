I will close my eyes to see your face again
Let the love I feel rebuild my faith through pain, I remain
Defences down
Heart in my mouth

I still hear your voice, calling my name,
And like every new choice, it carries the promise,
That we'll find our love, that we're not just like moths to flame,
Already lost, moments before the storm

I'll cast the telling bones to know my fate dealt hand
And down the beach I'll trail your footprints in the sand, overland
Till I'll kiss your brow again
I'm right here now

I still hear your voice, calling my name,
And like every new choice, it carries the promise,
That we'll find our love, that we're not just like moths to flame,
Already lost, moments before the storm

Are we collateral damage
Is love its justification
How do we sing our songs
Despite

In truth it's visceral savage
This magnetic sensation
Cornered it becomes strong
And it fights, to be right, to be right

I still hear your voice, calling my name,
And like every new choice, it carries the promise,
That we'll find our love, that we're not just like moths to flame,
Already lost, moments before the storm
