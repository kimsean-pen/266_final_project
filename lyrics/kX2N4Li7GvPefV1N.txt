Yeah yeah
Alright
Love hurt, love hurt
Yeah yeah

Hey my girl
She did something to my chemistry
And when I'm close I'm sure
I raise her temperature by 3 degrees

Everyday in everyway
She makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin her

So we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And I don't have to ask
Cause I know it's
Gonna last eternally

(Now let me tell you what we got)

Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use
We're making nice

You see we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And she don't have to ask
Cause she know it's
Gonna last eternally

Said we got a
Good good good good good
thing going yeah yeah
That girl and me
together...
