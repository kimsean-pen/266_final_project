Lately I've thought about us,
And my mind plays this game where it trusts,
Every word that you said,
My memory serves to save

I like this digital age,
Where we're set to be forward in state,
if I could code me a hologram,
It'd be shaped like you,

My twentieth first century love,
There's nothing that could get across or between us,
My twentieth first century love,
There's nothing that we could dream of that couldn't be done

I drawn a plan with the moon,
It involves outer spacing with you,
We could build our own graves,
And give ourselves names like stars, stars

People would fly out to see,
Empty pockets and pay good money,
Cause it's our nature the dish would be king,
Beneath the rainbow curve

I'm inside already inside,
I was a bit early,
sorry I was just going to text you,
Can you come over to my place instead?
why didn't you say so,
i don't feel super well,
what's going on?
I think we should talk in person.

My twenty first century love,
There's nothing that could get across or between us,
My twentieth first century love,
There's nothing that we could dream of that couldn't be done
