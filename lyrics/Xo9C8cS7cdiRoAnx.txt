In my lover's eyes there is summertime
See you walking through the streets at night, only in my mind
I don't know you're name, but it's fine
Oh, it's fine
See you walking in my dreams at night, only in my mind
Young guns don't run, they never do
Young guns don't run
It's only me and you
Everything will be just fine when you come around
When you come around
Everything will be just fine when you come around
When you come around
Know where you've been hiding, baby know where you've been hiding out
Know that you are still the shining, know that you are still the only one
And our love is fast
body language that will last
See you walking through my dreams so fast, so fast
And I don't know your name, but it's fine
Oh, it's fine
See us walking in my dreams at night
if only in my mind
Young guns don't run, they never do
Young guns don't run, it's only me and you
Hey
Everything will be just fine, when you come around
When you come around
Everything will be just fine, when you come around
When you come around
