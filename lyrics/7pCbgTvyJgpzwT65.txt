It's the end
Oh baby you're leaving me
It's the end
You know that you're killing me
It's the pain
It's going to return to you
It's the pain
But you'll change your point of view
It's the end
Oh babe I believed in you
You're looking for someone better
You say I mistreated you
But now it don't really matter

Babe
You'll never meet an angel
Pray
To find a better guy oh baby
Hey
I've never been an angel
Pray
You'll never see me cry oh baby
Cold as the winter
Your soul is too cold
Cold as the winter
Your soul is too cold
Cold as the winter
Your soul is too cold
Cold as the winter
It's the end
Oh baby you're leaving me
It's the end
You know that you're killing me
It's the pain
It's going to return to you
It's the pain
But you'll change your point of view
It's the end
Oh babe I believed in you
You're looking for someone better
You say I mistreated you
But now it don't really matter
