I cannot turn away
From this obscurity
A nameless force
Is stealing my face

Come and try to fight me
You will never break me

I know it's the final breath I'm taking
If I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving
Or I'm giving in

Now I can see you
You were just hiding
You won't betray me
'Cause now I know your name

Come and try to fight me
You will never break me

I know it's the final breath I'm taking
If I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving
Or I'm giving in

Come and try to fight me, baby
You will never break me, no
[Incomprehensible]

Come and try to fight me, baby
You will never break me, no
[Incomprehensible]

I know it's the final breath I'm taking
If I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving
Or I'm giving in

I know it's the final breath I'm taking
If I let you win
So I cannot be the one forgiving
Or I'm giving in

Come and try to
Come and try to fight me
