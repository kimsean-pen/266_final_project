I am complete!

Fuck!

Yes, you are fucked, shit out of luck
Now I'm complete and my cock you will suck
This world will be mine and you're first in line
You brought me the pick and now you shall both die!

Wait! Wait! Wait!
You motherfucker
We challenge you to a rock-off!
Give us one chance to rock your socks off

Fuck, fuck, fuck
The demon code prevents me
From declining a rock-off challenge
What are your terms? What's the catch?

If we win, you must take your sorry ass back to Hell
And also you will have to pay our rent

And what if I win?

Then you can take Kage back to Hell
What?
Trust me Kage, it's the only way
What the fuck are you talking about?
To be your little bitch

Fine!
Let the rock off begin!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

I'm the Devil, I love Metal!
Check this riff, it's fucking tasty
I'm the Devil, I can do what I want
Whatever I got I'm gonna flaunt
There's never been a rock-off that I've ever lost
I can't wait to take Kage back to Hell
I'm gonna fill him with my hot demon gel
I'll make him squeal like my Scarlet Pimpernel

No!
Come on Kage, bring the thunder
There's just no way that we can win
That was a masterpiece
Listen to me
He rocks too hard because he's not a mortal man
Goddammit, Kage
He gonna make you his sex slave
You're gonna gargle mayonnaise
No
Unless we bust a massive monster mamma jam
Dude
We've been through so much shit
Deactivated lasers with my dick
Now it's time to blow this fucker down!
Come on Kage, now it's time to blow doors down
I hear you Jables, now it's time to blow doors down
Light up the stage 'cause it's time for a showdown
We'll bend you over then we'll take you to Brown Town
Now we've got to blow this fucker down
He's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down
Come on Kage 'cause it's time to blow doors down
Oh, we'll piledrive you, it's time for the smackdown
Hey Antichrister, Beelzeboss
We know your weakness, our rocket sauce
We rock the Casbah, and blow your mind
We will defeat you for all mankind
You hold the scepter
We hold the key
You are the Devil
We are the D!
We are the D, we are the D, we are the D, we are the D, we are the D
We are the D, we are the D, we are the D, we are the D
We are the D, we are the D, we are the D, we are the D
We are the D, we are the D, we are the D, we are the D

You guys are fuckin' lame!
Come on Kage, you're coming with me
Taste my lightning, fucker!

No!

Ow! Fuck!
My fuckin' horn!
Oh no!

From whence you came
You shall remain
Until you are complete again

No!
Fuck you Kage and fuck you Jables!
I'll get you Tenacious D!
