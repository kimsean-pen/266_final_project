Maybe I'm the one who's so full of shit

Point the finger
Reject the blame
Dig deep in a heart that breaks
No spine to be found
Pick me up from the ground

Maybe I'm the one who's so full of shit
Point the finger
Reject the blame
All my friends who have wasted their lives
We are one in the same

I was too quick to judge
We're all alone in this

I put the drugs in between us
I told myself that it changed you
But I'm the one who changed

Point the finger
Reject the blame
I call out for help
But I'll never call your fucking name
Anguish

I did away with the poison
But I still feel like I'm dying
