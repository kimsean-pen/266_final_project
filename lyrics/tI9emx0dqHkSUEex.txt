I've heard the devil speak
Speak through a man
And I found them listening
I've seen the holy take
Take to a fool
And I've seen them following

Long enough to know
I fall somewhere outside it all

Let me recuse myself
Lose myself
Excuse myself from your world
Recuse myself
Lose myself
Excuse myself from your world

I've felt the weight of death
I've held the hand
And I've tread a fading line
I'm not afraid to go
And still I am
I've sung the battle cry

Long enough to know
I fall somewhere outside it all

Let me recuse myself
Lose myself
Excuse myself from your world
Recuse myself
Lose myself
Excuse myself from your world

I never saw myself inside your shadow
But now I dig to pull myself out of your grave
I don't know where I stand
I just can't meet your demands
Time to find my way out

Let me recuse myself
Lose myself
Excuse myself from your world
From your world
