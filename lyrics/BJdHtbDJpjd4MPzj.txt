You're superstition
So am I
We believe in the saints
In lucky charms of all kinds
Good, beggars
We call them creatures of the night
To come and dance into the moon light
My lucky cat,
Behind my back
It's singing sweet 2, 1, 0

Oh oh Maneki Neko x 2
Un, dois, trios quatre

Make me luck, make me shine
I'm so out of my mind
It's so strange, it's a mud
So hard to understand
It is blind
The divine
All the way up
To my spine

Oh oh Maneki Neko x 2
Un, dois, trios, quatre
Maneki Neko
