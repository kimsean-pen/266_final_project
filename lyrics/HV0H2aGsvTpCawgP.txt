Well you'd better get home
'Cause your Daddy's awake
Said he saw you last night
Making out by the lake
With a boy that he hates,
Doesn't look at me the same way that you do.

Said I look pretty cute but
I don't got the grades
Seen the star on my foot
And the way I behave
And we're better off when Daddy's out of town

Oh baby you've got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go,
Doesn't mean he's gotta know
Oh baby you've got nothing to lose
And we're better off when Daddy's not around

He doesn't give his consent
So now we can't afford
The perfect wedding you want
Gotta do it abroad
In a place you adore,
So I got us on a plane to Hawaii

Where the weather is nice
And where we are alone
None of Daddy's advice
Followed us here from home
It'll be chilled out when Daddy's not around

Oh baby you've got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go,
Doesn't mean he's gotta know
Oh baby you've got nothing to lose
And we're better off when Daddy's not around

I can't be around him and I've tried
Told him once I liked him but I lied
Find some way to make him change his mind
What can I do to be with you.

Oh baby you've got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go,
Doesn't mean he's gotta know
Oh baby you've got nothing to lose
And we're better off when Daddy's not around
