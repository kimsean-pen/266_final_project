Why'd you have to go and do it to me?
Your psychopathic-self went and cut the brakes on my car
If I survive she probably gonna sue me
And if I die she'll make sure that I'm six feet under her house

Angeline, won't you listen to me, please
I don't know what I did, baby
I'm just tryna' live, baby
So Angeline, no, I'm not tryna' cause a scene
But you need to get out of here, girl
All my family thinks you're crazy, yeah

I've got something I wanna say
I'm tryna' keep this conversation moving
And I don't wanna do it all day
Just find someone to take my place
He might appreciate your sense of humor
He might just be as equally insane

Angeline, won't you listen to me, please
I don't know what I did, baby
I'm just tryna' live, baby
So Angeline, no, I'm not tryna' cause a scene
But you need to get out of here, girl
All my family thinks you're crazy, yeah

Angeline, she's been on the vicodins
I don't know what you do with you
Girl, I think I'm through with you
So, Angeline, she's been drinking too much lean
Oh, it's making her weak, it's making her weak, it's making her weak, oh, yeah

Angeline, she's been on the vicodins
I don't know what to do with that girl
Man, I swear I'm through with that girl
Angeline, you're drinking way too much codeine
And you can't fall asleep here, girl
You're not allowed to sleep here, girl
