Oh, rock me, hey
Yeah

Rock me, baby, rock me all night long
Rock me all night long
Rock me, baby, rock me all night long
Want you to rock me like my back ain't got no bone

Roll me, mama like a wagon wheel
Roll me, baby like you roll a wagon wheel
Rock 'n' roll, mama
Won't you rock me, mama?
Know how it could have made me feel

Rock me, baby, rock me slow
Rock me on till I can't rock no more
Rock me, baby, rock me all night long, hoo
Once you rock me like my back ain't got no bone
Yeah, rock me

Yeah

Rock me, mama, rock me slow
Rock me, baby, till I can rock no more
Rock me, baby, rock me all night long
Rock me all night long
Want you to rock me, baby, like my back ain't got no bone
Yeah
