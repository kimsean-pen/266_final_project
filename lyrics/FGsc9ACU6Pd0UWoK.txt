You say the pain will liberate me
You turn my body into knots and tell me it's a blessing
You say you love me love in this shape
That there is beauty in my suffering
I wonder would I stay
If you asked for it
You still create the shape
And I ask for it
I gave my heart in pieces
Please release me I'm tired
Don't try to pacify me
Please release me I'm tired
I'm slipping away
No discipline just let me be
And now my body starts to worry
Put down the words I will not hesitate
This is your chance make me relatable
Knock me down with your false intentions
It turns to ash in my mouth
I need you gone
I beg you to release me
Now I turn my body into something
Into the shape you find so trusting
I could never be that shape
You caught me slipping
Farther down in madness
Echo chamber (nod your)
Leave my body in peace
No need to pacify me
Nod your head yes
The pain will set you free
I gave my heart in pieces please release me I'm tired
Don't try to pacify me please release me I'm tired
Leave my body in peace
No need to pacify me
You find escape in the reverie
This is the beauty of suffering
I love you I always will
My heart is always still
(please release me I'm tired)
You find the strength in the reverie
This is the beauty of suffering
