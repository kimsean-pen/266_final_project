(All good people are asleep and dreaming.)

Every truncheon hit
Misguided
The peoples army divided
United stance
Amped out war dance
What a ride
Inner thought of non violent rebellion outside dare To die stand and fight
Show faith return all the weapons
Government says use them right
Fixed action set in motion doubting amnesia potion What to hide red carpet ride
Guessing right

(Ah ha ha)

The jokes on
Dark corner the square

(Ah ha ha)

You bath once a week distorted
The viewpoint seldom seen
Wayback in 68
Ohio kent state
Was nothing so great
Have of have not
Forcing the point
Shot in the back
Take it back
Down trod soldier away
Flower power
Within
Kill me
Kill this way of life

(All good people are asleep and dreaming)

Unbeknown one by one they'll be coming down Altogether sister machine gun
Automatic high what a ride what a trip tripped over The candlestick
Tanks arrive
Fire wall got to keep the camera alive
Tell the world
Tell the world whats going on
Here
Warning shots are
Fired at the stomach chest wound coed falls
Amped out
Amped out
Amped out
Amped out
Changing guns for brooms the guards change to clean up crews

(Ha ha ha)

The jokes on you
Dark corner the square

(Ha ha ha)

You bath once a week distorted
The viewpoint seldom seen
Way back in 68 every thing was so great
No way
Wrong date
Keep up the trade
Balanced charade
Close circuit truth
Used to remove
Keep the camera alive

(All good people are asleep and dreaming)

(Mind Trip)
