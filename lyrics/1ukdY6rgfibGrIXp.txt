Maybe you've forgotten who to ask
Maybe you're pining for things past
Maybe you've forgotten who to ask
Ask

I can take you to places further than you know
Send you to the edge, feel the vertigo
Make your heart beat 'til your chest gets tight
I'm letting you go so you've gone all night

Maybe you're pining for things past
Maybe you've forgotten who to ask
Ask

Ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh x

Walk through walls for you
Swing the bat back
Sew the darkest groove before your mind cracks

Is it me or you
Who's bringing who back
Who's bringing who back

Ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh x

Friends, healing her she fears
Friends, cold as glass,
Friends, standing in contempt
Friends, time goes past
Friends, healing some fears
Friends, cold as glass
Friends, standing in contempt
Friends, time has passed

Time has passed x

Walk through walls for you
Swing the bat back
Saw the darkness grew before your mind cracked
Is it me or you
Who's bringing who back
Who's bringing who back x
