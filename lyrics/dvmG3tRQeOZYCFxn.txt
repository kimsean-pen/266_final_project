Wrench is just a household God
But I carry mine with pride
I don't work but I can work with it to split your smile
Run you down without a twitch
Your car's just not as big as mine
Tear the son out of your bitch and
Sprinkle your remains with lime
I ain't no workin' man
I do the best I can
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man
I use up all I can
I got the slacker's hand
My afternoon's remote control
Daydream milk and genocide
Tranquility with broken knees
Silly putty enemies
Butter knife in your side
What I got I got for free
Middle finger technology
What's yours is mine
Yours is mine
Told you fucker, yours is mine
Snake eyes for sissies
I ain't no workin' man
I do the best I can
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man
I use up all I can
I got the slacker's hand
I am the pedophlle's dream
A messianic Peter Pan
Just a boy, just a boy
Just a little fucking boy
I can never be a man
I ain't no workin' man
I do the best I can
I got the devil's hand
Rollin' sixes
I am the habit man
I use up all I can
I got the slacker's hand
I ain't no workin' man
I do the best I can
I got the devil's hand
I am the habit man
I use up all I can
I got the slacker's hand
(Oh no, Oh no)
