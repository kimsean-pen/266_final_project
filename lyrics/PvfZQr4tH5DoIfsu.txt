I can't concentrate, I'm in a state
I don't feel straight, I can't love or hate
I can't feel nothing, can't feel no sting
Only just learning, I ain't a king

You're in a rut,
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut,
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it... out of it!

Ain't no use, you ain't that sloose
Don't tie that noose, it's just abuse
Don't take that ride, it's suicide
You cut your wrist, You tried and missed.

You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it.
You're in a rut,
You gotta get out of it, out of it - out of it... out of it!

I can't concentrate, I'm in a state
I don't feel straight, I can't love or hate
I can't feel nothing, can't feel no sting
Only just learning, I ain't a king

You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it... OUT OF IT!

Ain't no use, you ain't that sluiced
Don't tie that noose, it's just abuse
Don't take that ride, it's suicide
You cut your wrist, You tried and missed

You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it.

You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it...

You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it
You're in a rut
You gotta get out of it - out of it - out of it - out of it...
