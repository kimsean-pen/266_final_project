Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo

I'm alone, it's just me and I'm watching TV
And I'm always, oh, so bored at home
I get up I get out, drive my car way down town
Keep on calling but you're never around

See my friends out tonight
Under these city lights in the club
'Til someone starts a fight
Then we get in the car
Still don't know where you are
I'm so pissed off
Always hanging around

And I'm so tired, you're fired
I'm so jealous restless relentless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need

You know what they say
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lies are free
Talk is cheap

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo

Now we're out in the street and we're sweatingv the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don't care if you choke
When you light up your smoke
It's the one that I can't call my own
It's so tragic, I'm so many

I'm so jealous restless relentless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need

You know what they say
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lies are free
Talk is cheap, yeah

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo

I'm so tired, you're fired
I'm so jealous restless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need

You know what they say
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lies are free
Talk is cheap

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo

Talk is cheap, yeah

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Woohoo, woohoo
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Yeah, lies are free
Talk is cheap
