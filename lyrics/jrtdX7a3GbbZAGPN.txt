you put the pill inside the petal
you put the petal in your mouth
you put your love inside the metal
you build the metal for your house
and the night runs wild
you put the pill inside the petal
and it runs white
you put the petal in your mouth
you put your blood into the metal
and it runs white
you build the metal for your house
you put the pill inside the metal
you put the metal in your mouth
you bleed into your house of nettles
you bleed the night without a sound
there's an ocean inside your chest
we've been sleeping inside your head
there's an ocean inside your chest
we've been sleeping inside your hand
