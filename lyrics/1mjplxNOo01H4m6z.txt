In the dead of night I'll meet you in my sleep
And in the morning light you'll wake up next to me
Like a dream come true I'll take you where I roam
Then follow you back home

Tell me you care
Tell me you care

If I lose my way and forget what I need
Just remind me now of what you give to me
If you hold my hand and take me where you go
I'll show you the side that no one knows

I'm taking you there
I'm taking you there

If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
(You're the light, you're the light...)
And everything you need
I could give you
If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
(You're the light, you're the light to guide to me)
And everything you have
I could take too

Tell me you care
I'm taking you there
Tell me you care
(If scars are for the living, I could be forgiven)
I'm taking you there
(If scars are for the living, I could be forgiven)
Tell me you care
