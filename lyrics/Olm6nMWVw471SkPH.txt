I look up to the sky above
Full of sweet release
From the days that I waste
Trying to fight for space
Well I know what my heart believes

I won't run when the storm clouds come
I won't turn away

Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain
Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain

As we wait for the light to fade
I keep asking why
All those stones that we threw
That the shadows grow
And close every road we try

I won't run when the storm clouds come
I won't turn away

Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain
Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain

[Vocal Solo]

I look up at the sky above
Full of sweet release
From the dreams that I chase
Trying to find some face
In a world that I don't believe, no

I won't run when the storm clouds come
I won't turn away

Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain
Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain, yeah
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
