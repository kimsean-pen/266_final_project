A low riding junkie girl
rode down south to your little world, like a dream
you can do it if you want to
you can do it if you want to
you can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't be a hero, if I wasn't such a zero, if I wasn't such a zero
good to go
All I ever see around here is things of her's that you left lying around
it's all I ever see around here
she kicked New York like a curse
and you traced her footsteps in reverse
up to Queens
you can do it if you want to
you can do it if you want to
you can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't be a hero if I wasn't such a zero
if I wasn't such a zero
good to go
All I ever see around here is things of her's that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here
some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see around here
I'm waiting for something that's not coming
