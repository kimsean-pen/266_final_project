It's 2: 30 a.m.
I slowly come awake.
And I know somethings not right.
I walk slowly to the door,
and feel the heat through the walls;
smell the burning outside...

And all I can see
are these flames around me.
And all I can think
is I'm here alone.
Please find me and save me...

And even if the world ignites into flames
you'll be right here by my side.
And as it burns away,
you smile at me and say
that, "not even death could take me away from you..."

The fires are growing close,
and all I smell is smoke... Yeah.
Still it's beautiful to me.
I hope you get here soon;
I've been waiting here for you.
I believed in you...

So hurry please.
There's these flames around me.
Pleas come save me...

And even if the world ignites into flames
you'll be right here by my side.
And as it burns away,
you smile at me and say that,
"not even death could take me away from you..."

Where are you tonight?
Come find me...
Come find me...
Cause you're not here by my side.

And even if the world ignites into flames
you'll be right here by my side...

Come home to me...
Where are you tonight, love?
Where are you tonight, love?
Cause you're not here,
you're not here with me.
Please come home...
Please come home...
Please come home...
Your not here by my side
It's burning outside!
Please come home...
Cause you're not
Cause you're not here,
you're not here with me...

I've been waiting here for you...
I hope you make it soon.
The flames are right outside my door...
