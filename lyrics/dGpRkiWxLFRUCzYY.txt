I don't mind stealin' bread from
The mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled, yeah
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies
While the slaves are all workin'
Blood is on the table and the mouths are all chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

I don't mind stealin' bread from
The mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled, uh huh
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies
While the slaves are all workin'
And it's on the table, their mouths are all chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)

I'm goin' hungry (I'm goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)

I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)

(Yeah, I don't mind stealin' bread) I don't mind
(No, I don't mind stealin' bread)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry) yeah
