In the Devoid of Sorrow
The Air and my Heart full of Luster

Behind the Mountains
Blasphemy to the Gates

Right passed easy Talk
We can once again walk the Path of Sorrow
Let the Turn of Search bring you away

Ahhhhh!

Two Shades of the Midnight Fire
In the Night Sky
You waiting Child walk with me
Walk by Side of Fall
The Essence to open those Gates
And still we must walk the Path of Sorrow
