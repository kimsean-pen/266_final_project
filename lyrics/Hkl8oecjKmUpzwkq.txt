Fifth Harmony
Yeah, yeah

Ever since I was young I'm tryna get it right
Every year I'm working towards the goal
Don't sleep 'til we see the daylight
Living big, going up on the rope
I like seeing all the bright lights
Keep it up, pour it up for the night
Two times, I'mma get it two times
Double up, run it back on my mind

This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life

Give it up for the kids eating good, getting lit
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, this is the life
We the best in the biz, breaking up ain't a chance
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, yeah

Level up, meet me court side
Tricking out, whipping hard in the coupe
I'mma go, gotta board flight
Off the term, there's a show I gotta do
No stress, baby you can find us
Getting down on a beach in Dubai
Pool side, sipping on a Mai Tai
Double up, run it back on my mind

This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life

Give it up for the kids eating good, getting lit
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, this is the life
We the best in the biz, breaking up ain't a chance
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, yeah

No stress, baby you can find us
Getting down on a beach in Dubai
Pool side, sipping on a Mai Tai
Double up, up, up, up

This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life, this is the life

Give it up for the kids eating good, getting lit
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, this is the life
We the best in the biz, breaking up ain't a chance
Living life, feeling rich, oh, I, oh, I, yeah

This is the life, yeah
