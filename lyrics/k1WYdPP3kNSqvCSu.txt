Waking up, with sunbeams in my eyes
And the world outside, seems to pass me by
Embrace the land, where the ocean meets the sand
And emotion fades away, until you take my hand

I will be coming with you, tonight
You're all that I want, you're all I have, you're all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun you're the only one who can set me free
You will set me free

Still so young and anxious to be free
But now I'm trapped inside, with all these memories
There's more than this, if you open up your eyes
And then soon you will realize, those days are all gone

I will be coming with you, tonight
You're all that I want, you're all I have, you're all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun you're the only one who can set me free

We need to find a way to live
There's more to take, there's more to give
We try so hard, we try so hard and this time
We're on our way

I will be coming with you, tonight
You're all that I want, you're all I have, you're all I need
Oh, oh you will be shining on me
Like a midnight sun you're the only one who can set me free
Like a midnight sun you're the only one who can set me free
Like a midnight sun, like a midnight sun, like a midnight sun
