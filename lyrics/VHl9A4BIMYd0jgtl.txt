I wonder if he'll stand before me again, if we'll make peace in that same blazing light
I lost sight long before sleep, for hours I've wandered in the dark
Does he still stand firm on the horizon, patiently waiting, so sickly insisting
Or has he already walked into eternity? A storm is rising and it's late in the night
I look up at the moon and down at the ground, but he's nowhere around
Just say the words, he says. Well, I wish it were that simple
Leave everything, everyone else behind. Still, just say the words he says
Well, my throat is filthy old and dry. I've said those words of trickery before,
That would bend and break my spine. But this time around I'm sure I'll be fine
On the horizon. Between earth and sky. Hovering above water
Moving closer. With fire in his eyes
I could claim I'm possessed, but at best I'm a dissembler in disguise
Hiding behind affectations. How do you live with yourself
Once you surrender to the word? It's not as if I haven't tried already,
And gone under more times, than I dare to remember
I could say I lost my ground, just this one last time
Cursed is the word that'll describe. The feeling I bear inside;
Loveless, pitiless, relentless. In the company of snakes,
I find complacency. How can I stomach the horizon
That perpetual light and let the devil take the hindmost?
On the horizon. Between earth and sky. Hovering above water
Moving closer. With fire in his eyes
