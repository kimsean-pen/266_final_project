Through the trials, and the the gaps in the free
From what once was a seed, to what we've grown to be
Travelled miles, across the oceans and seas
Nothing's out of reach, living positively
This is our song to remember, all the places we have been
Remember every dream, the things we said
Our hope will never end
This is our song to remember
Through the darkest dark and the brightest bright, we walked this path
together
Through the hardest parts of all our lives, we carried one another
Heads high, arms locked, we move on keeping close to where we began
Open eyes, don't stop, we stay strong tracing back to where our roots grew in
This is our song to remember
Never stopped moving forward,
Never forgot what we're made for
Always changing, but always true
A tree stands strong, but not without it's roots
This is our song to remember, all the places we have been
Remember every dream, the things we said
Our hope will never end
This is our song to remember
