"Stay Forever"

Silence in the living room
Hours feel like days
Silence when I speak to you
Your a thousands miles away
Crying for real oh yes your worth the prize
Because when the mind gets clouding
I forget about our fights

Stay forever, it's never again
My words have been spoken,
It will come to an end
Stay forever, it's never again
My words have been spoken,
It will come to an end

I'll affiche your energy
Running through my veins
Chemical the love I feel
For faces without name
Crying for real Oh, yes your worth the prize
Because when your mind gets clouding
I forget about our fights

Stay forever, it's never again
My words have been spoken,
It will come to an end
Stay forever, it's never again
My words have been spoken,
It will come to an end

This empty house is not a home
find the will to stand alone
Without your armour
Flesh and blood for turn to stone
find the will to stand alone
And wait to turn away

Stay forever, its never again
Our words have been spoken, it will come to an end
Stay forever, its never again
Our words have been spoken, it will come to an end

Stay Forever

Stay Forever!
