Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered...

It's easy for you
To lean into nostalgia
What you deserve, what you deserve
And what you should have known

It's comforting to
Allow yourself to feel pain
Maybe it's true, maybe it's true
You feel more alive this way

We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We don't want another shape, we just don't wanna be misunderstood
And you know, you know
We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We try hard to play the game cause we just want to feel something good

(Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered...)

It's hard to break the habit
And the past is no excuse
To treat the ones, to treat the ones
Like villains in your movie

Your head is on the table
Is anyone to blame?
So stitch it up, now stitch it up
Only you can make the change

We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We don't want another shape, we just don't wanna be misunderstood
And you know, you know
We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We try hard to play the game cause we just want to feel something good

(Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered, Hot'n bothered...)

Too late too late
Go home
Leave it leave it alone
Too high too high
Calm down
All night all night
Open

We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We don't want another shape, we just don't wanna be misunderstood
And you know, you know
We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We try hard to play the game cause we just want to feel something good

We would never be the same if it wasn't for our deepest wounds
And we know, we know
We try hard to play the game cause we just want to feel something good

I have a feeling we're not in New York anymore
