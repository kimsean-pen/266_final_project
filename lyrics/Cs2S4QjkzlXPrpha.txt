You've known some girls who couldn't pull the gun
Your bed is warm but I love a good storm
There's been some boys that I've made very sad
Your love is tasteful but taste can go bad
Out with old, in with the new
That's the way that this world works
When I'm with you all my senses go blue
And I can't help but fight it
I've got lots of boy toys
And if you can't play nice
You'll go back where you've been
I know that you think you got me locked down
You're the only good thing I've got in this town
But I've got lots of boy toys
Lot's of boy toys
Walking 'round angry 'bout things I've done wrong
Telling me I don't know how to sing songs
You're just a tired old sad little man
Yes, I'm a big girl, don't need holding hands
Out with old, in with the new
That's the way that this world works
When I'm with you all my senses go blue
And I can't help but fight it
I've got lots of boy toys
And if you can't play nice
You'll go back where you've been
I know that you think you got me locked down
You're the only good thing I've got in this town
But I've got lots of boy toys
Lot's of boy toys
Lot's of boy toys
Lot's of boy toys
Lot's of
Lot's of boy toys
Lot's of
I've got lots of boy toys
And if you can't play nice
You'll go back where you've been
I know that you think you got me locked down
You're the only good thing I've got in this town
But I've got lots of boy toys
Lot's of boy toys
