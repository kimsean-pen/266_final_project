See the fear goes beyond
Four thousand five hundred million years

Nails come off
Hair falls off with scalp
Visibililty gets narrow slowly
Who do we hand over the responsibilities

Justice sometimes
Become unpaid sin
Only leave and tell aftereffects
Remorse and hapiness
To weapons
We demand and built

Arm I raise exhausted
Those phrases are madly fascinating
I breathe and my thoughts crumble
Caused heat after decieved

Vanish, vanish, vanish
The calling on knees says

Where an exiled man who had wrong
Ideas of hope in the past goes?
Responsibilities passed around and
Sank into oblivion Shifted a stare gently
Dedicated to your shoes and
The world to come
