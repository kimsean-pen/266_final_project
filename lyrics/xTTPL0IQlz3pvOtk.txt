Star A.D
See tomorrow dreaming
You don't need your freedom
Star A.D
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world

A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
Over
Over
Over
And dying is dry
Like a fact of history
And when you die
You'll become something worse than dead
You'll become
A legend
See tomorrow dreaming
You don't need your freedom
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We...
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We...
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
Over
Over
Over
