Baby you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat

When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
When you give me something I've never known
So baby you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

No need to question next time we meet
I know you're coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna, break up the ice
I know you're gonna stay the night, stay the night

When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place

I just, I just can't let you go
When you give me something I've never known
Baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place
At my place
