If time came to an end today and we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back, what would we want to change?

Now's the time to take a chance
Come on, we got to make a stand
What if we gotta lose the choices in our hands
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like there's no tomorrow ('cause, all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (the only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe in it and it'll never die
So never let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

It never was a night at day and then the week will fade away
Let it be, nothing less, and let the dreams remain.
Take a leap and fade and hope you fly
Feel what it's like to be alive
Give it all, what we've got and lay it all on the line
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like there's no tomorrow ('cause, all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (the only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and it'll never die
So never let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

Will you be by my side?
We'll do this together
Just you and me, nothing is impossible Nothing is impossible

Live like there's no tomorrow ('cause, all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (the only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe in it and it'll never die
So never let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

Live like there's no tomorrow ('cause, all we have is here right now)
Love like it's all that we know (the only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside
