Hey, what did I do?
Can't believe the fit I just threw
Stupid (Hey!)
Wanted the reaction (Hey!)
(Wanted the reaction)

I remember the words
How I said them, so they would hurt
But then, (Hey!) I regret my actions
(Hey!) I regret my actions

If I could press rewind
Rewind the tape
Redefine the line
We make mistakes
Take it back in time
Just one day (Hey!) Ay

So all I need is a Time Machine
A one way track 'cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

Yeah who's laughing now?
Didn't think you'd actually go
Stupid (Hey!)
Me and all my bitching (Hey!)
(Me and all my bitching)

Second thoughts and regrets
Wanna alt, delete and reset but then (Hey!)
This ain't science fiction (Hey!)
(This ain't science fiction)

If I could press rewind
Rewind the tape
Redefine the line
We make mistakes
Take it back in time
Just one day (Hey!) Ay

So all I need is a Time Machine
A one way track 'cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

Taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back, taking it back

So all I need is a Time Machine
A one way track 'cause
I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

Taking it back, taking it back
Oh yeah!
