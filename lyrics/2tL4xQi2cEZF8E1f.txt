I saw werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
For to get a big dish of beef chow mein

Ah-hoo...
Werewolves of London
Ah-hoo...

You hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again

Ah-hoo...

Huh

He's the hairy handed gent who ran amok in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him he'll rip your lungs out Jim

Huh I'd like to meet his tailor
Ah-hoo...
Werewolves of London
Ah-hoo...

His hair was perfect
