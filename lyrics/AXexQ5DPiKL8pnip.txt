Talk as if I'm ready to die
But I'm really not ready to die
I don't mind
You can tell me 'bout your day
If you wanna sit together
In silence for a number of hours
That is OK
That is fine by me
I was surprised you see
When you asked if I wanted to chill
Because you used to say
You're really not a fan of awkward tension
And I can be quiet and self loathing
And have a constant need for attention
Not to mention
Confusing humor
I might be rude about your music taste
So, I'm sorry in advance
But the industry moves quickly
And I feel the need to keep up with names and faces
So I find new sounds on a daily basis
It's not difficult to listen on a daily basis, but
Still question my existence on a daily basis
Tie my shoes up on a daily basis
Write my thoughts down on a daily basis
Worry about life
And wonder how many days I have left on this daily basis
Sixteen years in so see all you're able to see
Sixteen years in because you'll never be free
And I should really get to sleep
