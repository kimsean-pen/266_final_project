When she was just a girl
You didn't even know her name
When she was just alone
You were never there to say

(I love you, love you, love you, my girl)
All these years, all this time
Where have you been
I won't even ask
(I need you, need you, need you)
All that is left is fumes and tears
My heart as light as dust
Piano dust

When do you feel most free
When do you feel truly special
Is it when they like who you are
Even when that's not really you, oh

(I love you, love you, love you, my girl)
All this time, all of your heart
Who have you tried to please?
(I need you, need you, need you)
Take yourself back to where you belong
Someone's still waiting for you, for you
My soul clings to the dust
Soul clings to the dust
My soul clings to the dust
Soul clings to the dust
My soul clings to the dust
Soul clings to the dust
My soul clings to the dust
Soul clings to the dust
