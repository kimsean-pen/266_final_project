Cold light of the stars the same
A flag drew a line in the wind
If I was awake there's a world that I left
Never far behind
From the time that I spent on the Arctic ice

One moon has a name
Only one to a dream evolved
And in the night she's ashamed
Tell her drive through a darkened sea
Below, beyond the world
How deep does the water go?

Cold trail of the last descent
Across held a sign in the wind
And time fell away
With the sound of each step
If the stars align then
For us they were meant in the lunar sky

That moon has a name
In the fires of a silver corpse
And on the ice I'm afraid
Of the drop through a darkened sea
Below, beyond the world
How deep does the water go?
