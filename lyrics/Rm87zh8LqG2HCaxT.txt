Here's that part again
Where everything's more than it should be and
Greener seems to fall beneath your feet

Seconds tick like boulders
Whenever you don't call
Does it seem like that where you are
Wherever it is you are
Does it seem like that where you are (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Time for time together
And depending on the weather
We'll either argue in your
House or outside

How different I felt
Before I got this notch on my belt
'cause in my plans you were all for me
Yeah but now it seems that you'd just rather leave

Wherever you go
Is breaking me slowly
Don't leave it alone
Don't leave it alone
You sound so much further on the phone
You fit just right
Right next to me
But there's always a reason why it can't be

Telephones make you seem miles away from home
All alone I get a little meaner
I leave a message at your tone
And miles away from home
You get a little cleaner of me
And I find a little greener shade of envy

Wherever you go
Is breaking me slowly
Don't leave it alone
Don't leave it alone
You sound so much further on the phone
You fit just right
Right next to me
But there's always a reason why it can't be

Tissues get used
Getting rid of you
Don't you see what you do to me
And you just let it be

I wish you'd get used
And then come running back
To the shoulder that's become me
To the shoulder that's me

Wherever you are
Is breaking my heart
Don't leave it alone
Don't leave it alone

You fit just right
Right next to me
