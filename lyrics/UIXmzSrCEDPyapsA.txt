When I feel all alone and nobody knows
Still gotta smile for a while I can't let it show
Dry my tears, dry my tears

Have no fears, have no fears
And when I'm, and when I'm backstage feeling down
And the lights come on, no time to worry
Gotta hurry
Gotta sing my song
Gonna shake it off, shake it off
Strike a pose, strike a pose
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that

Don't get what I want
Just 'cause I want it

I'm super cool
Super hot
Living like a rock star
You think I'm super
You think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super

I'm super-duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
Never as easy as it seems
To be super, super
To be super, super girl

When I walk in the room
Everybody stops
Camera's flashing
People fighting for the best shot
They like my hair, like my hair
The clothes I wear, clothes I wear
Everybody wants to know
What I'm doing next
Sometimes I wish I could
Stay home just be by myself

I wanna be I wanna be
Walking free
Can't you see
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want
Just 'cause I want it

Wish you could see
I'm like everybody else
Struggling to let go
And always be myself

I'm super cool
Super hot
Super
I'm super, super
I'm super, super
On the cover of your magazine
Where ever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super
I'm super, super
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super, super
To be super, super girl
