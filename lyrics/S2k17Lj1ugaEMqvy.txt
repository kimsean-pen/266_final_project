This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn

But how do I feel
In my gloomy depths?

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
Like the flat brink of a cloud.
Like a dark night in autumn
A black winter day

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn
A black winter day

This is how the lucky feel
How the blessed think
Like daybreak in spring
The sun on a spring morning
Like the flat brink of a cloud
Like a dark night in autumn

A black winter day
No, darker than that
Gloomier that an autumn night
