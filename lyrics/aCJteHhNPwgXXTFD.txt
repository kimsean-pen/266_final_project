I see no, hear no evil
Black writing on the wall
Unleashed a million faces
And one by one they fall

Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero
I am all, I am all, I am

I... I... I... I am!
Here we go, buddy
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Here we go, buddy
Here we go

Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare (dare!)
One step forward, two steps back
I'm here (One step forward, two steps back)
Do it... do it... do it... DO IT!

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life

Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
(I am, I am all of me!)

I am... I am, I'm all of me
I am... I am, I'm all of me
I am... I am, I'm all of me
(Here we go)

I see and feel the evil
My hands will crush 'em all
You think you have the answers
I'll laugh and watch you fall

Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero
I am all, I am all, I am

I... I... I... I am!
Here we go, buddy
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Here we go, buddy
Here we go

Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare (dare!)
One step forward two steps back
I'm here (One step forward, two steps back)
Do it... do it... do it... DO IT!

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life

Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
(I am, I am all of me)

I am... I am, I'm all of me
I am... I am, I'm all of me
I am... I am, I'm all of me
(Here we go)

I am...
I am everyone, everywhere
Anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am...
I am everyone, everywhere
Anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am! I am! I am!

I am! I am! I am!
I am!
Do it... do it... do it... DO IT!

Can you see all of me?
