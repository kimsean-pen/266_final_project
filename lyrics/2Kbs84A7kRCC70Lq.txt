All alone, in a place I can't remember
Lost control, forgot what I was chasing after
The lies I've tried to justify, have kept me up at night
I'm done trying to hide my lies away from mercy's eyes

Every little secret, that I kept there Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And all the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all

This is a war, I'm done with getting over
The weight is more, then I was ever meant to shoulder
Only You can save this life so I come clean tonight

Every little secret, that I kept there Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And all the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all

You made right what I made wrong
Once and for all
You put an end to who I was
Once and for all
All the shame thats in my soul, met Your grace and is no more

Every little secret, that I kept there Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And all the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
