In more ways then one I've been fighting the gravity,
It pulled me back to you.
You could find yourself or the true side of loyalty
It broke me as the sun comes through my window.
We are nearly alone.
In many years from now you'll find yourself with a family
And they won't wait for you.
You couldn't find yourself,
You couldn't find any honestly,
It broke me as the sun comes through my window...
Alone indoors.

Break me off on another day when I prayed for you.
There wasn't much to say, I threw you out on a holiday.
When I looked for you, you didn't wanna play.
What we had today,
I'll Remember it.
And I'm not taking chances with our friendship.
Separate rooms,
Cure me of you somehow. (so inside out I feel)
He's just a bit too cautious.
He knows just when to leave.
And I spoke to her about him, her eyes say she believes
