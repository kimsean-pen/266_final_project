I don't wanna take from you
I don't need an I.O.U
Keep your pockets superglued
I got nothing, you got nothing
Be my Yoko Ono muse
Serotonin, bullet proof
Never better, never blue
I got nothing, you got nothing

All I wanna spend is one more night
Between your sheets, behind your eyes
Keep your money, you can take my time

I don't need it, a car to drive alone
I don't need it, a house that ain't a home
I need you on the passenger side
A house gets cold with nobody inside
Some shit I just don't need in life but I need you

Play those records that you like
Keep it simple, keep it light
Every morning, every night
I got nothing, you got nothing
I got secret skeletons
You got problems just like them
Maybe you're my medicine
Maybe I'm your medicine

All I wanna spend is one more night
Between your sheets, behind your eyes
Keep your money, you can take my time

I don't need it, a car to drive alone
I don't need it, a house that ain't a home
I need you on the passenger side
A house gets cold with nobody inside
Some shit I just don't need in life but I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you

I don't need it, a car to drive alone
I don't need it, a house that ain't a home
I need you on the passenger side
A house gets cold with nobody inside
Some shit I just don't need in life but I need you
