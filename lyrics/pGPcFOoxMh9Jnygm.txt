Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over...

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See the sea wants to take me,
the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me
Sad veiled bride please be happy
handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly
though she needs you
More than she loves you
and I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over...

I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said

If you're so funny,
why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very entertaining
why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so very good looking
why do you sleep alone tonight?

I know
'cos tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
while they're in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over and over...

It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
over and over...

Love is natural and real
but not for you my love
not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
but not for such as you and I my love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh yes, oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
