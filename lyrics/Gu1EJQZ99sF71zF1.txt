I'm sinking, I'm sinking
I don't know what the hell I was thinking
My past mistakes are draped in my shame
I never thought I'd be in my twenties
Hoping desperately to amount to something
Marking down the days
Will these things ever change?
Or will they stay the same?

So here I am
With my heart in my hands
Searching for the chance
To be something more
I fear that it's gone
And I've tried my best to hold on
But I'm slipping now
With no one to catch me

My heart beats in time
With the sound, with the sound
A ticking clock constantly counting down
I never dreamed I'd be in my twenties
A hole in my chest that left me with nothing
Old memories up in flames
Only myself to blame

Can you remember the day?
When we told ourselves
That we would never be like them
Another spoke on a wheel of bullshit
I promised you
That there was way more to life than this
I swear I tried so hard
Can't believe it's all falling apart
I fought to get this far
Only to fail, only to fail

So here I am
With my heart in my hands
Searching for the chance
To be something more
I fear that it's gone
And I've tried my best to hold on
But I'm slipping now
With no one to catch me

I've tried so hard
To feel just like I used to
I'd rather feel this pain
Than nothing at all
I've fought so hard
To try and break the cycle
A failure I'm forced to meet
Each and every day
