I never thought
I'll get to meet someone like you
are you real
are you sure
cause in your eyes
there's nothing left for me to do
I was lame
I was such a fool
she doesn't get your style
can barely make you smile
I'm tempted to take over
tell me that it's over
she can't predict your feelings
there isn't any meaning
I'm tempted to take over
tell me you don't love her
she doesn't match your style
can barely make you smile
I'm tempted to take over
tell me that it's over
she can't predict your feelings
there isn't any meaning
I'm tempted to take over
tell me you don't love her
you don't
you don't
you don't
I never thought
i'll get to meet someone like you
are you real
are you sure
It's in your eyes
there is nothing left
for me to do
I was hanging
I was such a fool
It was too strong
I can't keep holding on
but there's no other choice
you're breaking my voice
you're breaking my voice
you're breaking my voice
you're breaking my voice
and if we never are
we never get to talk
I try and be your friend
you're leaving me to fence
you're leaving me to fence
you're leaving me to fence
to fence for myself
she doesn't get your style
can barely make you smile
I'm tempted to take over
tell me that it's over
she can't predict your feelings
there isn't any meaning
i'm tempted to take over
tell me you don't love her
you don't
you don't
you don't
tell me you don't love her
you don't
you don't
you don't
tell me you don't love her
you don't
tell me you don't love her
you don't
just tell me you don't love her
you don't
just tell me you don't love her
you don't
she doesn'y get your style
can barely make you smile
I'm tempted to take over
tell me that it's over
she can't predict your feelings
there isn't any meaning
i'm tempted to take over
tell me you don't love her
she doesn't match your style
can barely make you smile
I'm tempted to take over
tell me that it's over
she can't predict your feelings
there isn't any meaning
i'm tempted to take over
tell me you don't love her
