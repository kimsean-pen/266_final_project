There are times when I can't think about the future
When all my days are dark and life seems cruel
I'll take another shot and think about you
Cos a bottle of wine is all I have to hold

But I think it's all I've got
You've taken all I got
And I'm sorry to hold your hand
But I miss you and your life

There's a full moon in the sky
It makes me glad
That there's something pure
In something that I had
Something good is all I need to feel alive
A bottle of wine is all I have to hold

And I think it's all I got
You've taken all I got
And I'm sorry to hold your hand
But I miss you and your life
