Here I am just make it stop
I can tell the whole world
to get out of the way
if I could just make it stop.
If I could just make it stop,
breaking my heart,
get out of the way,
if I could just make it stop.

You see them close to the edge,
I'm at the end of my road
the road is starting the threat,
I'm trying to keep my hold.

You say I'm nothing I'm not
but I'm not what I seem,
get my back off the wall
If I could just make it stop

Chorus:
If I could just make it stop
I can tell the whole world
to get out of the way
if I could just make it stop.
If I could just make it stop,
breaking my heart,
get out of the way,
if I could just make it stop.
If I could just make it stop.

Now I'm looking up from a tempt from a whole
see nothing but blue sky, shining on my soul,
as I enter the court and I'm .not
we could get where I'd go in,
if I could just make it stop.

If I could just make it stop
I can tell the whole world
to get out of the way
if I could just make it stop.
If I could just make it stop.
