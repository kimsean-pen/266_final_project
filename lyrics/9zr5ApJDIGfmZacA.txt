I'll string along

I'll string along

oo whaoo whaoo
whaoo

Come morning

my beads on
a face

A thread
A thong

oo whaoo whaoo
whaoo

We can save it
We can change it

Put it in lines
across the room

But we'll never

stop it
bristling

And I gotta
quit

With a ribbonless
hair

With a wire of
snare

oo whaoo whaoo
whaoo

With all the
trembling vein

that you can bare

oo whaoo whaoo
whaoo

We can save it
We can change it

Put it in lines
across the room

But we'll never
stop it
pimpling

And I gotta
quit

Scrape
a little pattern

to a sty

I kiss holes
for the bullets

in case
of thigh

in case
of thigh

I kiss holes
for the bullets

And I gotta
quit
And I gotta
quit
