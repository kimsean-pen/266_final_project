Spread the word,
write the word to recreate.
Recreate the world.
In authentic voice,
no uncertain terms could face your...
curiosity and compassion,
your heavy crown of virtues.

They poured their malice down your,
down your back...
and then they, dropped the match.

Arbitrary in our pity,
selective in our shame.
Recognizing our lives as pinpricks
conclude exemption from blame.

But you... you fell into your life,
unrehearsed and undisguised.
