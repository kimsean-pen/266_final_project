Got me caught picking up for a lower bag
Praying for your latches, I'm a gentleman
Darling, shackles on my neck 'til I feel like a man
Rushing to the hope before you make it back
I wanna feel your hair
All over my body
All I need is one

Say my love ain't enough
It won't make your heart stay
Well, love ain't enough
It won't keep your heart awake
Love, love, love
Singing love ain't enough, no, no, no yeah

I trumble to my pain, and no body back
Our love, don't say it before I relapse, honey
Lead me to drowning, I could live with that
Your baeauty must have led me to the booby trap
I wanna feel your hair
All over my body
All I need is one

Say my love ain't enough
It won't make your heart stay
Well, love ain't enough
It won't keep your heart awake
So, love, love, love

Say my love ain't enough
It won't make your heart stay
Well, love ain't enough
It won't keep your heart awake
Say my love ain't enough
It won't make your heart stay
Well, love ain't enough
It won't keep your heart awake
Say my love ain't enough
Say my love ain't enough
