Define me as a failure
Only the shadow of a man
I will suffer the judgement passed by those
Who simply do not understand
Who I am, the way I think
The pain that sets in underneath
And when I try to be myself it seems like
The insecurity gets the worst of me
Gets the worst of me

The distance, it makes me sick
But there's a new way that I'm coping with conviction
And I don't expect you to understand it
I can't leave these words unsaid
Cause it's a product of the battle that's in my head
And I can't pretend that it never haunts me

The world will never be enough for me
I'll tell you from the top, it's only skin deep
I don't know what I believe
But it's not the way it's supposed to be
Over these past few years I admit that things have changed
Dreams became reality but the pleasure became pain
I've loved, I've lost, you wouldn't know what it cost
After every sacrifice that I have made
I'll take this to the grave

You can be who you want to be
But your nightmares live in the same dream
Go be who you want to be

The distance, it makes me sick
But there's a new way that I'm coping with conviction
And I don't expect you to understand it
I can't leave these words unsaid
Cause it's a product of the battle that's in my head
And I can't pretend that it never haunts me

I don't expect you to understand it
And I can't pretend that it never haunts me
