Romeo
He walks the city at night
The tall dark building's cast a ghostly shadow in his burning eye's

Oh Romeo
Roam Romeo
Romeo roam
Roam romeo
Yeah

Romeo
Cruises the street's at night
Under his feet lay the remain's of all the cruiser's
Before him
When out of the alley comes these green lazer eyes
Saying come closer...
(whisper)come closer
Juliette!
He's still alone

Oh romeo
Roam romeo
Romeo roam
Yeah

Romeo
Around the corner's there is nothing there
Juliette! wooh!

Cause there is no juliette
