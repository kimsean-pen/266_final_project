With vengeance I must striketh down
Thy enemies of our kingdom
Fled and sheltered by the flock of angels downtrodden
Cast out by the sacred
Bound and shackled till extinction
Now withered away into darkness
Erased from the annals of history
Have you no mercy

In the stillness of black
I shall destroy the world
Of purpose and desire from spite
I have spoken, I have arisen

Salvation lies ahead
Or shall we wither away into darkness
Devastating in thy authoritative approach
I shall activate an emerging threat of doom
Culminating into a storm of beckoning cries
Disintegration of all that once was
We must dismantle this society of lies
Society of lies

Following ones path into the light
Punished from the wrongs of our kind
Annihilation of this sacred land
The task that now must be complete

Detestable, deplorable, yet fleeting in all its glory
There shall not be any noble deaths
For the world as we know it is now absolved
Iniquitous, malevolent, born evil from thy inception
Conjuring this catastrophic drought
Seizing earth's precipitating fall

You shall become descendants of my own image
I shall reign over the wonder of awe
I shall impose scarcity over man
As your penance is the downfall of all
