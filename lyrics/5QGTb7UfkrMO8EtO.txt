There will never come a day
You will ever hear me say
That I want or need to be without you
I wanna give my all
Baby just hold me
Simply control me
Because your arms
They keep away the lonlies
When I look in to your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
Cause I never felt this way about lovin'
Nooo
Never felt so good

Really
Never felt this way about love and it feels so good
