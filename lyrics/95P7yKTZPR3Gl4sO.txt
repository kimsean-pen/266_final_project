Under gas light, the joining of hands
Chanting a name over and over
The table tilts, the circle is broken
Doubting no more
They pay what they owe her

Disembodied, a luminous hand
Holding the air, passing the current
A voice is channeled, a rope is uncoiled
Flicker the light
And someone is here

We go following sorrow to free your
Blood spilling out of the reeds there
Give me a sign I can breathe air
Blood flowing out of the stream there

(Give me something new please, something I can love)
