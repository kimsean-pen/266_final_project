And you're finally out
As you draw your first
And the air was cold but
you will never know

And I tried to find
the heart to hold
But my arm was tired
Had to let you go

But i hope I made you well
I hope I made you well

So I wish you well
As you're on your own
And I hope you find
wherever is your home
