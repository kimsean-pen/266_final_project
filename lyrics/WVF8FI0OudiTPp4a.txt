Bad luck never leaves
Your jinx just floats around
Like the taste inside your mouth
Or the sound when your skull cracks
Feel the growing pains
It means you're growing up too fast
Telling white lies to black cats
Stretch me out across the tracks

While you were sleeping I was blood red
Sharp as a knife inside your stomach
I'm squeezing tight, don't let the light in
No medicine

Daydream tendencies had you smiling soft and sweet
Keep those blurry memories somewhere safe
You may need them
You can make a wish
But there's no rabbit out the hat
Realize it's never coming back
Realize it's never coming back

While you were sleeping I was blood red
Sharp as a knife inside your stomach
I'm squeezing tight, don't let the light in
No medicine

Don't let the light in
No medicine
