Da da da du dup
Thank you
If you have some time on your hands
I'd be happy to make some plans, you know

Someone like you

Baby, you could be my Jane B
And I could be your Serge Gainsbourg
Well, I don't know what you heard
But lately, I've been thinking you should date me
But I can't seem to find the words

And I've been out here so long
And I don't know what's right or wrong
And I know that this feels right to me, oh we
And I can't make no guarantee
But, If you spend some time with me
Well maybe we'll find this destiny

Ohh, I just want someone to share this view
All the amazing different places I've been to
All the good times and the bad times I've been through
Baby it could be you

Honey, I got a little money
My pocket's got a hole burned through
And I don't know what to do
Fashionably tardy
The life of every party
I'd rather be at home with you
It's true

And I've been out here so long
And I don't know what's right or wrong
But, I know that this feels right to me, oh we
And I can't make no guarantee
But, If you spend some time with me
Well maybe we'll find this destiny

Ohh, I just want someone to share this view
All the amazing different places I've been to
All the good times and the bad times we'll go through
Baby it could be you
It should be you

Honey, should be you

Hey, what do you say
This could be every day
Why don't you come my way

Come my way
