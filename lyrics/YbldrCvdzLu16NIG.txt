I'm waking up, up on the floor, still looking perfect
I'm walking out, out through the door, into the circus
I jump the train, I never pay 'cause I'm a rock star
You go with me, there will not be drinking of tea ah

Ain't got a buck, I got the lock, that's how I run it
Down on the ground, I found a brand new crispy hundred
I took it straight down to the bar 'cause I'm a rock star
You go and pee, your drink is so safe with me

On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
Yeah yeah yeah

I'm waking up, up on the floor, still looking perfect
I'm walking out, out through the door, into the circus
I jump the train, I never pay 'cause I'm a rock star
You go with me, there will not be drinking of tea ah

I know you like, like what you see, well I can't help it
Sit next to me, buy me a treat, let's not be selfish
Hey now our friends don't wanna dance, just drink at your expense
So good to be, so so so good to be me

On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
Yeah yeah yeah

Everything that's free tastes better
Pour another drink, I'll have her
She didn't wear it very well, whatever
Hope I feel like this forever

On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
On a roll again
Rock n' roll again
Yeah yeah yeah
