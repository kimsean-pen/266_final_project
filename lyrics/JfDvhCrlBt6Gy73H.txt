No I won't
No I won't
No I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't
No I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't
No I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't
Anymore

No I won't
No I won't
No I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't
No I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't
No I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't
Anymore

You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh you don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor

No I won't
No I won't
No I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't
No I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't
No I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't
Anymore

You won't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since we've been on the floor
You won't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor

Do something dark with me
I can't live with these words
Grab me by the feet and throw me into the crowd

No I won't
No I won't
No I won't
I won't let you move that way
Cause I don't
No I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't
No I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't
Anymore

You won't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
You won't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
Oh you don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
