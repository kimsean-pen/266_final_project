This room sealed shut
I found peace within the dark
There's no world left for me
Stone cold is this beating heart
Troubled times we have fallen upon
Smother my body in gas
Light the match and I'm gone

And it is here I offer my body
To whoever chooses to hear my voice
Use me as a sacrifice
My body a vessel a mere tomb of flesh and bone
I leave this world in agony flames embrace me I am home

I've fallen to my knees my lungs they draw no air
All nerves are fired as they cease I find comfort in the solace
Here in my room the flames embrace me
I'm at peace with my doom

Her alone in my room
Numb and lucid I dance within the flames
Care free from the feeling I'm blind to the pain
My sorrows leave my body every nerve has screamed my name
The fire paints a glorious picture flesh forfeit to the flames

So tired go the loathing
So tired of the sadness
My mind seeing colors unseen have I succumb to the madness

So here I'm dancing in the flames
So blind and numb to all the pain
My body sways and twists here in the flames
So blind and numb to all the pain

Watch me burn
Eager to become one with the ether
Never to return

Let me burn
Eager to become one with the either
Never to return

Numb and lucid I dance within the flames
Care free from the feeling I'm blind to the pain
My sorrows leave my body every nerve has screamed my name
The fire paints a glorious picture flesh forfeit to the flames

I've fallen to my knees my lungs they draw no air
All nerves are fired as they cease I find comfort in the solace
Here in my room the flames embrace me
I'm at peace with my doom
Here alone in my room

My body a vessel a mere tomb of flesh and bone
I leave this world in agony flames embrace me I am home
