There you're closer
Don't be shy
Bid you with the other in mind
That just a shadow of life
...
Get out of my town

I don't wander on my own
I don't wander on my
I don't wander on my own
I don't wander on my own

So build your hopes up
Just to die
Smile until I see to a nightlight
You would not travel the course
You and I
Battling sides

I don't wander on my own
I don't wander on my
I don't wander on my own
I don't wander on my own

Do I know
Don't intervene
ooooooh
Why you know
Don't intervene
ooooooh
