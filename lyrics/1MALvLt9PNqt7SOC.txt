The deepest solace lies in understanding
This ancient unseen stream
A shudder before the beautiful

Awake, oceanborn
Behold this force
Bring the outside in
Explode the self to epiphany

The very core of life
The soaring high of truth and light

The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant Island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers

Tales from the seas
Cathedral of green

The very core of life
The soaring high of truth and light

The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant Island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers

The unknown
The grand show
The choir of the stars
Interstellar theatre play
The nebulae curtain falls
Imagination
Evolution
A species from the vale
Walks in wonder in search of the source of the tale

The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant Island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers

The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant Island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers

The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant Island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
