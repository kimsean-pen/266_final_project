I woke up awfully early
Something disturbed my sleep
Out through an open window came
This simple melody

I heard somebody whistlel
I had to stop and listen

Surrounded by the city noise
Machines and screaming cars
A tiny sound my attention caught
Out from a crowded bar

I heard somebody whistle
I had to stop and listen
I heard somebody whistle
I had to stop and listen

I tried to sit and compose
It happened just the other day
When through the open balcony door
I was transported away
