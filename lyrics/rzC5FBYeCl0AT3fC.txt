What is wrong with all my friends
I know that I am unlike them
Just another situation
Don't hold me back
I don't look up to them

They always act so dirty
They keep thereselves so clean
Why can't they find the answers to
The questions that are right in front of me

I'm so high, I'm never low
I hold the sky and I'm never letting go
Letting go

No one's ever listening
The lines I've crossed somewhere between
My head is spinning like a top
I don't know when this shit is going to stop

They always act so dirty
They keep themselves so clean
Why can't they find the answers to
The questions that are right in front of me

I'm so high, I'm never low
I hold the sky and I'm never letting go
You filled my cup, I'm good to go
So shake me up, I'm ready to roll
Roll
(Never letting) go
Go

What is wrong with all my friends
I know that I am unlike them
They hold me back, they'll never win
I'm telling you these people are not my friends

I'm so high, I'm never low
I hold the sky and I'm never letting go
You filled my cup, I'm good to go
So shake me up, I'm ready to roll
I'm never letting go (I'm so high)
I'm never letting go (I'm never low)
I'm never letting go (I hold the sky)
I'm never letting go
Go (never letting)
Go
Go
