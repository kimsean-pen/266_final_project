Pouring rain in Tucson, Arizona
Checked into the Congress Hotel
Met the band in a bar next to the lobby
Looking for another story I could tell
When I left town we were heading for the altar
And I told you I'd be back before too long
Cut my hair and I found me a new girlfriend
Thought a broken heart could write a perfect song
And it did and I was right so now you're gone
Your echo in the halls
I feel your shadow on this empty stage
I hear your music through the walls
I see your picture on the blank page
Your echo in the halls
Played this show
Left another message
Booked a ticket for tomorrow in Tempe
Three AM doing cartwheels down the hallway
I've been drinking since the day I set you free
But on this airport morning will you wait for me
Your echo in the halls
I feel your shadow on this empty stage
I hear your music through the walls
I see your picture on the blank page
Your echo in the halls
Halls
Halls
Your echo in the halls
I feel your shadow on this empty stage
I hear your music through the walls
I see your picture on the blank page
Your echo in the halls
I feel your shadow on this empty stage
I hear your music through the walls
I see your picture on the blank page
Your echo in the halls
