You give your love to anyone you find to put your hands on
What a typical man
You take away everything I am
I can't stand you
What a typical man

You take love
More than you give love
It's such a selfish game
Give love a bad name
You take love
More than you give love
It's such a selfish game
Give love a bad name

Your conditional love was all I had
Can't pretend anymore that you're a man
Your conditional love was all I had
But I can't, and I won't, let myself back down
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one

Can't wait till you, get all the Karma that you came for
Front row, take a seat
Let my hair down, my hair down
Watch you feel the pain
(Hey!)
That you put into me

You take love
More than you give love
It's such a selfish game
Give love a bad name
You take love
More than you give love
It's such a selfish game
Give love a bad name

Your conditional love was all I had
Can't pretend anymore that you're a man (I can't pretend no more!)
Your conditional love was all I had (That's all I had with you baby!)
But I can't, and I won't, let myself back down
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one
Feel bad for the next one
I'm on to the next one

Your conditional love was all I had (Your conditional)
Can't pretend anymore that you're a
man (Can't pretend, can't pretend!)
Your conditional love was all I had
(I said why you foolin' me, conditional)
But I can't, and I won't, let myself back down
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one
Good luck to the next one
