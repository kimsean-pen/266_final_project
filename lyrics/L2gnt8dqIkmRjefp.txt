Compulsion and numbness become
The only way that i can survive
This moment is the closest thing
I'll ever have to paradise

Color reflects as the night projects
A glitch in the frame for this life of excess
Tell me secrets of life and death
For i foresee my grave

Forget the past
Or be swarmed with regret
A pulse in the veins
As i wait for the end

Fighting fear i wait in agony
Seeping into the soil
Rust upon the coil
I am swarmed with self contempt

Never again, no never again

I don't want to face
The Void Alone
The warmth in me
Swallowed whole

The sequence of the frames
A young child alone
Speak to me
So gracefully

You saw me through the lights
And we had only time

Paradise awaits as i unfold
Bleeding days into the soil

Forgetting the child you always were
Becoming the man takes more than words
Hate the way my thoughts they sway
Home is but a place, a cage in a frame
