Wait i'm innocent
I can't afford to go back to MCDF
now they got chained up to a seat
forty more days and i'll be out again

Heading out to main county jail
back to j-mod and i'm on no bail
a little bird sang now i'm left to this
one bed, one sink, one cell

Please send me back to the farm
i can't sit here anymore in solitude
i got to work these idle hands
before i sink in claustrophobia

Wait this isn't fair
I have a faulty attorney that doesn't care
while i'm staring at the ceiling
he's fast asleep
have to write to the warden get an early release
