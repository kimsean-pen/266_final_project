Get up and shake it up
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
There at the water but at night your're on fire
Back against the wall

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Take it slow
Shoot it high

Hold onto what you've got
And strike while the arms help put up a fight
Those days are good and gone
Keep up keep on going strong
All through the night

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Take it slow
Shoot it high

Feels like the latest version
Now that the wind is turning soft and cool
Next up a new dimension
Find something fresh and someone just for you

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
Then next time
Take it slow
Shoot it high
