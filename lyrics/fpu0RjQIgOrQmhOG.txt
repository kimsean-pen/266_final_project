Tell me I'm desensitized
Tell me porn is poisonous
That it dulls my pure desire

You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so na誰ve
To expect my touch to mirror

Don't you borrow scenery
For your remnant city?
Inner greys and greeneries

You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so na誰ve
To expect my touch to mirror

You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so na誰ve
To expect my touch to mirror

You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so na誰ve
To expect my touch to mirror
