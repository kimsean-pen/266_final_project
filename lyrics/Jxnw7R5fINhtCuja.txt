So small in my greatness
I am the one who never wanted to be
so great in my smallness
I am the one who knows he is not

Around and inside, I am everywhere
ruling my mind, I am made of power
started down below, but now
going higher and higher and higher
from one to ten, 慶ause ten is one and
one thousand million hearts beating under my skin

I am the word which means every word
I am the truth hidden behind every lie

Started down below but now
going higher and higher and higher

I抦 the beginning, I抦 the end
I am the alpha, I am the omega
one thousand million hearts beating under my skin

I am the sword which leads every sword
I am the path which contains every path
I am immortal, I am glorious
I am supreme, I am my saviour
