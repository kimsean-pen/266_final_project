The butterflies come back to me
With peace of mind for broken wings
And these days are harder than the last, I know
But this is a song we all know, oh oh
We live and learn and let go, oh oh

So tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
When they stare right through me
Can they see my heart beat
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
Cause all I wanna be is anything

And I still remember every word
That I ever wrote about you, girl
They came like air to me
In my head I played out everything
Just tell me it's not time to let go

Tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
When they stare right through me
Can they see my heart beat
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
Cause all I wanna be is anything

And your friends, they talk a lot
I hear just how you're doing and it's sad
There's still a memory of us laughing
And it sits inside your head
You try to make believe you never were in love with me
I'll drink your eyes away
And try to hide the way my own stay red
And I wanna be whole, I wanna be anything
We live and learn and let go

Tell me
Tell me what your eyes see
When they stare right through me
Can they see my heart beat
Tell me why the rain can't wash away the blame
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
Cause all I wanna be is anything
(Tell me, Tell me what your eyes see)
(When they stare right through me)
Oh, you know that all I wanna be is anything
Can't take away the pain to make you see again
Cause all I wanna be is anything
