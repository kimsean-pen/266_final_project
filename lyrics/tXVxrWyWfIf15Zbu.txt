You take all you have and you leave it behind
In the hope there's more to find
In blind ambition, yeah, in blind faith
You wait for things to change

Hungry for something I can't say
And the colours fade to grey
Too close for comfort but too far to feel
Yeah, it spins the wheel

Walking forwards with no sight
Cos the rhythm leaves you blind
Walking forwards with no sight
Yeah, it's dark as night

Falling through
Falling through

Call out the fracture between two lives
There's one to leave behind
The dream isn't woken so let it forget
The song is different

Hungry for something that I can't say
And the colours fade to grey
Bruises and blisters, they follow the ride
Never turn desire

Walking forwards with no sight
Cos the rhythm leaves you blind
Walking forwards with no sight
Yeah, it's dark as night

Falling through
Falling through
Falling through

Falling through
Falling through
Falling through

Falling through
Colours all fade to grey
Falling through
Colours all fade to grey
