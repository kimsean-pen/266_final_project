"I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear I judge: and my judgement is just:
because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."
John 5: 30

Qui tollis peccata mundi

Agnus Dei, Son of man
See me not for your eyes are pain
Do not force me to stab you again
For I envy every wound on your corpse

Verily, verily I say unto thee
A million images won't be enough
For I know where you hide your soul

Agnus Dei

Crucifixus etiam pro nobis, sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est
Qui carne quondam contegi dignatus es pro perditis,
cujus latus perforatum unda fluxit sanguine

Agnus Dei, Prince of peace
Yet shall war be the echo of your love
Just like war shall be the echo of mine
and together shall we make the utmost balance

Verily, verily I say unto thee
In those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them

Agnus Dei
