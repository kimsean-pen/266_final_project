They see me search the darkest night
But trouble came for what I left behind
Hey, was it all all pretending

I never dare to take the fight
And now I'm stuck into this emptiness
(I never saw the fall)
And now is never ending

So what's the right direction?
I still need to know where from
'cause now my heart is on the run

Hurts
Does it matter where the pain is coming from?
When it still burns
And the fire here inside me wasn't enough
Will we still love?
Can't you see that there was only you and me?
Until we burn
Until we burn
So what's the lesson learned?

My restless soul is up tonight
Walking in the shadows of what was left of me
Is there another way here?

They say this world will not run dry
So where's the hope you feel the same as me
(Cause I never saw the fall)
And there was never ending

So what's the right direction
I still need to know where from
'cause now my heart is on the run

Hurts
Does it matter where the pain is coming from?
When it still burns
And the fire here inside me wasn't enough
Will we still love?
Can't you see that there was only you and me?
Until we burn
Until we burn
But what's the lesson learned?

Then if the time will come
And it will tell us to be free
Will you still believe in you? you and me?
'cause all I know
Is that our love will grow
And all that we need starts from

Hurt
Does it matter where the pain is coming from?
When it still burns
And the fire here inside me wasn't enough
And we still love?
Can't you see that there was never ending love?
And it's still here
And it's still here
But --- it's all alone
--- it's all alone
