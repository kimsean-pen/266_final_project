Life In A Day
The price that you pay
For time that you spent
It's such a fatal event
Take a look at your watch
There is no time to wait
Take a look deep inside
There's no escape from this day

Life In A Day
Life In A Day
Take a look around you
Is it true what they say
Life In A Day
Life In A Day
Is there no place to hide
Could there be some other way

Can you see how they run
Do you believe what they say
They'll soon be looking for you
For sure they'll get you away
The premonition came true
Look all around and you'll see
Some say it takes two to know
Or could it all just be me

Life In A Day
Life In A Day
I love to see how they run
They came a running this way
Life In A Day
Life In A Day
No sence in looking for you
They're going to get you one day
