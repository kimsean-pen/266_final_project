I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry

Am I losing faith in my own anger?
I forgot to punch my tab on my own
You dropped my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard
Wasting your last days, I can't feel you, you're too far

Talk to me in whispers with bad intention
So many of us lie, but you're not the worst
You dropped my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard
Sweet to the taste, I can't feel you, you're too far

I once was in love before I knew you
I've given up
I once was in love before you

Spell my name with sand and suck up the salt air
Don't divvy all the world, a vision of hope
You dropped my sin, bounce like glass against the flame
Where future struck just fell in ruins 'round your name

I once was in love before I knew you
I've given up
I once was in love before you

I once was in love before I knew you
I've given up
I once was in love before you

I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry

I once was in love before I knew you
I've given up
I once was in love before you

I once was in love before I knew you
I've given up
I once was in love before you

I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry
I'll make you sorry
