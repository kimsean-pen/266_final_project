Trouble for a friend of mine.
It's not fair they make you go to school.
Let's rip up the list tonight
Of all the things you're scared to tell your father.

I'm gonna hang around long enough to be part of the furniture.
Oh boy, you look so suave when you unzip your harrington.
I guess what you're like at home.

Spend the cheque that you picked up today.
Neon-lit when i saw your face.
The post came, i thought 'a letter. great'
It's all about how you never go on holiday

I'm gonna hang around long enough to be part of the furniture.
Oh boy, you look so suave when you unzip your harrington.
I guess what you're like at home.
