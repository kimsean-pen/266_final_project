Seems like heard this song a thousand times before
He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall, keep it all to herself

Always never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains, sad remains
Another victim of

Overlove
Overlove

He was just the devil in a thing disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page, close the cage
On another victim of

Overlove
Overlove, yeah
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove

Mamma never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone, and come the dawn
You got another victim of

Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove, love, love, love, love
Overlove
