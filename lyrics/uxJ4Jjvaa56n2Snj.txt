Emotion - Buring wooden icons
Menial man - In the candleshadow
Notorious King - Unblessed & Isolated
Open his wings

Lord himself
Enter to abyss
Non Serviam
Subterranean Ambitions

The undersinged
Never submit
Like flame he escaped
Underestimate the mankind

Unleashed he rule
Shifty bites the heel
Make red-hot under earth
With the face of angel

In flirt with sin
His voice in eternity
Non Serviam
Immortals Sum

Anni non vexaverunt me
Mille suboles certat contra a tyrannidem
Nus fons ad erevum est
Numguam Recessi
Per te natus sum et tu per me
