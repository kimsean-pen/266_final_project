Tellin' you to shut your mouth
Truth tellin' will never help
Pick up your head and smile pretty, girl

'Cause there's a lot of water, and a lot of world
Push it under and gimme that twirl
Silence is the perfect sound
For the man that tried to
Hold you down

Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!

Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!

Tellin' you to close your eyes
Just keep your secrets in your thighs
One in three and one in five

Guess I'm lucky I'm still alive
'Cause people come, try to stain your life
Silence is the perfect noise
For the one they love to call
Poor boy

Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!

Poor boy
What you gonna do? These girls are coming for you!
Poor boy
What you gonna do? Us girls are coming for you!
