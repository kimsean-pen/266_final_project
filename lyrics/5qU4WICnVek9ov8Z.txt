Rosemary in my throat from the chicken last night
We ate it then we smoked
It was in the oven, it was roastin'
You always wanna fuck, but you never let me host it
I ran out of my patience
I might become a patient
I'm a race car without no lane
I'm a rain cloud without no rain

I'm useless, oh-oh-oh
I'm useless
But you can use it, oh
Go, baby, do it
I'm useless, oh-oh-oh
I'm useless
But you can use it, oh
Go, baby, do it

Lisa off the grapes
Like Condoleezza with the cape
Blowin' Hillary out the vape
Got a house full of snakes
Yeah, I sweep 'em with a rake
Ooh, I'm makin' every mistake
They tell me I'm on time, but I know I'm late
Oh, I'm useless
The [?] was made at midnight
And I could be airin' in the pinstripes
We gotta stop runnin' from our sense, right

It's useless, oh-oh-oh
To feel useless
So I'ma use it, oh
Yeah, I'ma do it
And it's useless, oh-oh-oh
To feel useless, oh
So I'ma use it, oh
Yeah, I'ma do it, oh-oh

Oh, but it's useless, oh-oh-oh
To feel useless, oh
I'ma use it, yeah
Oh, I'ma do it, oh-oh
Because it's useless, useless
To feel useless, babe
So I'ma use it
Yeah, I'ma do it, oh-oh
Oh
