Remember me
She whispered heaven's so far out of reach
And keep me close
Like a moment you're afraid to leave

So now
This is how it feels when you're all alone
This is how it feels when your heart starts racing
If you can ask what you'll never know
It's the way it feels, the way it feels

Something terrible
Hollow in ways you'll never know
If it's all in my head, all in my head
It's heavier now than it's ever been
So fake a memory
Keeping me quiet underneath
And if this is the end, if this is the end
Destroy everything and make it new again

You're letting your fears stand in your way
The hardest of demons that you'll ever face

How does it feel when you're all alone?
How does it feel when your heart starts racing?
You're out of time, you're out of faith
The hardest of demons that you'll ever face

Something terrible
Hollow in ways you'll never know
If it's all in my head, all in my head
It's heavier now than it's ever been
So fake a memory
Keeping me quiet underneath
And if this is the end, if this is the end
Destroy everything and make it new again

Pull out my eyes, show me my flaws
So I can see what I've become
Can we pretend I'm in a dream?
Can't take apart what's incomplete
So pull out my eyes, show me my flaws
So I can see what I've become
Can we pretend I'm in a dream?
Can't take apart what's incomplete
I'm underneath

I'm underneath

So remember me
(Heaven's so far out of reach)
(And keep me close)
(Like a moment you're afraid to leave)
