Lost in your own conviction
Being lead from outside eyes
Perceiving success as malevolent
At the expense of others
Defiance with hands out
Claiming the bribes as plunder
Images presented certainty
Driving thoughts that despise
Subservient, obedient
Wanting to preserve the cause
Tag along within the pack
Acceptable behavior stick to the mantra
Fan the flames of discontent
Open the window for opportunism
Civic disobedience, barbarism incurs, violence within the horde
Reguritating what you're told
In the momnet feels like wisdom

Declarations of simpatico
Cementing thoughts of divine purpose
Coinciding goals power of suggestions
Ushering the age of euphoria
Presuming the absence of interior conflict
Startled by antagonism
Easily rationalized
The mob is pulling the strings
Peers the moral compass, antipathy realized
Calls for action, tensions boiling, surrogate violence
Tragic revolt, prominent support
Favorable courage, bolstered exploit, elevated impact
Obstinate provocation initiating response
Willful ignorance wallowed in
Talking heads to permeate insight
No need to modify agenda
Marching orders on the way
