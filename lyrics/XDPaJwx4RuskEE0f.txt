There's a side of you I love
There's a side that I'm sick of
No one gets me high like you
No one breaks me down the way you do

we've played this game so many times, used the same old lies, said our last goodbye
Still I keep coming back for more, I just want you for one last time

You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
I'm addicted to
You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
That is how we ride
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round

I can't tell the wrong from right
and I don't know why when we fight
I'm too lost in you to see
That the thing we have is not meant to be

We are waiting for the weekend rush, when life doesn't suck, when there's a chance
we'll fu'

I realise this won't work no more, I just want you for one last time
You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
I'm addicted to
You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
That is how we ride
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round

on the merry-go-round
round and round
round and round
round and round
I hate that I love what I hate
and I can't escape
I can't find no cure
I hate that I love what I hate
I'm thinking that

I'm addicted to you
You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
I'm addicted to
You hate me when I break up
You save me when I fuck up
You love me when I'm back again
That is how we ride
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round
That is how we ride
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round
on the merry-go-round
