Well, I love the rain the most when it stops
We can see the big white houses, yeah, and the docks
And we can jump in the river, don't know if the water or sky is clearer
But I know that I love the rain the most when it stops
Yeah, when it stops

No more grey today, we gonna celebrate
You know Miss Sunshine, she starts to paint a perfect picture of this river parade
And I know that I love the rain the most when it stops
Yeah, when it stops

Well, the dark waves, they start singing together
I can't believe this change in the weather
I start to hum a child's rhyme
And all these boats, they start rocking in time
And I love the rain the most when it stops
Yes, we love the rain the most when it stops
Yeah when it stops

The summer is coming to an end
We ain't gonna let that slow us down one bit
Til that sunset will start to fade
They're gonna drag us screaming from these old riverbanks

We love the rain the most when it stops
We love the rain the most when it stops
Yeah, when it stops
Yeah, when it stops
Yeah, when it stops
When it stops, when it stops, when it stops...
Yeah, when it stops

I think you've had a little too much too drink
Let me help with that
Don't forget to tie the boat up
Not that way, no it's a figure eight, yeah
Yeah when it stops...
The rain, when it stops...
