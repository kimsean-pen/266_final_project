I have a mandolin, I play it all night long
It makes me want to kill myself
I also have a Dobro, made in some mountain range
Sounds like a mountain range in love
But when I turn up the tone on my electric guitar

I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me

I went out to the forest and caught
A 100, 000 fireflies
As they ricochet 'round my room
They remind me of your starry eyes
Someone else's might not have made me so sad
But this is the worst night I ever had

'Cause I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
Always close

You won't be happy with me
But give me one more chance
You won't be happy anyway
Why do we still live here
In this repulsive town?
All our friends are in New York

Why do we keep shrieking
When we mean soft things?
We should be whispering all the time
