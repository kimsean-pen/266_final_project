No map looking for the one I love
Cause the one I love is here

No map looking for the one who stands
Cause he's arming me from fear

We got tuned in by the other side
Lives spent digging holes for the ones that hide

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes

More cuts taken for the one in silence
Now he sits between my ears

His moves in madness how I love the rush
Could you wipe away these tears

We got taken by
A rush of blood

My trains leaving now
How I wish I could

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes

See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
I'm a stuntman
See the white of my eyes
