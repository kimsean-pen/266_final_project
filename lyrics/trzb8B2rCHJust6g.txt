Listen up everyone, there's something wrong
We got the answers in our sights now, but some how still we struggle along
Looking for solutions in a threatening sky
But we never get an answer
Just chorus of voices wondering why

We're stuck here without a peaceful day
It's a promise in the night, I'll be OK
The superlative is telling me that help is on the way
Won't someone tell me, how will I make it through the day?

Looking towards the future, and all I can see
Is the next generation looking back with pity on me
Hunting for some insight or a means to change
But do we have the will to, or will our future look the same?

We're stuck here without a peaceful day
It's a promise in the night, I'll be OK
The superlative is telling me that help is on the way
Won't someone tell me, how will I make it through the day?

How can I live when you won't let me in?
How can I die without the reasons why?
How can I laugh when I want to cry?
How can I go on with nothing nowhere?

Listen up everyone, there's something wrong
We got the answers in our sights now, but somehow still we struggle along
We're stuck here without a peaceful day
It's a promise in the night, I'll be OK
The superlative is telling me that help is on the way
Won't someone tell me, how will I make it through the day?

How will I make it?
How will I make it?
How will I make it?
Tell me, how will I make it?
