I used to
I used to talk to you all the time
Even though I was alone
It was easy when I just imagined you
Now I don't know what to say
There was always me
Holding onto you
We were always here
And I am lost without you
We could break apart
You could run away
But I'll come right back
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
I could hear you, I could see you, feel you
I could hear your voice
Then it slowly faded
I even imagine you talking back to me
With long conversations
The two of us
Now I don't know what to say
There was always me
Holding onto you
We were always here
And I am lost without you
We could break apart
You could run away
But I'll come right back
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
Everything stopped
Everything stopped
Only to begin again
Now I don't know what to say
There was always me
Holding onto you
We were always here
And I am lost without you
We could break apart
You could run away
But I'll come right back
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
'Cause you've got your wicked ways
Now I don't know what to say
