Let me take the ashes when you burn!
Bitch fuck yourself
I'm filled up with life while you're stuck under the ground
It was all in the moment
Hatred was the only thing around
So much that I can't say
I hope that you cry
Fuck your beautiful features
They will haunt me for life
Stop the rushing better watch the running you won't catch me bluffing
I got rules to melt something's coming if it's God
we love it better run for cover if it's something else!
I reflect life of the lxrd, yuh
I got the racks I'm not poor, yuh
Okay then let's even the score, yuh
Fucked your girl she's a whore, yuh
I just found my love, oh yuh
Put gas in my lungs, oh yuh
Don't mix them drugs, oh yuh
I way past that stuff, oh yuh
Turn back to your old ways once you see that this is dead
You know that this entire life is projecting straight out your head
Stars are in the sky and you're worried 'bout the shit they rent
You live inside a hologram, your life is great and fucken blessed
