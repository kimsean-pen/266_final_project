Its started taking its toll on me now
It comes back to you
The lights around but the globes have blown out
It comes back for you
Remain fully clothed
Till you don't have to
A chrome set of teeth
With nothing to chew

I see you wasted
I know what to do
Give the good??
Then come back for you

I come back for you
When you asked me for some more, I was energized
I couldn't see your eyes, they were up inside
When you asked if I could see I was pulverized
Certain overdrive, test & recognize
