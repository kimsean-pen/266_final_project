Don't you know

A party to remember
The good times it always was a pleasure
Here's hoping they find the ones who did it
A party and everyone's invited

At the disco
Dancing slow
At the disco
Dancing slow
Now pray
I'm gray
I'm gray
I'm gray

At the disco
Dancing slow
Into my soul
He's gonna linger on
Now pray
I'm gray
I'm gray
I'm gray
