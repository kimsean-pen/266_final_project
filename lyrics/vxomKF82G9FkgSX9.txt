The wind is blowing cold
Have we lost our way tonight?
Have we lost our hope to sorrow?
Feels like we're all alone
Running further from what's right
And there no more heroes to follow

So what are we becoming
And where did we go wrong?

Yeah, oh yeah
I want to rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh, won't you rise today
And change this world?

The sun is beating down
Are we ever gonna change
Can we stop the blood from running?
Our time is running out
Hope we find a better way
Before we find we're left with nothing

For every life that's taken
So much love is wasted

Yeah, oh yeah
I want to rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
So won't you rise today
And change this world?

Only love can set it right
This world
If only peace would never die
It seems to me that
We've got each other wrong
Was the enemy just your brother all along?

Yeah, oh yeah
I want to rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh, won't you rise today
And change this world?
Yeah, oh yeah
I want to rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh, I want to rise today
And change this world
