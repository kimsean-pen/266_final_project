You were only 17 looking at your window screen sweetest girl iv'e
ever seen straight up from a project dream,
you were on the second floor, I was right across from yours.
Two different sides of war, kinda like a west side story, now

Leyla, i am in love with ya Leyla
Im giving up any day now, so bust that window and come with me
Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out,
baby i know what to say now, but i want you any way

But i want you anyway
But i want you anyway

Now we've turned 23
You moved across town from me
Our friends and family wouldn't let us be happy
I hear your married now, hear it ain't working out
But they can't shut us down
Leyla just tell me how and ill be there
You are a goddess i want you to know (oh, oh, oh)
Ill never forget you, ill never let go, ill be coming to get ya

Leyla, im in love with ya Leyla
Im giving up any day now, so bust that window and come with me
Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out,
baby i know what to say now, but i want you any way

But i want you anyway
But i want you anyway

You are a goddess i want you to know (oh, oh, oh)
Ill never forget you, ill never let go, ill be coming to get ya

Leyla, i am in love with ya Leyla
Im giving up any day now, so bust that window and come with me
Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out,
baby i know what to say now, but i want you any way

But i want you anyway
But i want you anyway

Leyla, i am in love with ya Leyla
Im giving up any day now, so bust that window and come with me
Leyla, get all your stuff and we'll break out,
baby i know what to say now, but i want you any way
