Your love is like a drug
I'm so addicted, you got me fucked up and it feels so good
Your love is like a drug
I'm so addicted, you got me fucked up and it feels so good

You got me fucked up, feels like I'm losing my mind
Can't focus, can't do shit
And everything's covered in slime
I'm out of control, what the fuck
Feels like I'm going insane
What the hell have you done to me
Can't get you out of my brain
I want you, no I always and forever
Fuck the world, fuck everyone
Yo I don't care, whatever
I can feel my heart pounding like a motherfucking cartoon
Don't know what the hell's going on
All I know is I want you
Yo! Shut up and kiss me with tongue
