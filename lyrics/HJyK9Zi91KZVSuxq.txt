Hay una discoteca por aqui?

I don't speak the language
I can't understand a word
Where angels fear to tread
I've sometimes walked
and tried to talk
but how can I be heard
in such a world
when I am lost?
I'm doing what I do
to see me through
I'm going out
and carrying on as normal

Hay una discoteca por aqui?

Te quiero
Entiende usted?
Digame
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar?

I don't speak in anger
though the chances that I've let
pass me by and now regret
I can't forget
They're haunting me
like a score of unpaid debts
Is it enough/ to live in hope
that one day we'll be free
without this fear?
I'm going out
and carrying on as normal
