D for effort
D for intent
D because you pay the rent

D for love
D for insight
D because you're heaven sent

I want you to need me - not to feed me
I want you to need me - not to feed me

D for dishes
F for floors
Can't make the grade anymore

D for love
D for intent
D because you pay the rent

You kick my head
Lying on your ten - your ten foot bed
You say you're all alone,
that's just cause, you don't want anybody home
See a smile, make it sad
Take it all so bad
