Cruising on the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at the those cars we are passing
as we're sucking down that funny, funny weed.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight Clan
Throw your dukes up, Wham!
We are splashing in the water to the beat.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Clumbsy, Sandy dunes
Hot day, mid-June
Naked kids, running wild, and free.
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
You can be home, with Oprah Winfrey.
Water feels nice, dive deep under
Ships, and treasures and greed
Just one of those days, a blue, perfect wave
Come out, and join. You'll see.
We are lying in the sun, when we're done finding a towel
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat.
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams.
Cruising on the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at the those cars we are passing
as we're sucking down that funny, funny weed.
Oh Yeah
Oh Yeah
Oh Yeah
Oh Yeah
