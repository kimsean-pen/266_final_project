Stick it to the man
Or wave those flags
Wave those flags

TA TA TA TA!

Stick it to the man
My little island, little lambs
FOOL FOOL!
Fall Behind
In the herd lose your chance
Lose your nerve
You're just a cattle fly
SHOO! SHOO!

So many distracted minds
At the scene of the crime
With all these cattleflies

BZZZ!

Go ahead jump the line
No that's just fine
That's just fine
CHAR-CHAR-CHARMING!

No go ahead jump the line
I've got time to wait
I'm not gonna whine
