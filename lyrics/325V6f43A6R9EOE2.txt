I, I am confused, fighting myself,
Wanting to give in needing your help.
Skin cold with fear feel it when we touch,
Outside don't know you but inside I'm fucked.
Can you see it in me, skin cold from touch,
Each day confronted with what I have done.
You pull me closer, I push you away,
You tell me it's okay, I can't help but feel the pain.

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I loved you!
Why do I feel so helpless?
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you.
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?

Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Fuck you bitch!

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I loved you!
I feel so helpless.
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you.
Why do I try?
Why do I fucking need to?
