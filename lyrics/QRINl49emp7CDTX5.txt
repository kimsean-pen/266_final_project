This is the hardest part
When you feel like you're fading
All that you have has become unreal
Collapsing, and aching

All I want, all I want is right here
But love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
Love don't live here anymore
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

I know that you think of me when you're
Beside her, inside her
It must be so hard for you to
Deny it and hide it

Oh, all I want
All I want is right here, but love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
And love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

Love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore

But love don't live here anymore
(Love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
Anymore

(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
And love don't live her anymore

(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
And love don't live here anymore
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)
Love don't live here anymore
(love is dead, love is gone, love don't live here anymore)

And love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore, love don't live here anymore, love don't live here anymore
