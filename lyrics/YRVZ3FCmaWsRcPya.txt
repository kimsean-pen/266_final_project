Close your eyes
Precious One
And you will see
Your life has only just begun
Nervermore
Be afraid
I embrace you
And I'll take you
All the way through endless time
To your new life
I await
The Divine
Lost in time
But I'm holding on
See her face (Light all around me)
Filled with grace (Darkness fades away)
Her embrace (I'm at her mercy)
Brings me home (As she takes me from this life)
As I wait to pass through darkned glass
I cannot help but wonder
When I stand before you at Death's door
Will I be afraid to enter?
Now I walk through to the other side
Former life a memory
Everything inside is amplified
As she's whispering to me
Close your eyes
Precious One
And you will see
Your life has only just begun
Nevermore
Be afraid
I embrace you
And I'll take you
All the way through endless time
To your new life
I face
The Divine
End of time
And I'm letting go
Take her key (Light all around me)
Made for me (Darkness fades away)
I willingly (I'm at her mercy)
Open the door (As she takes me from this life)
I begin to pass through darkned glass
I cannot help but wonder
As I stand before open Death's door
Should I be afraid to enter?
Now I walk through to the other side
Former life a memory
Everything inside is amplified
As she's whispering to me
Close your eyes
Precious One
And you will see
Your life has only just begun
Nevermore
Be afraid
I embrace you
And I'll take you
All the way through endless time
To your new life
To your new life
Endless time
To your new life
I embrace you
And I'll take you
All the way through endless time
To your new life
To your new life
Close your eyes
