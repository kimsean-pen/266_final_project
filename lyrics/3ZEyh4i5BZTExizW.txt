When I wake up in the evening
Something's gotta cross my mind
Like a body in a casket it
I will ask it
To die
As you search my eyes for answers
I'm as open as a book
There is nothing I won't tell you
All you have to do is look
Baby don'chu worry
I ain't in no hurry
While you were up to something
I was up to nothing
And now it's in the open
And you think we're through
Baby don'chu worry
I'm in love with you
But you know it's not the first time since the last time we went
Take me back to where you came from
I'm so lonesome with regret
Baby don'chu worry
I ain't in no hurry
While you were up to something
I was up to nothing
And now it's in the open
Time to tell the truth
I'm easily distracted
But I only ask for you
La di da di da di da da
La di da da
Da da
La di da di da di da da
La di da da
La la
Oh oh
I've seen a million others but they were never my type
I wanted to be clear cuz you got me alright
I'm telling you
Baby don'chu worry
I'm in love with you
