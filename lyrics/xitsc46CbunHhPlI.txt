Ooh ooh ah
All along the shore
Where the waving waters keep the score
Suddenly you arrive
A distant star in two lovers' eyes
But you had no choice
Appearing in this place
Before you had a voice
You were born to run the race
Ooh ooh ah
You're different every day, and you grow in every way
But your thoughts, your friends, your face
Just visitors who leave without a trace
So if the highs of youth have got you crashing down to earth
It's time to face the truth
Of your pain, your love, your hurt
The world is turning, I can feel it turn away
I come towards you but you seem so far away
The world is turning, it will always be that way
I run towards you but you seem so far away
You seem so far away x2
You may be hypnotised
Or perhaps you've realised
That to be famous and thin
Is the greatest goal of the age we're living in
Way up on high, there's an order to the stars
It's up to you and I to change what's on our path
The world is turning, I can feel it turn away
I come towards you but you seem so far away
The sun is burning, it will always be that way
We may not have tomorrow but we'll never fade away
Never fade away
We'll never fade away
