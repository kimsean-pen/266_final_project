Hand me the telephone I need to make a call,
to the prophet dogs they're always saying
it's in my interest to keep on paying back all your tiny debts
what other way is there?

it's hard to keep my back unstabbed,
i will tell you one thing before you jab,
it's priceless really,
come with your mirror knife
i'll be here waiting ripe with a love bite

I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world
I will be, I will be the world

Hand me the telephone I need to make a call,
to the prophet dogs they're always saying
it's in my interest to keep on paying back all your tiny debts
what other way is there?
