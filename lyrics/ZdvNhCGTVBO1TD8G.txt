All or nothing, I want it all
I can feel it in my body when the pressure's on
From dusk 'til dawn, we need to take it by storm
I know we're ready, ready to take it all

We could take it all
I know we're ready, ready to take it all

'Cause I know that we should take it all
And reach something incredible
I know that we can take it all
Ready to take it all

All or nothing, I want it all
I can feel it in my body when the pressure's on
From dusk 'til dawn, we need to take it by storm
I know we're ready, ready to take it all

'Cause I know that we should take it all
And reach something incredible
I know that we can take it all
Yeah, we can take it all

'Cause I know that we should take it all
And reach something incredible
I know that we can take it all
I know we're ready, ready to take it all

'Cause I know that we should take it all
And reach something incredible
I know that we can take it all
I know we're ready, ready to take it all

All or nothing, I want it all
I can feel it in my body when the pressure's on
Ready to take it all

'Cause I know that we should take it all
And reach something incredible
I know that we can take it all
I know we're ready, ready to take it all
