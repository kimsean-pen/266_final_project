Mama found her draped over the toilet bowl

Oooh

Mama said, " child, what you done? "
Mama said, " child, what you done? "
" wake up and greet the midday sun"

Mama's little pills spilled all over the floor

Oooh
Oooh, ow, ow, ow

Mama can't handle her on her own
Mama can't handle her on her own
She says, " you just wait till your father gets home"
