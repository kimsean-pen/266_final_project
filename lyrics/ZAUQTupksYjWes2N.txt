Oh, oh
Lose my breath when you look my way (say oh oh)
Baby, I never knew I could feel this way (say oh oh)
On the kitchen floor and the candlelight (say oh oh)
You could play me down cause you gave me hype

Ay, than you got me trippin' on ya
Lose in my brain
You got me sippin' on ya
I can't complain you fuck me up
You knocked me off my feet with your love
With your love
I'm feelin' drunk
Cause you knocked my feet with your love
With your love
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)

Move my bed sittin' on cloud 9 (say oh oh)
Why we don't go down and we do all night (say oh oh)
Baby show me yours I could show you mines (say oh oh)
Oh, and I make dam sure that you feel alright (say oh oh)

Ay, than you got me trippin' on ya
Lose in my brain
You got me sippin' on ya
I can't complain you fuck me up
You knocked me off my feet with your love
With your love
I'm feelin' drunk
Cause you knocked my feet with your love
With your love
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
With your love (Oh, oh)
