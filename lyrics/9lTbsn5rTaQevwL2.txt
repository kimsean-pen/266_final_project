oh no, not this time too
i'm the only one you got to use
and if I tell you all this could be
nothing more than a way to leave you
would you want me?

and now you're sorry
for the things you did to me
i want you to know
i feel i was the one who got used
and used to just about anything you would tell me
but those days are more than over now

dont you say you want me to stay
now you've got to get away,
you've got to get away,
go find someone who wants you
someone to pray to
get on your knees to
lay down and please you too
it just won't be me ever again

hopeless that this will turn out better
this isnt what i wanted
i should've listened to them
go thank yourself for nothing
it's really all youre good for
and every year you wasted
and every half-assed offer
