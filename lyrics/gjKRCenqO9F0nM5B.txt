I've waited, oh, so long
For you to come to me
What did I do wrong
It's all a mystery to me

Baby, I feel it too
What am I supposed to do
Maybe I've just changed
Or can I be wrong for you

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
Am I your plaything

You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
With my heart, my love

Do you mean to say
That after all this time
I've waited like a fool
Now who's been changin' you

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I ain't your plaything

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm masquerading
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I ain't your plaything, whoa

You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
Come on, child
Take me by the hand

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything, no, no, no
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
Hang on, hang on, yeah

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
I'm not your plaything
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You never told me

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating (I'm not your plaything)

You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
