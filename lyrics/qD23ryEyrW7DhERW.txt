In the beginning there was silence
and darkness, all across the earth.
Then came the wind, and a hole in the sky.
Thunder and lightning keep crushing down
hit the earth and split the ground
fire burning high in the sky.

From down below, fire melted the stone
the ground shook, and started to pound.

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that it was good.
They said to play it louder than hell
we promised that we would.
When loosers say its over with
you know that its a lie.
The gods made heavy metal
and its never gonna die.
We are the true believers

its our turn to show the world
in the fire of heavy metal
we were burnt.
It's more than our religion
it's the only way to live
but the enemies of metal
we can't forgive.
Cause'

We believe in the power and the might
and the gods who made metal, are with us tonight.
The gods made heavy metal
