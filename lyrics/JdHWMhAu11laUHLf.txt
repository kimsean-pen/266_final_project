I'm a keeper of secrets, pray to tell
I'll be your disciple, show yourself
Living a fever dream, lost control
You be my diviner, show me where to go

My ghost had left my skin
Diviner, bring it in
Our house of mirrors always shimmering
Diviner, where you been
You've been gone
A long time

I'm a keeper of secrets, pray to tell
I'll be your disciple, show yourself
Living a fever dream, lost control
You be my diviner, show me where to go

Oh, oooh, mh-hm, diviner
Oh, oooh, mh-hm

My ghost had left my skin
Diviner, bring it in
Our house of mirrors always shimmering
Diviner, where you been
You've been gone
A long time

Living a fever dream
Lost control
You be my diviner
Show me where to go
