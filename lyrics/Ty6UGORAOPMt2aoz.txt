These are the veins of the way that we love
These are the hearts of lonely people ripped in front of us.
Things aren't the way that we

Love as if you didn't know at all
Never once, never knew, painted glass with no love
(Wish I could answer you)
So uptight and desperate for attention
We're all lost and begging to be found
With every word you say, you lead everyone on

These are the veins of the way that we love
These are the hearts of lonely people ripped in front of us.

You've stopped before the sayer says a word

I need to take it out on you (really take it out, really give it all)
As hard as I can and let you, let you have it all
Do I make you?

Don't start, Don't start, shaking again
She can make the salt taste like sugar on her hands but
If love is a way out, then please let me in
don't start, darling
don't you turn my nightmares into dreams again.

Uptight and desperate for attention.
We're all lost and begging to be found.
With every word you say, you lead everyone on

These are the veins of the way that we love
These are the hearts of lonely people ripped in front of us.

We all did what we had to do
We all did what we had to do
We all did what we had to do
We all did what we, what we had to do
What we had to do

These are the veins of the way that we love
These are the hearts of lonely people ripped in front of us.
(we only did what we had to do)
