Don't worry
Everybody in the room notices you
Sit back and relax the night is early
You're 'bout to overdo it
So come and tell me something that you've already told me
'Cause everybody's already heard all of your stories
I'm hoping some of them are true

I've been losing lots of keys lately
I don't know what that means
But maybe I'd be better off with things that can't be locked at all
I've been feeling kind of sea sick lately
See you reaching to me gonna save me
You or me, I would much rather take the fall

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes the rain
Down comes our spirits again
But down comes the strength
To lift us up and then...

Been going upwind now
For too long
Forget how
To let go
Seems too hard
Too late now
To turn around

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes rain
Down goes our spirits again
But down comes the strength
To lift us up and then...
