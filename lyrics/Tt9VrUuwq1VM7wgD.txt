Come take the Sacrifice!

Hey, don't walk away
I'm not done with you, you're not done with me
Stop, we can't survive
Will you die for me, cause I'd die for you
I, I'm not insane, cut my heart with this razor blade!
Take, this sacrifice
You can't feed on me, can I feed on you?

Come take your sacrifice!
Come take your sacrifice!

You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, over and over again.
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, and nothing in between.

Hey, there's no escape
You can't run from me, I can't run from you
Bow, cause I'm your god
Will you pray to me, cause I'll pray for you
Push, your sins aside, nobody cares your heads fucked inside
Embrace your apathy
I dont care for you, you don't care for me
Embrace your apathy, embrace your apathy

You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, over and over again.
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, and nothing in between.

(Solo)

You don't want to hear the truth

You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, over and over again.
You don't bring me pleasure
You just bring me pain, and nothing in between.

No nothing in between

Come take your sacrifice!
