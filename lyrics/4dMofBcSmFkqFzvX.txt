Down by the water
Under the willow
Sits a lone ranger
Minding the willow

He and his wife
Once lived happily
Planted a seed
That grew through the reeds

Summers and Winters
Through snowy Decembers
Sat by the water
Close to the embers

Missing out the lives
That they once had before
I wouldn't leave you
I would hold you
When the last day comes

What if you need me
Won't you hold me
On the last day
Our last day

Mr and Mrs
Dreamed of a willow
Carving their names
Into their willow

If he had spoken
Love would return
Spoken inside
Too soft to be heard
Summers and Winters
Through snowy Decembers

Sat by the water
Remembering embers
Missing out the lives

That they once had before
I wouldn't leave you
I would hold you
When the last day comes
What if you need me
Won't you hold me
On the last day
Our last day

Somewhere the timing will all come together
The mishaps will turn into sunny Decembers
The lovers
Will be able
To find their willow
I wouldn't leave you
I would hold you
When the last day comes
I wouldn't leave you
I would hold you
When the last day comes
What if you need me
Won't you hold me
On the last day
Our last day
