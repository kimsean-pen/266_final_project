All along I felt a longing to find
the lighthouse but I found
a home through a lens
in the water
drawn from the well
I fell into

I know that I've been sleeping
and I know that I've been dreaming
But now the sun is streaming
and I swear that I've been here before

Not just the act of being
Caught somewhere in between
I just can't fight this feeling
I swear that I've been here before

Are they mine?
These memories reside inside my mind

Bleeding borders
Run with colors seen before my time

I know that I've been sleeping
and I know that I've been dreaming
But now the sun is streaming
and I swear that I've been here before

Not just the act of being
Caught somewhere in between
I just can't fight this feeling
I swear that I've been here before
