This morning I received air mail letter 3 from my connection overseas.
I pulled the paper back,
you begin your attack and it means:

Of all the places I laid down my head,
I think of two I regret
Love isn't easy my baby you're sayin' today

But tell Mr. shoemaker I'll be away
On a rocket or a comet or the dock of the bay
On a continental steam ship sailin' away
On a one way ticket on a 1st class airplane
I wanna know what you're thinkin' about
Don't just let me go

Four hundred days have passed since I've heard from you last
I'm getting worried, I admit
Maybe it's nothing much
There's nicer shores in sight
Oh I just don't know

Of all the places I laid down my head I think of two I regret
Love isn't easy my baby we'd tell you today
But tell Mr. shoemaker I'll be away
On a rocket or a comet or the dock of the bay
On a continental steam ship sailin' away
On a one way ticket on a 1st class airplane
I wanna know what you're thinkin' about
Don't just let me go

I'm sayin' so long
I want my baby back
I know it's hard to see
Why she's in love with me
I'm sayin' so long
I want my baby back
I know it's hard to see
Why she's in love with me
So long to the headstrong
I wasn't qualified to lead that city life
That's all I have to say
