Just like breaking in the middle of
Hanging out, sounds all so familiar
Used to meet a lot the superior
Little child hope for the real one
Then I got a feel Of the real love
And it comes with a backpack devotion
And You know it slipped off my shoulder
Gave all I had for nothing at all
I can finally
Think of time physically
I can finally
Think of love easily
Yea!
Was a time that met the superior
He just bent over ma shoulder
Used to pray hope for a miracle
Two thumbs up for making me cynical
Then I got the feel of the real love
And it comes with a backpack devotion
And You know it slipped off my shoulder
Gave all I had for nothing at all
I can finally
Think of time physically
I can finally
Think of love easily
yea!
I can finally
Think of time physically
I can finally
Think of love easily
yea!
Better be cruising on tonight
Ain't gonna be no slip n slide
Even I loose u mama gonna shake that blues tonight
Thinking about the alphabet
Trying to play myself up dead
You should do something
Just instead of, Fill those tears tonight
