I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't done
My spirit's sunken deep into the ground
Why am I alone?
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence's all around

See hat will rise
So don't come closer
Fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me and changed my cards
No one asked if I want it if I like it

Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side

I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn

Nothing else
But laughter is around me
Forevermore
No one can heal me
Nothing can save me
No one can heal me

I've gone beyond the truth
It's just another lie
Wash away the blood on my hands
My father's blood
In agony we're unified

I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fulfill my fate then I'll be free
God knows how long
I tried to change fate

Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side

I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn

I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn
