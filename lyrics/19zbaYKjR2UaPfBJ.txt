You were the tree
And I was the apple
That fell to the ground and turn brown

Hate was the wind
But love was the secret
That blew us to where we are now

And now love can grow without
Tiny little raindrops
Tiny little, tiny little, messy little raindrops

So cry on my shoulder
Cry on my shoulder
For love, love, for love, love

We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
For love, love

Floats like the sea
So distant and waving
Bringing you closer to me

Stay next to me
For love can't keep waiting
It's got no place left to be

And now love can grow without
Tiny little raindrops
Tiny little, tiny little, messy little raindrops

So cry on my shoulder
Cry on my shoulder
For love, love, for love, love

We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
For love, love

We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
We were told, we were told
We were larger than life
For love, love, for love, love, love, love

Love
Love
Love
