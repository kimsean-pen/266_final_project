Like a flower waiting to bloom
Like a light bulb in a dark room
I am here waitin' for you to come on home
And turn me on

Like the desert waitin' for rain
Like a school kid waitin' for spring
I am sittin' here waitin' for you to come on back home
And turn me on

My poor heart, it's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all you're the one that turned me off
Now you're the only one that can turn me back on, uh

My hi-fi's waitin' for a new tune
And my glass is waitin' for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sittin' here waitin' for you to come home
And turn me on
