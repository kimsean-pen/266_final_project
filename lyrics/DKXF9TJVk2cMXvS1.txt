I am the dying apparition
End of your display, too late for regret
Final moments in slow motion
Your foolish choice, trying to amuse
Choking down, blood, air, and mucus
Feel the cost of miscalculation
Boasting and bragging, all but past
Enduring the price, curiosity's last

Wanting to astonish so everyone can see
Attack unworthy foes, no not like me
Petrified pride, the sad fool's terror
Blind-sided and broken, soak in the ignorant failure

Living to intimidate, tormenting the ones you can
Rolling the dice is your fate, unlucky or doomed or dumb
Never wanted to gamble, thought the strength was assured
Then there's an immovable object, your power and unstoppable force

Bitten off more than you could chew
Trying to impress with your primacy
Can't match a level that intense
Shocked to see the outcome unfold
Pushing forward with weakness
Compared to a hardened past a joke
Ran into this ruthless motherfucker
Last time being wronged

Stalking the weak, making the rules
You just realized, I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Pushing my buttons, daring a response
Clear regret, the wrong one to fuck with
Pain creeping in, blurred mortal wound
Grasp of horror, the wrong one to fuck with
Can't change your mind, too late this time
Your life is spent, I was the wrong one to fuck with

Thinking the outcome can be in doubt
First and last mistake, beat the arrogance out of him

Don't fear the pain inflicted, warming up idle hands
Knowing the worst is later, solace for the moment
Wrapped in the shame of cowardice, no end is undeserved
Time for atonement's past, exposed, frail fool, that's you

Thinking the outcome can be in doubt
First and last mistake, beat the arrogance out of him

No coins for Charon, unable to cross over worlds
Dumped out in the river, found unworthy to pass now
Cannot hide from past shame, experience what you have earned
Take pride in suffering, paying homage to the dead
No ego present, instead accepting to believe
Fate of the damned, no doubt is your destiny
