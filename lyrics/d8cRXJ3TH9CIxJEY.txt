Your friends, they don't know me well at all
Shouldn't you say if you're in trouble?
They told me that you know when you know
If I couldn't wait, the month would double

I'm alone in my head, my alarm isn't set
Getting used to American time
Still awake if you call, don't feel normal at all
So I'm back smoking Camels instead

I've fallen in deep, who'd have known?
Always afraid of what will follow
I've done things that I'd like to forget
Guess I deserve to get what I get

I'm alone in my head, my alarm isn't set
Getting used to American time
Still awake if you call, don't feel normal at all
So I'm back smoking Camels instead
