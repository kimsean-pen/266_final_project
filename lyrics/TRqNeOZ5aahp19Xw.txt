The very thought
To make me come
Over to yours
It weighs upon my head
And I feel the charge
Pull me south
To your door
I chase the thought across my mind
I've got her on my side tonight
Bending back for you is fine
From distance grown
The very moan
That in the night
Becomes my home
Lie awake
See you rise
All these pieces
They come so quiet
The very thought
To make me come
Over to yours
It weighs upon my head
And I feel the charge
Pull me south
To your door
I chase the thought across my mind
I've got her on my side tonight
Bending back for you is fine
