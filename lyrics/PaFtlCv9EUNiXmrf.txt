Some elated revelation
Comes from long lost sleepy eyes
So you turn a new rotation
And live a silent dreamy sigh

And you rise awake
And you rise too late
When you borrow your expressions
All the glass begins to fog
Over under over under
Don't know where you belong
And you lay awake
Cause sleep's a waste

Young heart, look what you found now
Sold her to the sky now
She's high above you
Now, now
Why don't you come down
Come on, we can ride to a true beginning
Love lost, but look what you found now
Give her to the past
Cause you're such a young heart
You're such a young heart

Your thoughts glide like a dancer
And your finger wears a string
All the verses you remember
But the you can't sing
And you slip away
What a weight to weigh

Missing person in your presence
Innocent since the first day
Shine a light light up creation
Make the saints all go away
And you lie awake
Cause the truth's a waste

Young heart, look what you found now
Sold her to the sky now
She's high above you
Now, now
Why don't you come down
Come on, we can ride to a true beginning
Love lost, but look what you found now
Give her to the past
Cause you're such a young heart
You're such a young heart
You're such a young heart

Crawling to feel
What you need isn't all that matters now
From a walk to a wheel
You can turn to the brightest of them all
If you fall you can fly
You can think what you want about that now
All the crawls, all the wheels, rays of the sun
From the start you're the one
Young heart

You're such a young heart
You're such a young heart
You're such a young heart
You're such a young heart
Yeah you're such a young heart
