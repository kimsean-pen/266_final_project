It's taking us downtown
You're watching me watching me watching me go
But I never listen
No I never let you know

Now we're heading uptown
Is there something or nothing you wanted to say?
'Cause I need to go now
Do you want me to stay?
Stay...

What you need to know
Is to try and let it go let it go
What you need to find
Is someone who never will let you go

And oh oh
Sunshine and city lights will guide you home
And oh oh
Yeah you gotta know that I'll never let you go
Mmm, I'll never let you go

Now we're stuck in midtown
Surrounded by people and nothing but sound
And we're going nowhere
And we are the lost and found

We're all over this town
Is there something or nothing you wanted to say?
Do you want me to go now?
'Cause baby I want to stay...
Oh stay...

What you need to know
Is to try and let it go let it go
What you need to find
Is someone who never will let you go

And oh oh
And sunshine and city lights will guide you home
And oh oh
Yeah you gotta know that I'll never let you go

And sunshine and city lights
Wooh, wooh, woo
And sunshine and city lights

What you need to know
Is to try and let it go let it go
What you need to find
Is someone who never will let you go

What you need to know
Is to try and let it go let it go
What you need to find
Is someone who never will let you go

And oh oh
And sunshine and city lights will guide you home
And oh oh
But you ought to know that I'll never let you go
