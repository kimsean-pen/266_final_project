One step back take two leaps forward
And with bated breath we wait
For generation X to fade
Embracing the emmancipation

How will history remember?
Collapsing pillars of the earth
A march of progress in reverse

Blood fills my lifeless heart
I seek her in the dark

Two steps back one leap forward
You led your shackles for the grace
Still counting on that wish you made
To reach out far beyond the pale
How I dream to feel alive
Bestow upon these vital signs
They'll learn up off repents the tide?
Will we ever reach the shoreline

How we answer to the gods
Among where man created us
As I inhale the hurricane
I touch the void and feel no pain

Resolve to carry on another
Life awaits beyond the horizon
We've all and will assure our survival
We are the revolution

Resolve to carry on another
Life awaits beyond the horizon
We've all and will assure our survival
We are the revolution
