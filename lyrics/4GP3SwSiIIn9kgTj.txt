How does it feel being in these arms?
What's it really like to be loved?
I've been alone now, how long?
Have you ever loved the way that I have?

And I have often wondered who
Who could love you the way I do?

Now, I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you

And I need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

I've got all this poetry, now
I didn't know then, I kept it inside
Guess I had never seen anything beautiful
Till I first saw you asleep at night

And I have often wondered who
Who could love you the way I do?

Now, I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you

And I need you more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

I just wanted to know what it was like
What it's really like to be loved?
These little volcanoes came as a surprise to me
Oh, I never thought I could be this way

And I have been cautious
And I've tried to keep to myself
Who could love you the way I do?

Now, I just want you to know
How I'm touched deep in my soul
Just being with you

Oh, so much more each day
Baby, if you're still awake
Call me when you get this

Just want you to know
I'm touched deep in my soul
Being with you

Need you more each day
If you're still awake
Call me when you get this
