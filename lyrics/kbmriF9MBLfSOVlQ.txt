Friday night, you and I
Side by side loVE the way we disappear
There's 'bout a million places we could go
But I'd rather be here

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true

But I'm done chasing parties
I'm done chasing bodies
I'm done getting home past two
I'm done 'cause I finally found you
Oh, oh, oh

I used to try anything
I was dying to escape myself
But I get so high just being around you
Don't need anything else

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true

But I'm done chasing parties
I'm done chasing bodies
I'm done getting home past two
Yeah, I'm done getting wasted
In somebody's basement
And waking up somewhere new
I'm done 'cause I finally found you
Oh, oh, oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true)
I'm done 'cause I finally found you
Oh, oh, oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never ever ever ever thought it would be true)

Friday night, you and I
Side by side love the way we disappear
There's 'bout a million places we could go
But I'd rather be here
