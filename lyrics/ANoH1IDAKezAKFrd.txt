I don't know you anymore
Twice the man you were before
Your sadness ever growing
Ever flowing tears all knowing

And it seems I'm getting smaller
Every day I feel minute
Or is it you who's growing taller
And the world just follows suit

I'm afraid of what you'll do
You've discovered something new
And it seems I can't compete
I stand my ground but it's effete

And it seems I'm getting smaller
Every day I feel minute
Or is it you who's growing taller
And the world just follows suit
