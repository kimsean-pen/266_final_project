Want you to cry
'Cause you're laughing so hard tonight
Playing air guitar alright
We're being who we are, even if they hate that

Want you to shout
At the top of your lungs about
All our favorite songs so loud
We'll be singing along, even if they hate that

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh whoa oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa

So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Don't hesitate
Be as dumb as you like
You may miss the time of our lives
So stay, you're dancing under the lights
Even if they hate that

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh whoa oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa

So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Some day when you're alone
And feeling whatever
You're gonna remember the times

When we were dancing alone
And holding fake microphones
I hope those memories can make you feel alright

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh oh oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count (whoa whoa)
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa

So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Whoa oh oh oh
We can do it like nobody's around
Whoa oh oh oh
We can do it like nobody's around

Yeah yeah yeah
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

We can do it like nobody's around

Yeah yeah yeah
Whoa oh oh oh

We can do it like nobody's around
