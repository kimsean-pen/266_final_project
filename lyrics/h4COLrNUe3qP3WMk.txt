Friends hit me(?) to this sound
Friends don't have the time to save me
When I'm falling

Come and shine your light
On the darkest lows
When I'm
When I'm all alone

Won't you paint my skin
With a warmer glow
All I need's your soul

You ease my heart, my mind
Opalite
Open up my lined eyes

So stay please, don't leave
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night

Thoughts eat me
Oh but you fill me up
Sadness evaporates to nothing
With your pure love

Come and shine your light
On the darkest lows
When I'm
When I'm all alone

Won't you paint my skin
With a warmer glow
All I need's your soul

You ease my heart, my mind
Opalite
Open up my lined eyes

So stay please, don't leave
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night

-ight, -ight
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night
-ight, -ight
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night

Your golden rays fade away
The blue that looms from yesterday

From every crack and every flaw
It's stepping on the (?)
You're the color I adore
You're the color I adore

You ease my heart, my mind
Opalite
Open up my lined eyes

So stay please, don't leave
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night

-ight, -ight
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night
-ight, -ight
Opalite
Take away the trouble of the night
