Forever sound
Whistle around the ring
Wetness on the lip
Like phantom weeping
Chemicals gave us time to tell, right?

This little creek
So barren and bleak and dark
Winding at the bend
It's almost Heaven
All is wild, all is wonderful, right?

And state lines
With nothing to show, so long and slow
Stay just out of reach, just take us home

Forever sound
Whistle around the ring
Wetness on the lip
And the glass rim sings
Like the voice of who we'll never meet

And our Heaven went astray
Drowned out like indigo
And you're bitter wine that's tasteless
Never came along with time

And state lines
With nothing to show, so long and slow
Stay just out of reach, just take us home

We're the best, pretty good at waiting
But in the end, bodies for the taking
You were the best violent motivation
A valentine, still but somehow shaking

Potomac river secrets floating on along their way
Lost but somehow staying

And state lines
With nothing to show, so long and slow
Stay just out of reach, just take us home

These bed sheets
Like bodies all alone, never there at all
Old road just take us home
