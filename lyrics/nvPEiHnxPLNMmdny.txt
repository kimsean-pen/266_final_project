well, i forgot the way back home
i called yr number on my phone
and asked you for directions in my car
and i can't sleep, i'm up at night
yr in my ear and i'm alright
i'm trying not to put it on the line
and i am so tired of losing sleep
i just want to keep you around
you make me feel alright
you make me feel alright
you make me feel like everything is gonna be just fine
well, i remember vividly
i can't believe it's happening
the perfect picture burning to the ground
then suddenly, it all makes sense
i push the sigh of my own regrets
and focus on the constant ringing sound
and i am so tired of losing sleep
i just want to keep you around
you make me feel alright
you make me feel alright
you make me feel like everything is gonna be just fine
