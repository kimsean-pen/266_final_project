There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Is it raining
Is it snowing
Is a hurricane blowing
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of hell glowing
Is the grizzly reaper mowing
Yes!
The dangers must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing!
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
Stop the boat
