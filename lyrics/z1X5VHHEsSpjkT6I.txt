I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours
Into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
The message you're sending

Body to body
Soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Love, love on the run
Breakin' us down
Though we keep holdin' on
I don't want to lose
No, I can't let you go

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the start
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the start
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh, take it to the heart

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
