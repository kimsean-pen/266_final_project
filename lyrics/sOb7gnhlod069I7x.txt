And as I see you walk away
It blurries my eyes
I've got nothing left to say
Just a bunch of lies
Cause you don't know
What you are doing
You say your love isn't true
Well, you don't know what it feels to be
Alone, alone

So go on
Go on and see how long you can survive
Without the one that makes you feel alive
When you're down down down
So go on, so go on... So go on

And as my memories fade like polaroids
I see the dreams of both of our lives as they are
Destroyed
Cause you don't know what you are doing
It isn't as it seems
Well, you don't know what it feels to be
Alone, alone

So go on
Go on and see how long you can survive
Without the one that makes you feel alive
When you're down down down
So go on, so go on... So go on
