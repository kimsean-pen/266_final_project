See the future in your eyes
Heard a voice say "don't let go"
Slipping through the cracks of time
It's the only place we ever known
You follow from the [?]
Counting the satellites, it's all we done
Reality says goodbye
Leaving me tied up hearing that

Let's chase satellites
Heaven knows what could happen next
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get

Running from the black and white
Looking for a place to lay our head
Reality slips sometimes
Next to you in another land
Running from the safety lines
Breaking the strobe to get ahead
Reality says goodbye
Oh it is on to what you say

Let's chase satellites
Heaven knows what could happen next
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get

Let's chase satellites
Heaven knows what could happen next
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get
Let's break through the night
I can't, the fast tracks we'll ever get
