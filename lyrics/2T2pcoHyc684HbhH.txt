Though I'd like to be the girl for him
And cross the sea and land for him
Milky skin, my tongue is sand until
The iridescent band begins to play

He's my Brandy Alexander
Always gets me into trouble
But that's another matter
Brandy Alexander
He's my Brandy Alexander
Always gets me into trouble
But that's another matter
Brandy Alexander

Though I know what I love most of him
I'm walking on needles and pins
My addiction to the worst of him
The low moon helps me sing

I'm his Brandy Alexander
Always get him into trouble
I hide that I am flattered
Brandy Alexander
I'm his Brandy Alexander
Always get him into trouble
I hide that I am flattered
Brandy Alexander

It goes down easy
You go down easy
It goes down easy
It goes down easy
You go down easy
You go down easy
You go down easy
You go down easy

Brandy Alexander
