Wooh!
Well I'm feeling left behind
Lord what a waste of time
They're coming to get you
Run on

How can I respect your crime?
When all you criminals whine
They bought and sold you
Run on
Run on yeah!

Well you can call me crazy
You can call me wrong
Cause
See I was born a liar
Albatross
Fly on
Fly on

My home is kind
Man, it pays to be blind
Well
I promise to forget you
Run on
Ah yeah
No swallowed pride
No conspiracy lined
Ow! Broken promise of virtue
Run on, lord!
Run on

Well you can call me lazy
But I know where I belong
Cause
Cause I was born a liar
Albatross
Fly on
Fly on

With your trust in love
From your god above haha

Oh I believe
The albatross is me

Well you can call me crazy
You can call me wrong
Cause
Cause I was born a liar
Albatross
Fly on
Fly on

I should have seen the signs
Now the memorys far behind
It was no big loss
Fly on Albatross, Yeah

Fly on

Albatross
