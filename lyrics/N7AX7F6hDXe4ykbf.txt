Always impatient
Purpose waning
Now is the perfect time

Our equity
Depreciating
Witness of the decline

Never let down

Keep making noise

I say
You say
Collage
It's all one
I say
You say

Everything is dead

This is a pulpit
I am a preacher
I have nothing to say

There is no moral
Only contest
All of it shades of gray

Never let down

Excess has cast our die
This is where I draw the line

It's a portrait of good times
With bad fashion in tow
But exposure's not influence
So shine a light on them

Cowards
Nothing but cowards
