Jenny whispered 'what does it all mean?'
Sometimes I feel like caught in the machine
But not forever, nothing is forever
Soon we'll all be gone, we're bound to
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na

Maybe we're all criminals and this is just a scene of a crime
Holy matrimony make some money and wind down 'til we die
Circling chairs until the music stops
Until it ends you got to
Open up your heart
Everybody's got it hard
We're built and then fall apart
We're all terrified

Jenny whispered 'I see what you mean'
A broken bottle in a washing machine
But not forever, who says forever
Soon we'll all be gone, we're bound to
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Na na na na na na na na na na na na

Maybe we're all criminals and this is just a scene of a crime
Holy matrimony make some babies and lay down 'til we die
Circling chairs until the music stops
Until it ends you got to
Open up your heart
Everybody's got it hard
We're built and then fall apart
We're all terrified

Circling chairs until the music stops
Circling chairs until the music stops
Circling chairs until it stops

Open up your heart
Everybody's got it hard
We're built and then fall apart
We're all terrified

Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart

We're all terrified
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
