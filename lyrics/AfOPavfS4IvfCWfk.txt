You say don't worry about me babe, promise this is just a phase
So what?
Should I stand around and wait, while you're living in a haze?
Nuh-uh

I remember how you were, when it was all fresh and new
Now what?
Now when you look at me, sometimes like you're looking straight through
And I say why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?

Looking like love is, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know
I'm One In a Million

(one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)
You're going down
Without me
You're wishing that you had someone like me

I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)

You say, "Don't worry about us babe, I just need a little time,"

So what?
I'm supposed to be okay, when we're nowhere close to fine?
Nuh-uh
I know you've done nothing wrong, but it only makes it worse

You-ooh
Hurt me more, you don't care, about what you're about to lose
And I say why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like love is, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)
You're going down
Without me
You're wishing that you had someone like me
I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)

And I say why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like love is, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm One In a Million
(one in a, one in a, one in a)
I'm One In a Million
(Ohhhhhh)
You're going down
Without me
You're wishing that you had someone like me
I'm One In a Million
