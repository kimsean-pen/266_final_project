My baby don't turn around
Leaves hearts scattered on the ground
My baby don't make a sound
As long as her hard liquor's never watered down

She's never been turned away
Don't care for what people say
She'll never see a rainy day

As long as her hard liquor gets bought and paid
As long as her hard liquor don't wash away
She needs that hard liquor maybe every day
She needs that hard liquor
Just give her that hard liquor
And she'll be okay

My baby don't need a song
My baby won't sing along
She don't need my muscle
'Cause her liquor's strong

Just give her that hard liquor and she took me home
Just give her that hard liquor 'til the morning comes
She needs that hard liquor maybe every day
She needs that hard liquor
Just give her that hard liquor
And she'll be okay

And she'll be okay
And she'll be okay
She'll be okay
She'll be okay
She'll be okay
Be okay
Be okay

My baby don't need a song
My baby won't sing along
She don't need my muscles
'Cause her liquor's strong

Just give her that hard liquor and she took me home
Just give her that hard liquor before the morning comes
She needs that hard liquor maybe every day
She needs that hard liquor
Give her that hard liquor
And she'll be okay

She'll be okay
And she'll be okay
She'll be okay
(Hard liquor, hard liquor, hard liquor)
