Every day, the deficit grows
You spend more than you own
Papa always said to me
"Keep a close eye on your authority"

You say that you care
I was unaware
You say that you care
I was unaware

All you do is push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther

Every day, taxes increase
So is this our land, or is this our lease?
Papa said, "Son, it's the land of the free"
As he broke his back trying to make ends meet

You say that you care
I was unaware
You say that you care
I was unaware

All you do is push, pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther
Push, pull, tear

Yeah
You say that you care
I was unaware
You say that you care

I was unaware
'Cause all you do is push, pull, tear
Oh, all you do is push, pull, tear
Oh, push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
No, no
We can't stretch it any farther
Push and pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther, no
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch any farther, no, no
