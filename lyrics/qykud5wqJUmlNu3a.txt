You gave me hope when nobody else did
Forgot what it's like to feel so alone
You gave up your time to fix up my mould
You made me feel fine when I felt the lows

When you feel down with no one to hold
If you feel alone you know who to call
When you're not around I never feel small
You say that you're right, that never gets old

You've got a grip on my mind
And things you could live without
Playing both sides
Erased every trace of doubt

I lied to myself
Blamed everyone else
But you

Pride's on the line, these lies I've been keeping
You'd watch my demise, whilst drunken inside
I've built walls so high, got trapped in my feelings
You took what was mine, something you can't buy

When you feel down with no one to hold
If you feel alone you know who to call
When you're not around I never feel small
You say that you're right, that never gets old

You've got a grip on my mind (Oh)
And things you could live without
Playing both sides (Oh)
Erased every trace of doubt
I don't know why
I gave you my all but you
Fed me white lies (Fed me white lies)
I'd fall for it every time

I lied to myself
Blamed everyone else
But you

Looking back in hind sight
I could count a million lies
A million tears, a million fights
A million ways I could describe
Way you made me the fool
Was too caught up on you
Oh I couldn't forget if I tried

You've got a grip on my mind
(Grip on my mind)
Playing both sides
(Playing both sides)
I don't know why
(I don't know why)
I'd fall for it every time

Oh, oh, oh

You've got a grip on my mind
And things you could live without
Playing both sides
Erased every trace of doubt
I don't know why
I gave you my all but you
Fed me white lies
I'd fall for it every time

I lied to myself
Blamed everyone else
But you
