Rollin' down the highway
Like a rocket
God I'm headed to town now
Can't stop it
With the wheels in my hand
As I stand
On the floor
Of the board
Of this car
On the road
Got this woman in the back seat
she's my wifey
In the middle of the delivery
Man she saves me
To this day I don't know why
She picked me up
When i was down on the road
With the wind when it blowed

Well a son's gonna rise in a mile
In a mile
You'll be feeling fine
In a mile you will see
After me
You'll be out of the dark, yeah
You'll get your shot
