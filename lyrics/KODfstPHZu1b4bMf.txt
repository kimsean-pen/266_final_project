I've seen you eat away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine*
I've seen you chisel away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine

and you wonder why I leave so soon
how I get so high sink to the bottom of your room

I've seen you fritter away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I've seen you whittle away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the spine

And you wonder why I leave so soon
how I get so high sink to the bottom of your room

I wonder why I stay
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I've seen you eat away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine

I wonder what to do
slow as a glacier takes to move on through the world

And you wonder why I leave so soon
how I get so high sink to the bottom of your room

And you wonder why I leave so soon
how I get so high sink to the bottom of your room

I've seen you chisel away
Hammer in place always in time
I've seen you chisel away
slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine

And you wonder why I leave so soon
how I get so high sink to the bottom of your room
