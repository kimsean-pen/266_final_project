Every night I have the same old dream
'bout you and me and what's in between
So many changes, so many lies
Try to run, try to hide
From everything that I feel inside
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes...
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
Stone Cold...
and I thought I knew you so well
Stone Cold
Can't break away from your spell
Another dark and empty night
If I was wrong I wanna make it right
But you are so distant, so far away
Your words like ice fall on the ground
Breaking the silence without a sound
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
Stone Cold...
and I thought I knew you so well...
Stone Cold
Can't break away from your spell...
You leave me Stone Cold
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
Stone Cold...
and I thought I knew you so well
Stone Cold
Can't break away from your spell
You're Stone Cold... yeah
I can't break away from your spell
Stone Cold... baby
I thought I knew you so well
You're stone cold... ice cold
Can't break away from your spell
(you put me in the deep freeze)
(oh baby don't you leave me)
(stone... cold, your leavin' me cold)
Stone Cold... I thought I knew you so well
Stone Cold... Can't break away from your spell
