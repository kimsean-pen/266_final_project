You told to me stay here,
I'll be right back.
It's just a matter of time.

I knew you taught myself into
Looking for you...
In my mind.

You told me you need me.
You didn't say why.
Hold on just that
You would never lie.
All I know is
You're here by my side.
I've got you here,
I've got you here.

I've got you here,
I've got you here.

When the Sun is burning red,
Push out my diamonds.
My whole life I did,
Leave them behind us.
All my questions'll
Be answered in the dark.
I've got you here,
I've got you here.

I need you to leave me,
But please don't ask why.
I beg you to trust that
Everything will be fine.
I'm alive as long
As you're here inside.
I've got you here,
I've got you here.

When the Sun is burning red,
Push out my diamonds.
My whole life I did,
Leave them behind us.
All my questions'll
Be answered in the dark.
I've got you here,
I've got you here.

You're way behind the time,
I know what you don't.
From your head down to your toes,
You're a sheep in wolves' clothes.

I've got you here,
I've got you here.

When the Sun is burning red,
Push out my diamonds.
My whole life I did,
Leave them behind us.
All my questions'll
Be answered in the dark.
I've got you here,
I've got you here.

I've got you here,
I've got you here.
