For all the lonely ones, who live life in the dreams
It's so cold and lonely outside, so it seem's.
So you keep on searching, anyway.
Maybe you'll find someone tomorrow, cuz you haven't today.

So let your mind be carried, with the breeze.
For you know your not the one's who carry, the deseise.
Cuz your the lonely one.
the only one.
the lonely one.
