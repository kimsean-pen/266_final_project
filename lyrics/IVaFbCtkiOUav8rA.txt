I will try
I will try
not to lose my own
If you cry
That secret down

Open up your eyes again
Even you can try
Don't you think
you toil in vain
What have you come to be, to be now?

Stop for a minute
You better change
your heart in time
Stop for a minute
You can believe that part of mine
I'll be protectin you
From what you run into
If you will hold on

Stop for a minute

I rely
I rely on my chance to know

You and I
Could feel as once
Open up and start again
An' take a look around

Don't you see what I have meant

What have you come to be, to be now?

Stop for a minute
You better change

your heart in time
Stop for a minute
You can believe that part of mine
I'll be protecting you
From what you run into
If you will hold on
Stop for a minute

And what is left to you
Where are you goin' to
That sorrow in your life
In your life
What did you come to be
come to be now?

Stop for a minute
You better change
your heart in time
Stop for a minute
You can believe that part of mine
I'll be protecting you
From what you run into
if you will hold on
Stop for a minute.
Ah-ah-aah, stop for a minute
... for minute, ah-ah, stop for a minute
uh-uh-uuh, stop for a minute
ah-ah-aah, stop for a minute
... for minute ...
