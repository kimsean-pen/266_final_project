Chorus:
If I can't dance
If I can't dance
Oh, baby, if I can't dance
If I can't dance
If I can't dance
Then I don't want any part of your revolution

A new dawn waits for us tonight
If you play the cards, you're holding right
I swear I'll keep in party line
Cross my heart and hope to die
If I lose myself to rhythm
Doesn't mean I lose control

Chorus:
If I can't dance
If I can't dance
Oh, baby, if I can't dance
If I can't dance

If I can't dance
Then I don't want any part of your revolution

Can you see the action in my head?
The town we're painting turning red?
We need a new wave I can ride
If we are ever gonna turn this tide
Politicize my own endeavors
I've no use for your protocol

Chorus 2x

Oh darling don't be so unkind
The beat must never be denied

Chorus 2x

Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
