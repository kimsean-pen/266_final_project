Well you're not what I was looking for
But your arms were open at my door
And you taught me what a life is for
To see the ordinary isn't

Light me up again
Light me up again

And I want to keep us all alive
And I want to see you with my eyes
But I see you are my fireflies
And how extraordinary is that

Light me up again
Light me up again
And you don't hold back
So I won't hold back
You don't look back
So I won't look back
Light me up again
Light me up again

We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever

And you don't hold back
(We are, we are, we are tonight)
So I won't hold back
(We are, we are, we are forever)
You don't look back
(We are, we are, we are tonight)
So I won't look back
(We are, we are, we are forever)

And you don't hold back
So I won't hold back
You don't look back
So I won't look back

Light me up again
Light me up again

And you don't hold back
So I won't hold back
You don't look back
So I won't look back

Light me up again
(We are, we are, we are tonight)
(We are, we are, we are forever)
Light me up again
(We are, we are, we are tonight)
(We are, we are, we are forever)
Light me up again
(And you don't hold back)
(So I won't hold back)
Light me up again
(You don't look back)
(So I won't look back)

We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever
