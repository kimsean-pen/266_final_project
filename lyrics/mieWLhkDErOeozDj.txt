I'm sleeping to develop my dreaming skill
I'm going to build, I'm going to build
If the space is malleable the contrast must be too
It changes shape with you, it changes shape with you

Wishes turn out orphans, skip on the surface of the
Sky and sink, sky and sink
They break into the air with little faith and heap
A desert full of dunes, a desert full of dunes

The space is wired for light
Light for gaze, gaze for intent
The space is wired for light
Light for gaze, gaze for intention

A body disassembled still assembles its
Memory as a whole
Recognition renders composition
Intention begins resurrection
