From the ice-age to the dole-age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than
Other girls' mothers

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than

Other girls' mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale

Oh, i say
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others

Some girls' mothers are bigger than
Other girls' mothers
Some girls are bigger than others

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than
Other girls' mothers
Send me the pillow

The one that you dream on
Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on
And i'll send you mine
