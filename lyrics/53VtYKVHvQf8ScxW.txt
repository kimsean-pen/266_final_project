I don't know what to do myself
Baby, since you've been gone
I don't know what to do myself
I just love you
Baby, please come back

I don't know what to do myself
Baby, since you've been gone
I don't know what to do myself
I just love you
Baby, please come back

O destino desse rio é o mar
Meu destino, seu amor
A vida só vai valer
Se por onde eu for
Vier você

I don't know what to do myself
Baby, sice you've been gone
I don't know what to do myself
I just love you
Baby, please come back
