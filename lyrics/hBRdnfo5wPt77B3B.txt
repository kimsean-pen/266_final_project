I've been walking in the rain,
I've been swimming through the air again,
I've been floating in the blue,
I've been coming to my own rescue...

I take another brief dip
in the indifference of fools,
I see a whole new me,
I see a whole new you...

I've been glowing in the dark...
I've been fooling with a naked flame...
I've been quoting this and that,
I've been talking in my sleep again...

Is this the nature of the beast?
Am I the creature you pursue?
Is this the general release
or just a private view...?

I've been spinning like a top,
I've been changing my tune,
I've been skating on thin ice,
I've been making heaven's rendezvous...
I've been thinking about me and you...
I've been thinking about me,
I've been thinking about me and you...

I take another brief dip
in the indifference of fools...
I see a whole new me,
I see a whole new you...
Is this the nature of the beast?
Am I the creature you pursue?
Is this the general release
or just a private view...?
