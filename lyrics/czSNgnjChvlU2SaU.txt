Danger, danger
The queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger
And life about to spill
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone

Speed on and on
Kill the king

Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Strike him down
Power, power
It happens every day
Power, devour
All along the way

Oh no, move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone
Speed on and on
Kill the king

Treason, treason
The spectre looms again
Treason, reason
The realm is safe and then

Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone
Speed on and on
Kill the king, yeah
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Got to take his crown down
Kill the king
He'll rule no more
Strike him dead
The people roar
Kill the king, yeah
Take his head
Down, down, down, down
Oh, kill
Oh, kill
Oh, oh
