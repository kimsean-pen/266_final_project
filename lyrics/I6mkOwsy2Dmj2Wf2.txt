I, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe through the trees of loneliness
And you, you must confess
How hard you need to see through the heart beatin' out my chest
Feel like we've been falling down like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come don't let our hearts freeze
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
Dark, as midnight sun, smoke as black as charcoal
Fills into our fragile lungs
Cause when our demons come dancing in the shadows
To a game that can't be won
Feel like we've been falling down like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come don't let our hearts freeze
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our souls
We will walk away from empty gold
We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer gotta fever runnin' through my bones
We're the ally cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts they won't take our souls
We're the underdogs in this world alone
I'm a believer gotta fever runnin' through my bones
We're the ally cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts they won't take our soul
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
We will walk away from empty gold
