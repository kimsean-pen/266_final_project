It ain't about a heart to find
It's about the one inside
It's about the love you hide
It's waitin' to be let outside

And it ain't about losing your mind
But if you happen to, that's fine
But there's only one way to shine
And it's called trying to live

Freely, freely meu coracao
Freely, freely meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
I'd like to live that way

And my mother may not understand
Why I'm the way that I am
But I love her and I wanna let her in (do you love her?)
Get to know a friend

And now we gotta take some time
Get to know each other our whole lives
And I call on you to remind
Nothing's really mine
Except for

Freedom, freedom en meu coracao
Freedom, freedom en meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
Oh I'd wanna stay stay that way

You ever seen anything as kind
As the wind blowing by
I've never seen anything as wise
As the sun rise, that shines

Freely, freely en meu coracao
Freely, freely meu coracao
I'd like to live that way
Oh I'd wanna live that way
