Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
But that's okay, that's okay

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

Your appetite is whet
I've got the table set
Don't get your dribble on my
T-t-t-table yet
I've got the goodies baked
Got more than you can take
Just try a nibble of my biscuits
And my rainbow cake

Let's be traditional
And unconditional

Elbows down
Pinkies up
That's the way you sip my cup

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
But that's okay, that's okay

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

Try not to move too fast
You know dessert comes last
I'm a lady, futhermucker
Try to show some class
Down to the last cup
We keep it boiling hot
We keep the party moving till we drink the last drop

Let's be traditional
And unconditional

Elbows down
Pinkies up
That's the way you sip my cup

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
But that's okay, that's okay

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out

I know this night is like no other
And you're not just a lover
(You're porcelain in a paper cup world)
(Tip me over an pout me out)
I know it's only getting better
As long as we're together
(You're porcelain in a paper cup world)
(Tip me over an pour out)

I know this night is like no other
And you're not just a lover
(You're porcelain in a paper cup world)

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
You didn't RSVP
But that's okay, that's okay

Welcome to the tea party
You wanna be my VIP?
When I'm all steamed up
Hear me shout
Tip me over, and pour me out
(Out, out, out, out)
