How many times must we scale this wasteland
How many times must we climb these walls

A storm is brewing on the horizon
Dark skies gonna shut out the light
The high priest of the tribe got his eyes on you
We escape... Thru the night

We've got the power but no place to run
Dreams dying in the blacked out sun
You've got the powder
And i've got the gun

How can we break from this spell we're under
Is there escape from this broken world

So take my hand, We'll slip thru the outskirts
Together we can make it tonight
And if we cannot make it by daylight
We will stay- We will fight

We've got the power but no place to run
Dreams dying in the blacked out sun

You've got the powder
And i've got the gun

We've got the power but no place to run
Dreams dying in the blacked out sun
You've got the powder
And i've got the gun

It's too late to turn back
The point of no return
It's too late to turn back now
We watch the city burn
You can never go home
