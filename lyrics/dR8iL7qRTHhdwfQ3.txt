They gave you a heart, they gave you a name
Released to the wild with no one to tame
You need a place to disappear
That's why you're here

Escapeless dreams, I keep climbing up the floor
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a name)

They've been knocking at your door
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a name)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me

They gave you a heart, they gave you a name
Released to the wild with no one to tame
You need a shape for your fear
That's why you're here

Escapeless dreams, I keep climbing up the floor
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a name)

They've been knocking at your door
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a name)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart)

Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a name)
Lay down beside me

Beside me
(They gave you a heart, they gave you a name)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart, they gave you a name)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart, they gave you a name)
Lay down beside me
(They gave you a heart, they gave you a name)
