Every time you talk to me
you are only talking about yourself
And you don't see,
that I am not listening anymore

I refrain to talk about me
because it always turns into a war
A war between me and you
Between me and you

It's the morning after the war
It's the morning without you

Every time you talk to me
you are only talking about yourself
And you don't see,
that I am not listening anymore

I refrain to talk about me
because it always turns into a war
A war between me and you

It's the morning after the war
It's the morning without you

We have lost the war
We take the blame
We have lost ourselves in the flames
