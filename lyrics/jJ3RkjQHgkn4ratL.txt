We're all scared of trenches
And grow weak at knees
I want you to know that
If all you've ever wanted
Was a dream
Then you know that I can't help you

But did I show you love
In the author of my face
'Cause you know you left a hollow
Where your body cut an alcove
Did I show you love
'Cause the silence never stayed
It's a breach I'll never cover
It's a breach I'll never cover

You happened out the back door
Laying bare this need
Oh, you open up this vessel
And gather all the quivers
That never got to fly
And a one and only cipher

But did I show you love
In the author on my face
'Cause you know you left a hollow
Where your body cut an alcove
Did I show you love
'Cause the silence never stayed
It's a breach I'll never cover
It's a breach I'll never cover
