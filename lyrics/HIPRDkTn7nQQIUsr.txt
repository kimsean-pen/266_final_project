When you tell me that you need me
You're knocking on the door that I'd locked down
Oh, believe me I threw away the key
Along with my pride, I swallowed it down

Oh, the people say that I'm a machine
A robotic thing with no real feelings
But you remind me
What it means to be human
Human, human, human

See the static
No attachment
With computer screens for eyes, they're all dried out
But in the attic there's some magic
It's hidden away for the day that it'll be found out

Oh, the people say that I'm a machine
A robotic thing with no real feelings
But you remind me
What it means to be human
Human, human, human

I washed them so free
I wanted to be
I knew I had it in me
You found it buried deep
I washed them so free
I wanted to be
I knew I had it in me
You found it buried deep

Human, human, human
