Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you

I'm havin' that dream again
And I can't wake up from it
Will you come back from wherever you've been
Ah-ooh
I'm in over my head
And I can't get over it
Playing back everything you did
Ah-ooh

Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you

If I could see you again
If I could make you forget
If time could erase everything that I said
Ah-ooh

Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna fall, can't help it if I do
Don't wanna call, but I'm thinkin' about you
Don't wanna fall back in love with you
Don't wanna call, can't help it if I do
Don't wanna fall, can't help it if I do
Don't wanna call, but I'm thinkin' about you
Don't wanna fall back in love with you
Don't wanna call, can't help it if I do

Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Keep movin' on but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Don't wanna call but I'm thinkin' 'bout
