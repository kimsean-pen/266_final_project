I was young, but I wasn't naive
I watched helpless as you turned around to leave
And still I have the pain I have to carry
A past so deep that even you could not bury if you tried

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it

Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more than you'll ever know
And part of me died when I let you go
I would fall asleep only in hopes of dreaming
That everything would be like it was before
But nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting

They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it

That I loved you more than you'll ever know
And part of me died when I let you go

After all this why would you ever wanna leave?
Maybe you could not believe it that my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more than you'll ever know
And part of me died when I let you go
That I loved you more than you'll ever know
And part of me died when I let you go
