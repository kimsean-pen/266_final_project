I came here to
Be shallow
And to watch you spill
Out all your dreams
Sucked them up like a
Cool drink
I was never too willing
To leave

Some empty friend
Who talked me into sleep
Sweet dreams
And threw my wings
Into the blazing sun

Coughed a castle
Of crystal
Across the bright yellow
Kitchen floor
Watched the roaches
Grow kingly
Served them death by
The ivory sink shore

Caught up in my
Thoughts a
Beehive swarming
I can't swat you out your
Stories are too sweet
Should've never
Believed you
Why'd i ever believe you
