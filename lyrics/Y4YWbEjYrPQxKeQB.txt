Someone told you there is
Now where to get a way out of this
Then what
And if you're keeping this heart
From coming completely unthought
Then what
And if the rich are begging on the doorsteps of the poor
Then what
Then what is it I've got

Someone told you there is
No way to get out of this
Then what
Oh girl if you're the last thing that's keeping this heart
From coming completely apart
Then what
And if in the warmth and rhythm of your skin I lost everything I could win
Then what
Then what is it I've got

I used to think that I used to think I had it all
That was long before I knew you
But girl what could you do
It used to think that I used to think I had it all
That was long before I knew you
But girl what could you do

And if the eyes that draw you in
Don't reveal anything
And if the soul that lay thin upon the sweat on your skin
Retreated deep into your body again
Well what is it then
What is it then
What is it then
What is it I've got

I used to think that I used to think I had it all
That was long before I knew you
But girl what could you do
It used to think that I used to think I had it all
That was long before I knew you
But girl what could you do
