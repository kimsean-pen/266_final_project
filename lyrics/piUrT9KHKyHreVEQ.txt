I like the way that you dress up
But wear your Martens for me
I like that when I grab your hand
You tend to smile in your sleep
I like the way you sprinkle
Bourbon in your morning coffee
It kind of tastes bad, I'm not mad

I like how you put up with me
And all my friends 'cause we're jerks
And bring me places
Like your beach house or a Jimmy concert
I like how it's been days now
Since you washed that yellow t-shirt
It kind of smells now, but I'm down

We look good together, always down whenever
We are weird and painful, just like Ross and Rachel
Let's take a shot at something wonderful

So baby, let's go to the lake
And have a party for two
Come on let's get drunk, go adventure
Flip my uncle's canoe
And we'll sing pop songs by the fire from 2002
We're on our own now
We kind of smell now, but I'm down

We look good together, always down whenever
We are weird and painful, just like Ross and Rachel
Let's take a shot at something wonderful

Ah, ah
Good together, always down whenever
Ah, ah
Good together, always down whenever

So baby, let's go to the lake
And have a party for two

We look good together, always down whenever
We are weird and messy, just like Zack and Kelly
Let's take a shot at something wonderful
Let's take a shot at something wonderful

We look good together, always down whenever
We are weird and painful, just like Ross and Rachel
Let's take a shot at something wonderful
