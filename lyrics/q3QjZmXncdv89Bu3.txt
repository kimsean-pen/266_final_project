Look at all this youth get wasted
Idle with no hope
Drowning dreams into narcotics
Waiting for the end
Days are acid nights are worse
A maze of smoke and strife
Hush and feel the needle free you
Kill the hurt inside

Anaesthetized generation
Broken dreams, poisons ain't the cure
Living fast, you don't mind it
Dying young no one by your side

Side, side

Wake up from this bed of roses
Cuz roses hide their thorns
Let the needle fall away
I know it feels so right
Feeling like a thousand spades
Piercing through your soul
Bear the pain and stand the hurt
Just stand until it's gone

Anaesthetized generation
Broken dreams, poisons ain't the cure
Living fast, you don't mind it
Dying young no one by your side

Anaesthetized generation
Broken dreams, poisons ain't the cure
Living fast, you don't mind it
Dying young no one by your side, by your side
Side
