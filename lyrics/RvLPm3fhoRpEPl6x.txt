I want to rock with you
Just once
(I want to rock with you)
Come on...

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

Strobe lights make everything sexier (sexier)
Shadows dancing on the wall
I wanna rock with you
Let's converse
Talk with your body
Don't say anything at all
(I want to rock with you)

Rock with you
Wanna rock with you

Strobe lights make everything sexier
Shadows dancing on the wall
(Do you see me?)
I wanna rock with you
Let's converse
Talk with your body
Don't say anything at all

Our bodies as one
