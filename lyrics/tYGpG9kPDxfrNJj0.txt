We're the lifted boys and girls and we are on a roll
Listening to everything from grunge to rock n' roll
Our feet don't touch the ground
Fly like a plastic bag that's
Lifted

We inhale the helium and leave the shit below
We don't get in traffic jams we're shining on this road
With sunshine on our faces
We keep it super basic
Lifted

We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget

Wake up every morning we got troubles at our door
We get lifted right away no we don't touch the floor
We want to see in colour
We want to feel each other
Lifted

Drifting through the day no I don't make my mama proud She keep trying to talk to me but I am in the clouds
No I don't feel the pressure
Up here the air is fresher
Lifted

We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget

We got lifted on a Monday
Then we floated away and it was Sunday
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
We get high up on the low down
Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
All we want is to forget
All we want is to forget
