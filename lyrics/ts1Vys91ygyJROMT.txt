These kind ones have adopted us
Accepted without question
We have to love,
We have to live, a peaceful gift
These kind ones have adopted us
Accepted without question
We have to love,
We have to live, a peaceful gift

We must all be grateful, nobody deserves this,
Standing in the darkness, praying for the light.
Bartering, we seek friends. (?)
My only access to mistakes I may have made
Where are they? Where are they now?

As I stare into a hole made up of dismay
They now face me, gazing blankly into my eyes!
As I stare into a hole made up of dismay
They now face me, gazing blankly into my eyes!

All I want, shattering, leaving, all matter starts to be replaced
All I want, shattering, leaving, all matter starts to be replaced
I am putrid, clear aside, the good that I have done.
I am putrid, clear aside, the good that I have done.

BUT I AM ALIVE!

As I stare into a hole made up of dismay
They now face me, gazing blankly into my eyes!
As I stare into a hole made up of dismay
They now face me, gazing blankly into my eyes!

All of this starts to be replaced with guilt
I am putrid, I am putrid
I am putrid, I am putrid

Leave aside, the good that I've done, all I'll be in the end is worthless.
All I'll be in the end is worthless.
