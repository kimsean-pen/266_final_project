How do I release and get untied?
I don't know how to make you feel alive
Tell me, tell me, now now now now now, baby
Tell me now, yeah, tell me now, yeah

Why you always tear me down?
Bitch, you know I'll keep this crown
Intentions are clearly known
Clearly known-own-own
Why you always tear me down?
Bitch, you know I'll keep this crown
No, I don't feel high no more
I'm on the floor, no, baby

I'm sorry that my whole heart was not enough
I'm sorry, you can keep it 'cause I'm cold as fuck
Father, please forgive me 'cause I'm on the floor
Praying on the floor
Can someone save this sinner?

How did I get you to leave my head?
How did I get you to leave my bed?
Baby, baby, baby
Babe, I let you go (go)

Why you always tear me down?
Bitch, you know I'll keep this crown
Intentions are clearly known
Clearly known-ow-own
Why you always tear me down?
Bitch, you know I'll keep this crown
No, I don't feel high no more
I'm on the floor, no, baby

I'm sorry that my whole heart was not enough
I'm sorry, you can keep it 'cause I'm cold as fuck
Father, please forgive me 'cause I'm on the floor
Praying on the floor
Can someone save this sinner?

I smell his scent on your skin
Let's not try to pretend
I'm the one that's the sinner, sinner (it's you)
Time to play the victim now
Hope he's with you when you drown
Know you worry, know you're hurting
I have the power now

I'm sorry that my whole heart was not enough
I'm sorry, you can keep it 'cause I'm cold as fuck
Father, please forgive me 'cause I'm on the floor
Praying on the floor
Can someone save that sinner?
Oh, baby
Can someone save you?
Can someone save you?

I'm a saint, bitch
