Hey, Hey

Yeah, do I got your attention?
Crawlin' the night with you
Whatever you feel like doing (yeah yeah yeah)
You keeping you head low
Like all of them lovers do
Wherever it feels like home

So make some colors, makin' sounds
And I think it's time you found me out

Yeah well I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
Yeah I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
Yeah well I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
And all I care is
Someone I don't ever want to miss
And all I care
Is someone I don't ever want to miss

Caught my attention
Here all alone with you
So whatever you feel like doing (yeah yeah yeah)
Out on the loose, darlin'
Like you know how to do
Wherever it feels like home

Yeah well I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
Yeah I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
Yeah well I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
Yeah I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
And all I care is
Someone I don't ever want to miss
And all I care
Is someone I don't ever want to miss

And we're moving yeah
And all these neon lights
And all these neon lights
Someone I don't ever want to miss
I'm wanderin' out there alone
And I got that feeling of love
Yeah stars went over me
Tossed beside my feet
Yeah, well what a place to be (I said yeah)

I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
Yeah I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
Yeah well I don't see my friends until the sun goes down
Yeah I don't hear a thing until the drugs run out
And all I care is
Someone I don't ever want to miss
And all I care
Is someone I don't ever want to miss

And we're moving yeah
And all these neon lights
And all these neon lights
Someone I don't ever want to miss
