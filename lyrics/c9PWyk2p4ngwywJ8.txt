When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon, you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again y'all
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
Hey now all you got to do is call
And I'll be there,yeah,yeah,yeah now
Well ain't it good to know that you got a friend when people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yes and desert you and take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, running, yeah, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
Hey now all you got to do is call
And I'll be there, be there yeah, yeah, yeah
