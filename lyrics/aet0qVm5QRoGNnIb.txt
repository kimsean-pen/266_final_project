It was all a thrill
I got locked in
But I had to go
The balcony was closed
But our minds were open
And it was touch
Feel me breathe in
Go on and touch
Don't think too deep in
Don't be so scared of the things you love.

Diving into waves over deeper waters
Fools from far away
Close enough to fall in
I never could say
I never could say again
What I wanted
I never could see
I never could see the waves
That rolled you under
That rolled you under

It hits me still when you're distant
Out there alone
While the world is stretched, we go
But this time holding strong
Without the rush
You still feel me breathe in
The loss is cut
Don't think too deep in
Don't be so scared of the things you love
Diving into waves over deeper waters
Fools from far away
Close enough to fall in
I never could say
I never could say again
What I wanted
I never could see
I never could see the waves
That rolled you under
That rolled you under
Diving into waves over deeper waters
Fools from far away
Close enough to fall in
I never could say
I never could say again
What I wanted
I never could see
I never could see the waves
That rolled you under
That rolled you under
