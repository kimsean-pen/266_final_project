I see you
Playing in the garden
Outside my window

You're like your father
I see right through you
Just like your father
I thought I knew you

It's a panic in paradise
It's a panic, it's in paradise

Round and round and round and round and round

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You can't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You can't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

I see her playing
In the garden
I was once like her
You did this to me

I don't remember
When this offense began
I don't remember
I can't undo what's done

Round and round and round and round and round

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You can't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You can't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You know why
(Round and round and round and round and round)

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You know why
(Round and round and round and round and round)

I'll keep my secret
With me until I die
I'll keep my secret
And I don't know why
Don't know why

Round and round and round and round and round

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You can't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

You can't come here
(Round and round and round and round and round)
You know why
(Round and round and round and round and round)

I can't go there
(Round and round and round and round and round)
I will cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

I can't go there
(Round and round and round and round and round)
I won't cry
(Round and round and round and round and round)

Round and round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round and round
