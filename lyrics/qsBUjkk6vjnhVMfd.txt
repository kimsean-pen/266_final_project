Falling to disgrace, take your life
You pretend... to live.
Laying in this death bed, take a look
You pretend... to care.
Everyday struggle, to prevail
Though you know... you cant win.
Dying every night, and you wish
It's for good... This time.
What you are, is dead inside
What you are, is god damned.
Time to close your eyes, for the night
And pretend... all is fine.
Wishing you could look, through these chains
Of your flesh... and mind
Try to imagine, what it's like
To be truly free... If you could only see.
Dying every night, and you wish so hard
It's for good this time... It's for good this time...
And now it's time, to find out
And now its time...
