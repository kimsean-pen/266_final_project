I been spending all this money 'cause I might not see the sun again
I've been smoking drugs in the slums, have you running when
I step on the scene, I ain't mean, boy, I just ain't your friend
You been off the shits, off some shit that I don't reccomend
I been on my shit, that's why these women on my dick
I ain't even got a job, I get some money, make it flip
See you running like a bitch, just chasing dreams you'll never get
And I dont need to dream, because to me my dreams are dead
I can only make it happen, I ain't happy in the end
Just a little satisfaction, if that's all that I can get
See me dressed in my own fashion, I don't have to fuck with trends
It's OmenXIII, the assassin, steady clashing 'til the end
Then I'm back into the shadows where they cannot seem to see
See, to me my life's a battle and I'll have to face defeat
But until that fucking happens I'll keep rapping on these beats
And I'm repping 10 black nails 'til OmenXIII R.I.P
Bitch, I started doing me, because I lost my will to live
But I can't give into the pain because the pain is not my friend
But it helps me feel alive, so I respect for what it is
And I tried to keep it cool, but now my patience wearing thin

My mind is in constant motion
Thoughts created by the slightest notion
I'm screaming out for hope and
The same thoughts strangle 'til I'm choking
