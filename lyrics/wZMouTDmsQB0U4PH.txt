Long hair and longer stride
And your cut off painter pants
Charging down the craggy mountains with our thrift store friends
Who you find so... so in love with the falling earth
Oh you wake in the middle of the falling night with summer playing coy

In the attics of the city night
We talked corso and the MC5
You could dance like
We were all right

Only the wild ones, give you something and never want it back
Oh the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones, are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now no place to go... but everywhere

One I met in the green mountain state
I dropped out, and he moved away
Heard he got some land down south
Changed his name to a name the birds could pronounce

And only the wild ones, give you something and never want it back
Oh the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones, are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now no place to go but everywhere...

No place to go but everywhere

And in the city the mayor said
Those who dance are all mislead
So you packed your things and moved to the other coast
Said you gonna be like Charlie Rose
Only the wild ones, give you something and never want it back
Oh the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones, are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now no place to go... but everywhere

Only the wild ones, give you something and never want it back
Oh the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones, are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now no place to go... but everywhere
