You're unsure and you're not ready
So that must mean I want you
You're unavailable and disinterested
To you I look for comfort

A million times in a million ways
I will try to change you
A million months and a million days
I'll try to convince you

I have waited for you and adjusted for you
And I'm done
I have deferred to you and enabled you
And I'm done

You're too young or you're too old
Or you're simply not inclined
You're asleep or you're withholding
Be that my cue to crave you

Several times in several ways
I'll try to squeeze love from you
Several hours and several ways
I'll feast on scraps thrown from you

I have bent 4 u and I've deprived for you
And I'm done
I have depressed for you and I contorted for you
And I'm done

I have stifled for you and I've compromised for you
And I'm done
I have silenced for you and sacrificed for you
And I'm done

It won't be long before I am reclaimed
It won't take long and I'll be on path again
It won't be easy for us to disengage
I'm at the end of self deprivation stage

You're afraid of every woman
Afraid of your inner workings
You cringe at the thought of living under
The same roof as me God and everything

A million times and a million ways
I've tried to alter to match you
Several times every several days
I've tried to uncrush on you

I have waited for you and adjusted for you
And I'm done
I have deferred to you and enabled you
And I'm done

I have bent 4 u and I've deprived for you
And I'm done
I have depressed for you and I contorted for you
And I'm done
