You're collar pops in the latest style
I feel romance hanging in your smile
Is it just me or the Paris sun?
On this boulevard, making everything so ooh la la
Hyper colour, hyper real
Elevating every single thing that I feel
Like a 's photograph, making me smile
Making me feel so alive

We can't stay forever this way
So how 'bout we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine

Language of love on your lips like a song
Heavy elixir, you could do no wrong
Is it just me or the Paris sun?
Scorching the boulevard, making you look so ooh la la

We can't stay forever this way
So how 'bout we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine
I can be yours
I can be yours
I can be yours

We can't stay forever this way
So how 'bout we run away
To another lifetime
Where I can be yours and you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine
