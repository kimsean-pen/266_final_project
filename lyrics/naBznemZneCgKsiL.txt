No playa boy can win my love
it's sweetness that i'm thinking of

them boys always actin' so mean
hands down in the dirt don't call clean
like a hole and the three little donkey

ring the bell, let me teach you something
cause your mama never taught you nothing
cover out cause you keep on frontin'

listen up turn it up
listen up, turn it up.

no playa boy can win my love
it's sweetness that i'm thinking of
he gotta learn in the gangsta stands
he needs a rock on the sticks breans
and giving love not bad romance
i make a move nothin' left to chance
so don't you mess with me.

can't touch me liar i'm fire
you and all you tricks exipeared
you ride really need new tearies vroom vroom vroom vroom tearies
you like my kicks let me kick ya

like a twilight fan imma bite ya
turn around let me cee love forget ya
listen up, turn it up

listen up, turn it up
no playa boy can win my love

it's sweetness that i'm thinking of
he gotta learn in the gangsta stands
he needs a rock on the sticks breans
and giving love not bad romance
i make a move nothin' left to chance
so don't you mess with me.
if you wanna looking your ways

baby gotta get real
if you are ready to play
imma have to feel
if you wanna looking your ways
baby gotta get real, yeah go and get real
no playa boy can win my love
it's sweetness that i'm thinking of

he gotta learn in the gangsta stands
he needs a rock on the sticks breans
and giving love not bad romance
i make a move nothin' left to chance
no playa boy can win my love
it's sweetness that i'm thinking of
he gotta learn in the gangsta stands
he needs a rock on the sticks breans
and giving love not bad romance
i make a move nothin' left to chance
so don't you mess with me.
