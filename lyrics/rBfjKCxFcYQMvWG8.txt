I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
But through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time,
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
(And I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(And I know) I know you can show me

(Let's talk about love) I wanna know what love is
(Love that you feel inside) I want you to show me
(And I'm feeling so much love) I wanna feel what love is
(Oh no you just cannot hide) I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
(Let's talk about love) I want you to show me
(I wanna feel it) I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel it, too)
(And I know, and I know) I know you can show me
(Hold me back if I'm wrong)

I wanna know what love is
(I wanna know)
I want you to show me
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
I want to feel what love is (I wanna feel)
I know you can show me
