When you're down and out
And you don't know what to do
Just reach out for me
When you're confused, baby
I'm goin' to help your find your way
Ooh baby, I'll be there
Just reach out your hand
I'm going to catch you out of thin air
Reach out. Reach out. Reach out.
I'll be there to catch you.
Reach out. Reach out. Reach out.
