Since the darkness took our minds
They burned our courage many died
Had to leave it all behind rebuild our lives
Passing memories remained
It made my soul a burning flame
Haunted dreams of my desire
Reveal thy name

Raise our swords we fight for life
Shields and armor shining bright
Strike like dragons Have no fear
Swords are made of steel

Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight on for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

Since the time we saw the sign
Destruction of your feeble mind
Centuries have come and gone but nothing's changed
Hopes and dreams have disappeared
Destruction of your kind is near
Trapped inside your suffering eternal flame

Search the darkness search the light
Fierce resistance what a fight
Glory for unholy zeal
Lies all cast in steel

Fly across the high seas and mountains...

In the depths of your desire
So secretly you feed the fire
Burning through the memories of all our lives
Watch the day turn into night
You reach out for that guiding light
First to be the one to hear their blinding lies

Fear of darkness fear of light
Sucked in by their ancient might
Ruthless in what you may feel
When your mind they steal

Fly across the high seas and mountains...
