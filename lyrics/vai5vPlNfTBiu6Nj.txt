You don't remember
So I need to figure it out
But the memories fade
The truth is that I'm not so sure
If we'll make it at all
I can't even trust myself

I used to have it all
Until I lost control
I used to have it all
Until I lost control

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
It's time for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

Sometimes I'm angry
And some days I'm totally numb
I just wanna give it all up

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
It's time for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

I used to have it all
Until I lost control
I used to have it all
Until I lost control

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
It's time for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

Until I lost control
Until I lost control
