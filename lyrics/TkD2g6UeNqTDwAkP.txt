Over the flows
I take my time
I search and turn around
Watching the stars
I want to dive in the sky
deep inside of me

Over the sky
I found a place I can be
no need to run
Follow my heart
I understand why and when
and what it's all about

Watching the signs
dancing all around
Over the flows
I find now a way
speak the words
already know
and now I learn
open the door
