My sexy love
(So sexy)

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch and I errupt
Like a volcano and cover her with my love

Babygirl, you make me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."
And I just can't think
(Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing
(Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing
(When we do the things we do)
Babygirl, you make me say
"Ooh ooh ooh."
Sexy love, girl the things you do

(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
(Oh baby, I)
Ooh I love making love to you
Babygirl, you know you're my
Sexy love
I'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest drug

Just enough, still too much
Say that I'm simp and I'm sprung on all the above
I can't help she makes me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."
And I just can't think
(Of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing
(Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing
(When we do the things we do)
Babygirl, you make me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."
My sexy love

Sexy love, girl, the things you do
(Oh baby, baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
(Ooh baby, I)
Ooh I love making love to you
Say, babygirl, you know you're
My sexy love

Oh baby, what we do it makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' 'til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do if I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keepin' you around
My sexy love
Sexy love, girl, the things you do
(Things you do, baby)
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
(Keep me running back to you)
Ooh I love making love to you
Say, babygirl, you know you're my sexy love
Sexy love
Sexy love, girl, the things you do
