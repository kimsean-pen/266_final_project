Keeping her bright eyes focused on the coastline waiting for you
Isn't she all of us pining for that last kiss, a permanent truth
A means to get through
Maybe we'll cry whilst hopeful
When we think about the past being cruel
Got a thought for those who start to think of love
As the pursuit of a fool
It's a palace from ruin

Deep into the night, eyes closing
Heart swollen with my loving for you
A solid embrace, kind face
And then the hurt starts leaving the room
Followed by goons
Sometimes it's open, white lights that roll at night
You got a heart like the moon
Gather courage, if you're doing something, do it
'Cause she got to go soon

If I could now
I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
And that ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown
If I could now
If I could now
If I could now
If I could now

If I had you now

So keep them bright eyes focused on the coastline waiting for you
Don't give me that bye-bye baby
When the night moves into black from the blue
The nights you've been through
Just give me that wide smile
Made for putting songs into the hearts of the doomed
And catch a cold heart staring at the water, babe
Remember you flew

If I could now
I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
That ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown
If I could now
If I could now
If I could now
If I could now

If I could now
I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
That ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown

So say what you want, dear
But the courage was won
With the way that you spoke here
When the dreaming was done
