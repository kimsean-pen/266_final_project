I'm on the night train
Going so fast
I'm on the night train
Going so fast
I'm on the night train
Going so fast
I'm on the night train running someone's coming
Looking so good make me forget the light keep
Slipping and thugs keep singing along and on
She is so addicted to the window and simply
Wishing all but sure cause you'll be broken
And the door keep slamming and the words keep
Coming along, all along
I'm on the night train
Going so fast
I'm on the night train
Going so fast
I'm on the night train
Going so fast
And all the people waiting for the signal at the station
At the same time the lights keeps slipping the thugs
Keep singing along and on
She's so addicted to the window, simply
Wishing all but sure cause you'll be broken
And the lights keep turning the train keeps moving along, oh, oh, oh, yeah
