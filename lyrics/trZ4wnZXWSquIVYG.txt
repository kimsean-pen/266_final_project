I jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light
You could give an aspirin the headache of its life
Maybe it's the crazy that I miss

Watering plastic plants in the hope that they will grow
Seeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone
Maybe it's the crazy that I miss

It won't get better than this

I like the way your brain works
I like the way you try
To run with the wolf pack when your legs are tired
I like the way you turn me inside and out
I like the way you turn

I like the way your brain works
I like the way your brain works

I want to get college girl drunk tonight
No morning fears
No mountains to climb
They say the best memories are the ones that we forget
Like
Listening to Drake at your best friends swimming pool
Floating anti-clockwise in a red mushroom
Maybe it's the crazy that I miss

It won't get better than this

I like the way your brain works
I like the way you try
To run with the wolf pack when your legs are tired
I like the way you turn me inside and out
I like the way you turn

I like the way your brain works
I like the way your brain works

Baby it's the crazy I like
I think I saw the world turn in your eyes
Baby it's the crazy I like

Maybe it's the bullshit I miss
Screaming at the moon in black lipstick
Maybe it's the bullshit I miss

It won't get better than this
