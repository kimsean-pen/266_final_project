Better it would be for me
And better it would have been
Had I not been born, not grown
Not been brought into the world
Not had to come to this earth
Not been suckled for the world

If I'd died a three night old
Been lost in my swaddling hand
I'd have needed but a span of doth
A span more of wood
But a cubit of good earth
Two words from the priest
Three verses from the cantor
One clang from the bell

Better it would be for me
And better it would have been
Had I not been born, not grown
Not been brought into the world
Not had to come to this earth
Not been suckled for the world
I'd rather die, I'd rather be better unborn

If I'd died a three night old
Been lost in my swaddling hand
I'd have needed but a span of doth
A span more of wood
But a cubit of good earth
Two words from the priest
Three verses from the cantor
One clang from the bell

Better it would be for me
And better it would have been
Had I not been born, not grown
Not been brought into the world
Not had to come to this earth
Not been suckled for the world
I'd rather die, I'd rather be better unborn
