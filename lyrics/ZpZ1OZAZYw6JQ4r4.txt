You're all legs
I'm all nerves
Black black pearl
Horse-hair whip
My own heels
Heal my hurt
Grease the wheel
Feel your floor

Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon

No kisses, no real need
No kisses, no real needs

Who here
Hear your word
Ring, ring phone
Send you home
Find my heels
Heal my hurt
White white shirt
Back to work
