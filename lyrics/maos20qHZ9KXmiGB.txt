All these crazy mixed up lies
And floating all around
Making these assumptions brings me down

And you get tight lipped
How do I know what you think
Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
My temper too quick, makes me blind

I apologize, I apologize
I apologize, I apologize
Said I'm sorry
(Said I'm sorry now)

Said I'm sorry
It's your turn to look me in the eyes
And apologize, how 'bout it

So now we sit around we're staring at the walls
We don't do anything at all
Take out the garbage maybe
But the dishes don't get done

Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
My temper too quick, makes me blind

I apologize, I apologize
I apologize, I apologize
Said I'm sorry
(Said I'm sorry now)

Said I'm sorry
Now it's your turn to look me in the eyes
And apologize, how 'bout it

All these crazy mixed up lies
Floating all around
Making these assumptions brings me down

And you get tight lipped
But I know what you think
Is it something I said when I lost my mind?
My temper too quick, makes me blind

I apologize, I apologize
I apologize, I apologize
Said I'm sorry
(Said I'm sorry now)

Said I'm sorry
It's your turn can you look me in the eyes
And apologize, how 'bout it
Apologize, how 'bout it
