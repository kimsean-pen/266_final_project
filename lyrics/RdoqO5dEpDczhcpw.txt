Your smell makes me cry
and this shirt smells of you
So I hold it to my face
and I sleep with it
Because with out you
I'd cease to exist

Your smell makes me cry
and this shirt smells of you
So I hold it to my face
and I sleep with it
Because with out you
I'd cease to exist

Your smell makes me cry
and this shirt smells of you
So I hold it to my face
and I sleep with it
Because with out you
I'd cease to exist
