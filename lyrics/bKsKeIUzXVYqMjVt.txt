Sometimes I feel turned around
And upside down
And sometimes maybe I drink too much
But, man, my heart's still in touch

Hey, I remember standing tall, saying
I'm gonna be a rock'n'roll star
When someone said, "Sit down, boy
You already are", yeah

So raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Oh, raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock

Summertime was always right
Just me and you
Sixteen and dealing with
Those summertime blues

I was young and restless then
Living on the edge of a dream
When someone said, "Come on, boy
You just gotta believe", yeah

I've raised the hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock

Oh, raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock (Rock!)
Oh, raise your hands to rock (Rock!), rock (Rock!)
Raise your hands to rock (Rock!), rock (Rock!)

You really don't have to (Rock!)
You really don't have to (Rock!)
Yeah, you really don't have to rock (Rock!)
