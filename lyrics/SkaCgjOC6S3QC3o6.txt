Do it, feel it, touch it, taste it
Be it, live it, need it, take it

Just another day
I want to get away
I've got a ticket for a new adventure
No one will know our name
So we can start again
And all we're gonna do is seek out pleasure

The city calls to me
It offers what i need
We can escape and take it on together

Bridge:
Come away with me

Chorus:
New york city lights so bright
We can lose ourselves
And start a new life
Run away and leave tonight
(let's do it, feel it, touch it, taste it)
New york city take a bite and
Subway down to times all night
It's me on world informed alright

(do it, feel it, touch it, taste it)

I want to take your hand
Fly over sea and land
It's the beginning of the end
It's our time

A dollar says it's true
This town gets hold of you
We'll see it written right across the skyline

Bridge
Chorus

Run away with me
Run away with me

Chorus
New york city lights so bright
We can lose ourselves and start a new life
Come on baby, please tonight
It's me on world, it's all alright
(let's do it, touch it, feel it, taste it)

Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey
(be it, live it, need it, take it)
