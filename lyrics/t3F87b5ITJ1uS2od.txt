You say that you've been suffering
From too much life, baby
You say that you've been suffering all along
Oh, oh, oh
But after all this time
You cannot say you blew it
After all this time
You know the score

When you're cooking couscous
Riding a bus
Working all day for your little bit of glitter
When you're on the high road
Making a fuss
Working always for your little bit of heaven

Some say that it is suffering
That gets you where you're going
I say that if it's suffering
It is wrong
Oh, oh, oh
'Cuz I can see no time
When I'm climbing mountains
All I see is all I've been looking for

When you're cooking couscous
Riding a bus
Working all day for your little bit of glitter
When you're on the high road
Making a fuss
Working always for your little bit of heaven

'Cuz baby you're a star
You know who you are
And no matter how far
You've been kicking through
Kicking 'cuz you know its true
Doing what you wanna do
You gotta do
Hei, yeah!
You know its true
Do what you wanna do

When you're cooking couscous
Riding a bus
Working all day for your little bit of glitter
When you're on a high road
Making a fuss
Working always for your little bit of heaven

(This could be heaven)
When you're cooking couscous
Riding a bus
Ahh
