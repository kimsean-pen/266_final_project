Your wall's too high, I can't see
Can't seem to reach you, can't set you free
If you can hear me, follow the sound
Help me tear your wall down to the ground

Everyone gets hurt sometimes
Everybody plays the game
If you don't win the first time
Come back and try again
Rocks an' bricks can't help you
You can't hide behind your wall
Why don't you try to jump it little girl
I'll catch you if you fall

Sometimes early in the mornin'
Without warnin' you'll realize, that you ain't too wise
With your head bowed down you go downtown
Watch an old lady hit the ground
Lots of people standin' round
But nobody seems to know her

You're an hour late when you reach your floor
And everybody tells you
That your boss is sore
Watch that clock for seven more
Then go flyin' through the door

Back home again the day is gone
You're safe and sound but still alone
And when the night falls around your walls
Tell me don't you ever wish you go go outside
Follow the lights, go outside

You'll be alright, just go outside
I'll tell you be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Come on

Everyone gets hurt sometimes
Everybody plays the game
If you don't win the first time
Come back and try again
Rocks and bricks can't help you
You can't hide behind your wall
Why don't you try to jump it little girl
I'll catch you if you fall

Your wall's too high, I can't see
Can't seem to reach you, can't set you free
If you can hear me, follow the sound
Help me tear your wall down to the ground

Now follow the lights and step outside
You'll be alright
I'll tell you be alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, come on
Alright, alright
