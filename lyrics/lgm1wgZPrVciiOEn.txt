Wasted all day, killing all the Capulets
Find a new face, bring a whores' namesake
Keep that set straight, Holly gonna DJ
Flip that Holocaust, hang it on the colored cross

Hey, hey

Holly went to heaven, Holly can't hate
Find a new face, bring a whores' namesake
Never need to ask, we'll tell you who's boss
Holly, you're a six with a crossed out pentagon

Hey, hey
