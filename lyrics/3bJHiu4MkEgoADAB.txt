A huh huh huh.
Its nothin' a little music can't help.
Rockin'
Rockin' and Rollin'.
Down to the beach, I'm strollin'
but the seagulls poke at my head;
not fun!
I said, "Seagulls, mmm! Stop it now!"

Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha
Hmm hmm hmm hm ha hmm hm hm hm ha

Everyone told me
not to stroll on that beach,
said, "Seagulls gonna come,
poke me in the coconut," and they did, and they did.
And they goin' like
Hwawwh hawh hawh hawh hawh hawh
Haaww hawh hawh hawh hawh hawh
Haaww hawh hawh hawh hawh hawh
Nothin' I could do but yell when these birds attacked me.
When I tried to run I fell, and then these kids start laughin'.
And then, hmm, got hit in the neck with a hacky-sack.
Mmm hm hm hmm where'd it come from?
Mmmm Gotta run
Run

Jump
I can be a backpack while you run.
Run

Jump
Now stop! Put me down.
I love to groove and boogie
Yea-a-a-ah
(Great)
Show you some dance moves! Mmmmm!
(No, I don't want you to)
If I had your giant feet out there on the beach
Could've outrun those birds!
(You're a psycho wiener)
Let me grab my beater!

Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha

(C'mon man, quick that bangin')
Hey what's that stank?
(You put a fish in our basket)
Ho ho ho-ooh Yeah! I forgot I did that.
(You owe me an apology)
Just hold your breath and see, when the time is right
birds will fly at your face.
Wuwhuhuhuhuah!
Run

Jump
I can be your backpack while you run!
Swing from a hairy vine.
I can be your backpack while you climb!
Stand on one hand and lift
rocks with your special gift
Run

Now breathe.
That's good.
Yeah, like that.
Like that.
(Weehoo)
One day I was walkin' and I found this big log
And I rolled the log over and underneath was a tiny little stick,
and I was like, "That log had a child."

Hmmm
Listen boy, someday when you are older
you could get hit by a boulder.
While you're lyin' there screamin',
"Come help me please," the seagulls
HMM
Poke your knees!

Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha
Hmm hmm hmm hm ha hmm hm hm hm ha
Stop it now!
Hmm hah hmm hmm hmm hah hmm hmm ha
Hmm hmm hmm hm ha hmm hm hm hm ha
