Silt Pillow, thunderous sheet.
River depths abdicate a dream, so sweet.
A pitiless cretin tastes the sweat
dream echoes disparage skull walls
soured honey in a mouth agape
a sisyfus drunk and borne of bile
what draws such madness forth?
the frigid rest of a placid thirst
deepest sleep, bracken grows
umbiferous, languid shade.
human violence turns the gears
voices cry, no words form.
