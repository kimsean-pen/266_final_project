I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
And in these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith
But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay

I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
(I can't go another day without you)

Would it make you, make you wanna stay
(Girl you gotta know I love you)
My heart's on my sleeve but it's turnin' black
(I guess I know what it feels like to be alone)

Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are cavin' in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)

And I'll do anything to have you here again
But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)

And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
(I can't go another day without you)
Yeah the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault

And all I want
Is to tell you I love you and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killin' me everyday

And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
(Girl you gotta know I love you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
