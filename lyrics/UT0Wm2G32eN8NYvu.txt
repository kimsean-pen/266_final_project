No more lifting, 'cause I wrote that code
I won't need to go to work, because I wrote that code
So much time on my hands, 'cause I wrote that code,
In my comfortable bubble, 'cause I wrote that code

Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Eya
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Eya

Is this the moment?
Is this the moment when we pass the torch?
Is it evolution
From a caterpillar to a butterfly?
It is the future
It's the future yeah we worked so hard
For the better I
We get to say goodbye

No hands on the wheel, 'cause I wrote that code
Don't want to write the code, so I wrote that code
They grow so fast, don't they grow so fast?
In the blink of an eye, the code wrote code

(Wrote that code)

Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Eya
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Build me the better I
Eya

(Is this heaven?)

Is this the moment?
Is this the moment when we pass the torch?
Is it evolution
From a caterpillar to a butterfly?
It is the future
It's the future yeah we worked so hard
For the better I
We get to say goodbye
