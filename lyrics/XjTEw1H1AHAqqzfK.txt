Your enemy swell from apparent voiced weakness
Propaganda offered on a plate you concede
Not wanting to face, obvious dangers
Turning your back, on rage and hatred

Naively evolving judgment, placing blame where you can
Human nature eludes you, unaffected by others actions
Innocent analysis, simple view of the world
Ideological objectives, priority over conflict

Burying your head in sand, safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat, you contradict
The way the world should be, hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail, no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared, the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize, daring to defy your peril

Bewilderment abundant
Among rational witnesses
Marginalizing treats, doesn't make the less bona fide
Pandering your platitudes
To a furious adversary, cowering to enemies builds consensus
Obsessed in the belief

Unfathomable viewpoint, needing others' adoration
Mystifying concept, compassion keeps you secure

Baffling contemplation, saying please gets results
Adolescent notion that philosophy disarms

The conscientious objector, preaching to the populace
The pacifist religion, perception of the immature
The antiwar constitutes, bowing to their dogma
The indoctrinating mentors, seeding the inexperienced
Hijack your defense, expose vulnerability
The vice of beseeching, gratification in frailty
Further spreading support of vacating campaigns
No burden to explain your puzzling outlook
Must have confidence-in their sincerity
You have assurance-the enemy is harmless
They are trustworthy-despite the wickedness
It's an illusion

Why defend yourself through dialogue is power
Stated goal your death, room for compromising
Start with concession, surrendering advantage
Conceding any guilt irrelevant of fact

Open hand of peace, commence cooperation
No need for caution, now that we are affable
All historical grievance, wiped away over night
Astonished by attack, considering harmony

Burying your head in sand, safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat, you contradict
The way the world should be, hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail, no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared, the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize, daring to defy your peril
