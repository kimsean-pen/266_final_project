The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it
Push too far you'll see
The kid has got a darkside
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it's the
Last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a darkside
That you don't wanna meet at all

They always picked
On him in the class
He would wake up
With anxiety attacks
So he put a semi-automatic
On his back
He got murder in his eyes
He wore the silence like a mask
Now he's making up for
All the violence in his past
Took it from his father
Who never bothered to ask
What his son had on his mind

The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it
Push too far you'll see
The kid has got a darkside
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it's
The last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a darkside
That you don't wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-

The kid has got a darkside
La la la la la

He never went to check under his bed
He was living with the
Monsters in his head
Sick of getting beat up
He listened, what they said
Told him do some very bad things
And when the time comes
That he count to ten
Ain't nobody ever gon' fuck
With him again
Feeling all alone, i
t was him against them
Decided when the lunch bell rings
That he'll sing

The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it
Push too far you'll see
The kid has got a darkside
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a darkside
Best believe it's the last
Trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a darkside
That you don't wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-

The kid has got a darkside
La la la la la

You can't run, you can't hide
You can't run, you can't hide
Someone let me off this ride
You can't run, you can't hide
The kid has got a darkside
The kid has got a darkside
The kid has got a darkside
