She's got no money to bet
But she could be a bookie
She's got no fame yet
But she could sing her boogie

She's hiding all her bubblegum
Looking for a real chum
She knows more than anyone
That her day will come
Her day will come

She's got an old mobile
But could receive calls
She's got a pretty smile
But no one gives a hand
When she falls down

She's hiding all her bubblegum
Looking for a real chum
She knows more than anyone
That her day will come
Her day will come

She's got a pretty face
Just waiting a kiss
She's got her own charm
But she's never been on the hot list

Hiding all her bubblegum
Looking for a real chum
She knows more than anyone
That her day will come
Her day will come

She likes brown with blue
like fixing things with glue
She likes old socks
Like talking all rock.
She likes permanent pen
Likes sleeping at ten
To wake and watch the sun while she...

She chooses her bubblegum
Looking for a real chum
She knows more than anyone
That her day will come
Her day will come

She's got a pretty face
Just waiting for a kiss
She's got her own charm
But never been on the hot list

She's hiding all her bubblegum
She's Looking for a real chum
But she knows more than anyone
That her day will come
