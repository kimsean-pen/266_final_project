Thrashing of the bones
I can never sleep
I wish that I could pay someone to care for me
Honestly...

Girls of the world leave me room to breathe
When you think about me do it in your sleep
Privately...

Death is in the air
It's hotter than you'd think
I wish that I could pay a friend to buy me drinks

Sad to be alive and when I'm by your side
In my heart and eyes we're connected mind to mind
Together

Visions of your chest
Shadow of the past
Esoteric fragments of a spell I cast

Heavy on wine
The comfort of a bed
Things I find myself drawn to in times of stress
Life subservient to conflict and to death
Final breath

Sad to be alive and when I'm by your side
In my heart and eyes we're connected mind to mind
Together
