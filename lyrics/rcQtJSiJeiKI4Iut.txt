My little grasshopper airplane
Cannot fly very high
I find you so far from my sight
I'm lost in my old green light
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell me your name
Just let me say
Who am I
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell me your name
Just let me say
Who am I

A big white plastic finger
Surrounds my dark green hair
But it's not your unknown right hand, oh oh
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell me your name
Just let me say
Who am I
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell me your name
Just let me say
Who am I

I am the sun, the darkness
My name is green wave
Death, salt, South American is my name
World is my name, my size
And under my name hear am I
My little grasshopper airplane
Cannot fly very high
