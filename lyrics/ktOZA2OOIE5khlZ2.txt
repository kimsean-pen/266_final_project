We're like a boat drifting
In a lonely sea
And the stars and moon shine
Down on me

Down, down the river we go
Holding on for dear life
To the last stick of the raft
For we do love
And he tried to be brave
Through each and every tear
And the only warmth
Is the warmth of their bodies

We're like a boat drifting
In a lonely sea
And I start to cry
I need nothing but you
I wish I could be beautiful for you
But I feel as shallow as steel
No words are hollow enough
For how I feel
