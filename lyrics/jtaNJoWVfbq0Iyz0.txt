Reaching my limit for the night
Your touch is keeping me alive
We can keep it on the low I'm like no one you've ever known
When you gone read between the lines
Take me way up I don't need no reasons Wanna take the time with you
To go the extra mile or two
You got me so gone
Drunk on your attention
I've been waiting all night with something you might like
I could make it worth your time time
I could make it worth your time baby
I could make it worth your time
Tell me why we keep on waiting
I could make it worth your time time
I could make it worth your time baby
I could make it worth your time time
Give up all night if it's me your feeling
I'm just too good and honestly
I wanna feel you next to me
Face to face won't let you go
Make it unforgettable
I'll show you how it's meant to be
