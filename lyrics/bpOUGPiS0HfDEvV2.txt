Am I too desperate, too caught up in all the noise?
Do I mean nothing, another angry voice?
Did I even have a choice? Did I only make things worse?
Am I just another angry voice?
Then I hear the heart sing...
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh) then I hear the heart sing
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh)

Do you remember me after the lights go out?
Will you remember me after the sun goes down?
Will you remember me after the lights go out?
Will you remember me after the sun goes down and down and down?!

And when I'm worried then I'll look up to
the satellites and hear them call your name
Then I know I can't be the only
star in the world that's trying to burn
So look up to the satellites and hear them call your name
They're singing
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh)
I know that I'm never alone
(Hey-Hey-aohaoh-aohaoh-aohaohhhh)
