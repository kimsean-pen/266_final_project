Hanging dark in the Walmart lot Waiting for you
The black top wave The interstate that drags you
My obsessions Teach me lessons I'm always waiting for you
The Drugs we take Play with our fate I love you
Your mother hates you Your father bates you I'm surprised you take it
Here's my message to mom Here's my
pleading to god We might not make it home
These hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
These hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
Leaving home The cold north calls, Would you go with me?
I've seen too much around here I know how's it's going to be
Kiss the crescent moon You're my
best friend Soon I will be lying in snow
You don't want to go Roads we take The Plans we make I leave you
Your mother hates you You father bates you I'm surprised you take it
Here's my message to mom Here's my
pleading to god We might not make it home
These sorrow days These hollow days I miss you
These sorrow days These hollow days I miss you
Your mother hates you Your father bates you I'm surprised you take it
Here's my message to mom Here's my
pleading to god We might not make it home
These hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
These hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
These hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
Hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
Hollow days These sorrow days
Hollow days These sorrow days
Hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
Hollow days These sorrow days I miss you
