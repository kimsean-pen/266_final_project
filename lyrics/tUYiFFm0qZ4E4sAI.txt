If a boy had a chance, a chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart, let him cry for the moon?
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(In those eyes)

I just freeze every time you see through me (see through)
And it's all over you, electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me, baby
Tell me, what can I do?
Electric blue

Oh, I had a dream, for a moment I believed it was true
Oh, I'd have given anything just to be there with you
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(In those eyes)

I just freeze every time you see through me (see through)
And it's all over you, electric blue (in too deep)
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two, electric blue (I can see)
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me, baby
Tell me, what can I do?
Electric blue

Help me, baby!

Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?

I just freeze every time you see through me (see through)
And it's all over you, electric blue (in too deep)
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two (in two), electric blue (I can see)
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you (of you), electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me, baby
Tell me, what can I do?
Electric blue

Electric blue
