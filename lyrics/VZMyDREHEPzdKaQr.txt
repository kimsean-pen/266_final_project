I don't need a whole lot o' money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything that a girl could want
I got more than, than I could ask for

I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I've got a sweet, sweet lovin' man
And he knows just how to treat me right

See, my baby
He's alright
See, my baby
We're so tight

Don't you know he is, some kind of wonderful
Yes, he is
He's some kind of wonderful
Don't you know he is, some kind of wonderful

Hold it, let me tell you one more thing

Now, when he holds me in his arms
He sets my soul on fire
And, ooh, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire

When he wraps his loving arms around me
He almost drives me out of my mind
I get these funny little feelings inside of me
Chills run up and down my spine

My baby
He's alright
Me and my baby
We're so tight

Don't you know he is, some kind of wonderful
Yes, he is
Some kinda wonderful
He is some kind of wonderful

Now, hold on, let me know just one more thing
Is there anybody out there
With a sweet loving man like mine?
There's got to be somebody with a sweet, loving man like mine

Now, tell me ladies (Can I get a witness)
Can I get a witness up in here, ladies? (Can I get a witness)
Can I get a witness (Can I get a witness)
Do you know what I'm talkin' about,
ladies, are you listening? (Can I get a witness)

Wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful
