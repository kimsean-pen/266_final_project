So you had the best legs in a business built for kicks,
but was this changing of the guards really supposed to make you sick?
It's alright... The Sublimation Hour!
Medium Rotation, the Shock of the New,
and a memo from Feldman saying, "everything is true."
It's alright... The Sublimation Hour!

Don't spend your life conceiving
that the widows won't get sick of their grieving
'till everyone walks out.
Hey, isn't that what rock 'n' roll is all about, Princess?
Express your bloated self, willful and indignant,
in the face of somebody's lord!

You try to summon up the spirits live on Face the Nation,
but the Port Authority just taxed incantations.
It's alright... The Sublimate Hour!
Auction off The Temple. It's money well-spent.
Hey, are those tears in your eyes as the wind cries, "enlargement"?
It's alright... The Sublimate Hour!

Don't spend your life conceiving
that the widows won't get sick of their grieving
'till everyone walks out.
Hey, isn't that what rock 'n' roll is all about, Princess?
Confess your bloated self, willful and indignant,
in the face of somebody's lord!

So put your hands together! I hear it's a must
until this phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust.
It's alright... The Sublimation Hour!
I guess the streets will suffice till everybody makes nice,
but there's a rumor going round even Destroyers have a price...
It's alright... The Sublimation Hour!

Don't spend your life conceiving...
