Waiting for a beam
To break through here
A chain way vision
All bright and clear

And they talk
And they dance

I was expecting something pure
With a golden hair
Arms full of bracelets
And smoke in the air

And they talk
And they dance

Here comes darkness
Just afternoon
Waiting for a sign
If I survive I'll worship the moon
Or something
Anything

This must be it
Long for bliss
First it was so quiet
Now I know I'm not alone in here
And they talked,
And they danced

Two omens collide in my open hand
Making me a viewer
I am what I have seen

And they talk
And they dance

Your hand on my hips
Speak friendly to me
I've been studying for years
Patiently
Is this as far as you can take me?

This must be it
Long for bliss
First it was so quiet
Now I know I'm not alone in here
And they talked,
And they danced

This must be it
Long for bliss
First it was so quiet
Now I know I'm not alone in here
And they talked,
And they danced

This must be it
Long for bliss
First it was so quiet
Now I know I'm not alone in here

This must be it
Long for bliss
First it was so quiet
Now I know I'm not alone in here
And they talked,
And they danced
