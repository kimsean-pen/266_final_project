Mournful cries are in my mind
In this stormy winternight
Paint a shadow on my heart
A black cloud rains over me

See, this is me, no pleasure to see
Still the dark cloud is surrounding me
Scared, to be a different kind of my own
And the storm is raging on and on

Cold winternight – no way out of the dark
No one's leading me back – to the place I belong

Tried to breathe in rays of light
I can't be without my winternight

See, this is me, no pleasure to see
Still the dark cloud is surrounding me
Scared, to be a different kind of my own
And the storm is raging on and on

Cold winternight – no way out of the dark
No one's leading me back – to the place I belong
Uncovered secrets – will never be found
No rebirth, no regrets – never be the one to hold

Cold winternight – no way out of the dark
No one's leading me back – to the place I belong
Uncovered secrets – will never be found
No rebirth, no regrets – never be the one to hold
