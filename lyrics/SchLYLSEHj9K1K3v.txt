Space monkey in the place to be
Riding in a rocket to a planet of sound
Shooting the moon, playing dominoes in drag
An increase in population of a hundred percent

Space monkey in the place to be
With a chemical peel and a picture of Mary
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundred degrees

We're sown together
Shes born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her

Space monkey in the place to be
A mass of contradictions in a golden frame
Raising the roof in a calamity way
Completely meretricious of a poke in the eye

Space monkey in the place to be
Talk of the town with Columbian rock
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundred degrees

We're sown together
Shes born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her

It's far too sacred
Dont ever fake it
And don't, don't
Dont let me down

Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before

Space monkey in the place to be
With some free-association and a hole in her head
Out on a limb in the carnival of me
Raising the temperature one hundred degrees

We're sown together
Shes born to mesmer
Beside, astride her
I die inside her
It's far too sacred
Dont ever fake it
And don't, don't
Don't let me down
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before
Like you let me down before
