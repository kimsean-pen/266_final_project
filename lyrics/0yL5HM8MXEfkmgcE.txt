Words so secure screaming like an alarm.
Are you trying to wake me up.
Now what was that you were trying to pull.
Is it my arm.
I do believe you're trying to wake me up.

But could it be maybe.
It's not me sleeping.
Could it be maybe you awakening.

Sleep this time tonight.
Sleepwalk in the light.
Sleep this time tonight.
Sleepwalk out of sight.

Now here I am, but I'm just sleepwalking.
Yes here I stand.
But I guess I'm just sleeptalking for myself.

But could it be maybe.
It's not me sleeping.
Could it be maybe you awakening.

Sleep this time tonight.
Sleepwalk in the light.
Sleep this time tonight.
Sleepwalk out of sight.

One day this world will see me at the horizon.
One day from a distant light.
And just before I stand to face my love.
I'll turn around.
And with a smile I'll say my goodbyes.
Just one last goodbye.
Goodbye.
