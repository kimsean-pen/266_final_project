With a left twist and a flick of my wrist
There's a drink poured, oh I know you want more
You want more
You say tilt that bottle all the way up
Till you can't see the bottom of your cup
Of your cup

I say hold on, just start with one
You look at me and say, that's no fun
No fun

Cuz you can't feel your feelings go away
With only one drink, it's been a long day
A long day

And then you say

You don't know me like you think you do
I pour me one when I really want two
Oh, you're living a lie
Living a lie

You think we're good, but we're really not
You could've fixed things, but you missed your shot

Oh, you're living a lie

Living a lie

With a right turn, the tires start to burn
I see your smile; it's been hiding for a while
For a while

Your foot pushes down against the ground
The world starts to blur
Can't remember who you were
Who you were

I yell slow down, we're almost out of town
The road gets rough, have you had enough
enough

You look at me, start heading for a tree
I open up the door, can't take anymore
Anymore

And then I say

You don't know me like you think you do
I pour me one when I really want two
Oh you're living a lie
Living a lie

You think we're good but we're really not
You could have fixed things but you missed your shot
Oh you're living a lie,
Living a lie

And then you say
You don't know me like you think you do
Pour me one, when I really want two

Oh, you're living a lie
Living a lie
You think we're good but we're really not
Coulda fixed things but you missed your shot

Oh you're living a lie
Living a lie
