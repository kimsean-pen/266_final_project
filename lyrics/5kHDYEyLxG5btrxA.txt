(We got some dancing to do)

I wanna be dancing
Too cool for school
When I'm alone I like to break the rules
I wanna go faster
Can't waste no time
Let's get on down
And let me blow your mind, so

Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
I give you turning when you play with me baby
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Cos a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

Set it off now
And do your thing
Bring me low
And let the record spin
So give me lovin'
Till I explode
Do the move
Until I lose control

So clap your hands and sing this now
Cos you know where the party's at
It's time to let your feelings show
Ready, steady, come on let's go

Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
I give you turning when you play with me baby
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Love me
(Down love, boogie down love)
Cos a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

I wanna go faster
Can't waste no time
I wanna go faster
Let me blow your mind
Love me
I wanna go faster
Love me
Can't waste no time
Love me
I wanna go faster
Love me
Let me blow your mind
