Night falls
With gravity
The earth turns
From sanity
Taking my on-
-ly friend I know
He leaves a lot
His name is Hope

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm
Glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near

When the sun is climbing
Windowsills
And the silver lining
Rides the hills
I will be saved
For one whole day
Until the sun makes the hills its grave

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside my mind.

Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on
Yeah I'll live
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on

I'm semi-automatic
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on
Yeah I'll live on...

By the time the night wears off
The dust is down
And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for
The night's return

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside

I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
'Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside my mind

Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo,
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo, d-d-doo
Doo, doo, doo
