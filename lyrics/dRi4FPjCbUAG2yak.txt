I don't mind your love girl
I don't mind the one you're thinkin' of
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind your love so soft
I don't mind, it can't go cold
I know, I know
You gonna miss me

I don't mind, it's the end of my song
I don't mind, goodbye, so long
I know, I said, "Baby I know
You gonna miss me"
