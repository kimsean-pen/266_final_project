A flooding slowly calms the restlessness
That's what it's like when I'm with you

Fire!
Candle burning dual flames
The void ignites again
Shapeshifter take us all the way
The devil is in the details baby
No one remains the same

With the mysteries in front of me
I drop my guard and you set me free
I plunge into the great unknown
Wired wrong
Come on!

They say this race spawn
Only losers in the long run
I know my heart can't take the strain
Right now it's pointless
To remind me of the preachers
I paint with different shades of gray

Fire away!
Dual flames meet clashing shadows
Master any space
Easy on the crush
Pendulumswingingdoomsdayhoney
Changer of wars

With the mysteries in front of me
I drop my guard and you set me free
I plunge into the great unknown
Wired! Wired! Wired! Strong!

Crash-land kings and queens
Take care by all means
