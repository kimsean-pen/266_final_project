I'll take you with me everywhere I go
From Edmonton down to Mexico
Let you know it's cool to follow your dreams
Because, kid, you mean everything to me
We're gonna ride our bikes or write a song
And everybody here can sing along
You saved my life and you're cooler than me
None of my friends would disagree yeah

I'll kill your goldfish if you don't brush your teeth
My love for you is deeper than a cavity
You can sleep with both the dogs at night
We can look for shooting stars and satellites
Let's go to the lake and fish all day
We'll use a Panther Martin or a Renegade
I'll try not to laugh when you start to cry
I'm 40 years old you're in Junior High

I'll never turn my back to you
I'll support most everything you do
I'll yell till you get your homework done
I'll keep an eye out when you're playing with your pellet gun
I'm not gonna let you have a phone
I'll show you Minor Threat, Talking Heads, and Methadones
I'll try to be as patient as I can be
Because, kid, you mean everything to me

I'll never turn my back to you
I'll support most everything you do
I'll yell till you get your homework done
I'll keep an eye out when you're playing with your pellet gun
I'm not gonna let you have a phone
I'll show you Minor Threat, Talking Heads, and Methadones
I'll try to be as patient as I can be
Because, kid, you mean everything to me
