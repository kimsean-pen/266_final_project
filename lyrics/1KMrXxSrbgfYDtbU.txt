Plus she's down, plus I smoke the boof
When I lay back, I send a couple through
Pew, pew pew

Tote 22, Baby lick the pew
Call me Gleeshie Pew

Aye (Check, check)
Check me out, dawg
Dogs on me when I'm walking through the house, dawg
223 bullet, they hitting through the house, dawg
Bought 50 guns, hid it in the house, dawg
Go crazy on lil folks but lil folks faking
I tote daily, give a fuck if them folks chase me
No Twitter, Instagram, no commas, I'ma catch 'em later
Bullets hit your truck up, escalade your escalador
I'm show stopping, bullets hit your show, I'm so childish
I'm not stoppin, bullet keep going, it's not stopping
Hot pop out in your chest now and your heart stopping
Hop scotching on the block like a lost caution
Somebody, anybody, but a dead body
Hop out the rari, you know you looking scared, shawty
Hot boxing nigga's whips when the dogs barking
How 'bout it, lil shawty? Yeah, how 'bout it?
