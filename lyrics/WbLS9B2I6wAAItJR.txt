We are the victims but we are also the crime
And the only one who can judge us is the earth in time

I will show you more, a discovery
Beyond what you perceive
As you're tangled in thought, believe
And let your soul unleash
We're well on our way but they lead us astray
Perpetuate with distractions
As far as we've made only as one we can save humanity

The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded
Heartache will stem from fear

Ultimately the choice is up to you (the choice is up to you)
But in the end disbelief can't be denied can not be refused

They tremble in fear in the undercover sanctuary
And the walls disguise despair in the undercover sanctuary

I will show you more, we're uncovering
Let your soul unleash

The absence of what you hold dear it'll leave you stranded
Heartache will stem from fear

We are the victims but we are also the crime
And the only one who can judge us is the earth in time

We are victims yet we are the crime
And the only one who can judge us is the earth
