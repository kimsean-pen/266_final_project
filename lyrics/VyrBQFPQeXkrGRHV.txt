Too heavy a burden to drag behind
Given through your commitments
Figting against is a waste of your time
Accept your role and die

Fulfil all of the requests
One should never complain
Forgive all the mistakes
Your own management makes

All alone you must wade
Find your ways to survive
Crawl and kneel to succeed
Waste your life and get killed
Get yourself promoted again
Widen the scope of slavery
Extend the given trust
Exploit and be exploited

Fulfil all of the requests
One should never complain
Forgive all of the mistakes
Your own management makes
All alone you must wade
Find your ways to survive
Crawl and kneel to succeed
Waste your life and get killed

Die
Rot
Decay

Too heavy a burden to drag behind
Given through your commitments
Fighting against is waste of your time
Accept your role and prepare to die
