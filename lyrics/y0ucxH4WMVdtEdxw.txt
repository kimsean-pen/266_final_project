The heater's on
The windows are thin
I'm trying hard to keep this warmth in

I turn to her, she's sound asleep
Someplace I don't know
Doesn't matter how far you've come
You've always got further to go

I tried to tell you, yeah
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet, quiet heart

Two hours on
My eyes are open
There's bad blood between us

And what did I say that made you cry?
Our dream won't die
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

I tried to tell you, yeah
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your quiet, quiet, quiet heart

What is that light? That small red light
Scorpio rising
Doesn't matter how far you come
You've always got further to go

I tried to tell you, yeah
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss your heart

I, I tried to tell her, yeah
I can only say it when we're apart
About this storm inside of me
And how I miss her quiet, quiet, quiet heart
