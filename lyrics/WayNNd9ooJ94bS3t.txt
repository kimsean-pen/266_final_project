Party to party
I can't get you off me
Off of my chest
Out of my head
God I'm a mess, babe

You used to want me
And my heart pisses me of si
Glad you way in
Under my skin
Came and you went yeah

20-20 vision
See it from a distance
Everything is different now

That's in the beginning
Thought you was the ending
Wanna start again

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, think of you when I'm with him
I, think of you when I'm with him

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, let it came my condition
Wanna go into a mission
I wish that I could
But I don't know how to

I get your heartbeat
Straight through without me
Into my veins
Into my brain
Baby, you change me

20-20 vision
See it from a distance
Everything is different now

I don't want a relapse
Don't want to want you back
Gotta start again

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, think of you when I'm with him
I, think of you when I'm with him

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, let it came my condition
Wanna go into a mission
I wish that I could
But I don't know how to

I could feel better by now
But I don't even know myself
Tell me how to be somebody else
Still a slave to the way I felt

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, think of you when I'm with him
I, think of you when I'm with him

But I don't know how to
Get you out of my system
I, let it came my condition
Wanna go into a mission
I wish that I could
But I don't know how to
