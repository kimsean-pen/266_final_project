Maybe just a dead sign speaking to my eyes shaking - I can think of
A piece of broken fifth hand reaching to my head falling - I can think of
Closing my eyes tight, I can hear the sounds of my fellows

They are sounding so cold
They are sounding so cold

"Maybe just a ghost", you say and forget about it - I stopped talking
Then a piece of cracked tooth talking to my nail stinging - I can snatch out

So cold
Lost parts, they are stinging me so cold
I know where they live in the past

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost - shoot! - but I got a miss shot

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down, they stay in my footsteps

Maybe just a red dot attacking to my toe tender - I can think of
Some forgotten small seeds singing to my ear, scratchy

They are sounding so cold
Lost parts, they are stinging me so cold
I know they live in the past

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost - shoot! - But I got a miss shot

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down, they stay in my footsteps
I gave up and then put the gun down

It's maybe just a piece of lost dead past
Fallen from the trash can forgettable
Creeping, trying to find a space to be
Kind of a piece of puzzle never been solved
Fifty thousands footsteps still going on
No place to be - I can think of
Closing my eyes tight
I can feel them 'cause they are my fellows

Lived in the past, loved in the past
Used in the past, lost in the past
Where will they go
Instead of my pride?

They are sounding so cold
So cold, lost parts, they are stinging me so cold
I know they live in the past

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost - shoot! - but I got a miss shot

Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down, they stay in my footsteps
I gave up and then put the gun down
