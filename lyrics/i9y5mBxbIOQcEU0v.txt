My thoughts take me downtown
change up at the turnstile
go blind in the traffic
i go about it the wrong way
so what

see both pennies landed
they jumped where the sky scrapes
one's heads
one's blind
I'm yours
and you're over
now change

get caught on the weak end
you're gone and now we fade
your mind makes me nervous
your thoughts make me feel bad
it's all right
it's all right

shake shake shake shake
shake shake
the clouds out
shake shake
the stars down
shake shake
it downtown

I brace myself
to fall in place
over you
over you

shake shake shake shake
shake shake
the clouds out
shake shake
the stars down
shake shake
it downtown

now you can see yourself

so what
it's alright
so what
it's alright
