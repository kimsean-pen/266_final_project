And
In this context, there's no disrespect
So, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect

Obstacles are inefficient
Follow your intuition, free your inner soul
And break away from tradition
'Cause when we beat out, girl it's pullin' without
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
We burn it 'til it's burned out
Turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

Lose control of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Ya'll hear a body, two peices to it
Get started, get stupid
You'll want me body people will walk you through it
Step by step, like you're into new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Trench men hits, with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

At the gate, we'll bring the bud top drill (Just)
Lose your mind this is the time
Ya'll can't stand still
Just and bang your spine (Just)
Bop your head like epilepsy
Up inside your club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
Ya'll mount past slow mo in another head trip (So)
