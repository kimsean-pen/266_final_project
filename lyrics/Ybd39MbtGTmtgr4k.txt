She's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town
Took her mother's eye
Stole her mother's heart
It's a compromise

We nurture that part and she's gone
Says she can walk now
Says she can walk now
Thinks she can walk
Seen her walking
She totters and falls
And when I'm not looking
Leans onto the wall
And she'll hold on to me only when she wants
And she'll fall and be up again
It's part of the fun
But she's gone
Thinks she can walk now
Thinks she can walk now
Thinks she can walk

She's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town
Took her mother's eye
Stole her mother's heart
It's a compromise

We nurture that part and she's gone
And it's quiet now
Took her mother with her
Left town
