A nuclear storm breaches the post
A shimmering light fades in the morning
Poisoned hearts desperate hopes
Will appear without a warning

Heavens alive, heavens alive
The sky is burning

Colors grey nothing to say
As we hide underground
Concrete bunkers don't make a sound
Nomadic flashes burn on the ground

Heavens alive, heavens alive
The sky is burning
This is the end, nobody's crying
I realize I realize
There's no returning
This is the end, we're all dying
Immortalized, immortalized
The world is burning
This is the end, nobody's crying
Immortalized, immortalized
The world is burning
This is the end, we're all dying

In your eyes I can see
How the world used to be
Fragile hearts minds and souls
Please don't let tomorrow go

This is the end, nobody's crying
Heavens alive, heavens alive
This is the end, we're all dying
I realize I realize
This is the end, nobody's crying
Immortalized, immortalized
This is the end, we're all dying
Immortalized, immortalized
