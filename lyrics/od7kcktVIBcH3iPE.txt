Light as day
Into the garden
Silent days
Fallen shadows
Watching your world
By the fire
By daylight
See the stars

Play the part
Take a name
Burn a house
Tear this
Wondering
You wonder if it's fine
Or if it's just nothing

Light as day
Sweet smile
Tears like gold
Watching the night
You're my nightmare
And my dream
Silent storm
Waiting for me

Straight down the line
Come baby
Just start the engine
And hit the freeway
