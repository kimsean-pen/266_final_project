The phone shudders, tab the ringer mute
The annual reopening of wounds
Of a heart poured into the desert
And its address book of ghosts
Turn and walk away from the crater lip
And hope the desert dries your heart
Pat the ground flat and then close the door
From inside the burning mirage

The desert does not remember
The desert does not care
I can only see this moment
Through a veil of flames
As I cut away at the filaments
That tie me to others lives
It was someone else's loss
And has nothing to do with me, now

Aphasic thunder flickers behind a long flat of grey
Swirling dazzles of amber spin crumbling memories
