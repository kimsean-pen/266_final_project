Why don't I get you
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues
Why am I confused
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues

Every other time
I was there for you
Every other time
I was right on cue

But I just don't get you

Why don't I get you
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues
Why am I confused
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues

Every other time
I was there for you
Every other time
I was right on cue

But I just don't get you

Why don't I get you
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues
Why am I confused
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues

Every other time

Why don't I get you
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues

Every other time

Why am I confused
I listen to soul, babe
I listen to blues
