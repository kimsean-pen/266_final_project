Stop
Don't tell me how to feel
These scars will never heal
Overnight
I'm just searching for what's real
It's hard enough to deal
With life

Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me, get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars
(Heart full of scars)

You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you'd say
I'm not living for yesterday
(Heart full of scars)
I've figured out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend, not break
A full life is give not take
(Heart full of scars)

Done with doubt and overthinking
Wait for it to sink in
I'm enough
Sick of try'na to be your perfect
The pain is never worth it
Never was

Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me, get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars
(Heart full of scars)

You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you'd say
I'm not living for yesterday
(Heart full of scars)
I've figured out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend, not break
A full life is give not take
(Heart full of scars)

O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh

(Heart full of scars)
(Heart full of scars)

You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you'd say
I'm not living for yesterday
(Heart full of scars)
I've figured out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend, not break
A full life is give not take
(Heart full of scars)
