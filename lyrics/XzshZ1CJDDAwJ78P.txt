Speed demon spread thy shanks wide
Shower offense! Defile
Citadel pure desires' vice
Damnation nigh Behemoths feast
Old bloodlines die -
Warrior caste feed raging beast
Hear the roar of battle-horn. To War!

Dread Reavers rise from dismal mist
Ghouls emerge - Catalyst
Form jagged, spike - studded fist
Lean years breed - a skeletal corps
Deviant yield - Omnivore
Tide devour craven shore
To battlefield stream the warm. To War!

Mephitic mob - torch the havens
Chew the ribs of temple-maidens
Blackened babes - hung on high
Nourish the hawks circling sky
Talons to flesh - a hook-beak strips
Long pig to shreds - tongue from lips
Wild Reavers pledge - their guts to pour
Blizzard kin Raise the skulls.

Talisman shield - the sowrd our prophesy
Grail Quest - benighted destiny
War paths - must terminate in blood
Pit erupt - spray ochre upon the mud.

Plague Weavers spread Y-pestis far
Thin armoured ranks
Marauders close - Decimate guard
Hammer blade on anvil forge
Hel know our name
Wade knee deep - in sod of fore
Once more unto the breach. To War.
