Locked myself out can't find the key
Everyone is inside except for me
Wait, I can see your face in the darkest places
Wait, I can't see myself I'm too far away
I can feel the water running down my back
As I'm drowning in the rain down this broken path
Hang tight we'll shed our skin after daylight
Nothing matters at night I think everything will be alright
Lifetime flashing before my eyes
I still can't see the sunlight
But I can see your face
