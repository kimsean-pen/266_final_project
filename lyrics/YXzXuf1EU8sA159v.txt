All alone
I must stand
Even when I'm running
And it feels
Like a dream
I need to awaken from

I believe
When it hurts
We must keep on trying
But I want
And I need
Like a river needs the rain

There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just wanna breathe again
Like a summer's day, I need to feel the heat again

I only wanna keep the stone from rolling
I only wanna learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I wanna be alive again

Here's the night
Where's the stars
'Cause I need some guiding
And it cuts
Like a knife
As I watch you walk away

There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just wanna live again
Like a stormy rain I need to hear it beat again

I only wanna keep the stone from rolling
I only wanna learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I wanna be alive again
I wanna be alive again

'Cause I did my best
Baby who'd have guessed
That I'd fail the test
'Cause when love ain't blessed
And it's laid to rest
It can leave a mess

I only wanna keep the stone from rolling
I only wanna learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame
I only wanna keep the stone from rolling
I only wanna learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame
