Bite the thorn that pierces the skin
Come back down to Earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
You disconnect the telephone lines
Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Got to get away before the Lord calls me to stay
All that I know should've been, could've been mine

I killed the last way out of this
Persuaded by a deceitful kiss
That said you better stay, said you better stay, better stay
Said you better stay before it's all gone, gone away
All that I know should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine

Bite the thorn that pierces the skin
Come back down to Earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
You disconnect the telephone line
Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Got to get away before I lose my mind
They said you better stay, said you better stay, better stay
Said you better stay before it's all gone, gone away
All that I know should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine
And for all that I know
Should've been, could've been mine
