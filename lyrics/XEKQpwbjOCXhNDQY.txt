Sugar baby love, sugar baby love
I didn't mean to make you blue
Sugar baby love, sugar baby love
I didn't mean to hurt you
All lovers make
Make the same mistakes
Yes they do
Yes, all lovers make
Make the same mistakes
As me and you

Sugar baby love, sugar baby love
I didn't mean to make you blue
Sugar baby love, sugar baby love
People take my advice
If you love someone
Don't think twice
Love your baby love, sugar baby love
Love her anyway, love her ev'ryday
