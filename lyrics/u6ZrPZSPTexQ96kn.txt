Take your trick to Milly Lane I'm fucking what you think, hey
You see hatred in my eyes but peace is still my think, yah
Maybe I'm just 'fraid to pop this shit it's all the same
I'm a fucking [?] breathe inside my brain
[?] I gotta do this
So fluid I'm poolin from all of my moola
So savage so I gotta do this
I'll talk to [?] but y'all niggas are stupid
You think I give a fuck?
Hold onto your trust
I'm right behind you

I wanna see you run
I wanna see you run

Scarlxrd is a kid that got em [?] on his lap, ayy
All you niggas [?] right now I'm killing all these tracks, ayy
I might take a break from music then go hit my desk, ayy
Dougie in a pussy when I hit it from the back, yah yah
