Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in in a minute
Ayo this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin'
You're beginning to think women are swimmin in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and 'cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outter space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as you
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want
Whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal chord
So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls
Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every morning
But your young you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I would've did more shit that people said that I shouldnt
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done before I know it
I'll be forty with a forty on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really gotta hold on me
Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
Is drugs really gotta hold on me?

Drugs really got a hold on me
Really got a hold on me
'Cause drugs really got a hold on me
They really got a hold on me
