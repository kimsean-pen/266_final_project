You think I never see you when you jump over de wall
You think I never see you when you accidently fall
Me said a it mek, mek you pop yu bitta gall
A it mek, while you accidently fall
A it mek, hear she crying fe ice water

I check you out and you're cold, girl
I dig you out and you're cold, girl
Rock it to me children

I told you once and I told you twice
Wha' sweet nanny goat a go run him belly good
Me said a it mek, mek your pop yu bitta gall
A it mek, while you accidently fall
A it mek, hear she crying fe ice water

I check you out and you're cold, girl
I dig you out and you're cold, girl
Rock it to me children

I told you once and I told you twice
Wha' sweet nanny goat a go run him belly good
Me said a it mek, mek your pop yu bitta gall
A it mek, while you accidently fall
A it mek, hear she crying fe ice water
