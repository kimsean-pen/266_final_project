Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go
Round and round in circles like we've got no place to go

I've seen couple issues in the news that need discussing
But is there any point if they just keep repeating
Will this ever end
Questioning ourselves again now

Who says you can't sit here you can't come in
Wait that was back then
Eenie meanie minie mo
So who is next then?
Knocking us down one by one
look this game is not pretend
Why is this happening again?

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round in circles like we've got no place to go

I've seen too much news about abusing colour
we're all a canvas would you paint me red if I was darker?
Too much red's spilt
It's like you can't escape the history
What once was
Is now
Now just more eyes to see
We're all becoming too acquainted to these tainted lies
like it's normal to be stopped searched and end your life
If I saw Martin would he tell me that he's had a dream
But if he's dreaming I would rather let him stay asleep.

Coz it's round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round we go

Round and round in circles like we've got no place to go
