Life-exhaling sleep petrified in marbleized composure
As I drown in her calm breathing
I start to live beyond her notions
Faking balance - under wings of

Bright-inspiring dark
That is never to be brightened
Sphinx-like stupid I surrender
Poets comment poets never change
Paralyzed with sadness here I am

Carry me - anywhere and she'll be waiting
Let me be - resting by her patiently and
Maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
Agony - a promised word to save the silence

Life-inhaling sleep
And above me heavens full of roses
Full of orchids glittering in the moonlight
Dream-absorbing stars reflect in her eyes
Leave me very restless

Carry me - anywhere and she'll be waiting
Let me be - resting by her patiently and
Maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
Agony - a promised word to save the silence

Life-recovering sleep
Reveling in self-contained illusions
Illusive flowers obey the dawn
Is it my way ramifying before me
Paralyzed with sadness here I am

Carry me - anywhere and she'll be waiting
Let me be - resting by her patiently and
Maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
Agony - a promised word to save the silence

Anywhere and she'll be waiting
Let me be - resting by her patiently and
Maybe she - will shatter all the truth inside my
Agony - a promised word to save the silence
