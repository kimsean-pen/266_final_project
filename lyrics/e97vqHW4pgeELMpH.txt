The way that it's been going
I don't want anyone to know
The way that I've been thinking
I'm ashamed to let it show
The way that I've been spending
And all the money that I blow

The days are never ending, baby
I discovered long ago, oh, you know
I discovered long ago

I got ways to fake it
You'll never know
A million ways to fake it
No one will ever know
I got ways to fake it
You'll never know
A million ways to fake it
No one will ever know

The way that it's been looking
No one ever has to see
Seeing ain't believing nothing
No one ever knows it's me
I'll just keep pretending
I'm what you want me to be

Hope for happy endings, baby
No one gives it up for free, oh, you know
No one gives it up for free

I got ways to fake it
You'll never know
A million ways to fake it
No one will ever know
I got ways to fake it
You'll never know
A million ways to fake it
No one will ever know

And can you hear me say
There's another way
Can you hear me say
No one will ever know
