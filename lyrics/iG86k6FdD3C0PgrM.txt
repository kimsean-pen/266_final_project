A piece of me in your eyes
Reminds me of what's forgotten
I need to get closer to the fire
And feel my own reflection

A piece of me needs to die

A seed of the fatal kind
No roots to grow and and thrive
Some things weren't meant to stay alive
Aborted while still in mind

You gave me a sword to pierce the lie
Serrated edge for the demon inside
A moment I'm torn between two tides
But all I need I bear inside

Fear is a self-destructing fire
That burns what's dead and dry
Tears clean the wound that's left behind
When a shadow is forced to into light

You gave me a sword to pierce the lie
Serrated edge for the demon inside
A moment I'm torn between two tides
But all I need I bear inside

Broken mirror beauty divides
Though it's an illusion
It can cut like a knife

Don't try to give me
What I think I desire
It's mine to find

You gave me a sword to pierce the lie
Serrated edge for the demon inside
A moment I'm torn between two tides
But all I need I bear inside
