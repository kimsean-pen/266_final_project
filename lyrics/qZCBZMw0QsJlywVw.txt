Running in the parking lot, I'm four years old
I am lost, those were the days
Soft murmur of voices in the other room
Comforting you, as you fall asleep
Staring at the mother-daughter clones go by
We're in a race against time
And time might be winning

And it's not gonna take all day long
Watching the urban decay all around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark
How long must you wait
How long must this stay
Wake up I'm ashamed that there may have be sometimes
I might have used tricks to make you like me more
When I found you I was running wild
Let's get outta here, was in trouble there

I wanna know what are you thinking
'Cause I think, I think it too

Sliding across the Indian wildnerness
Like the wind, gliding down soft roads
6am and you're in Hollywood
And you're dancing, we made it
We are turning with the Earth so fast
That it feels a lot slower

And it's not gonna take all day long
Watching the urban decay all around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark
How long will it take
To fix what they break
Wake up Your Achilles heel is you like to feel
Your fingers on the wheel
Some live in the palace, some live in the sewers
The director, the actor, the crew and the viewers
Boys get their toys and girls get their dolls and
Nothing much else changes through the final stages
Are you spending the days the same
As your life and you're watching the time running away
Wait up Wake up
