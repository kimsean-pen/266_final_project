I just missed my exit
Last night I lost my keys
I'm fumbling over the words I
Don't feel a bit like me these days

I would be a liar if I said I was fine
But I can't help being honest
And I know now is not the time
'Cause

The truth is I'm fallin to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is the truth keeps slippin out

Can't seem to hide what I'm feelin

Can't believe what I'm sayin out loud
Truth is theres no turnin' back now
I guess I shoulda learned how to lie a little better.

Been trying to cover

This heart out on my sleeve

Been set on playing this down but
I think your catchin on to me.
The truth is I'm fallin to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is the truth keeps slippin out

Can't seem to hide what I'm feelin'
Can't believe what I'm sayin' out loud
Truth is theres no turnin' back now

Well, I guess I shoulda learned how to lie a little better.

I'm losing this battle
With every word I say
Wish I had a better lesson
Of not givin' myself away
'Cause
The truth is I'm fallin to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is the truth keeps slippin out
Can't seem to hide what I'm feelin
Can't believe what I'm sayin out loud
Truth is theres no turnin back now
Well, I guess I shoulda learned how to lie a little better.
