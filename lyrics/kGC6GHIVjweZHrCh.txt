Oh... oh oh oh... it's my first time
Oh... oh oh oh... please be kind
Oh... oh oh oh... don't hurt me
Oh... oh oh oh...
I met her last Friday
At the local dance
She was across the room
I caught her glance
We started dancing
And before you know
I took her to my place
Where we were alone and she said...
I didn't know what to say
Didn't want to hurt in anyway
I looked in those big brown eyes
Filled with tears she tried to hide... she said...
We felt so happy
We felt so fine
I don't think I'll ever forget the time... she said...
