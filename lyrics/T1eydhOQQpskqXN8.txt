Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world but
Don't want to be alone tonight
On this planet they call earth

You don't know about my past and
I don't have the future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

But what do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay

What do you say?
What do you say?

I just wanna start again
And maybe you could show me how to try
Maybe you could take me in
Somewhere underneath your skin

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay

What do you say?
What do you say?

And I've had my heart beaten down,
but I always come back for more, yeah
There's nothing like love to pull you up,
when you're lying down on the floor there
So talk to me, talk to me like lovers do
Yeah, walk with me, walk with me like lovers do, like lovers do

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay

What do you say?
What do you say?

Don't know much about your life
And I don't know much about your world
