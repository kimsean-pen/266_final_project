Silent restraint
Take comfort in the fall
In everything I gave you
Thank you, thank you all
I never quite forgave you
Fire away
We're made in simple forms
Taking cover in the way through
Falling to the floor
And begging me to stay true
Loveless escape
Silent restraint

How can I stay?
Not that I want to
How can I stay?
Not that I want you
How can I stay?
Not to get closer
How can I stay?
Now that it's over

Silent restraint
Take comfort in the fall
In everything I gave you
Thank you, thank you all
I never quite forgave you
Fire away
We're made in simple forms
Taking cover in the way through
Falling to the floor
And begging me to stay with you
All the way home
Loveless escape
Home
Silent restraint
Oh, home

How can I stay?
Not that I want to
How can I stay?
Not that I want you
How can I stay?
Not to get closer
How can I stay?
Now that it's over

How can I stay?
Not that I want to
How can I stay?
Not that I want you
How can I stay?
Not to get closer
How can I stay?
Now that it's over
