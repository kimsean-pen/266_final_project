Well I believe the closing scene
Is being told so close to me
I'm having trouble getting sleep
The devil dressed in blue

Well after all the enemies
Staring back inside of me
I wrote a tune so it seems
That convinced me to always sing

Well I am but a kitchen sink
The place to make the others clean
But you keep coming back to me
I've never felt so old

A dirty word, a venom seeps
A happy man, a fish to keep
As long as i can think
I really think I need to think

Angel wrestle me
Crack my sides to let me see
That if the end will set me free
They're sending me down below
Well I can feel the wooden hair
Creeping out your cross to bear
I never knew you actually cared
I'm such a simple fool

Well seventy months out at sea
I hope that you still think of me
As Jesus knows that I still think
About the way you murdered me

Seven demons out at sea
I hope that you still think of me
As Jesus knows that I still think
About the way you murdered me

Angel wrestle me
Crack my sides to let me see
That if the end will set me free
They're sending me down below
Well I can feel your wooden chair
Creeping out my cross to bear
I never knew you actually cared
I'm such a simple fool
