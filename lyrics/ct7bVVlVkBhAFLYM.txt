Ain't too sure what I believe in
But I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me

These are our hours (these are our hours...)
This is our time (this is our time...)
This is our time
These are our hours (these are our hours...)
Out on the verge
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives, the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

These are our hours (these are our hours...)
This is our time (this is our time...)
These are our hours (these are our hours...)
Out on the verge
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives...

Uh, yeah
(Rest of our lives)
From now on, there's no looking back
Full-steam ahead on this one-way track
From this day forth, I will make a promise
To be true to myself and always be honest

For the rest of my life
I will do what's right
I will do what's right
When I'm still out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed
To the nines tonight, top of the world
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives, the rest of our lives

Yeah, yeah
The rest of our lives
Edge of the Earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
