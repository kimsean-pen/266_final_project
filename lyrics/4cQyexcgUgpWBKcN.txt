Let's find a spot
Here under the stars
With nothing but sky
Between you and I

Oh, how the time seems to stop
With your face in my hands
With such trickery
See how it's flying away

And there's nothing I can do
But cling to you my love and thank the stars
I lived a dream with you

Oh, how my heart seems to stop
When you're here in my arms
With such trickery
See how it's flying away
And there's nothing i can do

I lived a dream with you
