Hey baby, won't you lie to me?
Oh darling, tell me, pretty please
Oh baby, baby, won't you tell me what I want to hear?
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone

'Bout those bitches, I don't wanna know
They think they love you, fuck those other hoes
They had you for a minute, just tell them you belong to me
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone

Your number one, I just wanna be your only love
To me, it's crystal clear, I'm in love and love is blind
I'm in love and love is blind

Cook you breakfast in my birthday suit
When you're sick, I'll cook you chicken soup
Just feed me, feed me the delicious lines I want to hear
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone

'Bout those bitches, I don't wanna know
They think they love you, fuck those other hoes
They had you for a minute, just tell them you belong to me
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me, don't leave me alone

Your number one, I just wanna be your only love
To me, it's crystal clear, I'm in love and love is blind
I'm in love and love is blind, blind, ah ah ah
Love is blind, ah ah ah ah, love is blind

I'm number one, original, the OG forever
Me say two, por vida y que, we'll be together
Me say three, call me your main bae
'Cause baby I'm your ruca and your hainna
You're my darling since it started
We gonna run it, stay one hundred
Keep it coming at this woman, creation
So pass the dutchess and give me those eyes
Pass the dutchie, got me hypnotized

Your number one, I just wanna be your only love
To me, it's crystal clear, I'm in love and love is blind
I'm in love and love is blind, blind, ah ah ah
Love is blind, ah ah ah ah, love is blind

Tell those bitches to go home
Tell them bitches to go home
