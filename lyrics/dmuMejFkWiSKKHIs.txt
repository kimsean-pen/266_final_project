While we drifted away
I missed it, missed it all
Caught up in everything
I meant well, but i didn't know how
Throw all caution to the wind
My friend, my eyes

And its been this way forever
It was sunrise when we started
Now the trees have grown all over
And the winter skies are lonely

There was something you said
I heard but I lied
It's beginning to fade
From my head, from my heart
And I'm back here again
Same thing, Same part

And its been this way forever
It was sunrise when we started
Now the trees have grown all over
And the winter skies are lonely

While we drifted away
I missed it, missed it all
Caught up in everything
I meant well but i didn't know how
Throw all caution to the wind
My friend, my eyes

And its been this way forever
It was sunrise when we started
Now the trees grown all over
And the winter skies are lonely
