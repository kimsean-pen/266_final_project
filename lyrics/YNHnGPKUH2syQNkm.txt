Cover up your shaky hands
I hear that you're doing well
Back again for long this time?
Looks like they put you all through hell
But you seem to be coping fine
Trust me, the stress will pass with time
And you'll be back around again
Yes, you'll be back again

I don't mean to make you curse
But it could have been much worse
And as far as I can tell
It seems that you're doing well

Come quick
Things worth seeing
Life-sick
We are leaving
Time framed
Changing season
Same, same
We are leaving

And I bet you constantly ask
"How did we get here so fast?"
And i have been here once before
All the dates they made me raw
Wait and weight, it's all the same
Sinking underneath the waves
Hell, it couldn't be much worse
Than diving in head first

I don't mean to make you curse
But it could have been much worse
And as far as I can tell
It seems that you're doing well

Come quick
Things worth seeing
Life-sick
We are leaving
Time framed
Changing season
Same, same
We are leaving here
