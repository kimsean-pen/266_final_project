So, are we heading outside?
It's a victory dance
Are you coming now?
Now the start is in sight
Now history sides with the common man Are you one of us?
Are you one of us?

I'm done with the creatures online There's more to this life
If you're honest now
Are you coming untied?
Are you one of us?

There's a baying crowd
And it's a call to account
It's a crying shame if you don't come And it's a call to account
And it's a crying shame if you don't come Are you with me?
Are you with me?
