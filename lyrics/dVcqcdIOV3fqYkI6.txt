Slow down, you move too fast
Never liked you working so hard
The devil's in heat and I got your minds made up

Way out along the path
Carried by love it's so hard
And now I want a reason why
Way to cut us out
Way to cut us out

If it wasn't for this life I would leave it
But oh I'd miss the sky and the sea
Damage to my eyes, I won't see it
Don't what you're missing in me
Don't what you're--
Oh I'd miss the sky and the sea
Damage to my eyes, I won't see it
Don't know what you're missing

I tried to save these words
Leave it to the rumors out there
I'm never gonna feel an eye
I want a mind made up

If it wasn't for this life I would leave it
But oh I'd miss the sky and the sea
Damage to my eyes, I won't see it
Don't what you're missing in me
Don't what you're
Oh I'd miss the sky and the sea
Damage to my eyes, I won't see it
Don't know what you're missing
