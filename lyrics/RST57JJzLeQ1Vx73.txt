There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave

I don't mean to seem like I
Care about material things
Like a social status
I just want
Four walls and adobe slats
For my girls
