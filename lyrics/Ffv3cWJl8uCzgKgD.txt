After the war
And now that they've sent us homeward
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own
No one can see
Just what this conflict has done to
The minds of the men who're on their way home

I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can I face the torment alone?
The vivid scenes
And all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light

People say don't worry
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're sayin'
I am living in my own world
And I'm feeling trance like all the time

I hear voices in my head
Could I really be going crazy?
In the night the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die?
When you laugh are you really cryin'
You're not sure what's real anymore

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore

Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Sometimes I wake
I feel that my spirit's broken
I wonder if I've the strength
Carry on
Carry on
