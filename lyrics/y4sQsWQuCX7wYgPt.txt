Roll the dice
Keep on guessing
Asking questions
One more time
Close the vice
Keep on pressing

Teach them a lesson
Hold the line
Don't let them through the door

Open any drawers

I promise officer
We haven't broken any laws

Well, not the bad ones
More, gimme more, I want more

Ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets

More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more until the breach

Cold as ice
Heavy heels
See through shield
Broken line

Shoulders high
Seal the deal
Spin the wheel

One more time
Don't let them through the door
Open any drawers
I promise officer

We haven't broken any laws

Well, not the bad ones
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets

More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more until the breach
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
One more last song
Don't let them through the door
Open any drawers
I promise officer
We haven't broken any laws
Well, not the bad ones
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more until the breach
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
One more last song
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more until the breach
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
More, gimme more, I want more
Ay, ay, ay
One more last song
One more last song
One more last song
One more last song
One more last song
