I don't wanna make you interested.
I just wanna make you the only one

I don't wanna ask myself forever
Why I didn't put myself together?
As soon as you appeared into my eyes

I don't wanna lose this (Don't wanna wait)
Quicker than a kiss (Not a second too late)
Wrap it like it mattered (Look what you did)
Being just one step from being well

I don't have any vocabulary
But I hear myself please go with me

Acting like six or seven
But I'm really close to heaven
I don't need to look further than your eyes

I don't wanna lose this (Don't wanna wait)
Quicker than a kiss (Not a second too late)
Wrap it like it mattered (Look what you did)
Being just one step from being well
