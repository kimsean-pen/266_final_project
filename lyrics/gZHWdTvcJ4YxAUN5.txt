Do you watch us in the dark
Do you see us in the night
We walk in the night
Our starlights aligned

Gathering, faith inside
The fear inside your bones reclaims its grasp
My ignited stars align
Illuminate the path that leads you back
Into my hands

We know your thoughts
The fear awakes us at night
All things can be rebuilt with time

Is all you want, to be alone?

In the forest & the cold
The night awaits your soul
I know you want to be alone
The night awaits your soul

The forest awaits
It's calling out your name
Our starlights aligned
We'll breathe the air tonight
& see the sun rise
