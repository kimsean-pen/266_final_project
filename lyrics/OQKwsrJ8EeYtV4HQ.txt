The sound waves of your voice make me swim
Through the storm in a form
I never knew about
It's so new, just like you in my life

But yet it feels like I've never lived before
Anything that's less turned into more
Everything I've loved but couldn't score
All I adore

I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me

The way you drive the road
Got my feet running fast with no despair
'Cause you make me believe
It could one day be me over there

But yet it feels like I've never lived before
Anything that's less turned into more
Everything I've loved but couldn't score
All I adore

I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me

Just the way to put it on me
