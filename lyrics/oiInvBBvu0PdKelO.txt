My legs are weary
But I still walk
My hands are sore and broken
But I still clutch
My heart is jaded
But I still love
My cup is empty
But I still pour

All I ever want to be
All I ever need to be
Was whatever you wanted me to
But you took that from me, yeah

I was never enough for you
I should have known
I should've known
I was never enough for you
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my

I've lost the feeling
But I still touch
I stopped believing
But I still trust

All I ever want to be
All I ever need to be
Was whatever you wanted me to
But you took that from me, yeah

I was never enough for you
I should have known
I should've known
I was never enough for you
Don't waste my time

All these questions, asking why?
I'll just close my eyes,(my eyes)
All these people, asking why?
I'll just wave goodbye,(goodbye)

Time, pushing forward
I'm sick and tired
Need a little shelter
Drag the glass across my eyes
Cut me open, cut me wide
Leave me for the winner
Just to the winner

I was never enough for you
I should have known
I should've known
I was never enough for you
Don't waste my time

I was never enough for you
Just wastin' time
Don't waste mine
