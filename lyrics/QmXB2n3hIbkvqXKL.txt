You know they call my girl the Snake Charmer
Here she comes rising with the yellow dawn
You know I would do nothing to ever harm her
I guess that I've just loved you for too long

You know they call my girl the Worm Tamer
She cracks lightning like a viper's tongue
She leaves me every night and who could blame her
I guess that I've just loved you for too long

For too long!

You know they call my girl the Serpent Wrangler
Eating inchworms down by the bill-a-bong
I spent all last night trying to untangle her
I guess that I've loved you for too long

You know they call my baby the Mambo Rider
I cry storms of tears till the rising of the dawn
You know I'm only happy when I'm inside her
I guess that I've just loved you for too long

Well my baby calls me the Loch Ness Monster
Two great big humps and then I'm gone
But actually I am the Abominable Snowman
I guess that I've loved you for too long
