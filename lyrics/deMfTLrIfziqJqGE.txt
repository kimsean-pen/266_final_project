Time after time
You could it once again
Cause you're doing fine
This is to show you
Just how much we need you in our lives
This place wouldn't be the same without you
You could say that it would be a little worse
There's just something about you
With you it's all worth
Oh, never did a one do so much to me
Oh, you've got some kind of hold on me
All the things that you do
You do it all so gracefully
Oh, never did a one do so much to me
Can we just stop?
It's our time to learn yourself to praise you
Cause we do it wrong
And you make it right
You bring the balance to our lives, you've done it all alone
This place wouldn't be the same without you
You can say that it had been a whole lot worse
Cause there's just something about you
And with you it's all worth
Never did a one do so much to me
Oh, you've got some kind of hold on me
All the things that you do
You do it all so gracefully
Oh, never did a one do so much to me
And I thought I should tell you
How loved you are
How loved you are
Just how loved you are
And if we are together
Oh, we're going far
We're going far
We're going far
And I thought I should tell you
How loved you are
How loved you are
Just how loved you are
And if we are together
We're going far
We're going far
We're going far
