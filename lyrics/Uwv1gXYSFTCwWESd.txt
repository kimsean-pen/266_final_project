The buttons on your collar
The colour of your hair
I think I see you everywhere
I want to live forever
And watch you dancing in the air
All the lies and make believe
The very things that one day leave
But I can see you standing in mid air
The girl I want to marry, upon the high trapeze
The day she fell and hurt her knees.

And only time can make you
The wind that blows away the leaves
For everything the life was worth
The fallen snow, the virgin birth
Yeah I can see you standing in mid air
I can see you standing in mid air
