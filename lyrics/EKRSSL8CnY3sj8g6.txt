Open road, no one stopped you from trying,
To lose you load, to find your silver lining.
You left my side, because mother let you run and hide,
But even from afar I hear you crying!

Let me out of this cage before I swell up with rage.
Let me sing to old age before I'm done.
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die,
And that fate will never stop me from trying.

Finally found, the dreaming lived, those ties unbound,
That quest for peace, that hopeless search for sweet release,
You found your feet, but now they only run to meet,
A hope that's hanging loosely, whilst you're crying.

Let me out of this cage before I swell up with rage.
Let me sing to old age before I'm done.
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die,
And that fate will never stop me from trying.

Open road, it will only lead back home,
It stole the heart, but your heart is still alone.
So take your time, mother let you run and hide,
Cos wisdom know the eyes through which you're crying.

Let me out of this cage before I swell up with rage.
Let me sing to old age before I'm done.
Let me shout to the skies that I'm too young to die,
And that fate will never stop me from trying.
