I'm in the mood to end these empty days
Ever when I, you stare down romancin'
Every time I see your face hopeless
Colder than ice with no more flame

I think our love has reached the part of no return
It's so sad when lovers don't see

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

That distant look is all you've got to say
Every time I try to talk to you
Every word is lost in space
Drifting further apart in every way

We've come to be the ones whose love is out of sight
It's so clear that we just don't see

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

There's no reason for this heartache
To go on and on when the feeling's gone
I can say now that it's to late
To try and change your mind

No tear, oh yeah
A look everyday, yeah
[Incomprehensible]
Eye to eye, I'm seeing
Eye to eye to just keep singing

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away
Eye to eye
