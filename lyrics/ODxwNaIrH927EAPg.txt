Lying low with your heartbeat
Kinda drunk on a side street
Like a kid on a shoulder
Always need to be closer

Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be

(I just wanna be) With you
(I just wanna be) With you

Coming up on a skyline
Found a good way to waste time
Just a kid on a shoulder
Always need to be closer
Closer

Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be

(I just wanna be) With you
(I just wanna be) With you

Reaching out just to feel you
Show me a door I can fall through
Show me a door I can fall through
Reaching out just to feel you
Show me a door I can fall through
Show me a door I can fall through

Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be with you
Right now, right now
I just wanna be, wanna be

With you
I just wanna be, wanna be
With you
With you
With you
