I'm the locust telling you something's amiss
Then you hear the sound
I'm the whisper, I can do it better
When I look around
I'm the siren sail beamin' from the highest shelf
You should really look down
There is a road block that I couldn't unlock
I really get around

Seduction, pure function
It's how I learn to speak
Steal your power, in my hour
I could change most everything

I'm not the anthem, I once was an anthem
That sang the song of me
But now there are no anthems
All I can hear is the echo, and the ring

I'm the sidewinder watching how to cut you down
I don't say a word
Slow dream plannin' up my next scheme
I lay my moves down
I'm the pool boy fillin' you with cool joy
In my melody
I will lay low, freak you on your way to go
Behind the scenes

I'm not the anthem, I once was an anthem
That sang the song of me
But now there are no anthems
All I can hear is the echo, and the ring

Seduction, pure function
It's how I learn to speak
Steal your power, in my hour
I could change most everything

I'm not the anthem, I once was an anthem
That sang the song of me
But now there are no anthems
All I can hear is the echo, and the ring

But I want an anthem, I'm singin' an answer
An answer and a voice
To feel rhythm in silence, a weapon, not violence
Power, power, source
