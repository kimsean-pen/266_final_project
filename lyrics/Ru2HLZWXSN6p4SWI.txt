Don't want your money
No dirty promise
Don't want the memories
That echoes in my head

You left me stranded
Caught you red handed
You tore my heart out
And left me here for dead

If I am giving
I'm giving up
I'm empty handed
You took enough

But if I had a dime
For every single time
You ever made me cry
I'd be a millionaire

If I had a dime
For every single time
I should have said 'Goodbye'
I'd be a millionaire

But I don't, don't
'Cause you left me broke
But I don't, don't
'Cause you left me broke

My love is priceless
Can't buy my time back
So let's forget all our regrets
And keep the change

You don't define me
Only remind me
I'd rather beg than live
That lie with you again

If I am giving
I'm giving up
I'm empty handed
You took enough, oh, oh

But if I had a dime
For every single time
You ever made me cry
I'd be a millionaire

If I had a dime
For every single time
I should have said 'Goodbye'
I'd be a millionaire

But I don't, don't
'Cause you left me broke
But I don't, don't
'Cause you left me broke

You had it all
But all I am is not enough
So I'm taking back my heart
I'm richer without you
With nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing

But if I had a dime
For every single time
You ever made me cry
I'd be a millionaire

If I had a dime
For every single time
I should have said 'Goodbye'
I'd be a millionaire

But I don't, don't
But I don't, don't, oh
But I don't, don't
'Cause you left me broke
You know you left me broke
But I don't, don't, oh
