Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire (oooh)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen

Oh say, you see, this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America (America, America)
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe...

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire (oooh)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen
American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen

Oh say, you see, this is the American Dream
Young boy, hustlin'
Tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all
In America, America (America, America)
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe...

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire (oooh)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America

This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire (oooh)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen
American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen

This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
