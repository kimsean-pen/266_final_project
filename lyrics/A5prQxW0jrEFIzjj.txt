Baby, put on your high heels
Running shoes and let's just run away
Yeah, I got the plan to kill your blues
And all it's gonna take is you and me

I got a full tank lady and I'm ready to drive
I got a full tank baby, just look up at the sky
Don't you back up back up buy you all the things
When we find a place to stay, yeah

You say that you hate it here
So why don't we disappear?
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby zoom
Zoom, just pick a spot on the map
And I'll get you there and back
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby zoom

Pedal to...
Pedal like the devil, gonna drive you straight to heaven
'Til you're smiling hard
Wishing on a bottle, let your hand just drive the throttle
Like a shooting star, yeah

I got a full tank lady and I'm ready to drive
I got a full tank baby, just look up at the sky
Name the time and place and I'll come get you
It don't matter if it's near or far, no, woah

You say that you hate it here
So why don't we disappear?
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby, zoom
Just pick a spot on the map
And I'll get you there and back
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby, zoom

Where you going? I'm going too
Where you going? I wanna ride with you
Where you going? 'Cause I'm going too
Where you going? I wanna ride with you

Hey, you say that you hate it here
So why don't we disappear?
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby, zoom
Just pick a spot on the map
And I'll get you there and back
If you want to go to the moon
I'll take you there, baby, zoom

Woo! Ha ha. Zoom!
