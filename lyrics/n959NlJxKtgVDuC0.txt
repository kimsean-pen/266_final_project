First time in dress shoes, and you slip
New guy puts his thumb in the petri dish

Son you did some sloppy science
Now the samples can't be trusted
You've set this lab back years
You've halted the march of progress

Hard to choose a career, when you're bad at everything

Pay shit rates, get shit labor
I should've started a chemical fire

Son you did some sloppy science
Now the samples can't be trusted
You've set this lab back years
You've halted the march of progress

Kid you soiled the sample
A decade of collected data

Fuck you at $12.50 an hour
I should've started a chemical fire
I should've burned this place to the ground

First time in dress shoes and you slip
New guy puts his thumb in the petri dish
Stained lab coat with weed pin
New guy dragged off of the premises

Hard to choose a career when you're bad at everything
