I watch the bright crimson drops
Hit the sink
I watch the bright crimson drops
Against white backgrounds
The pain lasts a while
But then turns to joy
It lasts forever
And then turns to death

Mesmerized with the sight of blood!
Soulless ritual
Over funeral sky
Mesmerized with the sight of blood
Soulless ritual
Mesmerized
Mesmerized

It is the way I release inner pain
No one can do me worse than I can do me
Sticky blade saws through my skin and veins
The lies. The Hurt. The shame.
Leaving me going down
The drain

Mesmerized with the sight of blood
Soulless ritual
Over funeral sky
Mesmerized with the sight of blood!
Mesmerized!
