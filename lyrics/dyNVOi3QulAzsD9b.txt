When I was 17 I fell in love
We had anniversaries each month
He was my first kiss
The real kind of kiss where I kissed back
Remember driving Stafford Road
A message popped up on my phone
Said he thinks he likes me and my world stood still
And my eyes grew wider than a party pill

I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Boy, I can't go a minute without you on my mind
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Can I build my life around you?
(Eyes grew wider than a)

He quit his job to spend the day with me
Thought I was pretty, couldn't see my acne
I slept two winters by his side and yeah, I let him come inside
And yeah, I let him come inside
(Eyes grew wider than a party pill)

I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Boy, I can't go a minute without you on my mind
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Can I build my life around you?
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Boy, I can't go a minute without you on my mind
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Can I build my life around you?

That was love, I was too young to see
My - took it all away from me
I said I thought that we should just be friends
And so we tried but it was all pretend

I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Boy, I can't go a minute without you on my mind
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Can I build my life around you?
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Boy, I can't go a minute without you on my mind
I think I'm gonna love you for a long time
Can I build my life around you?

He quit his job to spend the day with me
(That was heaven, that was heaven)
He quit his job to spend the day with me
(That was heaven, but I couldn't see)
