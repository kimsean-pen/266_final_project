Where are we?
First and last, bound together in our past
Much too cruel, much too fast
Much too quick to anger

I suppose, years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose
Years ago

Traps laid bare in my face
Said to keep me in my place
Waved goodbye to the child
and life it seems is colder

I suppose

Yes but what are you saying?
(please leave my mind intact)
Yes but what do you mean?
(as I slowly grow older)

Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Where are we each and all?
Spinning here, on this ball
Creatures run and creatures crawl

I suppose years ago,
I might have known
As I slowly grow older
