I crowned the same old passing of time
Gave the golden sceptre though it was never really mine
He made the days all pass me by
In such idyllic swiftness, he didn't even try
And so it goes, the stillness covers my ears
Tenderly, until all sound disappears
Now it shows, while wind is swinging the trees
Vigorously, well it has stopped to move me

I praised the same old spending of time
Slept on the whitest beaches in the calmest of nights
They held me chained and captive so I
Could never join the sea in its ever changing tides

If I'm to let it in
It might just stay forever
If I'm to welcome him
We might just stay together

The crown remains, it's always been mine
I ought to wear it better, I ought to know it now
And so it goes, the stillness covers my ears
Tenderly, until all sound disappears
Now it shows, while wind is swinging the trees
Vigorously, well it has stopped to move me
