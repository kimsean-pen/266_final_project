Nothing hurts you like the pain
Of someone you love
There ain't nothing you can gain
That prepares you enough

Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain
Of someone you care about
If I could take it all myself
You know I sure would without a doubt

Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain
Of someone so close to you
I feel so broke inside
But I'll devote my life to loving you

Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now

Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now

Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
Come on baby stop your crying
Come on baby stop your crying now
