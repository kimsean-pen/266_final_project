Leaving this time kinda feels like old news
I'm not coming through this time, gonna miss you
And oh, it's been too long
Five weeks in a bus, sick of seein you in the rearview

Been in a new town, got the same issues to work through
Turns out when you move you just take them all with you
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City

I didn't wanna get clean, went and did it cuz I had to
All eyes on me, didn't know that I was see-through
And oh, yeah it kinda feels good to know
Wherever I go I never have to walk alone

Been in a new town, got the same issues to work through
It turns out when you move you just take them all with you
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Been in a new town, got the same issues to work through
It turns out when you move you just take them all with you
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
Now I'm missin Kansas City
