Ain't it nice to be so lucky?
Ain't it nice to be so loved?
Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me drive your home

Cause I've had the rhythm and blues
Since the day you met me
Stepped on my blue suede shoes
Watch Elvis go crazy
Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me turn you on

Cause no one likes to be so lonely
No one likes to feel alone
Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me drive your home
I drive you home
Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me turn you on

I know my faithful mind is so blind
I've been running out on everyone
And everything till now
If it's Monday or Sunday

Cause I've got the rhythm and blues
Since the day you met me
Stepped on my blue suede shoes
You made Elvis go crazy
Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me turn you on
