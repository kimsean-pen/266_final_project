Jane, you say it's all over
For you and me, girl
There's a time for love
And a time for letting it be, baby

Jane, you're playin' a game called
Called hard to get by its real name
Makin' believe that you just don't
Feel the same
Oh, Jane

Jane, you're playin' a game
You never can win, girl
You're stayin' away so I'll ask you
Where you've been, baby?

Like a cat and a mouse
(Cat and a mouse)
From door to door and house to house
Don't you pretend you don't know
What I'm talkin' about

Were all those nights we spent together, hey hey
Only because you didn't know better
I gotta know

Oh Jane, you're playin' a game
You're playin' a game
Playin' a game

(Jane, Jane, Jane)

Oh Jane, you're playin' a game
Of hide and go seek
Jane, you're playin' for fun
But I play for keeps, yes I do

(Jane, Jane, Jane)
That's a game on me, yeah
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
It's so plain to see
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, yeah
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
Why you fooling with me, me, me
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
