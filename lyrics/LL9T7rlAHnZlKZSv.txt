It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here lovers in arms
I can feel your fear, can this love be true?

Come on lift me up love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith cause you keep stalling
Lift me up love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith cause you keep stalling

Cause you ain't got no
If you ain't got no love to give
You ain't got no
If you ain't got no love to give

I keep calling
I keep calling

I keep calling
I keep calling
