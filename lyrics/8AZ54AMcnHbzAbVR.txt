In the darkness she'll disappear
Loaded dallies all she'll hear.
Speak not, speak not, for a while
Speak not, speak not, hit the ground
Your whispers dead fell on the ground, set inside.

Soft like flower on the ground,
Laughing voices all around.
They're calling open your eyes
In places once alive.

Like fullest fly and treat the sorrows alike.

Speak not, speak not, for a while
Speak not, speak not, hit the ground
Your whispers dead fell on the ground, set inside.

Speak not, speak not, for a while
Speak not, speak not, hit the ground
