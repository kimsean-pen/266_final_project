Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah, ay ah
I'll be waiting out here
Waiting at your door
If you want it I could try and get you little, little more

Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah, ay ah
I'll break a promise that I made to you yesterday
I'll never hide from you or ever try to run-run away

Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah, ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wrote a letter when I met her and torn out the page
I threw it in a box and threw it somewhere far, far away

Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
You tell me secrets and you tell me that you want some more
It's not up to me to try and help you settle, settle score
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah, oh oh oh oh

I could take you out in the afternoon
Darts the shots as we swing to the contour
I know-oh-oh-oh it's a metaphor
I know-oh-oh-oh we're still unsure
Light a fire in our lifeboat
Just to keep warm but we won't stay afloat
I know-oh-oh-oh it's a metaphor
I know-oh-oh-oh we're still unsure

Sit-sat at home expecting I'll be driving round
I came to pick you up so you can try and let me, let me down
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah

It's so annoying how you hated, put yourself in pain
It's disappointing cause it's just a made-up little, little game
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah
Ah, oh, oh, oh ay ah

I could take you out in the afternoon
Darts the shots as we swing to the contour
I know-oh-oh-oh it's a metawhor
I know-oh-oh-oh we're still unsure
Light a fire in our lifeboat
Just to keep warm but we won't stay afloat
I know-oh-oh-oh it's a metaphor
I know-oh-oh-oh we're still unsure

Oh oh oh oh oh
