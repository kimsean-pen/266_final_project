Your glance sings of lyrics 'cite from memory
It's sad our goodbyes sound nostalgic
Your chords swung me from an ol' holler tree
I'm living like a vagabond that just can't decide
When to leave

With roots are in the rhythm to my mood it swings
I found even is impossible to keep
Everyday starting up a balance beam
Still you're steady with me
Always carrying the melody
Smiling all the while the paint chips off my mala prayer beads

It's the images, contained not the lenser frames
Recalled to my mind before I fall asleep
A list of regrets is no place to be
I'm coming in late but
I'll never modulate us to the minor key
Smiling all the while the paint chips off my mardi gras beads
