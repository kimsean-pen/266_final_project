I was just waiting for your phone call
When they came along to say
That a rose done chased you clear away

You had said I was gamine
But we didn't mean the same thing I think
Broke my choux pastry heart
Guess, life's no picture postcard

One for sorrow
Two for joy

Sometimes you win, ooh
Sometimes you lose
Don't wanna lose you
Don't even own you, yeah
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns, yeah, ooh

I was just waiting for your answer
Still, you made your own apologies
I cried so much, I had to leave

Three for a girl
Four for a boy, ooh

Sometimes you win, ooh
Sometimes you lose
Don't wanna lose you, yeah
Don't even own you, yeah
I just wanna stay right here
Until never dawns, yeah, ooh, ooh
