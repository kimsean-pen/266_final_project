I got one more in me
I got one more in me
I get your messages and I erase them promptly

I got one more in me
I got one more in me
I get your messages and I erase them promptly

Oh you not being with me is pure agony
My baby
My little baby
Oh babe you shouldn't have
Oh wait you didn't do
My baby
Not my baby

Oh what I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please
What I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please you

Oh what will happen to me
Now there's nobody left to be keeping me clean?
I haven't been behaving
And they'll be talking 'bout me
Saying I'm feeling happy and free
But truth be I'm scared
I can't believe you've left

Oh what I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please
What I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please you

And so, to all the queue who want to be with me
You love the beating in my body but that's why you leave
So I'll orbit you and you can orbit me
And we can have a few more mornings till we lose gravity

I got one more in me
I got one more in me
I get your messages and I erase them promptly

Oh what I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please
What I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please you

What I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please
What I might have achieved
What I might have achieved
If I wasn't trying to please
If I wasn't trying to please you

What am I?
What am I?
What am I now?
What am I?
What am I?
What am I now?
What am I?
What am I?
What am I now?
What am I?
What am I?
What am I now?
