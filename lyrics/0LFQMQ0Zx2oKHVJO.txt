Great days have come and gone
Get a place to hide

Cause I'll steal your fucking heart
And lay it over mine

A breathtaking work of art
Every verse a lie

But here is the simple truth:
Nothing conquers time
Why would you?

A face that is barely formed
An unbroken heart

So what makes you think your voice
Should be louder than mine?

Why is that?
Not so fast
When we're under the gun, it's slow
When we're fine, a flash

This is all
All I could do
But is it enough for you?

It is all
All I could do
Is it enough for you?

All
All I could do
But is it enough for you?

All
All I could
And that is the life I choose
