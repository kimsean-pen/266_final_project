I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday abusive things that you have done
Your impossible ego fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
And if you touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that bitch you call a heart

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it, at least I admit it

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself

Yeah!
Yeah!

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

I know you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself

Well, I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
