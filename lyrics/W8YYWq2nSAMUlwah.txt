I spend these hollow nights, all alone
Sick from the looking glass, that you kept whole
Let's go

I saw the sea in you, it was a mirage
It wasn't even so, I played the odds
I'm full of black and blues
From all the nights with you

I never wanted to go
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you to feel the same as me
I never wanted to go
But now I'm letting you know
I just wanted to feel the life in me

I went from solid steel, to broken glass
The darkest side of me, you brought out fast
The things I said were true, I'm taking them back from you

I never wanted to go
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you to feel the same as me
I never wanted to go
But now I'm letting you know
I just wanted to feel the life in me

I miss you
I wish you
Will let me be
Just leave it
Stop breathing
I need to be free

I never wanted to go
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you to feel the same as me
I never wanted to go
But now I'm letting you know
I just wanted to feel the life in me

I never wanted to go
I don't want you anymore
I don't want you to feel the same as me
I never wanted to go
But now I'm letting you know
I just wanted to feel the life in me
