Just a young ass nigga not givin a fuck
Cause if I ever did I'd be wifin' her up
My heart real black I don't trust a bitch
I hate this fuckin' world, y'all can suck my dick
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense
But never use a nigga just to get too rich
I always try to smile but the world is fake
The world is a house with a yard full of snakes
I don't have money, I don't have cars
All I got is the truth, and a couple of bars
All I need is a beat and the O to the E
Destroyin' competition cause this style is unique
My patience real short so just walk in my shoes
My mind fucked up mentally, too abused
Don't accuse me to be a nigga who hate
I always show love from city to state
So ride real slow as I murder the sound
The screamin' in the back represent Hell's grounds
These nigga's love to hate, see 'em eye'n me down
Progression is a blessin', you ain't slowin' me down
All I know is real shit, and I cannot lie
Me and my fuckin' goddess, rollin' side by side
Look me in my fuckin' eye, and feel my pain
As I shed blood tears, as they spell your name

Rest in peace, Jitt nigga, keep your motherfuckin' head up
It's a cold world, nigga, I know that everybody fed up
Rest in peace, Jitt nigga, keep your motherfuckin' head up
It's a cold world, nigga, I know that everybody fed up

I be the one for sure, you know just what it is
Recognition is the mission let me handle my biz
My peers hold it down for the planet of youth
Idolizin' all the women while I spit in the booth
The truth has been written when I sit in the Coup
As I spill every thrill on the waviest loops
I know just how it feel not to have any loot
Tired of the same clothes, tired of eatin' this soup
I be the B, L, A, C, right to the K
Power of the hour, like every day
What can I say? You better believe in what you see
Deception no reception just leave it to me
I gotta be, nobody else but myself
Gotta feed the whole fam' gotta gather my wealth
My shelf, is full of dollar bills and pills
If you got that connect, take me right to the mill's

It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power, bitch
