They can't take it from me, if they tried
i live through does early days
so many times i had to change the pain to laughter
just to keep from getting crazy

(guitar)

Dressed in black from head to toe
two guitars across our backs
we would walk the city roads
seeking someone who would listen to the music
that we wear writing down at home.

They can't take it from me, if they tried
i live through does early days
so many times i had to change the pain to laughter
just to keep from getting crazy

i sleep back with vaseline
like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
he bring noises we where destined to remember
the will and thrill to never stop

Made sweet memories of friends from the past
always comes to you, when you look for them
and your inspiration love may have last
may it come to you time and time again

now everybody seems to have there own opinion
who did this and who did that
but as for me i don't see how the can remember
when they weren't where it was at

They can't take it from me, if they tried
i live through does early days
so many times i had to change the pain to laughter
just to keep from getting crazy

i live through does early days
i live through does early days
