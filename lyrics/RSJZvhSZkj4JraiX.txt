You've got this new head
Filled up with smoke
I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
They're the safest place to hide

A long night spent with your most obvious weaknesses
You start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
Because you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

I just wanna break you down so badly
I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

My inarticulate store bought
Hangover hobby kit it talks
It says 'You, oh, you are so cool'
Scissor shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes
You hollow out my hungry eyes

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)

I just wanna break you down so badly
I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

I just wanna break you down so badly
I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

I'm gonna make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me

I'll make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me

I just wanna break you down so badly
I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way (worst way)

I'm gonna make damn sure
I just wanna break you down so badly
I just wanna break you down so badly (damn sure)
In the worst way
Worst way
