Those boom times went bust
My feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's
Just, rust
And the signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering, so

Why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I might be so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it

I knew that to keep in touch
Would do me deep in dutch
'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering
It's just mush
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now
To keep from following, so

Why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I might be so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it

Those boom times went bust
My feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted
It's... just... rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering

So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I might be so sick in the head
I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
I sure hope that's it
