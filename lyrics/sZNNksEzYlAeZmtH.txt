It's like technicolor in black and white
I felt like a boxer without a fight
A night in Vegas without all the lights

Before you
I could only see as deep as the skin
Before you
I never thought I could let anyone in
Before you
I was waiting for my life to begin

You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

My walls are falling and my white flag is high
I've surrendered to the feeling inside
I look in to your eyes and rewind

Before you
I could only see as deep as the skin
Before you
I never thought I could let anyone in
Before you
I was waiting for my life to begin

You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

Hand on my heart, feel how my heart beats, heart beats
Hand on my heart, feel how my heart beats, heart beats
(You are) Hand on my heart, feel how my heart beats, heart beats
(You are) Hand on my heart, feel how my heart beats, heart beats

You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one

You are, you are the proof
That love is beautiful
You are, you are the truth
Something unusual
You are, you are my fire
You're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are
You are the only one
