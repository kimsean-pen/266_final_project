Now I am crawling in
(My crawling skin)
I can't wake up anymore
(Can't find the door)

I try to make a deal
(With myself)
To avoid the blinding door
(Once again)

The party's over, the flies are back
Unexplained, mean and bad
The deepest wound, still no scab

Full HD, sci-fi scream
The time is out, mind is clean, it's blank
I'm missing a little time

I found a truth beneath the lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down
I do not know a soul in here
But I can remember the faces
And the truth is in their eyes

Every thing's mixed with gray
Say g'nite and welcome the day
Cannot see hues
So that is why the grays wear green?

I don't like this state of mind
I can see, but I can't find it
Horrified to see
What the following two days will bring

Can I trust my own eyes?
Is that me in disguise?
Is this bliss or am I insane?

Found the thin red line of madness
Far from the Skyland Mountain

I found a truth beneath a lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down
I do not know a soul in here
But I can remember the faces
The truth is in their eyes

Don't really want to know
Don't want to go out there
I feel hypnotized
The truth is somewhere

Wake up, I only want to wake up
Don't wanna fall asleep
But I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off
What I've been concealing?
Something underneath

My crawling skin
(My crawling skin)
I can't wake up anymore
(Not anymore)

I've seen how this will end
(Oh, it will end)
Don't want to soak anymore

The truth is out there
Somewhere between two fairy tales
Caught somewhere
Deep between someone's truth and a lie

Another really rainy morning
It's a perfect day
I'm too tired to be hypnotized now
It's all too real for me anyway

Wake up, I only want to wake up
Don't wanna fall asleep
But I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off
What I've been concealing?
Something underneath my crawling skin
