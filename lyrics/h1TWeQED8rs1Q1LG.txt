Take care of me
Whose side you always on
And bring sound sleep
The wind undoes me
Pulls me past
The way you hold me brings me back

Take care of me
Whose heart you always own
And lay simply
Where I didn't die
I free my back
The weight it loves me
Owes nothing
Feeling here is free

You light it slowly
Your light is lonely
You light it slowly
Your light is lonely
You light it slowly
On me

Take care of me
Who saw your war winds won
And stayed soundly
When alone I feel no pain
The way you hold me brings me back

You light it slowly
Your light is lonely
You light it slowly
Your light is lonely
You light it slowly
On me

Feeling here is free
