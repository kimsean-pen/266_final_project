Bleeding, Bleeding
To my country
The mounting costs
My freedom's lost
The death of liberty

We live in a Kingdom of reigns
The dogs of war rule the day
The hypocrites roam in gangs
The truth is lost
It's wars first casualty
Speak the truth
If you've got something to say
To lead the boys off to war
Is to throw them away
Depleted rounds kill
RU-238
These troubled times
Bringing on our darkest days

Is this the death of liberty
Is this the price that life has come to mean
All our friends, now enemies
The misery of
Bleeding, Bleeding
To my country
The mounting costs
My freedom's lost
The death of liberty

Tell the truth
If you've got something to say
No blood for oil, killing fields
Halliburton money
Wounded troops left to rot
No help from the VA
These troubled times
Bringing on our darkest days

Is this the death of liberty
Is this the price that life has come to mean
All our friends, now enemies
The misery of
Bleeding, Bleeding
To my country
The mounting costs
My freedom's lost
The death of liberty

Speak the truth, Speak the truth or Throw it away

Is this the death of liberty
Is this the price that life has come to mean
All our friends, now enemies
The misery of

Bleeding, Bleeding
To my country
The mounting costs
My freedom's lost
The death of liberty
