Woken up and here I am
All too fast to understand
All the way across the sea,
thinking thoughts of you and me
In my life, I feel so free
You're so far away from me

What a pleasure all this is
I take it all the way
I take it all the way

I take it all the way
I take it all the way
I take it all the way
I take it all the way
