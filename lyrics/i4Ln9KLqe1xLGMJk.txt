what am i gonna do
i feel like im on fire
if you only knew
that your the object i desire

i keep hanging on i keep hanging on
and i swear by god that your the only one,
i keep hanging on i keep hanging on
and i swear by god that it wont be long,

my aim is true
my vision is clear
my thoughts are crude
whenever your near

i keep hanging on i keep hanging on
and i swear by god that your the only one,
i keep hanging on i keep hanging on
and i swear by god that it wont be long

i keep hanging on

you've got a vicious streak
for someone so young
your like a solar flare
in the rising sun

i keep hanging on x 4
