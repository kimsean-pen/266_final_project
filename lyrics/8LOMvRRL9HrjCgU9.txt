And everything I've ever done
I've never been the one
It's never been easy, it's always been a struggle for me
I hope that when I'm gone
My love will live in song
Don't try to rescue me when swinging from the attic beam

What a time to be alive
But I'd be fine if it was my last night
I've got a prayer for the endless motion
To take me out of my misery
The only thing I need tonight is
You right here by my side

And ever since you left me
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me 'til the day I die

I can't keep going on singing a one-note song
I cannot give up when I'm the only person that she needs
My sweet Penelope, I'm sorry but I had to leave
I'm just not strong enough to be there for the both of us

What a time to be alive
But I'd be fine if it was my last night
I've got a prayer for the endless motion
To take me out of my misery

And ever since you left me (the pain)
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me 'til the day I die
'Cause ever since you left me
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me 'til the day I die

I would rather die than be without my love
I'd rather die than be without my love
I would rather die than be without, without my love

And ever since you left me (you left me)
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me 'til the day I die
'Cause ever since you left me (you left me)
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me 'til the day I die
