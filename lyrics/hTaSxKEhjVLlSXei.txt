say no more
everything is so in focus
listening away, listening away, listening away
play this and you'll be older
show me the, way show me the way
soaking in the den of your resort
do you say, just say no more
do you say, just say no more
rushing in but time has run it's course
never again, we'll say no more
never again, we'll say no more
days are blending parts of me throw away away
more than mystic love
tell me the day, we'll say no more
tell me the day, we'll say no more
say no more
everything is so in focus
listening away, listening away, listening away
play this and you'll be older
show me the, way show me the way
if you have your life, open toes
everyday, i'm waiting for
everyday, i'm waiting for
coloring inside, you lose your soul
do what i say, say no more
do what i say, say no more
days are blending parts of me throw away away
more than mystic love
tell me the day, we'll say no more
tell me the day, we'll say no more
(say no more, say no more, say no more)
everything is so in focus
listening away, listening away, listening away
play this and you'll be older
show me the, way show me the way
say no more
everything is so in focus
listening away, listening away, listening away
play this and you'll be older
show me the, way show me the way
am i needed?
am i everything?
let me take you babe, propositioning
so clear, when it's all the same
hey, tell me the day, say no more
