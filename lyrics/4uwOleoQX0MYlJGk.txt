Everyone's sayin' I should probably give up
And hey, I wouldn't wanna waste no time
I couldn't look myself in the mirror
Then again, why would I?

It's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life
to the lowest power
Feeling bad
in the best way a man can

Shame on you,
shame on you
Shame on you
Oh baby when you cry
it brings a tear to my eye
Oh shame on us

(Whoo!)

Chubby in the face in a world of muck and slime
Time for the comedown
How can I even look myself in the mirror?
Then again I guess I think I

Wouldn't really mind in the shame chamber
Living life
To the lowest power
Feeling bad
In the best way a man can

Yeah, it's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life
To the lowest power
Feeling bad
In the best way a man can

Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Oh baby when you cry
It brings a tear to my eye
Oh shame on us

(Whoo!)
