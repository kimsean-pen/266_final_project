Here it comes, that's another one
You know the bell rings, not for anyone
Take it back, on your own
Laugh it up, laugh all the way home
I started lying as a small kid
Take it back if I could, every bad thing I did
And I've been this stubborn since before you
It's too late to change, it's forever true
And how far is it how much did you take
I'm sorry to them, I'm sorry it's fake
In hiding there is truth, but it's low
Everyone wants to prove, just prove that they
Know what's coming, know what's coming
Know what's coming, what's coming
So the big lie is advice you gave
Everyone talks this way, everyone looks the same
And maybe one day I'll be surprised
With my twin fists, with my twin eyes
