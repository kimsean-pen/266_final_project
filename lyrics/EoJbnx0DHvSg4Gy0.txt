Royd

In the land of destiny
There is a void that can't be felt

We negotiate starvation
In the land of milk and honey
We live in opulence and decadence
And yet it's not enough

Praising our deficiencies
We'd rather close our eyes than see
Gorging is much easier
If we can look the other way

In the lap of luxury
The house of cards will fall
I'm your toxic symmetry
Break and correct,
Break and correct me.

We drown in wine
And you in water
The die is cast
Our eyes can see

Shout at the voices
They will not be heard.
