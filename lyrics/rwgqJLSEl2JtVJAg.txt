Sunspots changing glares
Walking 'round with my very best friend
I've got a love song in my head
Strolling 'round with my very best friend

I look back but I don't see
Walking round with my very best friend
She looks good--fine to me
I'm in love with my very best friend

And eeeeyoooo, it goes away
And eeeeyoooo, it goes away

Sunspots changing gear
Driving 'round with my very best friend
I gotta love song in my head
Holding on to my very best friend

We look back but I can't see
Moving on with my very best friend
She looks good--fine to me
I'm in love with my very best friend

Eeeeyoooo, it goes away
And eeeeyoooo, it goes away

And eeeeyoooo, it goes away
And eeeeyoooo, it goes away
Way, way, way!
