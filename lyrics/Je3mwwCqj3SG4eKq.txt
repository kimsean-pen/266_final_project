Early morning dreary horizon
Aching hands are pulling a millstore
Wailing from the cart
Moaning from a shattered heart

He's burnerd down many a bridge
And he's sacred of walking in the dark
It hurts when the rain falls on this skin

He's burnerd down many a bridge
And he's scared of walking in the dark
It hurts when the rain falls on this skin

Oh he's worn out from maching
And he's forgetten for what he's searching
Yet he's keeps up the stride
God knows that he's won't arrive

He's burnerd down a many a dridge
And he's scared of walking in the dark
It hurts when rain falls on this skin

He's burnerd down a many a bridge
And he's scared of walking in the dark
It hurts when rain falls on this skin
