Oh baby why
Do I miss you like I do?
Homeless my sweet
And the birds all sing the blues
And why? And why?

Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you
Honey I ain't nothing new

Oh baby why
Did I treat you like I did?
Honey I was just a kid
Bubblegum on my shoe
But you loved me
And I loved you

Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you
And I just wanna die without you
Oh I just wanna die without you
Yeah I just wanna die without you
Without you
Honey I ain't nothing new
