If I return, all I used to be
All I used to go
If I recall, too tough, too weak
Too long, too bleak

Still NO FATE AWAITS
Still NO FATE AWAITS
Still NO FATE AWAITS ME

If the reward
Comes down to me
Come back to me
If every road comes back to you
Come back to me

Still no fate awaits
Still no fate awaits
Still no fate awaits me
