Trouble's coming down again
We said, "Trouble's coming 'round the bend!"

I see 'em coming 'round the bend
From me again
Riding for my soul across the creek
Oh yeah
I hear the hounds call

Going back between my eyes
True grit lies
Inside my mind
Living awake in the moonlight
Dust, trees I'm outta sight
I'm going, going, going back home

Only face I know
Is the face I see
Only place I know
Moves inside of me
Home, home, home in me

And I hope the swamps they push me toward (Liza?)
(??) They almost won
I put my heels down and I steady my course
I push on 'cause there's so much noise
Gotta outrun what's chasing me

Going back between my eyes
True grit lies
Inside my mind
Living awake in the moonlight
Dust, trees I'm outta sight
I'm going, going, going back home

Only face I know
Is the face I see
Only place I know
Moves inside of me
Home, home, home in me

Back to the valley and into my soul
Oh oh I gotta get home
Back to the valley and into my soul
Oh oh I gotta get home
Back to the valley and into my soul
Oh oh I gotta get home
Trouble's coming down again
We said "Trouble's coming around the bend!"

Only face I know
Is the face I see
Only place I know
Moves inside of me
Home, home, home in me

Only face I know
Is the face I see
Only place I know
Moves inside of me
Home, home, home in me
