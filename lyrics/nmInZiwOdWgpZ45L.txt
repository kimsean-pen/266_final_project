If I ever get around to living
I'm gonna put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay

If I ever get around to living
It's gonna be just like I dreamed
I'm gonna take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away

Free
Free

Maybe it's all a dream I'm havin' at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be callin' me
Sayin', "Come upstairs, you've got some work to do"

When you gonna wise up boy?
When you gonna wise up boy?
When you gonna wise up boy?
When you gonna wise up boy?

You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it

And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never gonna love the way you want it

I think you better wise up boy
I think you better wise up boy
I think you better wise up boy
I think you better wise up boy
I think you better wise up boy
