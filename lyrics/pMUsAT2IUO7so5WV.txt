Tell me why
We never cared to do this when we still had time
We'll never have to give up if we never try
I know I'll only want it when it's gone
into the fire
Show me now
I wish that I could fake it but I don't know how
I'll know we'll never make it but I can't start now
We're only just beginning and it's over

Too late,
No time
It's over now, can't wait
Now, it's too late
No time,
it's over now, can't wait
and now we all fall down into the fire
And my wishes have all come true
We all fall down
I don't want it if I can't be with you

Leave me here
I'll never see tomorrow 'til my eyes are clear
We never could run faster than the passing years
I know that I won't miss you 'til you're gone,
into the fire
Cross my heart
We'll never have to let this end if we don't start
We'll never see the light 'til we step into the dark
We're only just beginning and it's over

Too late
No time,
it's over now, can't wait
Now, it's too late
No time,
it's over now, can't wait
And now we all fall down into the fire
And my wishes have all come true
We all fall down
I don't want it if I can't be with you

There's a lesson that we learned
in the pages that we burned
It's written in the ashes of the fire below
While the world is spinning 'round
and we crash into the ground,
We'll never be together now
It's too late
