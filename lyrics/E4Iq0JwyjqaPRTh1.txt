Broken feather made me cry
Lost and wounded I realised lies
We don't need, no one to wither us away
Sit still tree, gently sway

Broken feather scattered down from the sky
Hoping with her, we all need sacrifice from our ways

We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean

Open windows, set the sail beneath my wings
We are the light that we are glowing in
She kissed my lips as fast as the wind
You and I, queens and kings

We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
We are the sky, We are the Ocean
