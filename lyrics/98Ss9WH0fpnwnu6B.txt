I always wondered why it takes
Fifteen stitches and a soft parody
To make my eyes be like deceit
I believe the sting proves heart to me

Now I know that you love me
Thank God that you love at all

Dislocated at the joint
Timing is everything in the bed
'Cause you'll sleep for hours
To keep away
Then sink the teeth and bat your eyes at

Now I know that you love me
Thank God you love at all

What's the surprise I was right
Here going off and going on
What's the surprise I was right
Here going off and going on
What's the surprise I was right
Here going off and going on
What's the surprise I was right
Here going off and going on

At least now I know that you
Love me, thank God that you love at all

What's the surprise I was right here
Going off going on dai the flu
What's the surprise I was right here
Going off going on dai the flu
What's the surprise I was right here
Going off going on dai the flu
What's the surprise I was right here
Going off going on dai the flu
What's the surprise I was right here
Going off going on dai the flu
