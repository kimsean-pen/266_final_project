Been thinkin' bout you all day
Pickin' me up in your beemer.
Meet me outside, todays been kind of dry make it sweeter.
We can drive around pick a small lollipop,
like your favorite if i don't love it. I don't swallow.
Sweet and sticky but your no good for me.
Should really leave ya.
But sweet tooth ache.
You give me a rush - sugar.

Ice cream man
I scream too loud when you come around.
But i was talking to the other girls
And i feel a little sick now.
I like you but i couldn't eat a whole one.
Cuz I've just heard your ice creams been in another mouth.
But sweet tooth ache.
You give me a rush - sugar.
