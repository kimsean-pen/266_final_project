Leaving my life behind
My young love and the unborn
Only have a lock of her hair...
and burning love inside

After forty work-filled days and sleepless nights
the sails are lit by the lights of Boston
...and here we go...

Off the ship! Towards the adventure
the one to define our lives.
Daily grind and a tiny room.

"I got here safe, Love.
I have an address, until spring
then I shall race for the land

hope to hear from you soon..."

Her letter reads...
"Please let me know everything's alright
Thinking about you, 'though you're out of sight
every night, when I'm turning in, my tears find me.

Please hurry, dear, come back and rescue me..."
"Now that I have made the dollars we need for the dream.
The best horse I've ever seen
a carriage and everything I need...
I will make my way to the great unknown

Every moment I wish you were here with me now...
"Please let me know everything's alright
Thinking about you, 'though you're out of sight
every night, when I'm turning in, my tears find me.

Please hurry, dear, come back and rescue me..."
"No, I'm not a stranger, among the people in here...

Yet I have never felt so alone...
At high noon the sound will boom
and I will start racing for the

land we can call home."
"I stuck my...
flag in the ground, screaming 'n shouting

I've never felt so proud, Love!
We are free from eternal serfdom!
I'm gonna bring you home, my light!"
"nine, eight, seven, six, counting the days. SOLO!"
"five, four, three, two, together forever! SOLO!"
I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
I am the land and the land is me
Freedom is everything and we are free
I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
Every night, when I'm looking at the full moon rising
I hold you and know that we are free...
