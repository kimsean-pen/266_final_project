I finally found a job in a paper
Movin' barrels at a chemical plant
There's shiny-looking dust on my fingers
Goin' up my nose and into my lungs

It's the Kepone poisoning-Minamata
Kepone poisoning-Minamata
At the grimy Kepone Factory
Turning people into bonzai trees

Now I've got these splitting headaches
Can't quite get it up no more
I can't sleep and it's driving me crazy
Shake all day and I'm seeing double

Kepone poisoning-Minamata
Kepone poisoning-Minamata
At the grimy Kepone Factory
Turning people into bonzai trees

Gonna go down your big metal building
Gonna slam right through your bright metal door
Gonna grab you by your sta-prest collar
And ram some kepone down your throat

The lawyer says "That's the breaks, kid"
"Gonna gnarl and rot the rest of your life"
"If you don't sue, we'll give you a Trans-Am"
That I'll never drive 'cause I shake all the time

'Cause of the Kepone poisoning-Minamata
Kepone poisoning-Minamata
At the grimy Kepone Factory, yeah
