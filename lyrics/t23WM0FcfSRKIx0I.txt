Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I will be near you

Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I will be near you

Some people handle love and never try
I can almost fly with your wings to set me higher
Some day we'll see the world
And through the grey have faith in our hands

Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
We'll always be forever friends

Hold me like a friend
Kiss me like a friend
Say we'll never end
Searching for the colors of the rainbow
Melody never say goodbye
I will believe you

When the river flows
Off to part us both
Only heaven knows
I'll be a boat to sail around you
Melody never say goodbye
I will be near you

Some people handle love and never try
I can almost fly with your wings to set me higher
One day we'll see the world
And through the grey have faith in our hands
Till the river ends
