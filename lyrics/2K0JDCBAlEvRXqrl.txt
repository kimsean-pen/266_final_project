Everybody's weird

So everybody came, but you're here to have some fun
And everyone's the same, well that's faster said than done.
And you're such a lovely guy, but it doesn't take so much
to get all there is out, all the dirt and all the sludge.

You're stepping on my sun
and it's such a lot of fun
better smile before it's gone
you're stepping on my sun

Everybody's weird

Everybody's a weird guy

And the liquor that you had
is playing twister with your mind
you been artificially sad
but never naturally high
I was flashing on a thought
on a party in this town
if I said what's on my mind
there'd be not a soul around.

You're stepping on my sun
Everybody's weird
and it's such a lot of fun
better smile before it's gone
you're stepping on my sun

Everybody's weird
Everybody's a weird guy
Everybody's a weird guy
Everybody's weird

It's easier to trust
if it comes down to this my friend
I will help you if I must
I will kill you if I can
experience is cheap
and you know that in the end
I will kill you if I must
I will help you if I can

You're stepping on my sun
and it's such a lovely gun
better smile before it's gone
you're stepping on my sun

Everybody's weird
'Cause everybody's weird
and they all think they're God
bBut the biggest one they fear is that precious thing you got.
The fire in your eyes
is a subtlety I know
and you will not be denied
but the service is so slow

You're stepping on my sun
and it's such a lovely gun
better smile before it's gone
you're stepping on my sun

Everybody's weird
Everybody's a weird guy
Everybody's weird
Everybody's a weird guy
