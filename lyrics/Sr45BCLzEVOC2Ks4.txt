To seem you're in me and over me
Relief in all things
And all things shoot through me
And all things shoot through you
Wherever you are
To seem you're a dream when you never stop
And we ask you what you are
Belief as one with what you believe
Travel slowly
Move in circles
You know time grows old in reverse
Life as a thing that began
And was magnified
And made the first fire and the last one
To mean everything you never say
Every single thing going every way
When you're leader's gone
He means to make you strong
He never went away
Cuz what you need you are
