Well everything's so different now, this scream which fills the air,
And haunts the hall which children sleep upon the floor,
They'll have the gun, you'll hear them say with smiles meant to cry,
As they wind the watch strapped on the wrist and quickly look away,
And four and six have come and gone, five times before this scene,
And upon the lips of everyone, the curse I've never dreamed,
Yeah, upon the lips of everyone, the curse I've never dreamed.

It's a complicated situation,
It's a complicated situation mama,
I'm a complicated situation.

The young must be our sacrifice, they say with crippled grins,
The eyes of youth must lose their way and stumble here within,
So the sleeping children were awoke, in time to haze their eyes,
So it's never known on which they choke's worth books of old and time,
So it's never known on which they choke's worth books of old and time.

It's a complicated situation,
It's a complicated situation mama,
I'm a complicated situation
