I want you
Woman

Tried to be your son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprise to find the cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man to buckle down and to shovel shit

What'll you do for loving when it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman, yeah

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher, will you lead us all the same?
Well, I travelled around the world and find a brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me, I have to getaway
What'll you think of Heaven, if it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman
