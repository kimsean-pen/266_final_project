A mind winters day, it's cold, and I know for certain
When I go outside my head will start hurtin
It's a winter's day and I know for certain
When I go outside my head will start hurtin
So I'll wrap it up in materials
To keep my head from getting cold
I'll wrap it up in materials to
To keep my head from getting cold
And I said to all my friends when I have kids
Yeah I said to all my friends when I have kids

I'm gonna want that child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want that child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child

And I go outside and mingle in the snow
My head looks like a globe
Ain't no hair on it at all
Do I buy a wig
Should I grow my beard
And comb it upwards
And around my ears
Well I can't wait for the kids to come
No I can't wait for the kids to come
Say "hey babe you ain't going to no barber shop!"
Cause I want yeah I want I know for certain

I want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
I'm gonna want the child to be a long-haired child
Baby that's for sure, baby that's for sure

And when the snow it hits my temple
I wanna rush home and put on the kettle now
And warm my little brain and bald head
I'm too cold to know if I'm alive or dead

But when my baby slips out my mama's womb
When my baby slips out my mama's womb
We're gonna enter a new life
Enter a new life, that's for sure
You're gonna enter your self back through your baby's front door
Now if you want that child to be a long-haired child
You're gonna make that baby be a long-haired child that's for sure
Baby, baby, that's for sure
Shoo bop, shoo bop
Shoo bop, shoo bop
