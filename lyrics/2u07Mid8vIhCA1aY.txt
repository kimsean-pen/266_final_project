I'm a little secret
Oh girl it's hurting me
And if I
Told the world what I was thinking
It'll set you free

And I can't be your shadow

I would tip-toe
Around your window
So no one can see

Oh no I won't be your little secret
Oh girl 'cause it's hurting me
And if I told your boyfriend
What you were doing
It'll set you free
And I won't be your shadow
No you can't hide me
You can't hide me for the rest of your life
You've got to set me free

Tell me what you want
To set me free
Tell me what you need
To believe in me
Wasted time
Wasted time
Wasted time
Please don't waste my time

Oh no I won't be your little secret
Oh girl 'cause it's hurting me
And if I told the world what you were doing
It would set you free
And I can't be your shadow
You can't hide me
You can't hide me for the rest of your life
You've got to set me free

Oh no, I won't be your little secret
No, I won't be your secret
No, I can't be
Your little secret

Little secret
Little secret
I can't be your little secret
Little secret
Little secret
I can't be your little secret
