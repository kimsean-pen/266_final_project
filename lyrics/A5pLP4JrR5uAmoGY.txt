Put all your angels on the edge
Keep all the roses, I'm not dead
I left a thorn under your bed
I'm never gone
Go tell the world I'm still around
I didn't fly, I'm coming down
you are the wind, the only sound
Whisper to my heart
when hope is torn apart
and no one can save you
I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone
My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone
Go back to sleep forever more
Far from your fools and lock the door
They're all around and they'll make sure
You don't have to see
What I turned out to be
no one can help you
I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone
My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone
Waiting up in heaven
I was never far from you
Spinning down I felt your every move
I walk alone
I walk alone
Every step I take
I walk alone
My winter storm
Holding me awake
It's never gone
When I walk alone
