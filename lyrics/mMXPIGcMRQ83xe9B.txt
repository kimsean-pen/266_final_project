You want a guy who can bring the bacon
And you want a guy with Savoir Faire
Somebody who can take control of it
Someone with cool, black, shiny hair

Yeah!

You don't want a boyfriend
What you want is Mr. Spock
To come to your wasteland
And destroy the ro-o-o-bot
Something more than human
Someone with blood that's cold and green
You want something better than me

Captain Kirk went to the planet
And there he fought the man lizard.
He saved the ship, invented the gun powder
But that's just not good enough for you, is it?!

No!

You don't want a boyfriend
What you want is Mr. Spock
To come to your wasteland
And destroy the ro-o-o-bot
Something more than human
Someone with blood that's cold and green
You want something better than me, me!

You sit all night at your computer
Drinking Diet Dr. Pepper
Looking for an answer to it all!
Say the words!
Say the words!
Say, say, say the words!

You don't want a boyfriend
What you want is Mr. Spock
To come to your wasteland
And destroy the ro-o-o-bot
Something more than human
Someone with blood that's cold and green
You want something better than me, me, than me!
