He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
He got the answers to ease my curiosity
He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity

God is dead
And no one cares
If there is a hell
I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion atrocities done in his name

God is dead
And no one cares
If there is a hell
I'll see you there
Your god is dead
And no one cares
If there is a hell
I'll see you there

God is dead
And no one cares
If there is a hell
I'll see you there
(Your god is dead)
God is dead
(And no one cares)
And no one cares
(Drowning in his own hypocrisy)
If there is a hell
(Burning with your God in humility)
I'll see you there
