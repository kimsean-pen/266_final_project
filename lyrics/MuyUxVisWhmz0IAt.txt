And i was a boy from school
Helplessly helping all the rules
And there was a boy at school
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools
And there was a girl at school
Blaming all the words she learned from home
Nothing could keep her a child
Long hours don't you know we try

We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong

Now i met you on the street
Heartlessly breaking rules we meet
Lives are found and lives are lost
Say goodbye to nothing everything cost
Now i find you on the street
Breaking rules hopelessly we meet
Loves are found and loves are lost
Say goodbye to everything, nothing cost.

We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong

I got i got lost
You said this was the way back
I got i got lost
You said this was the way back
I got i got lost

You said this was the way back
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
