The love that we've been through
Was splintered and sent to
The end of
The rainbow today
Now that its over
The grass and the clover
Grow over
The ground where I lay
...Come back Petonia
Come back I say... Come back Petonia
I'm hopin' soon ya'll... Come back, I pray
Be with me to stay... I'm hopin' soon ya'll
...Be with me to stay
