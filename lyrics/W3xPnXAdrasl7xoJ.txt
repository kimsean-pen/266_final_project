Animals, in the woods
Stuck outside all the looks, well
Everyone, analyze
Every note and criticize
Hear your voice scream my name
Stuck inside lost in your maze
Waterfalls push and pull
Waterfalls push and pull
Learn to lie, learn to cheat
Razor blades, hard to eat
Hear my voice, scream my name
Tried the punch but I don't like the taste
Read my lips, sod your head
Can't pretend like you know what I said

Over and over again
Over and over and over again

Animals, battlefields
Desert sun won't disappear
Like mom and dad behind the wheel
Face your fears or face tears long
Comes undone in the ocean
I don't care, I'll let you know when I'm done
Lick my bones, bleed my brains
Makes no difference, it's always the same

Over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
Over over over again

You're sleep walking
Again
Just sleep talking
Mmmmm
You're sleep walking
Again
Just sleep talking

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

Sleep walking, sleep talking
Over and over and over and over again
Sleep walking, sleep talking
Over and over and over and over again
