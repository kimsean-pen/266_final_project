The ripe August waiting for the cold
Caked in flowers, hair dyed blond
All he ever wanted was to dance with the crowd around his
And now they're gonna watch him fall

Ahaaaa,
Haaaaa

Looking down into his darkened eyes
The great white prize was here and loved
And all he ever wanted was to dance with the crowd around him
And now they're gonna watch him fall

Ahaaaa,
Haaaaa

Take your time
The floor is yours again
Flower and blood, mixed up
And your hair dyed blond
Take your time
The floor is yours again
Flower and blood, messed up
Ready to take in more

Ahaaaa,
Haaaaa

Take your time
The floor is yours again
Flower and blood, mixed up
And your hair dyed blond
Take your time
The floor is yours again
Flower and blood, messed up
Ready to take in more
