We simply fit together
Like a piece of apple pie
I will be vanilla ice cream
And I'll sing you lullabies
I will love you in the moonlight
And I'll love in the day, always

I love the time we spend
Like a watch from an old friend
I will help you keep your smile
Promise me you'll stay awhile
I will come to you in need
And I'll help you when I can, when I can

Stay with me
Promise me you're never gonna leave
Stay with me
Let's try to be the best that we can be
And take our time

We always joke together
Laugh 'til we're rolling on the floor
I like the way you dance around
When you're running for the door
I will come to visit you even
When we're old and gray, always

I love the way you make me feel
When you're asleep, I'll take the wheel
Make sure to call when you get home
When you're driving on the road
I will come to you in need
And I'll help you when I can, when I can

So stay with me
Promise me you're never gonna leave
Stay with me
Let's try to be the best that we can be
And take our time

I will come to you in need
And I'll love you when I can
I'll love you when I can
I'll come to you in need
And I'll love you when I can
I'll love you when I can, always

Stay with me
Promise me you're never gonna leave
Stay with me
Let's try to be the best that we can be
And take our time
