We're all standing with our backs against the wall, sooner or later
Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm, sooner or later
Trying to swim, but you're sinking like a stone, alone

And I can feel fire in the night waiting here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there

Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it

Milk and honey 'till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later, sooner or later
Sooner than later, sooner or later

We're all waiting on a dream
That's hard to own, sooner or later
Trying to feel the high
Without the low, you know

That you can feel fire in the night lying here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there

Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it

Milk and honey 'till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later, sooner or later

The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there
Sooner or later, we're gonna make it

Sooner or later, I know, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it

Milk and honey till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later

The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven (Sooner than later)
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there (Sooner or later)
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven (Sooner or later)
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there (Sooner or later)
