We can talk all night
I'll stay up as long as you listen
Speak of what you like
Say the desires that are your deepest
We know this won't be forever
When morning comes I won't be here
Don't think you even know my name
But it's probably better that way
We can talk all night
When the talking's done
Let our bodies talk
'Cause they talk so loud
If the mood is right
We can do this right
I don't want to hear you say that it's love
I just need you to show me
I just need you to show me
We can conversate
(Why, why)
I'll be here as long as you listen
We stay up till late
(Why, why)
Your body sings and my body listens
And maybe this won't be forever
Morning comes I won't be here
I'll leave my number on the table
In case you want it again
We can talk all night
When the talking's done
Let our bodies talk
'Cause they talk so loud
If the mood is right
We can do this right
I don't want to hear you say that it's love
I just need you to show me
(Oh, I just need, I just need you to show me)
Oh I just need you to show me
(Oh, I just need, I just need you to show me)
I can feel the water rising
I can hardly hold it back
You're a creature of the night dear
So body talk me through this
Both of us are moving in closer
And i can feel your words in my hands
So teach me how to speak like you do
I could be yours
We can talk all night
When the talking's done
Let our bodies talk
'Cause they talk so loud
If the mood is right
We can do this right
I don't want to hear you say that it's love
I just need you to show me
(Oh, I just need, I just need you to show me)
Oh I just need you to show me
(Oh, I just need, I just need you to show me)
I just need you to show me
