Yeah, you know, I just wanna something real fast before I start this
There's alot of things in this world that I care way too much about
And music's definitely one of them, but music's like the only one
That's actually worth my time
And I'm about to tell you why

(I've got the whole world on my back)

Yeah, 'cause I'm 5'9, 165
Established 1995
Living like I'm not getting out alive
And I'ma take a second just to tell you why

I had thoughts since 6th grade
That this world was not made for the sake
Of the people like me
Who can't see past their mistakes, and misdeeds

And I bleed the same blood you bleed
So why are you tryna cut me?
Why's there always something you want from me?
Why can't you be happy for me?

That I'm not that kid on the phone,
screaming fuck this world I'm leaving?
Like when I was sixteen and, it still feels like I'm dreaming
When I call your phone and realize I forgot to breathe in
Forgot the grave that he's in
I hope you know I mean it

When I say I'm only here today 'cause this music keeps me breathing
It's my only healing

I'm not alone if you can feel it

I'm not alone, if you know the bliss
When I heard that girl don't slit her wrists no more
From that time I reminisced at my show
Told her there's reasons to stay don't go

Don't push your family away I know
They don't understand all the pain you hold
I'm just as sad, know you're not alone
Don't let your story go untold

I know you're here in spirit, put on deja entendu
The only time I'm sad now is when I think of you
I hope one day these kids get some of my lyrics tattooed
If I only help one of them then I did it for all you
I don't know how shes doing, no we haven't stayed in touch
But I helped her put the knife down and that means so fucking much
I hope one day these kids get some of my lyrics tattooed
But if I only helped one of them then I did it, I did it for you
