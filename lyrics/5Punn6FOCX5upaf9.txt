Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in

Blood stains washing underneath the waves
(As we fall, as we fall)
I'll be reaching out to keep you safe
(as we fall, as we fall, as we fall)

I can't hold on much longer
We're drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side

Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us

Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in

Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As we fall

I can't hold on much longer
We're drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side
