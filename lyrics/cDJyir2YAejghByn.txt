The sentinel on the shoal
Where the shore dies every time, every night
Who's able to shut up his screaming will

All the remaining trembling lightpoles
fade with the morning light
Torches of inquisition for the drunk souls of
the last night, in my dreams seagulls are falling down

Foam celebrates the wedding
of the sea and the abyss of my heart
Deep blue ocean is fair
Since it grabs closer to the sun

All the remaining trembling lightpoles
fade with the morning light
Torches of inquisition for the drunk souls of
the last night, in my dreams seagulls are falling down
(So observe the dawn)
All the remaining trembling lightpoles
fade with the morning light
Torches of inquisition for the drunk souls of
the last night, in my dreams seagulls are falling down

But Mara Hope keeps calm
