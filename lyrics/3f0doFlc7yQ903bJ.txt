Don't look back until you try
a line so openly a lie,
Outside of you,
it's just tomorrow starting

I've said I'm wrong when I've been right.
I've seen times when I've been sure
but still I find
I'm just the first that you take
are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use

They never seem to be any use

it's just tomorrow starting

Don't look back until you've tried.
With time you'll endlessly arrive
outside of use,
with just tomorrow starting

See my eyes
tell me I'm not lying.
I'm just the first that you take
are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use

They never seem to be any use

It's just tomorrow starting

(Instrumental)

See my eyes
tell me I'm not lying.
I'm just the first that you take
are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use

Don't look back until you try
a line so openly a lie,
Outside of you,
it's just tomorrow starting

I've said I'm wrong when I've been right.
I've seen times when I've been sure
but still I find
I'm just the first that you take
are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use

They never seem to be any use

it's just tomorrow starting

Don't look back until you've tried.
With time you'll endlessly arrive

Don't look back until you try
