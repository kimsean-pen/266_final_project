Disgusted by your weakness
You have no right to live
To know you is to hate you
But your life's yours to give

You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on a string
You don't get it

I won't bow to something
That I've never seen
Can't believe in something
That doesn't believe in me

I'm not blood of your blood
I'm no son of your God
I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation

You think you have the answers
To every last detail
In your eyes, you're the victor
In mine, you've all but failed

You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on a string
You don't get it

Just monkey see and monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're like a puppet on a string
You don't get it

I won't bow to something
That I've never seen
Can't believe in something
That doesn't believe in me

I'm not blood of your blood
I'm no son of your God
I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation

Still I find salvation
Still I find salvation.
