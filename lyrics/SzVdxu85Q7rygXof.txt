You've been misguided and you've been deceived
Truth was not always quite what you believed
Trust has made fools out of great men before
Now we will even the score

Come on board our ship
Feel the breeze
That is cleansing your heart and your soul
We will set you free

Run away, from the lies
From their truth that blinds your eyes
Break the chains, spark the fire in your mind

Sing our song, join the fight
As we stand for what is right
Be the change you want to see today
Join the Silent Mutiny

We are the rebels we think for ourselves
Some men can rule but no men shall be slaves
A free heart, a free mind is changing the game
The world shall never be the same

Come taste our freedom!

Run away, from the lies
From their truth that blinds your eyes
Break the chains, spark the fire in your mind

Sing our song, join the fight
As we stand for what is right
Be the change you want to see today
Join the Silent Mutiny

For power and money, the higher the walls
The tyrants would build at our doors
For balance and justice, we hope for a chance
Someday we'll all know it lies in our hands

Come on board our ship
Feel the breeze
That is cleansing your heart and your soul
We will set you free

Run away, from the lies
From their truth that blinds your eyes
Break the chains, spark the fire in your mind

Sing our song, join the fight
As we stand for what is right
Be the change you want to see today
Join the Silent Mutiny
