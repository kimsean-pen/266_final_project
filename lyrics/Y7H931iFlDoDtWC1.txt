Suffer and hide it
Trapped in this nightmare
Trespassed the unknown
There's no going back, so take me there

Hang on
To nothing, to nothing, I won't
Let go
Never let you go, let you go, oh no
Oh no
Never let you go, let you go
Hang on
To nothing, to nothing, I won't

Darkness around me
Fragments left behind
Fighting what would be
Endless battle forever mine

In the black space
In the black space
In the black space, moving
In the black space, moving

Hang on
To nothing, to nothing, I won't
Let go
Never let you go, let you go, oh no
Oh no
Never let you go, let you go
Hang on
To nothing, to nothing, I won't

In the black space, I'll find you
In the black space, I'll find you
In the black space, I'll find you
In the black space, I'll find you
In the black space
