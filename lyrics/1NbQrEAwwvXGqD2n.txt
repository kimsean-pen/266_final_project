Cannot hide my tearful eyes
Cannot stand you start to cry
No chance to change my mind
A thousand voices in my head

Nothing I could understand
How could a boy feel so alone
Now I play my favourite song
It does not change I feel alone

How I tried to reach your lonely heart
Still I stay here in this place
Although I know I lost my race
Will never be with you again

I see you walking down the street
Can't you see how much I bleed
After all it was
You and me
Cannot stand we're loosing time
Without a love that means a crime
After all it was
You and me

Who has left me with those tears
Heavy weight of words to bear
I always knew its telling lies
Is there anything I could do
I really lost my love to you
No excuses offered anyway
