Razors edge outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation, the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself and let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!

Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, go insane!

Innate seed to watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated, eviscerated
Time perpetuated

Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself and let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!

Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, go insane!

Inert flesh, a bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution, a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself and let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!

Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, go insane!
