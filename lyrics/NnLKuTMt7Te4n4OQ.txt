Look in my eyes shot with terror
Paralysed, you roll me over
I'm so dumb and you're so clever
Scrutinise my best endeavour
Come the day when I will leave
I might cry, you will bleed

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there
Meet you there
There's no one there

I left the sun in Africa
To be with you, to fly
Cross the oceans licking flames
Every movement speaks your name
Come the day when I will leave
I might cry, you will bleed

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there
Meet you there
There's no one there

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there

Empty skies full of butterflies
Wings beat silent like air
Colours fade my promise torn
You said I'll meet you there
Meet you there
There's no one there
