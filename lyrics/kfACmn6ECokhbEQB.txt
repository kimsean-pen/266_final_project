Now, is all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will, forever be ours
Even if we tried to forget
Love will remember

You said you loved me
I said I loved you back
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

All your promises
And all those plans we had
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we tried to forget

Love will remember you
Love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will, forever be ours
Even if we tried to forget

Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

The trips we dreamed of taking
The tacks left on the map
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing
And all we did was laugh
What happened, what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we tried to forget

Love will remember you
Love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will, forever be ours
Even if we tried to forget

Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

Break down the walls
Let heaven in
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again

We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable

We lit the whole world up
Before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up

Forever
Forever
Forever

Love will remember you
Love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will, forever be ours
Even if we tried to forget

Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember

Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
Love will remember
