Wakin' in the dawn of day
I gotta think about what I wanna say
Phone ringing off the shelf
I guess it wanted to kill himself
Wakin' on a pretty day
Don't know why I ever go away
It's hard to explain
My love, in this daze

You can say I've been most all around
But honey I ain't goin' nowhere
Don't worry 'bout a thing
It's only dying
I live along a straight line
Nothing always comes to mind
To be frank, I'm fried
But I don't mind

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Been diggin'
Layin' low, low, low
I'm diggin'
Layin' low, low, low
Dig, dig in...
To these lives that we are living
Living low, lackadaisically so

Risin' at the crack of dawn
I gotta think about what wisecrack
I'm gonna drop along the way today
Phone ringing off the shelf
I guess somebody got something they
Really wanna prove to us today
Yeah, I'm waking on a pretty day
Floating in place
No use sayin' nothin'
To explain it to my loved ones...
Today

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
