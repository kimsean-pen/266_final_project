Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all

Stab, bawl, punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl, punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab, bawl, punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl, punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
