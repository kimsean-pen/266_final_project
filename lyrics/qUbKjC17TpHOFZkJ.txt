I don't fall slow
Like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my
Air Catcher
That kept me
Safe and sound

My parachutes
Will guide me
Safely to ground
But now, the
Cord's not workin'
And I can see you
Starin' me down

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to
Avoid those eyes
Ohhh

I think you would beat
The moon in a
Pretty contest
And the moon
Just happened to be the
Very first thing
That I missed

I was doing fine
On my own and there
Wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my
Air catcher and
I don't know if
I want it back

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to
Avoid those eyes,
'Cause, I'm not sure
I want to give
You tools that can
Destroy my heart

And judges don't say
What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I won't fall in
Love with fallin'
I will try to
Avoid those eyes,
But, now, I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can
Destroy my heart
