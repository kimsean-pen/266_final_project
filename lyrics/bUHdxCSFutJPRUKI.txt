Can't you see it's pointless just to argue.
I'm screaming, but I can't break through to you.
If you'd only shut your mouth and listen.
You'd see what you've been missing out on for so long.
Before you change your mind don't you wanna try.
To see all this through someone else's eyes?
Oh, you've never been so wrong.
The struggles only just begun.
It's all or nothing.
Don't spread yourself so thin.
You'll never see me giving in.
It's all of nothing.
In the moment we are living.
Please don't waste the chance we're given this time.
It could be gone in just a minute.
So find your place within it.
Slow down, we have common ground.
Before you change your mind don't you wanna try.
To see all this through someone else's eyes?
Oh, you've never been so wrong.
The struggles only just begun.
It's all or nothing.
Don't spread yourself so thin.
You'll never see me giving in.
It's all of nothing.
I've seen it all before.
Saw you walking out the door.
Just turn around cause nothings over.
Just let your guard fall down.
Keep your head below the clouds.
Here's your wake up call, some needed closer.
It's pointless just to argue.
I'm screaming, but I can't break through to you.
Oh, you've never been so wrong.
The struggles only just begun.
It's all or nothing.
Don't spread yourself so thin.
You'll never see me giving in.
It's all of nothing.
All or nothing.
