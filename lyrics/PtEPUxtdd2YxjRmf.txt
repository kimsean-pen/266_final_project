Dreamy haze come blind me
To take me where the tide lines will find me
Underneath and in between
Smiled up you come for me I see you

[Chorus]
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside

[Verse]
Come along, look down below
I want to go everywhere you go
You know the best I catch my breath
So steal me, take me in I want you

[Chorus]
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside

[Bridge]
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I can see your face I can find you
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I will see your face, I will find you
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I will see your face, I will find you
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
Let me run, let me feel like someone
I will see your face, I will find you

[Chorus x2]
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
