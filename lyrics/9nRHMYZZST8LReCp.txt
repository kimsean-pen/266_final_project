A human hand
Has written all books
A human mind
Has thought of the proof

To rule the earth
He had to ascend
To rule his peers
Their will he had to bend

Bibles are portraying a world in black and white
We invented the devil
So the devil is man

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light

Reversed is the 3rd Testament
...The 3rd Testament...
...The 3rd Testament...

A phantom god guarding your salvation
He lives in books
Your imagination
An abstract thought
Lord of all creation
An absent king
The final revelation

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light
