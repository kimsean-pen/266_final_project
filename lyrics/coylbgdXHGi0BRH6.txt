Travel the waste
Seeking the unknown
Come with me
The truth it shall be shown

Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light, beyond the down

Guilt shall not be mourned
Trampled beneath
The sickened mind that has been sworn

Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light, beyond the down

Forget all you know and all that you learned
Bridges of doubt shall all be burned
Who you are it shall be found
Through the darkened light, beyond the down
