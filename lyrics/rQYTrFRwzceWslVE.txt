Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down, get outta town

Got the stars comin' out
Over my hood
And all I know now
Is it's goin' good

You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control

I'm slowly loosin' hope of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end

Gonna cuss the mornin'
When it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain't no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile

Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss
Clock on the dash
Says 3: 35
There's plenty of gas
And the night's still alive

You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control

I'm slowly loosin' hope of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end

You've got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You've got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control

I'm slowly loosin' hope of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been from starin' at you
Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end
I don't want this night to end
No I don't want this night to end
