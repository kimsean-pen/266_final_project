Destruction is my state of mind
Armageddon, it'll come in time
When my whole world is gonna explode
My machine gun is gonna unload
Like an animal I take my prey
Where I exist I'm okay
I take no prisoners when I'm on point
Grab a chair let's wreck this joint!

You see you don't understand where I am or where I've been
Or where I'm going (where I'm going!)
You don't understand where I am or where I've been,
Or where I'm

Have you ever seen the devil?
Well I have and now he's in trouble
Our liberty and freedom I abet
Our words I will never regret
So I ain't ever gonna follow
Or beg or steal or borrow
See steady as a hand I hold
I won't do what I am told

You see you don't understand where I am or where I've been,
Or where I'm going (where I'm going!)
You don't understand where I am or where I've been
Or where I'm
Let's go!

Retaliation is my crime
Communication, a waste of time
Inebriation suits me fine
Incarcerate my own mind
When it all's just cost and concern
Knowing me you know I'm never gonna learn
Get in line cause it's your turn
Play with fire and you're gonna get burnt!

You see I don't understand where I am or where I've been
Or where I'm going (where I'm going!)
You don't understand where I am or where I've been
Or where I'm

One more time!

You see I don't understand where I am or where I've been,
Or where I'm going (where I'm going! no no!)
You don't understand where I am or where I've been,
Or where I'm going!
