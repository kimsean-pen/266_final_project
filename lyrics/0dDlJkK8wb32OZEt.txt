You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
All these reasons too hard to explain
So I'll drink you up my dear
We got it all right here
Here is now and now is where I wanna be
Allure see, you belong to me

...
And I had to get away
From this here masquerade
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
It's such a mystery, my mind philosophy
What to do when we do have some time
Allure see, you belong to me
Allure saw, never let you go

(No, no never let you go)

...
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up?
