Sat in your fast car
One last time...
I could never be your se√±orita
You've got my birthstone around your neck...
You smell of sex
You and I would make a great picture

But you like fast cars and movie stars
And I feel guilty when I have too much
You want fast cars and movie stars
I think that your ripped jeans are cool enough

I don't smoke green
But bill it up
Get lost as fuck
Four more decades 'till we need to fear (Need to fear)
If you were a rock star I'd fall in love
Your wikis dead
And your no original creature

You won't take a chance on battle scars
You want Coca-Cola figures
You want fast cars and movie stars
And I wanna train in the deep end
(Deep end)

Superstars aren't set in stone
I could never play a role
Sooner than you'll ever know
I'll be the one to take you home
Solar sounds on radio
You should know we're not alone
There's more to life than what we know
You should put down your new phone

Superstars aren't set in stone
I could never play a role
Sooner than you'll ever know
I'll be the one to take you home
Solar sounds on radio
You should know we're not alone
There's more to life than what we know
You should put down your new phone
