Cold fire feeling
there's a cold fire feeling
in my bones

sky lines breathing
as the sun lights beating
down the door
I'm tired of watching
the shadows on the wall
my eyes are for seeing
the shackles open
we're finally free to go
if you're done with believing

hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside out
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside out

found true meaning
now my head starts spinning
out the cave
you won't come with me
cause you're just too comfortable
in chains

I'm tired of watching
the shadows on the wall
my eyes are for seeing
the shackles open
we're finally free to go
if you're done with believing

hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside out

hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside out
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside
hold my
flame and set a light
hold my
fire screaming inside out
