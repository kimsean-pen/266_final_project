This is for those who wait!

Another day another waiting game
A little different but it's still the same
I am here
But where's the one I'm longing for?
I'm having trouble feeling all alone
Will my heart never find a home?
I want to hope but sometimes i just don't know

I know
I'm not
The only one
So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set your heart on fire

Let it set you free!
When you're fighting to believe
In a love that you can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait
I want to open up my eyes
I know that all i need is time

I'm growing stronger every single day
God I'm going to lead them to you now
Letting go of all my fear and doubt
I can't do this on my own
So I'll give you control
I know
I'm not

The only one
So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
let it set your heart on fire
Let it set you free!
When you're fighting to believe

In a love that you can't see

Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait
The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
The pressure makes us stronger
The struggle makes us hunger
The hard lessons make the difference
And the difference
Makes it worth it
So we sing a lullaby
To the lonely hearts tonight
Let it set your heart on fire
Let it set you free!
When you're fighting to believe
In a love that you can't see
Just know there is a purpose
For those who wait
(Let it set your heart on fire)
This is for those who wait!
