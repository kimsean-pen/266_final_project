There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him?
As much as I love her
Will that love be strong?
When old feelings start to stir

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you for the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go...

Oh, no we made it
Left each other on the way to another love...
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Ohhhhhh, we made it
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it...
Looks like we made it...
Oh, babe we made it...
