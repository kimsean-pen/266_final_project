I've done things I'm not proud of,
Dark things just to fit into a crowd I thought I belonged to...
Just goes to show.

In a jungle like this you can't ever know if you're lamb or you're lion or both
You are whatever gets you through.

I spent my life wandering through a wilderness.
Playing whatever role I had to play...
Crumbling under the weight of expectation,
Doomed, to watch my youth slip on its way.

Till I found you...
Till I found you...
(ha ha)

We lived simply away from the world that
Was trying to pull us back in,
Into the hunt, into the hunt!
They would always say "you reap what you sow",
But, in my case I just can't be true,
Cause now I hope with you.

I spent my life wandering through a wilderness.
(ha ha)
Playing whatever role I had to play...
(ha ha)
Crumbling under the weight of expectation,
(ha ha)
Doomed, to watch my youth slip on its way
(ha ha)

Till I found you...
