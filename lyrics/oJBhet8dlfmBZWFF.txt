You can feel the information in your heart
The places you would go to feed the shark
But baby you can't count on much
With every touch so out of touch
I root for you love

When you realize
Only the changing survives
You know the game is yours to lose
A truth the weight cannot confuse
I root for you love

To see you in the bloom
Someday afternoon, soon
Everyone's carrying something
Maybe I'm carrying you and you're carrying me

But always while you're wheel is wise
Know well this endless rule applies
I root for you love
