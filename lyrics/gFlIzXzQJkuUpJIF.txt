Yeah once again your kiss
Just blew me away
I ain't ever felt like this
Or ever found any words to say
How I feel when you're with me
Girl I need to let you know
So here it goes
Here I go

For the life of me
I just can't remember
Ever being one time ever
That you weren't on my mind
And for the life of me
Yeah baby i just can't see
My self my heart my soul not loving you
For the life of me

When I look at you tonight
It only lets me know
That I would be a great
If I ever let you go
So if you feel like I feel
I'll lean in for another kiss
'Cause girl you're it
For me you're in

For the life of me
I just can't remember
Ever being one time ever
That you weren't on my mind
And for the life of me
Yeah baby I just can't see
My self my heart my soul not loving you
For the life of me

For the life of me I don't know why
It's taking this long for me to say it just right
And baby tonight when I look in your eyes
Gonna lay it on the line

For the life of me
I just can't remembe
Ever being one time ever
That you weren't on my mind
And for the life of me
Yeah baby I just can't see
My self my heart my soul not loving you
For the life of me
For the life of me
