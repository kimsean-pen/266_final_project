Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

Cos you're my Number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset only seconds
Just ripe then it's gone
Got no new intentions
Just right then it's gone

Cos you're my Number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'll be there to meet you
Getting down to greet you

Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

Cos you're my Number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cos you're my Number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you

Howl under the moon
