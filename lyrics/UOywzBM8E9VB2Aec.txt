Follow me down to the water
through the tripwires in your head
through the seven layers
of your holy bed

Where there is no warm guard
by the city of systems
I wanna be your savior
I wanna be your seasonals

The only way out is through
lost my mind over you
the only way out is through
lost my mind over you

Follow me down to the freeway
where the beat goes on
and a heatwave lost the night

Say what you will but we pray
to the gods of our own demise
all the time

The only way out is through
lost my mind over you
the only way out is through
lost my mind over you

Lets build a bonfire tonight
we'll stay warm in the night time
warm in the night time

Follow me down to the water
through the tripwires in your head
through the seven layers
of your holy bed

Oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

The only way out is through
lost my mind over you
the only way out is through
lost my mind over you
the only way out
the only way out
the only way out is through
lost my mind over you
