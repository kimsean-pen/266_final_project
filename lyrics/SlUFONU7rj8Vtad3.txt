3 years, one muse
Purple haze, flowers bloomed
Running loose
Hand in hand in a golden frame

Too young, too naive
Too distracted to believe
That we'd make it through the rain
You know that seasons change

Hold on trying to make it last but I
Need to dance for me, I need to dance for me I
Back on my sauvi B
Ease my wicked mind
I, I, I, I

Late September Rose you can't grow here
Now wash away the sweet words from your mouth
Darling days are bleeding into tears
Give me solitude, I need something new

Trust me, when I say to go
Cause you lost me and I just wanted you to know
That I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so cold no
Oh, oh, there you go, my September Rose

Bedroom, 5 days
This yellow soul needs summer rays
But tell me what blooms in the shade
La la la la
, slow fade spinning in rewind
I, I, I, I

Late September Rose you can't grow here
Now wash away the sweet words from your mouth
Darling days are bleeding into tears
Give me solitude, I need something new

Trust me, when I say to go
Cause you lost me and I just wanted you to know
That I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so cold no
Oh, oh, there you go, my September Rose

Hold on tryna make it last, but I
Need to dance for me I, need to dance for me
La la la la
Back on my suavi B, ease my wicked mind
My mind, my mind, my mind

So trust me, when I say to go
Cause you lost me and I just wanted you to know
That I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so cold no
Oh, oh, there you go, my September Rose
