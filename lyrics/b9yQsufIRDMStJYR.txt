we've got a way to pave, for the young and brave
had no time to shave, we've got a world to save
thanks for all you gave, we just found your graves
we made it there too late, we hope you didn't wait

let them chant this, in the city of atlantis
let them chant this, in the city of atlantis

we've got a way to pave, for the young and brave
by inventing words, man have tamed the herds
from castle to cave, from master to slave
the men who walk on waves, walk on your graves

let them chant this, in the city of atlantis
let them chant this, in the city of atlantis
let them chant this, in the city of atlantis
let them chant this, in the city of atlantis
