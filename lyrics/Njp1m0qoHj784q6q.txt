Innocence has no resistance
Against a wicked counselor such as I
(You won't make it out)
(You won't make it out)

Shall I lead you to my parlor?
Poison offers disguised in just your size
(You won't make it out)
(You won't make it out)

You may think me altruistic
Feel my dark hypnosis closing in
(You won't make it out)
(You won't make it out)

Then you grow cold, cold as a stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close to ensnare
When I control, you will despair

You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Sycophancy solipsistic
Spider plays the fool to lure the fly
(You won't make it out)
(You won't make it out)

Then you go cold, cold as a stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close to ensnare
When I control, you will despair
