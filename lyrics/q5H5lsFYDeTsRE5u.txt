Out from my clutch your hand retreats
A universe out of contact
I maybe should have said nothing
I'll take your placid ousting easy
An underlight on the canvas
I maybe should have said something
But out from my clutch your hand retreats
I'm reduced to burning alone
Fly to my corner stone while you debate our design
Nothing like a panic attack to fine tune a heart beat
and lay the carbon ahead
I'm afraid to adjust
Love stunts in a helmet of trust
You'll never doubt I wanna conjure the past
When I do say goodbye
A universe out of contact
I maybe should have said nothing
I'm reduced to burning alone
Fly to my corner stone while you debate our design
Nothing like a panic attack to fine tune a heart beat
and lay the carbon ahead
