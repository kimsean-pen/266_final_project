I'd like to do a song
That I've never sung before
You know, when I first heard this song, it
Made me feel very sad, but it doesn't anymore
Now it just reminds me of someone very special
This is for him

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you, ooh
I will always love you
You, my darling, you, mmm-mm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you, you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you

You
Darling, I love you
I'll always
I'll always love you-ooh-ooh
