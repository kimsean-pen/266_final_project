They are up on the fences, hanging by scraps
In temporary trenches, out laying traps
Bags wrapped 'round their faces
Baseball bats and homemade taser
They've got bars and bricks and fucking bombs
And their dangerous because they don't think they're wrong

Are you friend or are you foe
Do you meet your end, with a hammer blow
Do you believe that every life is worth a shot
Or do you load the bullets up to kill the lot

It all feels so senseless, scrambling like rats
In a pit with no exits where we are the cats
Murdered by the nameless
Killed in beds where they should be safest
They're all mothers and fathers and children too
And you're scared of them 'cause they don't look like you

Are you friend or are you foe
Do you meet your end, with a hammer blow
Do you believe that every life is worth a shot
Or do you load the bullets up to kill the lot

I've seen a man on fire burning in the street
I've seen a woman buried to her neck, stoned for disbelief
I've seen a man thrown from a tower because he loved another man
I've seen a child soldier martyred by another child's hand
I've seen a stampede massacre on holy ground
And I've seen whole families being drowned
I've seen a baby lying face down in the tide
And I've seen thousands homeless begging for their fucking lives
You say they are nothing but a number
But when they speak it sounds like thunder
And all they want are your homes
Your life, your blood, your bones
