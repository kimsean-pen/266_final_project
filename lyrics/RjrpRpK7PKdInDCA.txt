Kill your past and all you thought you knew
Blacked out, hatred running through and through
Horsemen rolls, tomorrow's fading fast
Make damn sure nothing's going to last

Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now

Souls that bleed have nowhere left to run
Blind the crucifix and shoot the gun
Generals speak, we leave a trail of dead
Keep on killing till there's nothing left

Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now

Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
Doomsday Jesus, we need you now
