Eyes that shine in the spell of the night
Smart and dark he was born just to fight
Fear and pain that remains when it's cold
Arch-rival king of the mighty untold

With the shield on my left and the shiny gold sword
With the power of magic to fight the warlord

"Rain of fury" my blade, like wings in the mist
Hold my breath in the shade, both my hands on the hilt
Thousand sparkles collide, igniting the cave
There's nowhere to hide: I'm the valorous, the brave!

Broken the silence, the rite has begun
Strong words that burn like the flames of the sun
Fear and pain that remains when it's cold
The archrival king of the mighty untold

With the will on my side I'll get the prize that I deserve
With the power of God I'll have his head, I have the nerve

"Rain of fury" my blade, like wings in the mist
Hold my breath in the shade, both my hands on the hilt
Thousand sparkles collide, igniting the cave
There's nowhere to hide: I'm the valorous, the brave!

"Rain of fury" my blade, like wings in the mist
Hold my breath in the shade, both my hands on the hilt
Thousand sparkles collide, igniting the cave
There's nowhere to hide: I'm the valorous, the brave!
The brave!
