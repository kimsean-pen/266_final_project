Go!

I can feel you in the back of my skull
On my best days, worst ways
I don't wanna talk about it
I can see you waiting for me to fall
I don't wanna talk about it

I won't let you in
No I won't let you in

I will rise to walk again
I won't keep on listening
The sorrow I won't let it in
My life held by a safety pin
(Safety pin)
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin

Try to cut me from a walk to a crawl
I will get up, stand up
And now I wanna talk about it
Try to break me, I can still take a shot
I will wake up, stay up
Now I wanna talk about it
Let's fucking talk about it

I will rise to walk again
I won't keep on listening
The sorrow I won't let it in
My life held by a safety pin
(Safety pin)
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin

I will rise to walk again
I won't keep on listening
The sorrow I won't let it in
My life held by a safety pin
(Safety pin)
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin
Oh, oh, oh
By a safety pin
