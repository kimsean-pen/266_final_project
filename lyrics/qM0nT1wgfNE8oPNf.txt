These are the days
of the endless summer.

These are the days,
the time is now

There is no past,
there's only future

There's only here,
there's only now

Oh your smiling face,
your gracious presence

The fires of spring
are kindling bright

Oh the radiant heart
and the song of glory

Crying freedom
into night

These are the days
by the sparkling river

His timely grace
and our treasured find

This is the love
of the one magician

Turned the water
into wine

Instrumental...

These are days
of the endless dancing

And the long walks on
the summer night

These are the days
of the true romancing

When I'm holding you,
oh, so tight

These are the days
by the sparkling river

And His timely grace
and the treasured find

This is the love
of the one great magician

Turned the water
into wine

These are the days
now that we must savor

And we must enjoy
as we can

These are the days
that will last forever

You've got to hold them
in your heart.
