Now that shes older

As the embers of romance
Pay two mortgages and leccy bills
Been comfortable and that
Nobody told her
That she'd ever reach the stage
Where her husband bored or her
Or she lied about her age
He's compromising

At least he's got a job for life
Get born, get school, get job, get car
Pay tax and find a wife
And on that note
The end can't come too soon
If you're not living on the edge
You take up too much room
I could've been a contender

Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)
With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World

At school he used to dream about

Being Bruce Lee
But the need for chops in the Manor top
Aint all that great you see
And so he gave up
On his black belt and fast hands (?)
As near as he got to China

Was a week in Camber sands
I could've been a contender

Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)

With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World
I could've been a contender

Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one

Appearing in the papers
With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World
It's boring it's boring

It might put you to sleep
The same old routine repeating week after week
And you work harder, work harder

You're told that you must
And you must earn a living
You must earn a crust
And be like everybody else
Be like everybody else

Be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else

Just be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Just be like everybody else
Be like everybody else

I could've been a contender
I Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)
With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World
I could've been a contender
Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)
With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World
