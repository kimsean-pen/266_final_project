Step into my world!

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Whooaaaa
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Whooaaaa

Like a moth
To a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you
Better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you
Try to resist what you want, honey
I want you
To give me what I need, listen closely

I need you to (Hold on me)
I need you to (Kiss on me)
Feel your body (Next to me)
I want you to
I need you to
Want you to give (Into me)
Want all of you (Everything)
Ecstasy (will)
I will bring

You if you just
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities

Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world
Close your eyes
And let your feelings now take over
It's alright

I'm intoxicating you though you're sober
You inside
The thought alone is so overbearing
Boy tonight
You just follow my lead from herein
I need you to (Hold on me)
I need you to (Kiss on me)
Feel your body (Next to me)
I want you to

I need you to
Want you to give (Into me)
Want all of you (Everything)
Ecstasy (will)
I will bring
You if you just
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see

Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams

And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world
Where there's no reality
Time itself means nothing
It's so hypnotizing
It brings you to a state of natural high
See how my words, they get to ya
Creates the lift that's haunting ya
Yes, that's it, hold on to ya
Ooh, welcome to my world
My world
Where desires flow deep
Fantasies
Oooh, step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities (oooh)
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams (odyssey of dreams)
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world
Uh-huh
Whoooa
Uh-huh
Whoooa
