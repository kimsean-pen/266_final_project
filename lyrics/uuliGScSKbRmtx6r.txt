Driving with no brakes on
Waiting for your phone call
Talking to myself
Watching everybody else just
Roll on by

They think that I'm crazy
Not participating
Think I don't understand
What's another life out of seven billion?

Wanted to feel you but I'm numb
Don't even realize who I've become
Little white pill keeps breaking in
To read my body and mind

10, 20, 40 dumb
Happy, sad, crazy, numb
10, 20, 40, dumb
Happy, sad, crazy, numb

Trying for no reason
Giving up so easy
Talking to myself
Watching everybody else just
Roll on by

They think I'm amazing
Oh so fascinating
See they don't understand
Don't know who I am
But do I?

The less you feel, the more you know
A reason to leave me in a cruise control
A little white pill take me back
I hope you understand, it's my last resort
I've done it all

Wanted to feel you but I'm numb
Don't even realize who I've become
Little white pill keeps breaking in
To read my body and mind

Wanted to feel you but I'm numb
Don't even realize who I've become
Little white pill keeps breaking in
To read my body and mind

10, 20, 40, none
Happy, sad, crazy, done
