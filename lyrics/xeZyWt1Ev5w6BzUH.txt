Turning faded pages
A hint of calais
She was a refugee
From across the wall
Acting out a story
Written in air
Illicit in the darkness
Silent applause
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Shadows hold jealous eyes
Ice in may
Points on a silhouette
Slow fading shoes
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Acting out a story
Written in air
Illicit in the darkness
Silent applause
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mind with no end
Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
