A wreath built of withered roses
How long till it decomposes?
I don't think I can make it through this life
Without you
Of all the storms I've had to weather
You were my guiding light
In our last moments spent together
I tried to help you fight
I plead with sorrow
(as it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(won't you finally let me drown?)
The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design

A wreath built of withered roses

I curse the heavens for their thievery
You robbed me of my light
Faith is rewarded with your treachery
I've lost my will to fight

I plead with sorrow
(as it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(won't you finally let me drown)

The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design

The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind
...
How much longer must I face
A world imploding, falling grace

How much longer must I face
My self-exploding, I'm erased

Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness
...
Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness

(A world imploding, falling grace)
The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design
The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind
