One day when I came home at lunch time I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbor called Peter and a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine"
(Is pretty fine)

He took me to the future in the flux thing and I saw everything
Boy bands and another one and another one and another one
Triple breasted women swim around town totally naked!

We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
(Not much has changed but they lived underwater)
And your great, great, great grand daughter
Is pretty fine"
(Is pretty fine)

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Micheal Jackson

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
Seventh album, seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
(And your great granddaughter)
Is pretty fine"
(She's pretty fine)
Oh, oh, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
(3000)
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
(Not much has changed but they lived underwater)
And your great, great, great granddaughter
(And your great granddaughter)
Is pretty fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
(Not much has changed but they lived underwater, yeah)
And your great, great, great grand daughter
(And your great granddaughter)
She's pretty fine"
(She's pretty fine)
He said, "I've been to the year 3000
(I've been to the year 3000)
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great grand daughter
Is pretty fine
