So halfway drunk
You'd never seen
With your big eye punk
Fashion fingernails
Something cooking
When you play guitar
What a stake we're in
How did we get so far
Whatever happens we're okay
Hey we're still alive
To watch a sunset garage day
Head into the light
Oh oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
I promise us a garage day oho
See how the town comes out
Like a bruise
When the wheels go round
We can do anything
Nobody looking
And then six more come
Maybe later later
Could take it up from here
Whatever happens we're okay
Hey we're still alive
To watch a sunset garage day
Head into the light
Oh oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
Oh oh if they bring us down
We're gonna break out of this town
Into a sunset garage day oho
Yesterday looks so seem so far away
Dumbest point of this way
Waiting for a sun burn into rain
It's so fine about the high water life
Shifting with the paradise
Drifting as the drain move into flame
Oh oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
Oh oh if it all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
It's a sunset garage day oh yeah
It's a sunset garage day oh yeah yeah
It's a sunset garage day yeah yeah yeah
