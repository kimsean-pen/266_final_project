I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna live forsaken
I refuse to let this go
Because my soul is breaking
I don't wanna let you know
That my heart is just so jaded
I refuse to let it show
I refuse to let it go

Wake me up when this is over
I'm tired of living life like it's a dream
Please wake me up when it's all over
I'm tired of living right here in-between
I refuse

I've always walked alone
I chose the path less taken
I refuse to let you in
Life's a bitch and I've been shaken
It's not a joke at all
Inside my spirit's fading
I refuse to take the fall
'Cause no one cares at all

Wake me up when this is over
I'm tired of living life like it's a dream
Please wake me up when it's all over
I'm tired of living right here in-between
I refuse

'Cause at the end of the day I'm not you
I refuse

Wake me up when this is over
I'm tired of living life like it's a dream
Please wake me up when it's all over
I'm tired of living right here in-between
Wake me up when this is over
I'm tired of living life like it's a dream
Please wake me up when it's all over
I'm tired of living right here in-between

I refuse
