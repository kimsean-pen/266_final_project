Don't move back to LA
Don't move back to LA
Don't move back to LA
Although it's 70 out
Don't move back to LA
You got a bigger house
Don't move back to LA
I know you're sober now
Don't move back to LA, my baby
In your place out in LA, my baby

I'm gonna send this out to Mistress Mike
She knows who she is and what I like
I'm gonna send this out to Susan Sneeze
I'm gonna say thirty rosaries

I'm gonna tell her

Don't move back to LA
Don't get your license back
Don't move back to LA
Don't cut your intake back
Don't move back to LA
You think it's bad?

It's actually worse out in LA, my baby
Don't move back to LA, my baby

'Cause those West Coast cats
They're gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune you out
They're gonna chew you up and spit you out
They're gonna break, gonna break, gonna break, gonna break you down
They're gonna waste your time and watch you drown
They're gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make you die
You say I lost my soul or sold it out

But I told you, I want you
I told you, I want you
I told you now

Well, in two more weeks I'll drop this track
And you can have your New York City back

Well, I will send this out to Space Camp Chip
I saw him living on the ocean's lip
And I will send this to Aloha Chris
He might not agree, but I'll insist

And I will tell him
Don't move back to LA
I said I'll move back to LA
You got a Midwest song so sing it out
Don't move back to LA
You got a Deep South song so sing it out
Don't move back to LA
You got a mountain song, just sing it out

I got a East Coast song, I'll sing it out
Don't move back to LA
I won't move back to LA
To LA, my baby
Don't move back to LA

They're gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune you out
Don't move back to LA
You got a beach state song, country state song, wolverine state song
They're gonna break, gonna break, gonna break, gonna break you down
Don't move back to LA
So sing it out
Or fight it out, sing it out
They're gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make you die
Oh
Don't move back to LA
They're gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune, gonna tune you out
Don't move back to LA
They're gonna break, gonna break, gonna break, gonna break you down
