you have stripped my heart of all it's parts
and gave away the scrap for free

you have sold your soul for some control
and gnawed at the hands that tried to love and feed

you are crying out to end the drought
yet it's not your blood that filled this sea

all of the mistakes left in your wake
they all remind me of a younger me

to the parasites that have come and gone
this is your farewell song

to the parasites that have come and gone
this is your farewell song

run, just run away
