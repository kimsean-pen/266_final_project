Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
Have trigger, will travel, have trigger, will travel
Feeding frenzy, it's contagious
Have trigger, will travel, have trigger, will travel

Single sparks are spectral fires
Have trigger, will travel, have trigger, will travel

A single spark can start a spectral fire
Have trigger, will travel, have trigger, will travel

Have trigger, will travel, have trigger, will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire

A single spark can start a spectral fire
Have trigger, will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire
Have trigger, will travel

A single spark can start a spectral fire
Have trigger, will travel
A single spark can start a spectral fire
