This sinking feeling sets
It feels just like a hole inside your chest
I know you're thinking
No, no, no, no, it is easier said than done
But please let me attest
I know it's hard

You're feeling like you're trapped
But that's how you react
When you cannot see the light
But try and see the light
I'm tellin' you
No, no, no, no
You're the only one
Standing in your way
Just take a breath
Relax, and tell me

Why?
Please tell me why do we worry?
Why?
Why do we worry at all?
Why?
Just tell me, why do we worry?
When worry is never helping
Tell me why, why worry at all?

Why do we insist
On crossing bridges that do not exist?
Let's take these issues
Step by step by step, to work it out
Day by day by day we're falling down
But life goes on

I've got some questions
Are you sick of feelin' sorry? (Uh huh)
And people sayin' not to worry? (Uh huh)
Sick of hearing this hakuna matata motto
From people who won the lotto
We're not that lucky
Have you noticed that you're breathing? (Uh huh)
Look around and count your blessings (Uh huh)

So when you're sick of all this stressin' and guessin' I'm
Suggestin' you turn this up and let them hear you sing it

Why?
Please tell me why do we worry?
Why?
Why do we worry at all?
Why?
Just tell me, why do we worry?
When worry is never helping
Tell me why, why worry at all?

Chin up, quit actin' like you're half dead
Tears can only half fill how you're feelin'
Don't worry, be happy baby

Stand up, life is too damn short
That clock is ticking
Man up, if ya feel me
Everybody sing it

Why?
Please tell me why do we worry?
Why?
Why do we worry at all?
Why?
Just tell me, why do we worry?
When worry is never helping
Tell me why, why worry at all?

Why?
Please tell me why do we worry?
Why?
Why do we worry at all?
Why?
Just tell me, why do we worry?
When worry is never helping
I'm not buying what they're selling
So if worry is never helping
Tell me why, why worry at all?
