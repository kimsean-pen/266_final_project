Turn to Stone

Hey now the well run dry
Pages of the book on fire
Read the writing ...on the wall...

Hoedown, say showdown
Everywhere you look
they're fighting... Hear the call...

And you know its getting stronger,
It can't last very much longer
Turn to stone

(Break/Short Solo 1)

Well there's a change in the wind
You know the signs don't lie
Such a strange feeling and I don't know why
Its takin'... such a long time ...

Backyard people and they work all day
Tired of the speeches
And the way the reasons they keep changin'...
Just to make the Words Rhyme...

And you know its getting stronger,
Can't fake 'em out much longer
Turn to stone

(Solo 2)

And you know its getting stronger,
It can't last very much longer
Turn to stone

(Quiet Break)

(Break/Solo 3 to end)
