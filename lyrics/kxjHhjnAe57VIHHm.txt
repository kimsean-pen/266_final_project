You might as well invite Skits then?
- Barrin' barrin' barrin'

She said, she said, she said
She said she wanna do drugs.

I'm Skits girl I'm not sane
On a dark night I go bane
I ain't lying girl I ain't tame
Like EA Sports I got game
No cocaine, where the weed at?
Come my drum I'll beat that
My loves like drugs, you'll relapse
I'll make it sink in like bean bags

Shout "Free Max" when I feel waved
Scratch my back like you're a DJ
Bring your friends we can have a three way
If your hips don't lie, girl call me Pique
If I move to fast, slow it down.
Moscow flows I'm coldest out
Big like Tobz girl you know my style

Eh, she went down for the camera
Told her smile for the camera
I went Blaow with the camera
Then I went down with the hammer
You and your three friends
Come link with us for the weekend
Them man pree us, we don't pree them
My dons finesse it in Sweden

See I had a down ting, browning, stepping all over me
Meant to elope but supposedly
Hoes'll be hoes so these hoes'll be
Holding her phone when she rolls with me
Texting her man
But now Gyal wanna act so I close the scene
Till man are feenin' like Jodeci
Head held over me
Pun that. Run back
Sex getting overly mad
Short little nigga with the backpack
Caught with her figure so I grabbed that,
Bored of her nigga and if that's that
Snap back, socks and a t and of course I deliver when I tap that
She was on all fours like, 'babe, am I all yours?'
Quick pause, then I thought, man ah mad gassed
All on my floor with her slippers and her mad back
Just a yellow nigga in a rat trap, scrap that!

Eh, she went down for the camera
Told her smile for the camera
I went Blaow with the camera
Then I went down with the hammer
You and your three friends
Come link with us for the weekend
Them man pree us, we don't pree them
My dons finesse it in Sweden

Bless the pussy, been a reverend
Gassed up when I revved it
Dm's to a text message, take a sip of my beverage
Fuck the body and her bredrin
I'm 'a turn Justin Slayer in a second
Just to slay her in a second
Just to lay the lethal weapon

She said, she said, she said
She said she wanna do drugs.
