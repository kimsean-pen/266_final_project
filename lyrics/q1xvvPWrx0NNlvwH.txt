You wanna know
Why you feel so hollow?
Because you are
You're missing out?
Well, if you say so
Then you're missing out

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

You wanna know
Just how long you can hide from
What you are?
Not very long
I have been lost
Down every road I follow
Out in the dark
On my way home

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?
But I feel nothing, am I better yet?

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
