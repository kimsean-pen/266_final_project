In the morning
She gone crazy
With a painted picture
Her father's story.

Bone China, my friends...
Bone China, let the summer come again, come again.
I said oh, oh
She be dancing by the moonlit sky
Oh oh
She be moving like a butterfly
Oh oh
She be drinking all my early times
I'm just a waitin' on that dream
Cause the fast ones always ride for free.

Ugly morning
She Jezebel's daughter
She like a Brunhilda
A child of the water.

Bone China, my friends
Bone China, let the summer come again,
Come again I said
Oh oh
She be dancing by the moonlit sky (I'm talking to you)
Oh oh
She be moving like a butterfly (sting like a bee)
Oh oh
She be shakin like the girl from Shine
Oh oh
She be moving like a...
She be moving like a...
High falootin' like a...

I'm just waiting on that dream
Because the fast ones always ride for free
I, I, I
I'm just a waitin' on that dream
Cause the fast ones, the fast ones
Always ride for free...
