Come to me my love
One more night
Come on
Cause I don't wanna be without
Without you

In the air tonight
So cold and strange
Winter of loss
When I have changed
She is floating out too soon
So soon

In our room
Inside
With these ones
I want to hide
She is floating out too fast
Too fast

Come to me
My love
One more night
Come on
Cause I just wanna talk with you
Again

Come to me
My love
One more night
Come on
Cause I just wanna hold you close
Again
