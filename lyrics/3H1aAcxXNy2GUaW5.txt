A love song was playing on the radio
It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you
And I wonder how you're doing but I wish I didn't care
Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song

Didn't it break your heart
When you watched my smile fading
Did it ever cross your mind
That one day the tables would be turned
They told me the best revenge
Would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds
Would be the hardest one to earn

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song
Oh, any time I hear that song

When I woke up in the morning I was choking on some words
There were things unsaid between us
There were things you never told
Now that's twice you broke my heart now
The first was way back when
And to know you're still unhappy
Only makes it break again

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine

By the way, I forgive you
I never will, never will forget you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song
Oh, any time I hear that song
Oh, any time I hear that song
Ooh, ooh, hmm
