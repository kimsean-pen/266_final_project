I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancin' by
In the mornin' and the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should
Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good
Or is it comin' back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losin'
And your fuse is fireside?

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane
You like still looks the same
But somethin' about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should
Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good
Or is it comin' back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losin'
And your fuse is fireside?

And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage
To make it through the day without thinkin' of you lately

I'm not sure if I should
Show you what I've found
Has it gone for good
Or is it comin' back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losin'
And your fuse is fireside?
