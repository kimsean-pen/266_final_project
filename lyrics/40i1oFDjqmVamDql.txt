Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

No more times second guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough

'Til I see the turning tides are coming from you
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side

And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side

If we want to stay here
Can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us
Filling our insides
In the rising water
In the rising tide
They're spilling over me
Filling my insides
If we want to stay here

Can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us
Filling our insides
In the rising water
In the rising tides
We wait for the fall
Maybe the water's high
But I can see the difference
Maybe the water's high
But I can see the difference
Maybe the water's high
But I can see the difference

Maybe the water's high
But I know that this is different
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
Take, take, take, take
