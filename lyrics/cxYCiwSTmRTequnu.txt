Listen here mang
Just be real, be real with yourself
When you real you gon shine you gon be like gold
But when you fake, you gon be green like your neck
Like when you wear them fake ass chains

Red light green light
Pull up on time
No brakes no lie
West side for life
Red light green light
Get yours I get mine
Diamonds so bright
Well alright, alright

Blinded by the way it glow
Everything that glitter ain't gold
I been faded way too long
Everything that glitter ain't gold
So I had to go and sell my soul
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo

Fur coats, Burberry
Linked up, that's Hermes
She want more, urgent
So we cop more them purses
Pour the Merlot
With the herb rolled
In the front row pose for the photo
Red light green light red light
Wait wait wait, let's go

Blinded by the way it glow
Everything that glitter ain't gold
I been faded way too long
Everything that glitter ain't gold
So I had to go and sell my soul
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo

Everybody grow from pain
Eased by them shiny things
That's why I'm stacking my ends in them rubberbands
Packing a fat one in the back of the pocket
Like robbin a bank how I live on ten
Living that dream, heavy my chain
Pick up the pace, what does it change?
Pick it up pick it up pick it up slow
Kill em with kindness
Making no promise
Kill em with diamonds
Fill up my chalice with that good cognac
She want a challenge
Give her them pearls and she bring out them talents
Balance walk on this tightrope
Nah I moonwalk like Michael
Whoa to Jupiter I go
Wait wuh?

Blinded by the way it glow
Everything that glitter ain't gold
I been faded way too long
Everything that glitter ain't gold
So I had to go and sell my soul
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo
I'm dripping dripping dripping
Ice so cold, ice so cold
Yeah I'm drippin drippin drippin ice so woo
