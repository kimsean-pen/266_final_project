City nights, summer breezes makes you feel all right
Neon lights, shinin' brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
Give you love, if the price is right
Black or white, In the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta site, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
Like some girls, it makes you wonder why
City life, sure its cool, but it cuts like a knife, it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality, it's just a fantasy

Can't you see what this crazy life is doin' to me?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?

So forget all that you see
It's not reality, it's just a fantasy

Can't you see what this crazy life is doin' to me?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
I know, I know
