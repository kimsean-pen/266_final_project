It's 3AM
And I am laying wide-awake
And I can't sleep for the noise inside my head

The world vibrating
With a cruel cacophony
Flooded with the thoughts my mind has bled

The restless furor
Of a thousand racing thoughts
Swarms around me like a vulture circles prey

In the darkness
No one else can hear a sound
But I am deafened by this ceaseless disarray

I could scream myself to sleep
If it would shatter the illusion
But I can't give in to this
It's the noise that makes me human

Waking life
Like a movie on a screen
Running backwards as the film starts to unthread

A wall of violence
Bounding forward through the peace
With no regard for what might lie ahead

An infestation
Of arbitrary thought
Washes over me in paralyzing waves

My defenses
Battered by the driving storm
Isolated â€“ waiting to be saved

I could scream myself to sleep
If it would shatter the illusion
But I can't give in to this
It's the noise that makes me human

It's much too late
And I am slowly losing ground
A prisoner to the noise inside my head

Disconnected
I am trapped within myself
Held captive by a tide that never ebbs

I could scream myself to sleep
If it would shatter the illusion
But I can't give in to this
It's the noise that makes me human
