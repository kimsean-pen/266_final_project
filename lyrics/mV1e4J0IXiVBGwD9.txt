Ooh, ooh, ooh
It was spring
That look, that look you gave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Rivet use far
Would you let them slumber
Whisper the name
Sunrise call
If there's no tomorrow
Just wait all the same

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You've been gone
Been locked up
Should've wrote you long
Pitch black before they ask you for your last words
Softly spoken lines
You're mumbling and maybe she heard
Say it one more time
Not even a river on a cheek
She sat across the bar for weeks
Getting sober

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The world is numb
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And crow for song
Ooh
The bubbles swing
And she preys, the only one in her heart
Ooh

The girl, she jumped from the rooftop
And now I landed because you woke from your sleep
But, you have the wings to be a soul
Another lullaby to sing now
There's a place far away that's better
You said, "I wanted to go there"
She said, "I'll go, honest, we'll stay together
Cause you're the only one"

Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
Only one that's in my heart
heart heart heart...
