Won't you just admit it
'Cause I don't need your gratitude
Don't you try to hide it
Just tell me the truth
I can't go on this way
Looking for something that isn't there
Should I be on my way
Because I need a reason for this pain

(Chorus)
Tell me if you don't love me anymore
Just tell me if you don't care about me anymore
Just tell me if you don't want it
Just tell me

I never thought this day would come
But a test of love, I need from you
Honesty is always seen through eyes
I wish you would believe
I've given you my all
But it's not pleasing your distant heart
If you respect my love, you'll hear my plea
You'll hear my plea

(Chorus to fade w/Beyonce ad-libing)
