you were my best friend
i thought i'd have ya 'til the world ends
and now i'm staring at a blank page,
hoping i'll get by when someone passing by says yr name
it's hard to see
what you mean to me
i'll never know
why it's got me so low
we got a long way
but if we stop now, what does that say?
i wanna keep it cool but you don't, that's fine
take yr time and i'll do with the landslide
and keep it inside
it's hard to see
what ya mean to me
we'll never know
why it's got me so low
