Wake up my sweet child
There's something I've got to say to you tonight
It's time you took a look at me
'Cause there's so much more to me than meets the eye

Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look the more you'll find
It's never easy - no matter what they say

Chorus:
Love's a hard game to play
The heart's the price you pay
Love's a hard game to play
No matter what they say
Win or lose, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play

The problem here is not my fear
The trouble is you can't convince yourself
For tonight, let's lose the past
Make love last - Put our worries up on the shelf

We've been through thick and thin, and back again
And we can endure love's sweet pain
Remember, starting the fire is easy
The hardest part is learning how to keep the flame

Love's like walking a real fine line
You get too close and you'll go blind
Let go too long and it will drift away

Repeat Chorus

Just when I feel like I'm losin' you
I hear the voices call
They say it's better to have lost at love
Than never to have loved at all
Lose or win, stand or fall

Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look, the more you'll find
It's never easy, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play
A hard game to play
