I've seen within my heart
Found a great eclipsing dark in me
Thought I could face my end but now
Every time I bleed is close enough

I've learned to count this all
Lead the fight and heed my call again
No time to waste in vain because
Every time I bleed is close enough

I can't lose my balance
Pray no weight would slow me down
I can't face the outcome
Every time I bleed is close enough

One step from home
Close enough to hear my final song

Every fear my shadow
Cross the face of all you gave
Oh what faint conviction
Every time I bleed, I swear
Every time I bleed is close enough

One step from home
Close enough to hear my final song
All the unknown
Close enough to feel my soul move on

One step from home
Close enough to hear my final song
All the unknown
Close enough to feel my soul move on
