Hear me now

Bearing down upon a path we choose
Chosen from the start living different rules
Existence something to cherish true
Will not succumb to doubts that I hold onto
Release the fear of my pain, in so much pain
Give me the will to fight
Every obstacle that I have inside
Release my fear and...

Hear me now
Words I vow
No fucking regrets
Fuck these chains
No god damn slave
I will be different
I'll stand here defiantly
My middle finger raised
Fuck your prejudice

All my life always I've felt alone
Conditioned to believe that I'm always wrong
Only truth will help to set me free
My every weakness I must turn into strength
Every rage, every tear
Hate in so much hate
Never that pain will bind me
Ask of myself if I've the will to unwind
Every rage and tear

Hear me now
Words I vow
No fucking regrets
Fuck these chains
No god damn slave
I will be different
I'll stand here defiantly
My middle finger raised
Fuck your prejudice

Carved upon my stone
I will go on
Patience, belief
Love will ascend

Just listen to it
Voice so true inside calling
To stand you up and march you on
Keep from falling
Let go your sorrow
Sun will shine, this I promise
Rising tommorow
Rising

Hear me now
I'm taking back the control of my
Life from society's hold, I vow
No more will I be a slave
Rise to challenge the whole human race
My spirit you cannot break
When we won't lose
