Where were you when the lights when out?
Where were you when I almost drown?
Where were you when the fire went down?
Where were you when you lost your fun?
But you, last in the way of your mind
Oh and you, you take it all in your stride

Don't apologize, mhm-mhm
Don't apologize, mhm-mhm
Oh-oh, I don't hold a grudge
I just know if the feeling's right, hmm
I don't care if you say that you're sorry
I know she's right
I, oh, don't apologize
Don't you come back
Don't apologize
Don't you come back
I don't hold a grudge
I just know if the feeling's right

Where were you when I caught a hole?
I was sick and I waited for you
Where were you when they tied me down?
I was broke, but I could have used you
Oh, where were you when I lost control?
Sirens ringing, they sent me home
Told me I should be on my own
Where were you when I lost control?
I was sick but you never called
You missed out on it all

I don't hold a grudge
I just know if the feeling's right, hmm
I don't care if you say that you're sorry
I know she's right
I, oh, don't apologize
Don't you come back
Don't apologize
Don't you come back
I don't hold a grudge
I just know if the feeling's right

Where were you? (Where were you?)
Where were you when I lost control?
Where were you?
Sirens ringing, they sent me home
(Sirens ringing, they sent me home)

I, oh, don't apologize
Don't you come back
Don't apologize
Don't you come back
I don't hold a grudge
I just know if the feeling's right
