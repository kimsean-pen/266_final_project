Locked up in my hurricane head
Bloody knuckles paint the whole place red
Straitjacket, straight tie me to the bed
All alone in a room full of misfits
Cold blooded, cold hearted on a hit list
Paranoid, struggling, I gotta kick this

Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me

Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth
My crooked teeth

Caved in, hyperventilating
Cutting way too close to my skin
I feel the devil trying to creep back in
I feel the devil trying to creep back in
I'm possessed by the every day stress
Flash back and I'm trying to forget
Bloody hell, bloody knife, bloody mess

Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth

Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me

Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth
My crooked teeth
