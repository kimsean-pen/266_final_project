C-O-double M-O-N
A wave
An awesome wave
That rushes skin and widens in blooded veins.
Breath in, exhale
I've poked a nerve he'll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N.

Tide out
Tide in
A flood of blood to the heart
And the fear slipstreams.
Breath in, exhale
I've poked a nerve he'll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N.
Flood, flood, flood, flood
Of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
Flood, flood, flood, flood
Of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
Flood, flood, flood, flood
Of blood, blood, blood
To the heart, heart, heart
To the heart, heart, heart, heart
Flood of blood to the heart.
