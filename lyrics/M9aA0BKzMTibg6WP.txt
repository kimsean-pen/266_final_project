Been hiding in a tree,
When the whole world is right beneath my feet
Will it hurt when I come down?
I've seen it in my dreams, so close but yet to hard to reach
I've been in my head, outside of the blue
Dreaming 'bout the sun to shine through
Oh, I wanna feel the warm breeze on my skin
All I wanna do is break away from here so
I'll come down
I'll be unbound
I'll run to leave the past behind
The here and now is real
A touch from the sun, now I feel
The burst from the wind at my back
The the road is cleared of all it's cracks
Eyes fixed on what's ahead
Not looking back, the tree is dead
I'll come down
I'll be unbound
I'll run to leave the past behind
The here and now is real
A touch from the sun, now I feel
I'm not afraid to fade from the rain
I'm no longer a slave to the pain
I'm here to remain
But I won't stay the same
I'll come down
I'll be unbound
I'll run to leave the past behind
Then here and now is real
I'll come down
I'll be unbound
I'll run to leave the past behind
The here and now is real
A touch from the sun, now i fell
