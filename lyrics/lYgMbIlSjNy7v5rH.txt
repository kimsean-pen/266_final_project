Under the night lights
You're looking for some place to go
(For some place to go)
Well you didn't mean to hurt them
But now he's bleeding on the floor
(Bleeding on the floor)

You were feeling good
So you thought you'd have one more
(Thought you'd have one more)
But now look at you
You're paralytic on the floor
(Laying on the floor)

And it's the stories that you hear
Oh sometimes it will let you see
Don't you know that's all you need
Don't you know that's all you need
