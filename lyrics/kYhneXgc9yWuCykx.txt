The street's a liar
I'm gonna lure you into the dark
My cold desire
To hear the boom, boom, boom of your heart

The danger is I'm dangerous
And I might just tear you apart
Oh, ohah, oh

I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
Oh, ah, oh
I wanna taste the way that you bleed, oh, ohah, oh
You're my kill of the night

Now you're mine
But what do I do with you, boy
I'll take your heart
To kick around as a toy

The danger is I'm dangerous
And I might just tear you apart
Oh, ohah, oh

I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
Oh, ah, oh
I wanna taste the way that you bleed, oh, ohah, oh
I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
Oh, ah, oh
I wanna taste the way that you bleed, oh, ohah, oh

This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
This is a bad town for such a pretty face
Oh, ohah, oh

I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
Oh, ah, oh
I wanna taste the way that you bleed, oh, ohah, oh
I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
Oh, ah, oh
I wanna taste the way that you bleed, oh, ohah, oh
You're my kill of the night
