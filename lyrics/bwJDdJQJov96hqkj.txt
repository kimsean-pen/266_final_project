I am inadequate because I can't make you see yourself the way I wish you could

Skin peeled under the golden sun
its worth it to feel anything at all
you said our insecurities fit us so well
narcissistic nature rest in my brain,
bi-polar feelings put me to shame,
but i think i love you and before you are gone
lets watch anime love stories all night long
