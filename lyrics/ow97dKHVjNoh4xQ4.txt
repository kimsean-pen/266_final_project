It's time to say a word.
Say it like you mean it,
She spoke with a tone of hurt.
As my eyes rolled back,
Hoping for the end.
One too many condescending battles for a friend.
Say another word
And I'll sit on the floor,
Keep talking down to me,
You're not only losing me,
You're losing what's in store.

I tried to stay awake, when I go, when i get home
I tried to stay awake, over the phone
So I could tell the truth, tell the truth.

Something is still getting in the way between you and I,
on summer holiday.
Just wait one minute more,
cause my heart is half way torn
and your already gone, your already gone.

I tried to stay awake,(so i can tell you) when I go, when i get home
I tried to stay awake,(so i can tell you) over the phone
So I could tell the truth, tell the truth.

Say another word.
Face first on the floor,
Keep talking down to me
losing what was almost meant to be.

I tried to stay awake,(so I could tell you) when I go, when I get home.
I tried to stay awake,(so I could tell you) over the phone, so I could tell the truth.
