Every night
I take myself to where the skies are blue
To where we swim when I met you

Stay here
I spent the best days of my life with you
Watching clouds form in the distance
I watch the sunset on the beach with you
It's not over yet

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

Let's begin again
Let's get back to where we started
When there was talk of getting older
I've been waiting by the water
Let's start over

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I know that the words don't change and
I know that your heart keeps aching
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

Even when the light can't find me
I know that the sun keeps shining
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

Oh, I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
