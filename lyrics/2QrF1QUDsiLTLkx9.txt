Look in the mirror, time to face up
Ever tried to live without the photographs and money
Don't have to live behind the makeup
'Cuz all I want is what's itching inside of you

'Cuz I saw you sitting in the rain
With the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see you like this
But just open your eyes and watch it fade away
'Cuz I saw you sitting in the rain
With the tears running down, running down your face
Can't you see it's a masquerade? So get yourself together

Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?
And plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?

I wouldn't say that it's so serious
I know you think you're in a tragic condition
You know, I'm a little bit more than curious
When all I want is what's kicking inside of you

'Cuz I saw you sitting in the rain
With the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see you like this
But just open your eyes and watch it fade away
'Cuz I saw you sitting in the rain
With the tears running down, running down your face
Can't you see it's a masquerade? So get yourself together

Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?
And plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?

Plug it in
Plug it in

Ever tried to live without the makeup
Ever tried to live without the makeup
Ever tried to live without the makeup
Ever tried to live

Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?
Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?

Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?
Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?

Plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?
Oh, plug it in, plug it in, baby
Where you been, where you been, baby?

Just plug it in
Just plug it in

Just feel so plugged
Oh, baby so, oh
