Hurry home,
Freight train running.
I've been gone,
Too long, honey.
Why did I waste away the only good thing left to save me?
Hurry home,
Freight train running.
She's alone, got no money.

(She's alone, she's got no money
I'm coming home, I've done my running)
I'm coming home,
No more running,
Why now should I deny the only true thing left inside me?
Coming home,
No more running.
Well, I'm doing right
Oh, for once in my life now
I'm doing right, hey!
For once in my life now
No more running (he's doing it right)

No more running (he's doing right) I'm doing right, doing right
No more running (he's doing it right)
No more running (he's doing it right)
Oh-ah, no more running

Instruments
Rolling countries, fields unfolding
I swear the winds are calling
Old country, fields are flowing
I swear the winds are calling
So I hurry home

No more running
She's all alone
She's got no money
(She's alone, she's got no money

I'm coming home, I've done my running)
Why should I go and hide the,
Only true thing left inside me?
(Hurry) Hurry home
Freight train running
Well, I'm doing right
Oh, for once in my life now
I'm doing it right, doing it right
For once in my life now
No more running (he's doing right)
No more running (He's doing right) I'm doing right, doing it right
No more running (He's doing right)

No more running anymore (He's doing right)
No more running, no more running (he's doing right)
I'm going home now (Yeah, he's doing right)
I'm going home

No more running (He's doing right)
I've been away now (He's doing right)
I'm doing it right, I'm doing it right (He's doing right)
I've got a girl at home and (she's doing it right) (Ooh!)
Oh, baby, oh darling (He's doing it right) Can't you see?!
Oh, no more running! (He's doing it right!)
I'm doing it right
Yeah, for once in my life, I'm doing it right
