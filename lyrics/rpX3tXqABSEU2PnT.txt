A long so deep it bruises the inner depths of your soul
A fate you just can't wrap your head around
A feeling you can't describe as it blackens all that you see
And all you can see is death and despair

Nothing is beautiful and the colors all turn to grey
The sun doesn't shine behind the clouds of your dismay

I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this, no
I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this, no

And I don't see how this makes me a better man
Was this hole inside part of a bigger plan?
They say life goes on but it doesn't go on the same
Not even the taste of blood will satisfy the pain

Nothing is beautiful and the colors all turn to grey
The sun doesn't shine behind the clouds of your dismay

I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this, no
I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this, no

Nothing is beautiful and the colors all turn to grey
The sun doesn't shine behind the clouds of your dismay

I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this,
no I may never recover from this
I may never recover from this, no

End
