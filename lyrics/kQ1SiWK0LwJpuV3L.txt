DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feelin' low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

Watch me take it up, then I break it down
I don't play sports, but it's a touchdown
I don't blend in, I-I'm a black sheep
And even then, ha, they still follow me
I rock the race stripes, can, go and check my closet
Never share the guap, can, go and check my wallet
I'm a comet out of this planet
Sitting on the throne, and these haters can't stand it

DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feelin' low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ, spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

Now watch me do my thing, do my thing out on the stage
I become an animal, go and put me in a cage
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
Why they let me off my leash
No you can't tame me, in this jungle of concrete
I'm a creature, I ain't lying
Not a cheater, I'm a lioness
They saying that I'm the best
And I ain't drop an album yet
I got them waiting
Anticipating
They losing patience
My music is vaccination for all my loyal patients

DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ, spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

Ride
Silver moon, moon light
Let the boom, boom play
Turn it up till you feel that bass
Rock
Never gon, gon stop
Say whatcha wan, wan say
We sayin' keep going anyway

DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ, spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah

DJ, play my song on the radio
Lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
DJ, spin it back
If you feeling me
The 808 track is all I need
Drop the beat and play it again
Play it again yeah
