Mom and dad told me
"When you were on the way
They wouldn't love me any less"
Well, I didn't believe them
I thought you'd take my place
I didn't know a best friend is what I'd get

Through the years I make mistakes
So you don't have to make them
I took chances every day
So you'd know when to take on
You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow
If you so choose
You can take the road less travelled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
But if you're lost and feeling broken
Through and through
You can follow the Footprints
I left for you

I know it wasn't easy
Learning how to share
But now we get to share the memories
And all the times we argued
Swore we'd never speak again

Through the year I'd make mistakes
So you don't have to make them
I took chances every day
So you'd know when to take on
You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow
If you so choose
You can take the road less travelled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
If you're lost and feeling broken
Through and through
You can follow the Footprints
I left for you

And if one day you run right past me
Chasing down your dreams
I hope I can look ahead
And you'd tun and say to me

Through the year I'd make mistakes
So you don't have to make them
Took chances every day
So you'd know when to make them
You can follow my footprints
But you don't have to fill my shoes
It's just a path for you to follow
If you so choose
You can take the road less travelled
Yeah, I'd probably do that too
If you're lost and feeling broken
Down and Bruised
You can follow the Footprints
I left for you
You can follow my footprints
I left for you
