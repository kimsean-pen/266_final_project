So many times this has happened before
But I never knew that love could make me feel this sore
I could speak to you, you could speak to me
Oh but it will never happen, what will be will be
So I'll just lie and dream of the chances I've missed

Tell me fondly you love me, then how could I resist?
Who doesn't know I exist
Who doesn't know I exist
Doesn't know I exist
