Girl had a baby
And she gave it to the world
World didn't want to take
The baby from the girl

Flowed on the waterway
Your time
It never change your heart
Your life
Around again
You'll fly far away

Time
Will never destory your heart
Time
Will never destory your heart

So in the reeds
Beside the river
Where she lay
Give it to the river
Let the water show the way

Flowed on the waterway
Your time
It never change your heart
Your life
Around again
You'll fly far away

Time
Will never destory your heart
Time
Will never destory your heart

Flowed on the waterway
Your time
Never change your life
Your life around again
You'll fly far away

Time
Will never destory your heart
Time
Will never destory your heart
Time
Will never destory your heart
Time
Will never destory your heart
