Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local D.J.
Well, it's a jumping little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, gotta hear it again today.
You know, my temperature's rising, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, my heart's beating a rhythm, shakin' out rhythm and blues
Roll over Beethoven, rockin' in two by two.
Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now
Go for cover and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news
Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, gonna play my fiddle
I ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news
Well, she wiggles like a glow-worm, she dances like a spinning top
Yeah, she got a crazy partner, you should have seen her reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music will never stop.
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
