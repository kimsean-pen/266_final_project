I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by demons in abodes of the end
The reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life I have become
The resurrection of the evil one
'Yknow that I don't fucking care If I live or die

I need a bishop preaching fire
To get away with my sins
I despise everything I see

Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckas just leave me be
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside

I need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins
I despise everything I see
I don't give a fuck if you HATE ME!
Led by the reaper I walk in the night

Show me the way to yer kingdom come
I believe in armageddon, I've been baptised in alcohol

I'm embodyment of antichrist
I'm living for my own demise
I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by the demons in abodes of the end

The reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life I have become
The resurrection of the evil one
Y'know that I don't fucking care if I live or die
I need a bishop preaching fire
to get away with my sins

I despise everything I see
I don't give a fuck if you HATE ME!
Led by the reaper I walk in the night
Show me the way to your kingdom come
I believe in Armageddon, I've been baptised in alcohol
I've been baptised in alcohol
I'm living for my own demise
If you HATE ME!
