Possession of the mind is a terrible thing
It's a transformation with an urge to kill
Not the body of a man from earth
Not the face of the one you love

'Cause well
I turned into a martian
Woah oh oh
I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Sometimes I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Well I turned into a martian today

I walk down city streets
On an unsuspecting human world
Inhuman in your midst
This world is mine to own

'Cause well
I turned into a martian
Woah oh oh
I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Sometimes I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Well I turned into a martian today

Go
Go

Well I turned into a martian
Woah oh oh
Well I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Sometimes I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Turned into a Martian
Woah oh oh
Can't even recall my name
Won't you tell me what the fuck is my name
Martian
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
