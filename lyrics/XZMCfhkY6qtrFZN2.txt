There's a girl named Kate
and she thinks she's really great
but she's not

All the boys stare at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair

We gave her a chance
We gave her a hint
We offered help but she didn't accepted
We don't want you
We can't use you
You're too good for us

Break out in tears for all your fears
You're too good for us

You're too weak
You're so sweet
You're too good for us

You're so nice
And you think you're out of sight
You're too nice

There's a girl named Kate
and she thinks she's really great
but she's not

When she falls down
everyone turns around
When she falls down

They pick her up
They pick her up
They take her to the corner
They pay for her bus

It's not fair
It's not fair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair
It's not fair
Everyone stares at her
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
Everyone stares at her
It's not fair for the girls with brown hair
It's not fair for the girls with red hair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair

Go home
Go home
We don't want you anymore
Go home
Go home
Get out

It's not fair
It's not fair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair
It's not fair
Everyone stares at her
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair for the girl with blonde hair
Everyone stares at the girl with blonde hair
It's not fair
