We bathe in the Blood Moon in Berlin
Make out in cathedrals, Montreal to Madrid
In Fallingwater, brush our skin across the bed
The Masaya Volcano paints our faces in red
Now the landscape in your eye is a desert of defeat
I want to stay but I'll turn to leave
Tonight we'll abandon all we share
Force a deep sleep and pretend we don't care
I'd hate to put us up against yesterday
I guess what can't be close must be far away

'Cause the past will kill the present and if I let it
The past will kill the present if I let it
The past will kill the present if I let it
The past will kill the present if I let it

I dream in dripping colors of every ruin
We'll never lose ourselves in if I go on obsessing over
Coloring my memories with a more vibrant palette
Than existed, singin':
Those saturated rains could never flood the imprint of
One hand on the wheel, your other on my neck
Moving me through, moving me through, moving me through if
Ever I forget how much love there is
It's just I've become fixated on all of the love I'd miss

'Cause the future kills the present and if I let it
The future kills the present if I let it
The future kills the present if I let it
The future kills the present

If every head is a world, I don't want to
Be a destroyer of all things
Pure in my own
When I'm running from a day yet to bare its teeth
I see my only
Moment crumbling
Crumbling
If every head is a world, I don't want to
Be a destroyer of all things
Pure in my own
When I'm crawling towards a night that I'm convinced was
Golden
And glowing
Glowing

It takes a conscious effort to hollow out this head
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
My brain is a constant rain on its own shelter
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
But there's a parade in that dread
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
There's a symphony swaying in the downpour
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
And it plays me to sleep
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
Eventually, each night into my morning
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
And I can't go on ignoring the tender heart
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
In my chest and the splendor in its beating
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
Oh, the pain in possessing such a tenderness
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
But what else is worth possessing?
(Even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing)
When even in the tremor I feel a stillness growing
