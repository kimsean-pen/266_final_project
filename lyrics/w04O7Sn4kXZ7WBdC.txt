I. Different?

Once in the middle of the crowd
I stopped
Suddenly I felt so good
Not being on the move
But become an obstruction
In your way
And I was surprised
How fast you could unite
Against me

When you forced me to the ground
And tied my hands
Certain I couldn't disturb
Anymore
I saw the sadness in your eyes
Your fear
And the most secret desire:
"Escape from here"...

In pursuit of uniqueness
And individuality
We must be unlike anyone else
To survive
But in the mass of different runners
Different lies
We can't make time realize
How the same we are

II. Hedonist Party

So let me live without your pain
Just let me live without your pain
Because I want to feel so...

It's not right
It's not fair
When I am forced to live your life

It's not right
It's not fair
When I am forced to live your life

It's not right

Just let me live without your pain
Just let me live without your pain
Just let me live without your pain
Just let me live without your pain
Just let me live without

III. Straw Man Dance

Congrats
This time you're a borderline pass
Here's your reward
Now smile
After all
You conform to us
Drag on
Forget yourself in the final dance
You already know the steps
