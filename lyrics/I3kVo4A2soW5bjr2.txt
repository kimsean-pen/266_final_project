Underneath the moonlight, watch it invade me
Not need to feel worried, I'm all at ease
Its echoed in my voice
Oh slow, touchdown, you're grounded
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase, oh sunlight haze

Underneath the moonlight, watch it invade me
I'm overpowered by relentless beauty, beauty
Its echoed in my voice

Oh slow, touchdown, you're grounded
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase, oh sunlight hey
