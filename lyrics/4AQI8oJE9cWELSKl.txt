Dear wind of Mississippi can you call him by name?
I have followed his wings on a sunny day

I like to believe he's the chosen one
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I raise the fist
Raise the fist with power and fate
And wishing that his claws will grab on to my hand

I like to believe he's the chosen one
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I have been to the end of waters
I have been to the end of earth
I've been over mountains and riding the storms

Dear son your words have reached me
And for that I can carry on
I'll guide you in spirit today I'll be home

I like to believe he's the fallen one
I like to believe he's the chosen one
The rebirth of man heals a bleeding heart
The eagle of kings wears my father's soul
Dead but rising
