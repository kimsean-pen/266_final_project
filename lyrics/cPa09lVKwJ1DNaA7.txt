Wont' deny everything can't last
But it's closing in so fast
Thought that I'd figured it out at last
But you can't change the past
And it's closing in so fast

Refrain:
Feels just like we're dancin' in the wind
Feeling just alright
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night

Just dont walk away
When I've got you you in my arms tonight
And I've got something to say
There are still rules to break
And this music is a place to hide
Isn't it just a game we play

Feels just like we're dancin' in the wind
Feeling just alright
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night

Feels just like we're dancin' in the wind
Feeling just alright
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
We can dance all night
When we're dancin' in the wind
We can dance all night
