I don't know whats easier, to be with, or without you
I don't know the words to say, or the way to, be around you
Things could've been different, that's what i say
And i don't wanna lose you, so i'm going, away
On a rescue mission, for your love
Going on a rescue mission, for your love
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
Time doesn't go by fast like it did, with you
I think it's teasing me with these
Moments, that you're missing
Things could've been different, that's what i say
And i don't wanna lose you, so i'm going, away
On a rescue mission, for your love
Going on a rescue mission, for your love
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
When all communications has ended
I will go on
Until i reach, the center of your heart
Cause right now, i'm stranded
Alone in the dark
Until i see, the light from your soul
And what if i crash and burn
It would still be worth it
More than to be apart
On a rescue mission, for your love
Going on a rescue mission, for your love
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
Calling out mayday, mayday
In your heart, in your heart
On a rescue mission
(Mayday, Mayday)
Going on a rescue mission
(Mayday, Mayday).
