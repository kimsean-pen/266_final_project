Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)
Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)

Heads high, kill 'em with a no-no-no-no
Inside, that's how we be
Inside, tell 'em we don't want no photos
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, 'bout me
No fucks, swinging from the balcony with
Two cups, one in each hand
So up, tell the DJ hit the button
Load it up, load it up, my man

Leave me unattended, I'm an animal
Juice and gin, I'm mixin' all my chemicals
Uh-uh-uh-uh, I'm running out of syllables
1, 2, 3, 4, I'm about to let it go

They like ooh, they like ooh
Baby, just wait on it
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
They like ooh, they like ooh
Hold up, I ain't done yet
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me

Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)
Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)

Gold links, that's what I call chain reaction
Don't think we gon' slow down
This drink threw me into automatic
Revvin' up, revvin' up, lights out
Vroom... They don't see me comin'!
They don't see me comin'!
Vroom... They don't see me comin'!
They don't see me comin'!

Leave me unattended, I'm an animal
Juice and gin, I'm mixin' all my chemicals
Uh-uh-uh-uh, I'm running out of syllables
1, 2, 3, 4, I'm about to let it go

They like ooh, they like ooh
Baby, just wait on it
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
They like ooh, they like ooh
Hold up, I ain't done yet
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me

They like ooh, they like ooh
Baby, just wait on it
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me

They like ooh, they like ooh
Baby, just wait on it
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
They like ooh, they like ooh
Hold up, I ain't done yet
When I do the damn thing, just watch me
When I do the damn thing, just watch me

Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)
Oooh... (I'm charged up, I'm getting activated)
