Once upon a time in vitro solitude
Stepping out behind the wide blue eyes
Wincing from the sun now forcing open eyes
Waiting now becomes a solicitude...

Polaroid picture
Undeveloped
Amber promise
Wrap up rhyme
Artificial
Throw the curve
Wonder exactly
Who you'll find
When you lose your mind

When you gonna come down here and blow my mind?

Undecided
Choice in lies
Darker aspects
Lost in time
Under curfew
Repressive ties
Wonder exactly who you'll find
When you lose your mind?

When you gonna come down here and blow my mind?

Blow my mind my mind...

Sewn the seeds denied
Marked to track the time
Hack no laughing rhymes
Laugh and cry
Wise to take some time
Look around this pile
Wake up from your eyes
Laugh and cry
Seize the hard reply
Life that's flying by
Opened up inside
Crash and die
Look around inside
Sewn the seeds denied
Crash and die crash and die

When you gonna come down here and blow my mind?
