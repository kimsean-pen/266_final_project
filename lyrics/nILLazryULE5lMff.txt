I've waited a hundred years
but I'd wait a million more for you
nothing prepared me for
what the privilege of being yours would do

If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
if I had only seen how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I was living for all along
what I've been living for

Your love is my turning page
where only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefining phrase

I surrender who I've been for who you are
for nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
if I had only felt how it feels to be yours
well, I would have known what I've been living for all along
what I've been living for

Though we're tethered to the story we must tell
when I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well
with a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas
like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees
