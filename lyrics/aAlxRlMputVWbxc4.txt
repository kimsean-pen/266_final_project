Slean Sarah
Blue Parade
Twin Moon
hey Mister Paper
better get your story straight
we're not from the sixties
and it's Sarah with an H

and oh sometimes
the way you read things
the way you see things
hurts my heart

I fear
somehow they'll find the need
To spit out my name
like a watermelon seed

sometimes
I think what am I doing?
this business of bleeding
a dime for showing
my heart

oh twin moon
you are my twin moon
take me up-sky so I can kiss you
drink your starlight

I want to show you
I want to show you
my heart
