I'd watch the furniture dance slowly, as you drag it around the room
Unaware of my attention, you were alone for all you knew
But in the moments when the analgesia would briefly fade
I could collocate the words your body spoke; you were always so afraid

Your hands would shake as you rearranged flowers by the bed
I heard visitors pass comments, I looked well, or so they said
And every morning, as the sunlight slowly filtered through the shade
You'd awake, disappointed by me sleeping through the day

And it pains me knowing that you were taking time out of your life
To make sure I was still on the medication
That made me stay when I didn't want to
You always say you're not, but I know you're disappointed
When you visit and the doctor tells you that I've stopped talking again
It's just when I had no one, I had depression
It's the only constant in my life that I could depend on

Your hands would shake as you rearranged flowers by the bed
I heard visitors pass comments, I looked well, or so they said
And every morning, as the sunlight slowly filtered through the shade
You'd awake, disappointed by me sleeping through the day
