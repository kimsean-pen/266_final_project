Manic depression is searching my soul
i know what i want
but i just don't know, honey
how to go about getting it
Feeling sweet feeling
drops from my fingers fenders
manic depression is captured my soul
Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain
you mak love
you break love
it's a all the same, when it's
when it's over
Music sweet music
i wish i could caress caress caress
manic depression is a frustrating mess
oh!
Well i think i'll go turn myself off and a go on down
all the way down
really ain't no use in me hanging around
oh, i gotta see you,
Music sweet music
i wish i could caress and a kiss kiss
manic depression is a frustrating mess
Owh!
owh!
Music sweet music sweet music
sweet music
sweet music
hooo
