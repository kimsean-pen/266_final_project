It's like they don't have a side
You're waiting out in the night
It's like they caught in a daze
Mixing colours with shades

You dreamt through the days, oh
I can't lay down
No, I can't lay down
No, blow kisses to the sky till it comes down
Fade away, fade away

Lost in your, lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your lust, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your lust, lost in your lust

Paint just on the walls
Time's beginning to hault
You're just dying to know
You failed but you're cold
You do what you're sold

I can't fade now
No, I can't fade now
No, if you wanna go with me right now
Run away, run away

Lost in your, lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your lust, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your, lost in your lust
Lost in your lust, lost in your lust

I just try to be different
But I give them what they want
I just try to be different
But I give them what they want
I just try to be different
But I give them what they want
I just try to be different
But I give them what they want
