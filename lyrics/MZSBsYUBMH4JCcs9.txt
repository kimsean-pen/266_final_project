Listen up what's the time said today, I'm gonna speak my mind,
Take me up to the top of the world I wanna see my crime,
Day by day there's a man in a suit who's gonna make you pay,
For the thoughts that you think and the words, they won't let you say.

One fine day,
Gonna leave you all behind,
It wouldn't be so bad, if I had more time.

Sailin' down the river alone,
I'll be trying find my way back home,
But I don't believe in magic,
Life is automatic, but I don't mind being on my own,
No I don't mind being on my own

Life is automatic, but I don't mind being on my own,
No I don't mind being on my own,
No I don't mind being on my own,
I said that I don't mind being on my own.
