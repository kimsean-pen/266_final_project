Black operation change the money-colored black tar.
Whams getting spun, so politically correct
Watching everybody fight each other,
Sister versus brother

Peace versus war, rich against the poor
Different versus different, bed versus the floor
Wall versus the door, shore - black, water - black
Money - black, moneybag and greed back in season
Swing full until one turns up on the oasis

Wanna decide which side you are gonna go to
Don't know which evil sign is upon us this time
Mind your business, stay in line
Find your calling, enterprise

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

This is maniacal, entire societies
Are falling to bottom and no one taking them out
The fire has gotten out of control
We've got no water, no buckets
(So we're lucky if tomorrow comes)

"Why" isn't important anymore, so I'd like to know
That need-to-know information but when I know it
What reactions will it cause when they finally show up?
Dressed up, amped up in a black car

Wanna decide which side you are gonna go to
Don't know which evil sign is upon us this time
Mind your business, stay in line
Find your glory, enterprise

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Leaving things in a state
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Cut away all the red tape
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes

Cut away all the red tape
Cut away all the red tape
Of chaos and earthquakes
Chaos and earthquakes
