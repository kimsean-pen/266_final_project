Hopelessly showbiz
So she is
She's got friends you haven't met
They smoke menthol cigarettes

Bogus psychosis
She floats on in
She ain't ever anywhere
So you're lucky that she's here

Talk about Hollywood problems
She's got 'em
She's always looking for a wilder ride
She'll be fucking with the phone all night

She calls me
Girlie

She gets in corners where water can't
Got that look upon her face
Says she's twenty minutes late

Her shit is sordid
She's all for it
'till her eyeballs start to bleed
She don't wanna go to sleep

Talk about ladder to stardom
She's on one
And if that doesn't whet your appetite
Well she probably got something that might

She calls me
Girlie

Talk about Hollywood problems
She's got 'em
She's always looking for a wilder ride
And she'll be fucking with the phone all night

She calls me
Girlie
