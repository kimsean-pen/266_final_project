Suffering clouds of childhood
Erupting scars of trauma
Rigid anvils soon age into
Tender hallucinations

Humble servants displaying fascinations
Foreboding sense of no return
Young myths in the magic of this time
Young myths in the magic of this time

Between youth
Something was missing
Between youth
Something was missing

Images surrender the slaughtering doves
Biting against the manifesto of time
In the underlying forests of fear,
Caged in creatures freed by birth to experience tears

Between youth
Something was missing
Between youth
Something was missing

Between youth
Something was missing
Between youth
Something was missing
