A sinister telepathy is screaming at forgotten fears
An exit made of your
self-destruction, may your reflection guide the blade
In your lost code of self knowledge, a mere entrance for evil to enter
The venom is hidden and the venom wears a mask
(I serve myself upon the wings of pains affliction, unto thee)
Disconnect from my state of being
(and without a trace)
It was my soul that murdered yours
That murdered yours
