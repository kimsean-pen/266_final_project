Darkness enshrouded from within
Bitter rest in overwhelming solitude
Sleeping aeons and mountains
To conceal the tearing grief

A human life is not worth more
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn
(Than) a drop of blood on a yellowed paper
(Than) a shiver in the sharpened rain

No way out of this terror
Distance like an empty winter night
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul

Trapped among the mortal ones
My mourning is in vain
Unveiled dreams have turned to nothing
Fed on the wrecks of unanswered questions

A human life is not worth more
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn
(Than) a drop of blood on a yellowed paper
(Than) a shiver in the sharpened rain

No way out of this terror
Distance like an empty winter night
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul

Silence is trembling, screaming its rage-
Screaming...

NO WAY OUT
