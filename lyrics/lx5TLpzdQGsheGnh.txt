Kocain Karolina down to your bones
fireworks in your heart make it far from home
every morning you wake up alone just the same
who would wanna live longer anyway
oooooo
Easy days will come
When you rest your heavy soul
oooooo
Easy days will come
When your hard living is done
poke your skinny spirit to keep a man
whats left of your flesh slipped from his hand
lonely looking eyes have done you wrong
dont waste a way until your gone
oooooo
Easy days will come
when you rest your heavy soul
oooooo
Easy days will come
When your hard living is done
oooooo
Easy days will come
when you rest your heavy soul
oooooo
Easy days will come
when your hard living is done
Kocaine Karoline
your down to your bones
dont waste away until your gone
don't waste away until your gone
