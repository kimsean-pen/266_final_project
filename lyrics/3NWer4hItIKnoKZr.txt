Tom Cat Goodby

Rosie Pearl is a big blonde girl,
and she sails around like a Steamboat!
Takes her time, and her eyes... they shine... for... Tom...

Hey there Tom Cat,
where've you been to?
Hey there Tom Cat

I'm so lonely
I been crying - waiting up for you

Ya hear that?!

I got your name Tom
I got your children
What about the children?
Tom cat Tom cat
you old rat - you old rat

Johnny cheated, Frankie killed him
Johnny cheated, said Frankie killed him
Shot and killed him
I don't blame her. I'd'a done it too

Ya hear that?!
Ya hear that?!

You deal and promise
You kiss and swing low
Foot slippin' out the window
