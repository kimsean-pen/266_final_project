A pretty picture paints a thousand words
I'll look at yours today
It's been a while, the dust has long set in
You still look the same

So, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

Years have gone and time has healed

You words were casual but longing for
For me or someone else
What could have driven you to think of all
I let go with much tears

So, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
How do I know what's real?
Where do we go from here?

Years have gone and time has healed
Tell me now, just how to feel

Where do we go when all the roads are under
Where do we go, so many chances pass us by
Where do we go, what now when I am married, oh
But don't go, how can I let you in

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from,
Where do we go from here?

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from,
Where do we go from here?
