You curl my name with your lip
I take a drink, I hate it
I tell you what you want to hear, so I
Can catch my breath and step away
Think about what to say to you
While you come unglued
I don't know how to make it clear
I've tried it out all these years
But it doesn't seem to go through
Til now

Here I go, hear what I'm saying
What I want to say, what I want to say
All this time, you thought I would be your girl
I'm sorry, I belong to no one, no one
I belong to no one, no one
I'm not known to hold on, hold on too long

There you go, take it back
You didn't mean this and you didn't mean that
What were you thinking when you thought you could touch me last night?
I know you don't think it's wrong if you don't break the skin
But if I want to touch, I'll ask for it, oh oh oh, until I
Can catch my breath and step away
Think about what to say to you
While you come unglued
I don't know how to make it clear
I've tried it out all these years
But it doesn't seem to go through
Til now

Here I go, hear what I'm saying
What I want to say, what I want to say
All this time, you thought I would be your girl
I'm sorry, I belong to no one, no one
I belong to no one, no one
I'm not known to hold on, hold on too long

There you go, take it back
You didn't mean this and you didn't mean that
What were you thinking when you thought you could touch me
I know you don't think it's wrong if you don't break the skin
But if I want to touch, I'll ask for it, oh oh oh

Here I go, hear what I'm saying
What I want to say, what I want to say
All this time, you thought I would be your girl
I'm sorry, I belong to no one, no one
I belong to no one, no one
I'm not known to hold on, hold on too long
