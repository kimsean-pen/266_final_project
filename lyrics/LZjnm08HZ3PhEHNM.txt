Hey, little girl would you say that you know that
It's so hard to believe that it's so sad

And I know you're believing in something
But it's just so hard to believe in a nomad
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
Hey little girl would you stop and just lay back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad

And I know we just keep talking about it
In a swirl bunch of nothing turned inside out
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
Hey little whirl I reach for you and you jump back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad

I know that we've talked all around it
A little whirl we can do something about it
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care
