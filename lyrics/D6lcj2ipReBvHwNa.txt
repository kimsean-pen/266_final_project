You kept me waiting, wait alone
My head spinnin' round and round
You made your choice, oh back then
Now you say, yeah you chose wrong

I hate to break the news to you
There's certain facts I need to say
I can't help but sing loud
I'll state my case and then I'm gone

Help me out
Take me out
Help me out
I'm just a tired old dog
