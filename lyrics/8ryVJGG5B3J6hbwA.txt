With the grass so green
Sun coating everything
That day felt a lot like walking through a dream
And with the sky so blue
We snuck into the church at school
To play a song while no else was watching us

With the sun so bright
Walking side by side
Let me tell you that nothing ever felt so right
And with the sky so blue
A feeling in my heart-strings grew
It was then I knew that I would fall in love with you

So blue
(Sky) So blue
So blue
So blue
Just like a dream

I can see those skies clear in my mind
Frozen in time, frozen in time
Like a scene I picked from my dreams
Can't tell apart from reality
I hope that I can find my way out
Before I get caught in fantasy world
And get too wrapped up in what it could be
Back on my bullshit, I'm such an Aries
So I break down, stuck in my doubts
Jump too far in just to fall out
Things aren't the way I thought them to be
So many miles still set forth for me
Hop in the car, take the top down
And when we get out, drive it around
Clouds part ways and now I can see
The sky is blue above me

Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
