You operate and motivate
On synthetic fuel
You're mother nature
And an atom bomb
As long as you're kept
Full of pretty bodies
Your little secret
Will be safe with me

Around again
Insane again
It comes again
And sets me free

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

You're kept alive and polarized
With one thing in mind
Metabolize everything that you see
But now and then or a little later
Now I'm gonna take you down with me

Around again, insane again
She comes again
And sets me free

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

So take me down
Take me, down, down, down, down
Take me down, take me down
So take me down
Take me, down, down, down, down
Take me down, take me down

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!
