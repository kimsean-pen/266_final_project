I'm gonna come up by the liquor store tonight
I liked to be alone but then I came up to the life
To be alone is missing you
I don't know what it is that suddenly makes me wanna stay around
I'mma leave when I have seen the first of morning light
To loose myself I turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

I turn it up

You got me where you want
I watch the life go down
My mind is open
We don't know what we're searching
We don't hold out

I like to touch when I got nothing but myself to hide
I like to come to summer lens, I hate to stay inside
I feel the storm, we're up on it
I like the work flow, I'm not the one to pick the ice
We've got two lives to make up for all the time that we have lost
To be for real I cover up
Cover up, cover up

I cover up

You got me where you want
I watch the life go down
My mind is open
We don't know what we're searching
We don't hold out

Say you wanna be there
Say you wanna be there
Say you wanna be there

You got me where you want
I watch the life go down
My mind is open
We don't know what we're searching
We don't hold out
