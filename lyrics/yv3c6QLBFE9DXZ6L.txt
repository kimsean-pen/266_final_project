Young girl, don't cry
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall, ooh
Young girl, it's alright
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh

When you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache, life can bring and what it means

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within, oh

Young girl, don't hide
You'll never change if you just run away
Ooh, whoa yeah
Young girl, just hold tight
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, ooh

Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
When you look outside, look inside to your soul

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
If you will learn to begin to trust the voice within...

Oh, ho, yea
Ooh, oh, yea (ooh, ooh, ooh) oh, yea
Life is a journey (ooh, ooh, ooh)
It can take you anywhere you choose to go (ooh, ooh, ooh)
As long as you're learning (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll find all you'll ever need to know (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Be strong)
Break it (hold on)
You'll make it (be strong)
Just don't forsake it because (hold on)
(No one can tell you what you can't do)
No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within

Ooh, yea young girl, don't cry, I'll be right here
When your world starts to fall
Yea
Aah
Yea
(Listen)
Oh yea
(Listen)
Na nana (listen, listen)
Oh yea (listen)
Hmm yea (listen)
