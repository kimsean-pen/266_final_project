I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin

I'm workin' all week long
I dream the days away
I wanna sing my song
So let the music play

I have to get my kicks and fly tonight
And when the clock strikes 6 on Friday night
I need to blow it all away

I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't, I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin

I make it what I can, I try, I try
I'm shakin' up my plan and I get by
I'm savin' all my soul and all my pain
So I can lose control on Saturday
I'm gonna blow it all away
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't, I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
For the weekend to begin, begin, begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't, I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I've got to get my, and fly, tonight
And when the clock strikes 6 on friday night
I'm gonna blow it all away
I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't, I can't wait for the weekend to begin
I can't, I can't wait for the weekend to begin
