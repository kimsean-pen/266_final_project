Get up, get up
Come on, come on, let's go
There's just a few things
I think that you should know
Those words at best
Were worse than teenage poetry
Fragment ideas and too many pronouns
Stop it, come on
You're not making sense now
You can't make them want you
They're all just laughing

Literate and stylish
(Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet
(Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls'
Dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know
(And that's all you need to know)
You have it or you don't
(You have it or you)
You have it or you
(Don't)

You have it or you
You see how much time you're wasting?
You're coward of separating

Stop it, come on
You know I can't help it
I got the mic
And you've got the mosh pit
What will it take to make you admit that you were wrong?
Was his demise so carefully constructed?
Well let's just say I got what I wanted
'Cause in the end it's always the same
(You're still gone)
Let's go

Literate and stylish
(Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet
(Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls'
Dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know
(And that's all you need to know)
You have it or you don't
(You have it or you)
You have it or you
(Don't)
You don't

This is me with the words
On the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope
Down the barrel of a gun (gun, gun)
Remind me not to ever act this way again
This is you trying hard to
Make sure that you're seen
With a girl on your arm
And your heart on your sleeve
Remind me not to ever think of you again
This is me with the words
On the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope
Down the barrel of a gun
Remind me not to ever act this way again
Again

This is me with the words
On the tip of my tongue
And my eye on the scope
Down the barrel of a gun
I'll never
Act this way
Again

Rest the weight
You've had your chance and folded
Don't hold your breath
(I know something that you don't know)
Because you'll only make things worse

With the worst
Intentions, don't

You'll only make things worse
