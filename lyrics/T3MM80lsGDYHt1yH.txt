I can't tell you what it means
When you are here I am at ease
I don't blame you when you're gone
For the sadness in my song

That weight is mine alone, that shadow is my own
The coast is never clear
I'll wait for morning though, you will arrive
So we can watch that shadow disappear

If you try to be with me, I will try to get by
Some say I'm a fool for waiting
They don't know, this fool doesn't mind

They tell me "Give it up"
But I won't ever give it up

Because when the night does fade
I'm alive in the strangest way
Those first few cracks of dawn
Are a taste of what's to come

And yes I hum and haw about nothing at all
I get lost in fear
But no thief or act of god could take this grin I've got
I know you will be here

And if you try to be with me, I will try to get by
Some say I'm a fool for waiting
They don't know, this fool doesn't mind

They tell me "Give it up"
But I won't ever give it up

Ah, they tell me...
So what she's in your head?
She's gonna leave again?
What's gonna happen then?
She's just enabling
And there is truth to that
But I ain't holding back
If you try, try, try

Try to be with me, I will try to get by
Some say I'm a fool for waiting
They don't know, this fool doesn't mind...

If you try to be with me, I will try to get by
Some say I'm a fool for waiting
They don't know, this fool doesn't mind

They tell me "Give it up"
But I won't ever give it up
Oh, and they tel me "Give it up"
But I won't ever give it up
