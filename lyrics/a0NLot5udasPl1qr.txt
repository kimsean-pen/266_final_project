I got the message
I heard you want to know
who's your best friend
What's the hurry
I heard it's brighter on the right side.

I dream in colour
it's just the way I am.

I need solutions
I'm only human that's the pain
And if there's some confusion
Tell lies take sides
I got the message
I heard you want to know
who's your best friend
What's the hurry
I heard it's clearer inside

I dream in colour
it's just the way l am
I got the message.
