I'm lost in conversation
These words are meaningless
Can't seem to find someone to ease my mind
Then you shut down the wall for me
You just shut down the wall

We just need a little time out
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face?

Just face to face
Just face to face

Feeling so disconnected
Drowning in human noise
I am surrounded, but I'm so alone
Then you shut down the wall for me
You just shut down the wall

We just need a little time out
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face?

Just face to face
Just face to face
Just face to face
Just face to face

We just need a little time out
Some time to waste
Can we stay here in the silence?
Just face to face?
Just face to face
Just face to face
Just face to face
Just face to face
