There, there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To hold my head together

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

You, you can't but wait
for me to return
For me to show you how I felt

These wounds have bled,
And pages fly by
I need to feel you right by my side

So, so far from home
I need your voice
To hold my head together

So, So far from home
I need your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings!

(Whoa whoa!)

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back, to where I belong
To where I belong

(Whoa whoa!)

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back, to where I belong
To where I belong

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back, to where I belong
To where I belong
