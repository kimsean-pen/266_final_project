I've told you once and I've told you twice
Wait for that day when our love will rise
To that song that brought our hearts together

Even though you're mistreatin' me
I know the girl that you used to be
For me those days were meant to last forever
Oh ooo oh

Time after time I'm wonderin' why
Am I to be all alone
And day after day I'll pray that you stay
'Cause you've got a heart of stone
(Heart of stone)
A heart of stone
A heart of stone

I walk the streets like a broken man
Oh I wish that you could understand
Even though you're still the one I wait for

I guess in love there's no guarantee
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be
Even though you're still the one I care for
Oh ooo oh

Time after time I'm wonderin' why
Am I to be all alone
And day after day I'll pray that you stay
'Cause you've got a heart of stone
(Heart of stone)
Yea yea yea

Yea
She's got the heart of stone

Time after time I'm wonderin' why
Am I to be all alone
And day after day I'll pray that you stay
You've got a heart of stone

Time after time I'm wonderin' why
Am I to be all alone
Day after day I'll pray that you stay
'Cause you've got a heart of stone
(Heart of stone)
Its a heart of stone
