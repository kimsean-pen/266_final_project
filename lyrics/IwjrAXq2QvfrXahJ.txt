Tangled up with you in the night
Finding new reasons every time
I know you don't see them in the mirror
Don't you know? I'm not using my eyes
When it's this late
We've got the lights down anyway
Cause you're a nightlight girl and just glow
Nobody's outside
For all we know
What's inside your imagination
It's as real as anything else
I'll show you what it's like to be left
If you can't do it for yourself
Tangled up with you in the dark
Love when you're loving who you are
Your bones have curves
Your skin's got lines
And that's the way that you were designed
And you can do it by yourself
Yeah, you don't need anybody's help
Cause you're a nightlight girl and just glow
Nobody's outside
For all we know
What's inside your imagination
It's as real as anything else
I'll show you what it's like to be left
If you can't do it for yourself
So push away, just push away all the things you ever heard of
Every song that they told you
It's harder to you, then you say that you know
That beauty is in the eye of the beholder
I want to watch you while you glow in the dark
Want you to realize you can glow if you want to
You got to love yourself for all that you are
Want you to know that baby, you are my nightlight girl
