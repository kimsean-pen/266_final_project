This time I ran too far away
If you run, I'll be your renegade
With you, growing older, older, together
We growing older, older together

I have read the words on your face
They told me things I shouldn't know
But I swear I wanna go
We're growing older, older, together
Growing older, older together
Uh, watch out in the rain
This time always

Uh, watch out in the rain
This time I'll wait

This time I ran too far away
If you run I'll be your renegade
With you, growing older, older, together
We're growing older, older together

Uh, watch out in the rain
This time I'll wait
Uh, watch out in the rain
This time I'll wait for you
