I had a lady
She had a man
But this is something I could never understand
I told my lady go and keep your man
Cause you ain't never gonna see me again

I had a lady
She had a man
But this is something that they couldn't understand
I got so tired of waiting on you
Looking for love I found somebody new

Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady

Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady

Her eyes, so crazy
Her hair, just right
The moon is out, the streets are alive
I know a place where love never dies
We can go together for the rest of our lives
She said, "Can you take me there?"
I said, "I can take you anywhere"
I got a driver and he's waiting on you
Now tell me lady what you want to do

I had a lady
She had a man
But this is something I could never understand
I told my lady go and keep your man
Cause you ain't never gonna see me again

I had a lady
She had a man
But this is something that they couldn't understand
I got so tired of waiting on you
Looking for love I found somebody new

Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Just like a record lady

Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Just like a record lady

Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Just like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Go like a record lady
Just like a record lady
