Speed and ice, take it slow
Love when the lungs begin to glow
Mount Aso, I'm well below
What do we need to get along
Weed and rice in love with you
The clouds rise, you know it's true
Always misread, you don't have to say
Cumulus have your way

I'm by the river come find me
Sky's blown Hana-bi
Hanami swaying
And with it a hope a spring

You're the song I love to sing
You're the one I long to be
I'll always bring a sour touch
I've said too much, I've not said enough

Half-speed, then terminal
Doesn't take much to let it go
I love it when you hold me slow
She love it when I sing
Protector, protector, the love line left her
Protector, protector, love line left her
Protector, protector, your love line left her
Protector, protector, she love my eyes
I love it when she dance so low

Hear the chorus, the chant is on
I love it control me, the way it holds me
And the way you sway those words
Weed and rice in love I know
Love when you see beyond, echo
By Aso still rising
I always knew it would take so long

I'm by the river, come find me
Sky's blown Hana Bi
Hanami sways 'til may, and with it, joy blossoming
You're the song I love to sing
You're the one I long to be
Not too late to make it work
A nimbus for all its worth

You're the song I love to sing
You're the one I long to be
I love it, control me
I love when you sings
Protector, protector, the love line left her
Protector, protector, your love line left her
Protector, protector, the love line left her
Protector, protector, love line, I love it when you go so low
I love it when you reach below
I love it when you dance slow
This time, in my eyes

The chant and the chorus is on
I love it when you hold me so
Baby, I love it when you go so low, oh-huh
