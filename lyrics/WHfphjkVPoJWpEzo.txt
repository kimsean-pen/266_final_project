I reach to you my father
See me bound in chains
Now time has granted me
The language of the waves

If I fall away
Release me
Will you hear my cries
Through the dark

Call me out
Across the waves
Guide my spirit
And bring me home to you

As I fall away
Release me
Can you hear my cries
Through the dark
