You say you miss those days
But we did it right, right

Quit the habit
Started smoking again

You say you miss those days
But we did it right, right

Quit the habit
Started smoking again

I was crying, you were laughing
Hit in the face, blood on the snow
We were never happier
We were never happy

You say you miss those days
But we did it right, right
You say you miss those days
But we did it right, right

Quit the habit
Started smoking again
