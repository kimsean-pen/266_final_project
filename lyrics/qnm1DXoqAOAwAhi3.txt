Tell me, tell me a secret
And i will share some of mine
My steps led to your doorsteps
Your doorsteps soon became mine

This home is where my heart is
My heart is where we both live
I'm sorry for acting so silly
Sometimes it gets in the way

But i'm standing by your side
No matter what may...
...tempt me not to get by
I'll slip do fit into your dreams
And i'll dream until i'm put to sleep

This breath is yet one less
I keep saying yes and nothing less
Whatever little time there is left

I want to share it
You make it worth it

I want to share it with you.
