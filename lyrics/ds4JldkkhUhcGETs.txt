I would climb any mountain
Sail across the stormy sea
If that's what it takes me baby
To show how much you mean to me
And I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

I have waited a lifetime
Spend my time so foolishly
But now that I found you
Together we'll make history
And I know it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all my eyes can see

And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again
Never again

(It feels like the first time)
It feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time)
Tell me how it feels
(Feels like the first time)
Oh it feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time)

Won't you open up the door, yeah

Feels like the first time
An' it feels like the very first time
An' it feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
An' it feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
