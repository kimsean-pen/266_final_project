They won't see
The fire you have lit inside of me
They look up to the stars
And wonder where you might be
They look up without realizing
That they're standing right there in the palm of your hand
I can't explain or understand
I just love You

It's common knowledge
That you've been dead for a while
It's well known that the cross is only a burden
With pains and trials
But then again how come my shoes are so light
How come I can walk for miles
And still just love You

So I think I'll stay
Caught up in a silent prayer
Cause I believe in silence
Our hearts speak the same word
So why don't we just walk along
The shoreline with our silent song
Cause I believe in Silence
Our hearts speak the same word

We have to prove
That our love is real over and over again
But let them think what they want
Cause I know it will never end
Because I know where it began
And my heart still pounds twice as fast
Whenever you walk by
Cause I still love you

So I think I'll stay...
