They're hiding in my bed
I can see them at the window ledge

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing there

And crawling over me
They're inside my TV

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing here

They're inside my TV
And crawling over me

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing here
