Girl
There's something 'bout me that you outta know.
I never felt the need to lose control.
Always held on back and played it slow.
But not this time.
Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything.

Baby
Take me on a journey.
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you.
Crazy
Let's do something, maybe.
Please don't take your time
You got me
Right where you want me.

Girl
I'm gonna let you have your way with me.
When you move like that
It's hard to breathe.
I never thought that it could be like this
But I was wrong.
Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything.

Baby
Take me on a journey.
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you.
Crazy
Let's do something, maybe.
Please don't take your time
You got me
Right where you want me.

Can't explain it
How you swept me off my feet, unexpectedly.
In slow motion
My imagination running trying to keep my body still
I can hardly stand the thrill.

Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything.

Baby
Take me on a journey.
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you.
Crazy
Let's do something, maybe.
Please don't take your time
You got me
Right where you want me.
