I'll turn and teach the ages
nothing you love lasts too long
a motherless cub
abandoned in the stages of
birth mother lost the mid wife
who'll tell the children about her life

that's why you never mention my name to them
denying us all of the moment

that's why you never mention my name to them
denying us all of the moment

what brought you back to this place
I knew you'd never learn
I knew you'd never

anything expected of you now
I knew you'd never learn
I knew you'd never

I'll place my bag down now
you'll be the first one to sell me out

that's why you never mention my name to them
denying us all of the moment

that's why you never mention my name to them
denying us all of the moment

what brought you back to this place
I knew you'd never learn
I knew you'd never

what brought you back to this place
I knew you'd never learn
it's obvious

what brought you back to this place
what brought you back to this place
