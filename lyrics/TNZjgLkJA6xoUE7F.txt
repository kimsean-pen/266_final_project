So you're proud to be a good one
But the good ones always complain
About the stuff they never did...
Don't make a thing about the bad kind
'cause the bad kind don't even know
All the hearts they are messing with...

You can point fingers, so you won't!
I don't care, I love you anyway!
You can point fingers, so you won't!
I don't care, I love you anyway!

Yeah, I'm falling in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Falling in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you undestand?
Falling in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Falling in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you undestand?

I've been told I am the problem
And the problem is my honesty
When it's worst than how it seems...
And I tell you all the wrong things
All the things you don't wanna hear
'cause they change your perfect dream...

You can point fingers, so you won't!
I don't care, I love you anyway!
You can point fingers, so you won't!
I don't care, I love you anyway!

Yeah, I'm falling in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Falling in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you undestand?
Falling in love
And I hope that you want me
The way that I am!
Falling in love
And I know I can't change me
Do you undestand?
