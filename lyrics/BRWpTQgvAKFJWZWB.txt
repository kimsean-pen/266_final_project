Leave our initials in the concrete
Put your body on me and go slow
And maybe this will last forever
But we're both destructive
So we'll come close

You know, no, we'll never grow up
Catching a buzz, sippin' on a solo cup
Wearing baby blue jeans
Only eighteen in the twenty-seven club
Staying up all night, you know what I like
You could be my ride or die

'Cause what's love when
You're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high
If it ain't getting way too high
What's love when you're way too high
Don't leave now
'Cause what's love when
You're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high

You hit me harder than a first love
I liked when it hurts so knock me out
I'm seeing stars under my eyelids
Baby, we're the bad kids
They warned us about

You know, no, we'll never grow up
Catching a buzz, sippin' on a solo cup
When you wear your gold chain
Cheap Champagne
And a bag of, yeah, the real good stuff
Staying up all night, you know what I like
You could be my ride or die

'Cause what's love when
You're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high
If it ain't getting way too high
What's love when you're way too high
Don't leave now
'Cause what's love when
You're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high

One more hit, just one
More hit and baby, that's it
Yeah, I found heaven in your breathing
Yeah, I found heaven
In the backseat of your pickup
I swear that it's just one more hit
Just one more hit and baby, that's it
Yeah, I found heaven in your breathing
Yeah, I found heaven
In the backseat of your pickup
I swear that we'll never

No, we'll never grow up
Catching a buzz, sippin' on a solo cup
Wearing baby blue jeans
Only eighteen in the twenty-seven club
Staying up all night, you know what I like
You could be my ride or die

'Cause what's love when you're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high
If it ain't getting way too high
What's love when you're way too high
Don't leave now
'Cause what's love when you're way too young
If it ain't getting way too high
