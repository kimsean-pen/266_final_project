I rinsed after the rain
Like a dreamer dreamed the night
Switching through trees

I rinsed after the rain
Like a dreamer dreamed the night
Switching through trees

Switching through trees
Switching through trees
At night switching through trees

Have you ever seen the day
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I rinsed after the rain
Like a dreamer dreamed the night
Switching through trees
