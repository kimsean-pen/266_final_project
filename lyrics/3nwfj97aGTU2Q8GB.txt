We woke up on the mountain
Air was clear, sun was shining
All we could see was silver
And so we started thinking
Then when we came off the mountain
All of the lanes were static
All expressions were frozen
Over each other's traffic

Second time the dusk was setting
Streets filled with different people
All of them tired and distant
Some of them tried to know us
We had carried our instruments
And hid behind our features
Laughed and joked and hoped that they'd have
They'd have something to show us

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

We went back to the mountain
They spoke a different language
A mess of walls and fences
The mountain we created
Our faces amongst the landed
Except that we were nameless
Only inherited stories
Since we fell off the mountain

Then the mountain came between us
And took away the buildings
We were the half remembered
The only two remaining
Then we knew we were the mountain
You said "I'll do this for you"
Covered what we had broken
Forgot about the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain

At sea in the cities
Alien in the suburbs
Adrift on peripheries
Wake up back on the mountain
