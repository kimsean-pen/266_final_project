I took my seat and stared
at the cardboard screen while no one cared
while the lights stayed on
the familiar buzz was now long gone
i just waited there
as the music soared into the air
as the lights went down
she said don't open your eyes

at tempo 119
they took to the crowd and aimed towards me
as the circle closed
i held onto the one with splintered clothes
twenty years before
she said don't open your eyes and you can swim
all my friends ignored
she said don't open your eyes

don't open your eyes
and said goodnight
don't open your eyes
and said goodnight

i couldn't end it there
as her wooden bones grew through her skin
crumbled naturally
as her limbs and leaves had broken free
twenty years before
she said don't open your eyes and you can swim
wanted nothing more
she said don't open your eyes

don't open your eyes
and said goodnight
don't open your eyes
and said goodnight
