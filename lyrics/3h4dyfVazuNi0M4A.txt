I'd lend my hand to you, babe
You understand me true, babe
And all that was don't matter
It's you I trust, your laughter

So if you care to follow
Follow me anywhere
I wouldn't mind your sorrow
As long as you're next to me
So if you care to follow
Follow me anywhere
I wouldn't mind your sorrow
As long as you're next to me
