The gods watch over you
And they consider what you've done

But now you've hidden away
To gain your strength
Deep in a cave
Your power is regained

And your legacy has spread
To the deepest of the sea
The one that brought them vengeance
That fights for his belief

He can swim through matter
He has poisoned teeth
His tentacles have murdered
His scream can kill the weak

He's got
Explosives
CHECK
Corrosives
CHECK
A master at the art of murder
Mermaids weep the blackened tears

So you swim to a sunken ship
Invited by a soul who bleeds from the lips
This prophet who beckons you wades in the dark
Speaks an ancient language this language is of the sharks

He says you're the one that I decree
The one that can save us and set us free
You've gained the power of a deity
You have the strength to wake us from this sleep

And so you swim on
Swim on
And so swim on
Swim on
Keep swimming now

And the prophet gives to you this warning
If this path is chosen you'll be met with strife
For you'll be seen as an enemy of the sacred

And the gods will curse you
for the rest of your life
And you say

I get by just fine
CHECK
I've known much worse life
CHECK
I've conquered dark times
CHECK
They should fear MY mind
CHECK

So now you know then go then
Swim on through the cold then
Harness your strength
Because one day you may be called
To meet the mighty gods
Deep within the ocean
And if you're not prepared
Your soul will not be spared

Your eyes have gone black
You'll never look back
You'll never stop swimming
You'll always be tracked

Your life has transformed
Your power has grown
Your minions stretch for leagues
For a bloodied coral throne

A crown of murdered foes
Will sit upon your head
Those that wish to challenge you
Will wish that they were dead
The beasts of the sea will collect and submit prey for your forgiveness and live
as you permit
And you'll say:
I AM THE WATER GOD
You will BOW to the WATER GOD
You will LIVE for the WATER GOD
And you will DIE for the WATER GOD
Live for the WATER GOD
Die for the WATER GOD
And the deities loom nearer
They will find you...
