The're gonna chase us, but we will be one step ahead
They wanna trace us, but we'll never be left for dead
If the pressure's too high, we'll be shooting 'em down
If they bottle us up, we'll descend underground 'cause they'll
Never catch us how hard they may try
We never say die

You're not alone
You're not alone
We are king and queen and the whole world is our throne

You're not alone
You're not alone
I'll stand by your side 'till our names are cast in stone
You're not alone

Don't look behind, put the foot on the floor, cut and run
Just close your eyes, soon we're over the worst and it's done
Though we're running on empty, our pockets are filled
Let us spend all the money before we are killed, my dear
When a bullet will stop our hearts
And tear 'em apart

They're gonna chase us, but we will be one step ahead
They wanna trace us, but we'll never be left for dead
