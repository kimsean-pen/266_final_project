It ain't easy but it's almost over
Ain't gonna let it pull me under
But I will conquer
Some days I can't move forward
Not gonna let it push me over
But I will conquer
It ain't easy but it's almost over
This heart was made to wander
But I will conquer
But I will conquer
It ain't easy but it's almost over
(over over over over)
Every day I get a little closer
(little closer closer closer)
And I will conquer
And I will conquer
And I will conquer
But I will conquer
