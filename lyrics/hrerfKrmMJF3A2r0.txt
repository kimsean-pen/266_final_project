today

I saw a man

today

I saw a man
using an empty whiskey flask
as a walkie talkie

today
today

I saw a man

today

I saw a man
with a flaming eight ball
tattooed on his arm

today

today
today

I saw a man

today

I saw a man
using an empty whiskey flask
as a walkie talkie

today
I met a man
who threw his arms around me

and you give in...

today...

we laughed
we laughed waiting for a train
for a few into the city
seconds today
that great stuff
that great stuff
that stuff
that stuff makes me feel waiting for a train
feel into the city
feel today
happy today
