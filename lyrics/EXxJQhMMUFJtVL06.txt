Yeah, yeah
I was in the background
Quickly fadin' out of view
She with on the front line
Shinin' star of the room
I want to get closer
But there's nothin' I can do
What a shame
Yeah, yeah

Headed for the exit
Guess it's time to hit the road
I wish she was with me
'Cause I, I just never know
I pull the car up
Thinkin' pedal to the floor
About to take off
She opens up the door

She says let's get goin', we got time
But I can see that look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive
C'mon now, yeah

We were in the fast lane
Rollin' to who knows where
No destination
But she don't seem to care
She kept me guessin'
With the moonlight in her eyes
So fierce now
Hey yeah

I start to question
All the things that I don't know
She doesn't answer
She just turns up the radio, yeah

She says let's get goin', we got time (We got time, we got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive

Sometimes in life
Moments arrive
Things don't turn out the way that you planned
So never think twice
Just get in the car and drive
Yeah come on now, come on now

Listen
She says let's get goin' we got time (We got time)
I can see that look inside her eyes
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
So get in the car and drive, yeah
She says let's get going we got time (Gotta drive, gotta drive)
I can see that look inside her eyes (I can see that look inside your eyes)
And to my surprise
It was all green lights
Life's a crazy ride
We just can't think twice
So get in the car and drive, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
