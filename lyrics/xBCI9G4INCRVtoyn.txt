Completely awake in the back of the car I don't drift anymore
All's come into place and I unlock the door
If you have to warm up you can go back inside but I'm not gonna follow forward
I've come to prefer sleeping outdoors

Upstairs and downstairs
And outside on the roof
Small stars and steel bars
Say the ghosts up in the attic tell the truth

Standing on shingles at night, can't you see that there's a reason
The plans aren't on the ground, they're high and hanging down
Well once I remember the words we can climb down from the rooftop
I swear that I heard it right here, invasively clear

But I was upstairs and downstairs
And outside on the roof
Small stars and steel bars
Say the ghosts up in the attic tell the truth
