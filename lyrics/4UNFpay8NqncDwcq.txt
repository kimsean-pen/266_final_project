Hush now baby, there's no need to cry
Let me wipe away those lemon eyes
All your worries such a waste of time
You can't even see how much you're mine
You're so bitter, bitter. bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, runaway, look away
Turn away, honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine
Hold on baby, careful what you say
You've been drinking someone else's pain
I can't keep on staring at the sun
Yellow, I will have to bite your tongue
You're so bitter, bitter, bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away
Turn away, honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine
All mine
And the doctor said you're fine
All fine
Just don't get stuff in her eyes
All fine
See I told you were mine
All mine
Lemon eyes
Lemon eyes, all mine
Yellow eyes all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away
Turn away, honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine
