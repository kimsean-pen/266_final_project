The Sun
There's a million ways to walk the plains, between the greats sky and the ground
And there's a million ways to play the game, stoned by the voice of sound
I've departed in solitude, to make sense of my thoughts
I've departed to make amends, make amends for all that was lost
At what cost?

Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown
Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown and divine

I've imagined a better life beyond the enormous despair
I've imagined a solid sign, something we all could share
But reckless we do the stroll, further on to nowhere
Yes, reckless we walked the road, without any care
Oh, high

Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown
Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown and divine

Divine

Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown
Oooh, the depth of the sun reminds of something unknown and divine
