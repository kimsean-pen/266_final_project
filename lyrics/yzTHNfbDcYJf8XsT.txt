Staring up at the ceiling.
While I'm falling into the flames.
Something's gnawing.
My shoulder and scarring.
This moment into my memory frame.

The fathers speak, but might as well be castrated (castrated)
It feels so good from where I stand.
The one abstaining from all human needs and pleasantries is the one I never will be.

Collecting through the sheets a sense of power filling me and I will never let go.
I'm never letting go.

Bending will of man and the hearts of the gods.
Shut the fuck up and let us live a life we can call our own.

Leave me alone.

If you love the guilt then let it die.
A life kept so clean will measure the price of misery.
If you love the guilt then let it die.
In silence we will remain.
If you love the guilt then let it die.
A life kept so clean will measure the price of misery.
But manifest a taste of paradise and surely you'll see the sin inside of me.
