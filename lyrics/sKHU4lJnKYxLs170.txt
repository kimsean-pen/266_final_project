As I'm looking through these pages
Re-reading my old statements
There's something in every word I write
that always takes me back to when I was sixteen
A kid that's dreaming of a life I still don't have
Is there something more for me
Than every day stuck on repeat
In a job that doesn't make me happy

Have I been pushing pen to paper Instead of catching up on sleep?
I'm overthinking every word that I write
that I write down
Am I outdated? Fresh ink fading like a name
etched In the concrete of our neighbourhood
That I can't read anymore

These days I don't feel anything
Except the emptiness inside of my chest
I keep reasoning with that voice inside of my head
That said you're taking too long
get a grip before it's gone
Have I been chasing a lie?

Have I been pushing pen to paper Instead of catching up on sleep?
I'm overthinking every word that I write
that I write down
Am I outdated? Fresh ink fading like a name
etched In the concrete of our neighbourhood
That I can't read anymore

Have I been chasing a lie?
I can't decide if my choices are right Have I been wasting my time
Am I wasting my time
I can't decide but I'll keep an open mind

Have I been pushing pen to paper Instead of catching up on sleep?
I'm overthinking every word that I write
that I write down
Am I outdated? Fresh ink fading like a name
etched In the concrete of our neighbourhood
That I can't read anymore
