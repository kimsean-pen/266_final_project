Darker than amber
Dark like your bones
Clearer than crystal
In the death of the sun

Built on the ruins
Of the black angel's tomb
The house of madness
Awake, burning for you

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom

Like a finger to the gods
The tower it stands
Exhibition of evil
Monumental and grand

Floor on floor of fear
Temptation, decay
I'm cold, sinister
I'm wicked and strange

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom

Like a statement of the sick
A mansion of grief
If you walk into the house
You will never leave

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom.
