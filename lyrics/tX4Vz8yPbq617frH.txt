Hello?
Hello?

Oh, talk to me in the casket
And dress the stiff for the dance
Talk to me in the casket
And dress the stiff for the dance

Walk into time that stopped
Always said how good you look in the box
Walk into time that stopped
Always said how good you look in the box

Teel the hole what to engulf
Tell my painted lips what to kiss

In caskets carved with messages
In caskets carved with messages

Talk the lids into lifting again
Talk the lids into lifting again
Talk the lids into lifting again
Talk the lids into lifting again

Tell the ice to crystallize and
Talk the lids into lifting again
Tell the ice to crystallize and
Talk the lids into lifting again

Tell the hole what to engulf
Tell my painted lips what to kiss

In caskets carved with messages
In caskets carved with messages

Talk the lids into lifting again
Talk the lids into lifting again

Talk to me in the casket
And dress the stiff for the dance
Talk to me in the casket
And dress the stiff for the dance

Walk into time that stopped
Always said how good you look in the box
Walk into time that stopped
Always said how good you look in the box
