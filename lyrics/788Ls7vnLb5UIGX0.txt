I'm getting high off the vibe of the first fight.
Tonight (is the night) I will (finally) feel alive.
Can't pull me down or slow my pace.
I never give up on my inner battles.
They keep me company.
My grit and will are out the window.
Shattered glass is all I have to hold on to.

I'm getting high off the vibe of the first fight.
Tonight (is the night) I will (finally) feel alive!

I let myself down, when I beat myself up
I let myself down, when I beat myself up
I let myself down, when I beat myself up
I let myself down, when I beat myself up

Pleasant accidents, pleasant accidents, always worried
Pleasant accidents, pleasant accidents, forever focused
Pleasant accidents, pleasant accidents, always worried!
Pleasant accidents, pleasant accidents, forever focused!
