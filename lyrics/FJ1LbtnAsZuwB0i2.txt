On a point in time-present undefined
And it's getting cold outside
Situation statical-for reasons you don't know
Just short of indecision
And it's getting cold outside
And it's getting cold outside

For you own trepidation
Refer to new perspexion
See yourself as others see you
in reverse red can appear blue
wanna go outside
Don't you wanna go outside

Been stuck inside your room
so stranded-like and full of doom
all year
Time out for good behavior
adds up to what you want it to
what you wanna, what you
wanna do.

What informs a motivation-
casual or obligation-factitious circumstance
suspending all your future plans
wait for you outside.
If this false started motion
believes its own propulsion
tran-sending space and time,
then I'll wait for you outside
then I'll wait for you outside

Been so long since I've seen you
so much has changed, you sound the same
We're meeting at this place I wanna see you,
see your face again
We're all waiting, we're all waiting here.
