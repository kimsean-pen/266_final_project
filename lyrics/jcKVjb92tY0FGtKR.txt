Out of mind
Don't move a muscle
Stay out of sight
I would cut you out my dear
Modern life got you by the short and curlies
Suits you all just fine
I won't move a muscle

Hi, I'm a hell of a guy
When I'm walking that tightrope
Toeing the line
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
I, I'm not ready to fly
Swear I'll stick to the tightrope
Take in the sights
I might stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while

It don't take a genius
Don't move a muscle
And you're no good at hearing it
I can't see how you don't care
I'm no good at hearing that
You're OK to speak my name
To start over brand new
I won't move a muscle

Hi, I'm a hell of a guy
When I'm walking that tightrope
Toeing the line
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
I, I'm not ready to fly
Swear I'll stick to the tightrope
Take in the sights
I might stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while

Don't look down
'Cause you're likely to fall
With your foot in your mouth now
Wish the ground would swallow you whole
Don't look down
As I'm waiting to fall
With both feet in my mouth I hope
That the ground just swallows me whole

Running from me
All you gotta do, keep running from me
Oh no, I don't worry

Don't look down
As I'm waiting to fall
With my feet in my mouth I hope
All you gotta do, keep running from me
Always running

Hi, I'm walking that tightrope
Toeing the line
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
I, I'm not ready to fly
Swear I'll stick to the tightrope
Take in the sights
I might stay a while
Won't you stay a while
Won't you stay a while
