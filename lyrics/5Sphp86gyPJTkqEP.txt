it was right that we did meet each other in each other's eyes
it was right that we did see each other in our shadow sides
it was wrong then too that crazy love, loves crazy as it does
and each of us and both of us so crazy; as it was

who else is going to love someone like you that's marked for death
who else is going to be with you when you breathe your last
who else is going to take my place and hold and keep you safe/sane
who else is going to stay

you were right on time to break your head and make the death bed
you were right on time to crash those galaxies and flat-line
you were right on time to make the light inside of me a life
you were right on time to meet me, crazy love, and watch us die

who else is going to love someone like you that's marked for death
who else is going to be with you when you breathe your last
who else is going to take my place and hold and keep you safe/sane
who else would ever stay
who else would ever stay

who else would
who else would
who else would ever stay
who else would
who else would
who else would ever stay
who else would
who else would
who else would ever stay
who else is going to love someone like me

who else is going to love someone like me,
that's marked for death?
who else is going to be with me when i breathe at all?
who else would ever take your place and hold and keep me safe?
who else would ever stay?
