Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers?
Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
And now like maniacs, they scratch your back
Even when it doesn't itch

I want to figure it all
I want to figure it all out
I want to save you from
Save you from all that's vain
Save you from the things that cause us pain

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you

It's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you, my love

They believe you now
Have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star
You've got no right to bitch

But someday when you fail
They'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

But you're the real deal
And "real" is your middle name
You know sometimes I feel
Gotta earn every breath we take, baby
Never mind the rules we break

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you

It's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready rip you right off

With you I feel safe
There's nothing to fear from us
Away from the fangs, the fangs of the world
I may be a coward, but you are brave
And nothing seems so dangerous

'Cause it's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you

It's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready rip you right off

Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world
Cannibal world

So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you, my love
