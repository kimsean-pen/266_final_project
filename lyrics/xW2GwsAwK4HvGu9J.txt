I like girls
They are great
Strippers everywhere
I like this place
But I don't like all these fake people runnin' round
Pretending they got bands, all they got is they big mouth
But hey
I don't care

Cause in the end I'm flyin' private
And they just Ryan Air
I'm in the club, I don't know what the fuck is going on
Big smile on my face, DJ play my favorite song

And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now

We all fuckin' here now
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now

I been drinking Bacardi, I'm tipsy as shit

Turnt up in the party, it's lit in this bitch
Been drinkin' Bacardi, I'm tipsy as shit
Turnt up in the party, it's lit
I like girls

Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now
And we all here now, we all fuckin' here now
Let's smoke some weed and chase some Flügel shots with beer now yeah
We don't give a fuck
