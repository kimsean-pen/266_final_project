momentoCome on Eileen, come on Eileen
Poor old Johnny Ray

Sounded sad upon the radio
He moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers used to sing along
Who'd blame them?
You're grown

(You're grown up)
So grown
(So grown up)
Now I must say more than ever
Come on Eileen

Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means
At this moment, you mean everything

You in that dress

Oh, my thoughts, I confessed
Verge on the dirty
Ah, come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
These people round here
Wear beaten down eyes

Sun in smoke dried faces
Resigned to what their fate is
But not us
(No, never)
No, not us

(No, never)
We are far too young and clever
Remember
Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye
Eileen, I'll hum tune forever

Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye
Eileen, I'll hum tune forever

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means
Ah, come on let's take off everything
That pretty red dress
Oh, Eileen tell him yes
Oh, come on let's, ah, come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means
At this moment you mean everything

Come on Eileen, tooloorye, aye
Come on Eileen, tooloorye, aye
Toora, toora tooloorye, oh, Eileen
I said, come on Eileen oh, come on Eileen
We are far too young and clever
And things won't ever change
And I say, toora, loora, toora loorye, aye
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means
At this moment, you mean everything to me
Oh, to me, oh, Eileen
You mean everything
