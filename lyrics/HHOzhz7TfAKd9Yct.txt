Nail me to the cross in the darkest alley
I said, the Prince of Peace doesn't have to know about it
Say three Hail Marys, turn around, pray about it
C'mon, nail me to the cross in the darkest alley

Heartbeats through the dark that spread like a poison
And the tears ran hot like black tar of emotion
Inherit the earth where no words are spoken
And the sky like a veil was our wounds torn open

As she lies dying in a dark alleyway
Her lips, ruby red
And her eyes were morning green
But she whispered to me "Come closer, come closer"
And as I knelt down beside
With her dying breath, she said to me
"I'll wait for you, forever
And ever, and ever
And ever"

C'mon, nail me to the cross in the darkest alley
I said, the Prince of Peace doesn't have to know about it
Aw, say three Hail Marys, turn around, pray about it
Aw, come on, nail me to the cross in the darkest alley

Heroin(e)
She's my heroin(e)
She's my, she's my heroin(e)
She's my heroin(e)

And I was crying Hail Mary
God, I scream Hail Mary
On my knees I cry Hail Mary
Oh Lord, I scream Hail Mary

On my knees I scream Hail
Mary

Hail Mary
Mary (3x)

Hail Mary
Marry me (3x)

Hail Mary
Marry me (11x)
