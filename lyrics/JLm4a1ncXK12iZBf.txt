In the dawn an angel was dancing
Surrounded by an aura of light
But in the shadows something was watching
and with patience awaiting the night
Angel whispers: "mournful night, attractive night,
your dark beauty obsesses me."
An angel bewitched by the shadows
Seduced by the whispering lies

Chorus:
A spell was cast and the sky turned red
The angel's heart froze to ice
The blackness that falls is coming to stay
Under the snow lies angels so cold

Dusk has passed and a cold morning breeze
is sweeping all over the plain
On the ground lies an angel with skin so pale
On her face an image of pain
Snow is now falling to the frozen ground
The angel is covered by white
Frost is spreading across the plain
to welcome the eternal night

The dress is white with crystals of ice
and frozen roses so red
Roses of blood from an innocent soul
On the plain lies an angel dead

Chorus:

A spell was cast and the sky turned red
the angel's heart froze to ice
In the gloomy sky black clouds were gathering
The silence was broken by cries
A spell was cast and the sky turned red
and the angel's heart froze to ice
In the gloomy sky - The silence where dead angels lie

Touch the snow... Caress the lifeless sculptures
Die!

Chorus:

The blackness that falls is coming to stay
Under the snow lies angels so cold
Yet with each crystal of frost that is falling
another story is told
A spell was cast and the sky turned red
The angels heart froze to ice
In the gloomy sky - The silence where dead angels lie
