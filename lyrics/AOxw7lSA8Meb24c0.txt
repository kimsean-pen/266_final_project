I won't let this ruin me

My orchestra
My indecision
It all comes back full circle

From grace to all my hate
I never meant to hurt anyone
(Anyone)
I came for peace
(I came for peace)
And for great reason
There is no solace
There's no alleviation
In all our money
Or within her golden teeth

Is this it?
Is this how it goes?
I am the wretched one
I am the beggar's hands
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but feel nothing

Pick it up
Such a bitter friend
Change can be
Remind me God
Refresh what's turned to gray
Oh, my intentions
You vanish with the wind

Is this it?
Is this how it goes?
I am the wretched one
I am the harlot's bones
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but care no more

Is this it?
Is this how it goes?
It all comes back full circle
It comes back full circle
I cannot help but feel nothing

All that you know
I am all that you know
He had a vision as to what comes next
So disregard this unholy place
