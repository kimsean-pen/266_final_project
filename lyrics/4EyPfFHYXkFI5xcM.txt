I go hungry
Pick at the shell
Pop a bottle
Oh well
I'm with
My body

Like a bottle
Struggle for air
Like a woman
Like a prayer
I'm with
My body

I wear my body
Like a rotted peach
You can have it if
You can handle the stink

Like a rotted pig on the smoke
(?) A picture of me
Oh and my body

I go guzzled
Scrapped from the wind
Take it all
On the chin
I'm with
My body
