I know you're sleeping by now
I'm still up walking around
The walls of my skull bend backwards
And in like a labyrinth

I knew I was wasting my time
Keep myself awake at night
Whenever I close my eyes
I'm chasing your tail lights

In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

I know you left hours ago
I still haven't moved yet
I knew you were gone months ago
But I can't think of anyone else

I should've said something, something, something
I couldn't find something to say
So I just said nothing, nothing, nothing
Sat and watched you drive away

I just let the parking lot swallow me up
Choking your tires and kicking up dust
Asking aloud why you leavin?
But the pavement won't answer me

I just let the silence swallow me up
The ring in my ears tastes like blood
Asking aloud, "Why you leavin'?"
But the pavement won't answer me

I know I meant nothing, nothing to you
I thought I meant something, something, something
But I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
Sat and watched you drive away

I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I won't think of anyone else
