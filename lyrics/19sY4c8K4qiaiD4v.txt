Is that where we're at?

If we reach up as the waters climb in us
The hardest parts
Blind to reason, lose the sight of what's to come
Below or what's above
Falling away, keep all that sun below
Seen all your hype

Why'd you spend your time leading the chorus
When the war was just waiting before us?
As if you didn't know
You ignored all the darkest of warnings
Found our end in the silence of morning
It fell beneath the cold

I'll take the desert, you take the coast
But to each his own
I'll take the desert

If we reach up as the waters climb in us
The hardest parts of your silence
Tried to mark the fallen snow
We'll leave you here, you know

Why'd you spend your time leading the chorus
When the war was just waiting before us?
As if you didn't know
You ignored all the darkest of warnings
Found our end in the silence of morning
It fell beneath the cold

I'll take the desert, you take the coast
But to each his own
I'll take the desert, you take the coast
But to each his own
