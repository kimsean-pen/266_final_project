Standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
and I'm quite sure I'm in the wrong song
2 girls, 65, got a piece tied up in the back seat
"honey we're recovering christians"

In the springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring

And right there for a minute
I knew you so well
And right there for a minute
I knew you so well

Got an angry snatch
Girls you know what I mean
When swivelin' that hip doesn't do the trick
Me pureed sanitarily, Mr Sulu
Warp speed!
Warp speed!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

In the springtime of his voodoo
In the springtime of his voodoo

Every road leads back to my door / and right there for a minute
Every road I will follow / I knew you so well
Every road leads back to my door / and right there for a minute
Got all your crosses loaded / I knew

And I know she's not that foxy, boys, yes
I said I know she's not that foxy, but
you gotta owe something sometimes
You gotta owe, boys
when you're your momma's sunshine
You've got to give something sometimes
when you're the sweetest cherry
in an apple pie
I need some voodoo on these prunes

In the springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring

In the spring time of his voodoo
In the spring time of his voodoo
Yes, he, he was going to show me spring...
