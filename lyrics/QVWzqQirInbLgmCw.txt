Can I sleep in your brain tonight stranger
Can I rest my bones in your head
I won't make too much noise whilst I stay here
I just need some kind of shelter

Anywhere I try to go
I'm still stuck in my own skull
And lately that's no kind of place to go
All the walls have fallen down
Garbage lying all around
Is there maybe room in your temporal lobe

Can I sleep in your brain tonight stranger
Can I spend just one night on your mind
I can't live with this pain
With this anger
And I need some place else to go

I wanna sleep in your brain
I wanna wake you up early
I wanna make you black coffee if you like
Yeah
I'll do whatever's required of me
To have the roof of your brain above me
I got no-where else I can stay tonight

Can I sleep in your brain
Oh, can I sleep in your brain
