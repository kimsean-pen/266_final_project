Have you cried yourself to sleep
Have you felt this incomplete
Have you ever cut yourself so deep to see if you still bleed
Do you ever feel wanted
Do you ever feel needed
Do you ever feel happy
Or are you just like me

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope, the noose around my neck
I choke, cuz every time I'm fallin love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone, the brick inside my chest
Alone cuz every time I fall in love falls out of me
Love falls out of me

Have you ever wished for death
And prayed all night for your last breath
Have you ever wanted to forget the feeling of your dreams
Because I never feel wanted
And I never feel needed
And I'll never be happy
But I guess that's just me

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope, the noose around my neck
I choke, cuz every time I'm fallin love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone, the brick inside my chest
Alone cuz every time I fall in love falls out of me

I'll never forget the day I died
Love memories frozen and denied
Flower of my heart withered and dried

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope, the noose around my neck
I choke, cuz every time I'm fallin love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone, the brick inside my chest
Alone cuz every time I fall in love falls out of me

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope, the noose around my neck
I choke, cuz every time I'm fallin love falls out of me
cuz every time I fall in love falls out of me
Love falls out of me.
