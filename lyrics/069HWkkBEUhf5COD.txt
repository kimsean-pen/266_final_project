Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world is turnin' inside out - yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time I'm having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky's
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go go go
There's no stopping me

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I gonna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yeah I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all

I am a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh oh oh oh oh explode

I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit

I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
