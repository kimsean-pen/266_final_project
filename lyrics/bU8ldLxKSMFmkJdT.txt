Wait, wait for the moment to come
Stand up, stand up and take my hand
Believe, believe in mystery
Love, love is simple as 1-2-3

I'm a know-it-all, I'm the smartest man around
That's right
You learn real fast through the smartest girl in town

So, here a riddle
Here come a clue
If you were really smart
You'd know what to do when I say

Jump back, sit back, get back, relax, it's ok
I've called in sick, I won't go to work today
I'd rather be with the one I love
I've neglected my duties
I'd be in trouble but
I've been to college
I've been to school
I've met the people that you read about in books

Here come a riddle
Here come a clue
If you were really smart
You'd know what to do when I say
Jet pilot gone out of control
Ship captain on the ground
Stock broker make a bad investment
When love has come to town

Where, where is my common sense?
How did I get in a jam like this?
Believe, I believe in mystery
Love, love, love, love is simple as 1-2-3

Here come a riddle
Here come a clue
If you were really smart
You'd know what to do when I say
Why am I going out of my head
Whenever you're around?
The answer is obvious
Love has come to town
