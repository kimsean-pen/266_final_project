I know you're living in my mind
But it's not the same as being alive
I know you're living in my mind
But it's not the same as being alive

If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess we'll have to fight
If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess we'll have to fight

Lived for a year in a bed by the window
Reading books better than memories
Wanna feel the seasons passing
Wanna feel the spring

Of Supersmmetry
Of Supersymmetry

It's been a while since I've been to see you
Don't know where but you're not with me
Heard a voice like an echo
But it came from me

Ah la la la la la
Ah la la la la la
Ah la la la la la
Ah la la la la la
