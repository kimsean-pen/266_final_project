You're irresistible, you're mine
Don't want you for the weekend, don't want you for a day
Don't need a love divided, don't want to feel this way.
See I want you to need me, (the way that I need you)
Just like I need you (the way I see you)

And I want you to see me, like no one before
You're irresistible, you're natural, and physical
It's indefinable, it's magical, illogical
So make-you-mineable

You're mine
So can't you see I'm tortured, oh cant you hear my pain?

If youd just let me show you (show you)
I'll be your summer rain

Then you'll feel that you want me (the way I feel it)
Just like I want you (the way I want you)
And you know nothing is better
It's like nothing before
You're irresistible, you're natural, and physical
It's indefinable, magical, illogical
So make-you-mine-able
You're mine

Now you feel what I'm feeling (dont you feel what I'm feeling)

Don't you know that it's more (it can take you places)
It can take you places, like never before
You're irresistible, you're natural, and physical
It's indifineable, magical, and illogical
So make-you-mine-able
Your mine
