There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
So their cries for help
Will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand

Nou se mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Got to start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world (We are the world)
We are the children (We are the children)
Its for the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
(We are the ones who make a brighter day)
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving (let's start giving)
There's a choice we're making

There's a choice we're making (choice we're making)
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes
We'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond

Love the whole planet sing it along

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives (saving our own lives yeah)
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in

Nou se mond la
Nou se timoun yo

You and I
You and I
Uh, 12 days no water
Whats your will to live?
We amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the Worlds end
We can make the World win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
