Eater of souls, devourer of sanity
I'm calling thee!
Crawling chaos,
Thy name shall be revealed
Faceless father, ultimate void,
I am calling thee!
Delightfully wicked aristocrat
From the stars

Nyarlathotep!
Thrice invoked.
Nyarlathotep!
Circle closed.
Nyarlathotep!
Rise in our seal.
Ai!

Evil be performed in thy name.
Stalker of the stars,
Bringer of death to all!
Tear down
This feeble universe!
Black pharaoh
Reveal to us thy dreaded mysteries!

Nyarlathotep!
Sweet poison divine.
Nyarlathotep!
Evil incarnate.

Madness lurks
Behind thine faceless void.
Eldritch whistling from the cosmic gates...
Trickster, messenger,
Necromancer

Thee who walketh among mortal men,
Revered by those who know thine path.
Thee who walketh among the gods,
Feared by those who know thine intent.

Madness, corruption—rise
Chaos that creeps—divine
Liar—keeper of mysteries.
