Do you believe? Do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe, let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes, promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments
The blood and the body, control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your heart, show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene, I treasure, can you help me?
I sever, God, it's perfect, it's never really perfect

Now I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself

I cannot maintain a semblance of normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore

I'll throw it all away like everybody else
I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
I don't wanna be myself
