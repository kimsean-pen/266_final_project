Come and stay, make my day
Take away the gray
And set the wheels in motion
Down the road, what you do
Come and fall into
At the end of this day

You can flee, you can be
Your own enemy
In the end you will see no daylight
And you try, by and by
Falling from the sky
Like a nine days wonder
Call it you forevermore

Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher
I don't wanna see your affected smile
Not for anything, the time is nigh
Lay it on the line and run the mile
Reach a little higher

You can shine or resign
Lay it on the line
Or you make a bid for power
Vertigo, overflow
Just a cameo
Silent as a whisper

Raising cain, break the chain
Gather new terrain
Time and tide wait for no man ever
And your eyes are agleam
Like you're in a dream
Getting out from under
Getting out from under like you really like

Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher
I don't wanna see your affected smile
Not for anything, the time is nigh
Lay it on the line and run the mile
Reach a little higher

Give a little try, give a little more try
Never fall in line for a fleeting moment
Be and end all, I am aiming high
Climb a little higher

I don't want
Not for anything
So won't you run the mile
A little higher
Reach a little higher
