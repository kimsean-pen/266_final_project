I'm chasin' freedom for the fearless
I gotta do it cause' I can't chase fear myself
I'm bout as broken as I confess
But better than most that lay cower
Proud of who they crowd

You don't know me
Comin' to take your crown
Bow down

Cause' you know that I can do better, better
I don't need you to come in and show me how
Settle down

Cause' you know that I can do better, better
I'm not here to take no names or reservations

I'm the devil telling Satan
I'm just wild
Sit the fuck down

I'm a' kill it let me live just how I'm livin'
Ghetto heart with good intentions
I'm just wild

Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Down, down, down

Running circles causes regret
It's the only thing I see
Straight mental health

Black and white colored sunsets
Empty bitches need water cause' I'm a' give 'em Hell

You don't know me
Come in and take your crown
Bow down

You know that I can do better, better
I don't need you to come in and show me how
Settle down

Cause' you know that I can do better, better
I'm not here to take no names or reservations

I'm the devil telling Satan
I'm just wild
Sit the fuck down

I'm a' kill it let me live just how I'm livin'
Ghetto heart with good intentions
I'm just wild

Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Down, down, down

Limitations got you waitin' round in circles
Got my mind on melancholy
Now I'm fading color purple

Sit down
Sit down
Sit down
Sit down

Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down
Sit the fuck down

To stay alive don't stray your light
To stay alive don't stray your light
To stay alive don't stray your light
To stay alive don't stray your light
