Living miles apart
Breathin' the same old air
Watch another wheel turn
Turn 'til it goes nowhere
Raining down from above
Finding the same old god
Everything is undone
Nobody said it's fair

These ways don't open any doors

You're breaking me in two
Living like I'm castaway
I'm falling back into
What feels like another day
Sailing through a quiet storm
Waiting for an empty nest
You're breaking me in two
Living like I'm castaway

Drowning under my breath
Stare from across the street
Just a second too late
Waiting all of these years
I stand alone in my heart
Make a woman out of me
Try remember your face
It's always incomplete

You're breaking me in two
Living like I'm castaway
I'm falling back into
What feels like another day
Sailing through a quiet storm
Waiting for an empty nest
You're breaking me in two
Living like I'm castaway

Swimming all alone in the chaos
Watching all the planes as they take off
Tell me, is it now or forever?
Ever, ever, ever

You're breaking me in two
Living like I'm castaway
I'm falling back into
What feels like another day
Sailing through a quiet storm
Waiting for an empty nest
You're breaking me in two
Livin' like I'm castaway
