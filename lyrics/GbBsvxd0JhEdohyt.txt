When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
No, I didn't wanna work it out
(Normani)

Thought something was missing
We were too different
Baby I've been looking back now
I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out
(Dinah)

Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back, 'cause I
Boy I miss you

Said I really do
Boy I miss you
Now I understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do

(Camila)

Watching you with her, thinking I had you
I was like I was so dumb
Boy I should've known that you're the one
Boy I should've known that you're the one
So if it's not too late

I just wanna know
(Normani)

It's me baby, we could still run
'Cause I finally know that you're the one
Yeah, I really know that you're the one
