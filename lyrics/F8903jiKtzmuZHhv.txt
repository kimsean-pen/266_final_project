Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Breath the air, out there
We are free
We can be wide open

For you opened my eyes
To the beauty I see
We will pray
We will stay wide open

Don't analyse, don't analyse
Don't go that way, don't live that way
That would paralyse your evolution

Don't analyse, don't analyse
Don't go that way, don't live that way
That would paralyse your evolution

Lah-ay-ay this greatest moment
Lah-ay-ay the strangest day
Lah-ay-ay the greatest love of them all

Lah-ay-ay this greatest moment
Lah-ay-ay the strangest day
Lah-ay-ay the greatest love of them all

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Breath the air, out there
Fantasise
Fantasise we are open

For you opened my eyes
To the beauty I see
We will pray
We will stay together
Lah-ay-ay this greatest moment
Lah-ay-ay the strangest day
Lah-ay-ay the greatest love of them all
Lah-ay-ay this greatest moment
Lah-ay-ay the strangest day
Lah-ay-ay the greatest love of them all
Lah-ay-ay da-da da-da da
