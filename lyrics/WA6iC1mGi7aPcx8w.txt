I once had a heart
Inside of me
But I heard the devil speak
And he laughed at me
I once had a soul
But you made me weak
The devil told me
That is all you'll be

I once had a heart
I had a chance
To be forgiven
By you my friend
Oh, I once had a soul
From where we came
But we are older now
Now who's to blame
Oh, I once had a soul

I once had a friend
To hold my hand
When life was hard to live
We had a plan
Oh, time always change you
From what you are
Like things are supposed to
We've gone too far

I once had a heart
I had a chance
To be forgiven
By you my friend
Oh, I once had a soul
From where we came
But we are older now
Now who's to blame
I once had a soul

I once had a heart
Inside of me
But I heard the devil speak
And he laughed at me
I once had a soul
But you made me weak
The devil told me
That it's all you'll be

Oh, gotta go back in time
Looking back I don't know what I'll find
I'm trying to understand why we're forgotten

Gotta go back in time
I don't know what I'll find
Trying to understand why we're forgotten

I once had a heart
Inside of me
But I heard the devil speak
And he laughed at me
I once had a soul
