I tell ya
It's hell yeah
When love says goodbye, it's a four letter word
Because your heart knows
When love goes
The feeling is bad it's the pits of the world
It's sad but true
When nothing you can do can bring it back

Standing in the rain
She starts to cry
When love says goodbye
Is it all a game
She wonders why
Why it had to start
Why should it end and take her apart

Because she shows it
She knows it
But what can she do, it's a four letter word
Because it shakes you
It breaks you
And when it's the end, it's the worst thing you heard
It's over now
And nothing you can do can bring it back

Calling out his name
She starts to cry
When love says goodbye
Guys are all the same
She wants to die
Hide away the tears
No one will see and no one must hear

But oh
How can the love that she has be profane
And how can something that's so beautiful
Just Jekyll and Hyde around
It's so sad

When love says goodbye
When love says goodbye
Four letter word

I tell ya
It's hell yeah
When love says goodbye, it's a four letter word
Because your heart knows
When love goes
The feeling is bad, it's the worst in the world
It's sad but true
When nothing you can do, can get it back

Standing in the rain
She starts to cry
When love says goodbye
Shouting out his name
Four letter word

I tell ya
It's hell yeah
Because your heart knows
When love goes
When love says goodbye
I tell ya
It's hell yeah
When love says goodbye
Because your heart knows
When love goes
