I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight
Li-di-di, di-n-di
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Li-di, n'da, da-n-di
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again ... yeah

Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
mmm-mmm-mmm-li-di-di
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Oh, falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
