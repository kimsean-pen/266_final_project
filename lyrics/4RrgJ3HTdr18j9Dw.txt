Watch disgust enshroud you
Under grey sheets of rain
Smile while you're wondering why
There's only ever pain
Well, you die if you worry, die if you don't
Thaw out that chill, or someone else will
Will your Christ stop bleeding
When we lean in for the kill?

I don't believe a word you say - Alles Luege!
I don't believe a word you say - Alles Luege!
I don't believe a word you say, anyway!

And here we are eating each other's seed
The soaring joys of the flesh and a drum to beat
Well, you die if you worry, die if you don't
Thaw out that chill, or someone else will
Will your Christ stop bleeding
When we move in for the kill?

That's why we teach today the joy in desperation
That's why we teach today the joy of desperation
