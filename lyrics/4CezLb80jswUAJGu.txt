Rolling down the free way,
master to the speed of light,
Screaming up in the air,
bursting through the night
No rest, I've stayed here too long,
It's time to move on

Reality's a three way,
a scenery defined
By tomorrow dubbed a mystery and the past just blurry lines
If there's ever been injustice in my name,
I bow unto blame

And you can give me everything I need this way
We'll be loving till the first light of the day

Set the world on fire with bitter sweet desire
To chase away the night, let the whole world burn
Set the world on fire for bliss in sweet denial, oblivion and peace
Will you let me burn?

Drifting like a cast off, the shadows got it good
With constant companions, would that I could
Further afield my nemesis on stilts is gaining on me

So I crawl across the state line, to another state of being
Holding on for dear life to the better days I've seen
Long for the comfort of your loving arms, your passions, your charms

And you can give me everything I need this way
We'll be loving till the first light of the day

Set the world on fire with bitter sweet desire
To chase away the night, let the whole world burn
Set the world on fire for bliss in sweet denial, oblivion and peace
Will you let me burn?

Did you ever feel your love eclipsing the sun
I give you the reason I'm still on the run
Disappear in the heavy glare of neon

And you can give me everything I need this way
We'll be loving till the first light of the day

Set the world on fire with bitter sweet desire
To chase away the night, let the whole world burn
Set the world on fire for bliss in sweet denial, oblivion and peace
Will you let me burn!
