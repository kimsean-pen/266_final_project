It feels kinda crazy

These covers may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place, cause they never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they can't say good night and tuck me in before I go to bed
Say, "Naw baby girl,
you're better off," that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else

These lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

These candles light up my room at night
But they can't light the room the way
you did when you walked inside, oh baby
If these walls could sing about everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad, sad song,
and it'll probably sound something like this
Say, "Naw baby girl,
you're better off," that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Everytime I think I'm getting closer
These tears drown me out, once again I lose

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
I put up a fight
Crying like oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win

Crying like oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
