She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby, oh oh oh oh"
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by"

So I said, "What you're saying girl it can't be right
How can you be in love with me?
We only just met tonight"
So she said, "Boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard 'Love Goes Down'
Something started burning in my heart"
I said "Stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door"

She said, "But I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby, oh oh oh oh ohh"
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-aay-by" (Yes, she did)

So now I'm up in the courts, pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, "I'm innocent," I contested
"She just feels rejected, had her heart broken by someone she's obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why 'Love Goes Down' makes her lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music"

And I'm saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by The Zuton's "Valerie"
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced, like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like I'm murdererous
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down
Even though I told them she

She said "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said "I love you baby, oh-oh-oh ohh-ohh-oh" (Yes, you did)
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by"

So I said "Why the hell you gotta treat me this way?
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no-no-no, umm"
