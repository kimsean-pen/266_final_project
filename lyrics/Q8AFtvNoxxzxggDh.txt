Because I was born this way,
I got lightning running through my veins,
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train,
So hop on board, or get out the way'
Cause I was born this way,
I got lightning running through my veins,
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train,
You can't stop us, we can't be stopped

Ever since I was an infant, I spit it,
Ate mics, and rocked Lennon,
In first grade, I drank my juice with rocks in it Never looked down, 'cause up, had more stains in it Always been about the heart, never cared who's winning'
Ha!... I chase the light, like emcees on the wrong mic
My blood was the wrong type, so I had to give my life And relearn, the minute that I felt real life
I'd rather create, than follow, welcome to the knife Because I was born this way
I got lightning running through my veins
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
So hop on board, or get out the way'

Cause I was born this way

I got lightning running through my veins
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
You can't stop us, we can't be stopped
Feel that smoke rise, to the sky
Split, like a dollar sign
Flip, when ya hear that beat, rip like it's dynamite

Cold, like a winter street, loud, 'cause I wanna be, The mic is my weapon, so I spit this artillery Ha!... I chase the light, like emcees on the wrong mic, My blood was the wrong type, so I had to give my life
And relearn, the minute that I felt real life, I'd rather create, than follow, welcome to the knife

Because I was born this way
I got lightning running through my veins
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
So hop on board, or get out the way'
Cause I was born this way
I got lightning running through my veins

Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
You can't stop us, we can't be stopped Let's go, Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly

Put 'em up, Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
Hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
Put them hands up in the sky, hands up you can learn to fly
So hop on board or get out the way
Because I was born this way
I got lightning running through my veins
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
So hop on board or get out the way'
Cause I was born this way
I got lightning running through my veins
Ain't nobody gonna stop this train
You can't stop us we can't be stopped
