Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand?
Beauty of the beast.

Fire at will, will, will, will
Fire at will

Yeah I would kill
Yeah I would freeze all hell all over
Just to get a chill.
Yeah I would slay, yeah I would maim
Yeah I would vanish in thin air
And reappear again.
Be right in the squares
Yeah, I would be sincere.

Yeah, I would lie, yeah, I would lie.
Yeah, I would be there waking up the dead to get a thrill
I say "Yeah", I say "Yeah".

Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand the Beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you.
Would you do it all, do it all for me?

Take your time
You'll be fine.
Yeah, there is nothing wrong with this
You ain't commiting crime.
You don't know why
It passed you by.
You search for something never found
Along these lines.
Someday you may turn around and terrify.

You can't deny, You crucify.
Would you get down in the gutter
Swallowing your pride?
I say "Yeah", I say "Yeah".

Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand the Beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you.
Would you do it all, do it all for me?

All that you get is less you deserve.
Leaving for now, someday I may return.

Would you love a monsterman?

Would you do it all, do it all for me?

Would you love a monsterman?
Could you understand the Beauty of the beast?
I would do it all for you.
Would you do it all, do it all for me?
