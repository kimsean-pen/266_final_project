Oh, another few years wasted
On the same old tears I've tasted
Time and time and time again
Oh, when will this cycle end
It's all part of the story
All the misery and glory
All the enemies and friends
And those with us until the end

Here's to the secrets we can't keep
Here's to the words we cannot speak
Here's to the nights that we forget
So beautifully tragic
Here's to all those who wish us well
And to the rest, you can go to hell
Here's to the memories that make me fucking sick
Beautifully tragic

All of the moments spending in time
We wish we could live, rewind (We live, rewind)
The clock and let me live it up again
(Live it up again!)
There is no pause, so we are living in time
Not realizing what's passing by (Passing by)
I'll take what we share (To the end)

Here's to the secrets we can't keep
Here's to the words we cannot speak
Here's to the nights that we forget
So beautifully tragic
Here's to all those who wish us well
And to the rest, you can go to hell
Here's to the memories that make me fucking sick
Beautifully tragic

Beautifully tragic
Beautifully tragic
So beautifully tragic
Beautifully tragic

Here's to the secrets we can't keep
Here's to the words we cannot speak
Here's to the nights that we forget
So beautifully tragic (So beautifully tragic)
Here's to all those who wish us well
And to the rest, you can go to hell
Here's to the memories that make me fucking sick
Beautifully tragic

Beautifully tragic
So beautifully tragic
Beautifully tragic
Beautifully tragic
