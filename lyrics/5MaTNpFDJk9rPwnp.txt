Watch you spin in your veils of protection
Layer on layer of dark colors unwind
Shake them off, but you never forget them
Show your scars to the mute and the blind

Only showin' your face to the lonely
Wear a mask for the masses so cold
Choosin' roads that are broken and stony
Let me tell you my dreams of our destiny

Speak to me, sing to me, bare your soul to me
Step through the mirror, join me inside
Run to me, stay with me, till eternity
Show me the face that you hide
You hide, oh

You are wandering spaces in limbo
Hearin' words from the voice in your head
Give a sign and I'll open the window
Step outside and I'll hold you instead

Only showin' your face to the lonely
Wear a mask for the masses so cold
Choosin' roads that are broken and stony
Let me tell you my dreams of our destiny

Speak to me, sing to me, bare your soul to me
Step through the mirror, join me inside
Run to me, stay with me, till eternity
Show me the face that you hide
You hide, oh

When you're all alone
Let me be your home
Keep you warm inside the storm
I will shelter you
While you're breaking through
Walls that hide your light

Speak to me, sing to me
Run to me, stay with me

Speak to me, sing to me, bare your soul to me
Step through the mirror, join me inside
Run to me, stay with me, till eternity
Show me the face that you hide
Oh, oh, oh
Show me your face
Oh, oh, oh
Show me the face that you hide
You hide, oh

Step through the mirror
