Came up, came up from the bottom
Waited, waitlist, on the pavement
For the time, by the water
Keep comin' back

In the Capital, on the Capital
Step lightly, let the river take you
In the seeking of life, in the corridors
In the Capital

Stressed out, fadin' from the shadow
Silent, witness by the sea
Cross it in style, the body electric
Hangin' in time

In the Capital, on the Capital
Step lightly, let the river take you
In the seeking of life, in the corridors
In the Capital

On the edge of it
When you're losin' touch
And
And it opens up
And you face the truth
Till you find???
Over the railing, yeah, after the corridor
You got no lives
