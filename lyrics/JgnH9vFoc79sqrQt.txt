There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real
As you and me
This as real
As you and me

We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real
As you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Time cover me, please

The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real
As you and me
This as real
As you and me

The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real
As you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Time cover me, please

I know we hate to think about it
But this as real
As you and me
This as real
As you and me
