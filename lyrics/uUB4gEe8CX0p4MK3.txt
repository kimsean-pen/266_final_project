I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes
You might say, a little righteous and too proud
I just wanna find a way to compromise
Cause I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers, never giving in
But, baby, since you've gone, I admit that I was wrong
All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie

How am I gonna be strong without you?
I need you by my side
If we ever say we'll never be together
And we ended with "Goodbye"
Don't know what I'd do, I'm lost without you
I keep trying find my way (Yeah)
But all I know is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day

I'm lost without you
How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues?
Baby, I'm so lonely all the time
Everywhere I go, I get so confused
You're the only thing that's on my mind

Oh, my bed's so cold at night
And I miss you more each day, Only you can make it right
No, I'm not too proud to say
All I know is I'm lost without you

I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you?
I need you by my side
If we ever say we'll never be together

And we ended with "Goodbye"
Don't know what I'd do, I'm lost without you
I keep trying find my way (Hey)
But all I know is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
I'm lost without you (Lost without you)
If I could only hold you now
And make the pain just go away

Can't stop the tears from running down my face
Oh! All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you?
I need you by my side

If we ever say we'll never be together
And we ended with "Goodbye"
I don't know what I'd do, I'm lost without you
I keep trying find my way (Yeah)
But all I know is I'm lost without you
I keep trying face the day
But all I find is I'm lost without your love
I keep trying to find my way
And all I know is I'm lost without you, ohh
I'm lost without you
(I'm lost without you, I'm lost without you)
(I'm lost without you, I'm lost without you)
