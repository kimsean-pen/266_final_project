This is the bar I'm waiting
This is the bar I'm staying
This is the bar where I can't think for myself

This is the bar I'm waiting
This is the bar I'm staying
This is the bar where I don't want no one else

Don't want no one
Don't want anyone

I'm tired
From all these dreams
Lack of sleep
I'm still wired
To want these things
Don't bring him
Don't bring

So, you're a liar, a liar, girl
You know your limit
Getting higher and higher, no
No, he can't commit
So you're a liar, a liar, girl
You know your limit
Getting higher and higher, no
No, he can't commit
No, he can't commit
No, he can't-

This is the bar I'm waiting
This is bar I'm staying
This is the bar where I can't think for myself

This is bar I'm waiting
This is bar I'm staying
This is the bar where I don't want no one else

Don't want no one
Don't want anyone

I'm tired
From all these dreams
Lack of sleep
I'm still wired
To want these things
Don't bring him
Don't bring

So you're a liar, a liar, girl
You know your limit
Getting higher and higher, no
No, he can't commit
So you're a liar, a liar, girl
You know your limit
Getting higher and higher, no
No, he can't commit
No, he can't commit
No, he can't-

Fall
Or do you crawl
Back to where you're from?

Sweet angel
I'm unable to
Give this one up
Gameover
I'm heartbroken
I gave you up
