There's no time for things that I perceive
as bringing out the worst in me
It's hard enough to get up off the ground
But I'm holding onto useless thoughts
of a fight I wish I never fought

And now my back's against the wall
At least there's nowhere left to fall
Just the time it took to fix my lack of trust
I do all I can, but still it's not enough
Now I'm holding on to shed this ball and chain
I tried, but I'm still dragging dead weight
I'm lusting for the little things I love

I never learned with any self-control
Guess I just couldn't bring myself to care
So many years I wasn't there
Now I'm living with no time to spare
My pattern overthinking isn't scarce
I just couldn't bring myself to care
Myself to care

And now
my back's against the wall At least there's nowhere left to fall Just
the time it took to fix my lack of trust I do all I can,
but still it's not enough
Now I'm holding on to shed this ball and chain
I tried, but I'm still dragging dead weight
