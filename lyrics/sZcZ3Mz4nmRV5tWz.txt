I'm so mesmerized
I am caught up in the eyes of a Tropicana sunrise
Aloha to the world, swimming through a color swirl
Dreaming of a bright-eyed girl
Who's got turquoise pearls, seductive eyes (c'mon, c'mon)
Kiss my lips, pull me in like a riptide, yeah

You are blinded by the all knowing Illuminati eye
I have one question for your god and that is why
I said why Eve, why Eve, why Eve, why'd you eat the fruit?
Why Eve, why Eve, why? Why oh why oh why?

Look at that tequila sunrise, that tequila sunrise
Look at that tequila sunrise burning, burning, burning
In the distance, can't you see? Oh, can't you see?

I sailed across the earth in search of a humble head
Bermuda was a gamble
So I played my cards and I won the bet
I never underestimate what ancient stories teach you
I lost the world but gained a man

Thanks to Machu Picchu

I'm blinded by the all knowing Illuminati eye
I have one question for your god and that is why

I said why Eve, why Eve, why Eve, why'd you eat the fruit?
Why Eve, why Eve, why? Why oh why oh why?

Look at that tequila sunrise, that tequila sunrise

Look at that tequila sunrise burning, burning, burning
In the distance, can't you see? Oh, can't you see?

Can't you see? Yeah, say can't you see?
Hieroglyphic images are painted on the wall, yeah
Yeah, miss Cleopatra in love I fall
Hieroglyphic images are painted on the wall, yeah
Yeah, miss Cleopatra in love I fall
Look at that tequila sunrise, that tequila sunrise
Look at that tequila sunrise burning, burning, burning
In the distance, can't you see? Oh, can't you see?
Oh can't you see? Oh can't you see?
