In case I fall for you
Will you burn all boats behind you and hit the road with me?
And as we pull through
Two partners in crime
We settle down in Alabama and pretend we're free from fear

In case I provoke you to fury
Will you play the husky voice and show me that our love can heal?
And as we live the life of Riley
Will our browntanned skin and the wind up
the hills keep at bay all our demons within?

Oh I think I love you
Once again an old flag was blown away
Oh I think I'm in love
In love with you
Nowhere else will I find peace but when I'm with you

In case I fail to remain true to you
Will you say we are meant to be and that's why you won't leave?
And as I slash your devoted heart
Will you put up with him being next to me?
'Cause that's how love's supposed to be
Or will you walk out of the tale I really wanted to be real?

Oh I think I love you
Once again an old flag was blown away
Oh I think I'm in love
In love with you
Nowhere else will I find peace but when I'm with you

Will I find peace?

Oh I think I love you
Once again an old flag was blown away
Oh I think I'm in love
In love with you
Nowhere else will I find peace but when I'm with you
