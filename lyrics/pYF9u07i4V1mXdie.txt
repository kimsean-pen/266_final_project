Omit myself
(Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself as a favor of God
(All my rights are evryone's enemy)
Suffer fate cuz it's the only lift you've got
Dedicating all of before to now
Emphasizing these things you won't allow
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life we take our cover
(Echoing what is not)
Going nowhere
(Take it from your eyes)
Going nowhere's the only clear whot
(All my rights are evryone's enemy)
At being somewhere the fates think you're not
Somewhere's hole to divides any way you want
Faking now faking who you are
Never now we need the other
(Centralize the force of rot)
In your life I'll take my cover
(Echoing what is not)
Never now I need the other
(And if you're suffering a lot)
In your life we take our cover
(Try being someone you're not)
