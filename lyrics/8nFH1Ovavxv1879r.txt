If you lose me, you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure
If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure

When you were sick I held your hand
When you were in trouble I tried to understand
To stay with you i'd do anything I can
Cuz, losing you was not part of the plan

Melbourne is a tropical London
American in a tropical London
Abandoned in a tropical London
Oh no, oh no

If you lose me you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure
If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure

A souvenir reminds me of you
Everyday I cast a glimpse of us two
I'm the one called to the rescue
that's why i'm confused, you withdrew

Melbourne is a tropical London
American in a tropical London
Abandoned in a tropical London
Oh no, oh no

If you lose me you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure
If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure

Medication lead to an altercation
It's a hazardous in the valley of deception
And i walk along, but it was not my intention
Not my invention
But now my hearts been ripped wide open

If you lose me you lose a good thing
That's one thing I know for sure
If you lose me, girl, you lose a good thing
that's one thing I know for sure
