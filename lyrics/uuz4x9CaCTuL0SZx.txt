Everywhere is somewhere baby,
So can't you see we're in the middle,
Somewhere.

Nowhere just means knowing nothing,
of where you've been or where you're going,
feels farther.

You're a sight to see this early morning,
getting lost in my own,
neighborhood.

The same freedom you feel,
Is what's been blowing in my sail,
Since I arrived here.

It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, or nothing.

It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, or nothing.

Slowly coming into view,
The images, are slowly,

Slowly coming into view
The images, are slowly.

Blending out for once,
I know there's less to life,
Once more it's looking for me.

Saying yes instead of no,
And wondering what to make,
of my directions.

Won't be long that's just to gaze,
And days will fall to dreams,
something familiar.

It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, or nothing.

It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, all, all,
It's all, all, or nothing.
