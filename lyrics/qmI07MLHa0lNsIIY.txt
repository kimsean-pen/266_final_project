Du-lu-du-du, du-lu-du
Du-lu-du-du, du-lu-du
Du-lu-du-du, du-lu-du

I've seen it all, I've seen it all today
I cried a tear, I tried to turn away
But it's raining in my heart
Every time we are apart
And the sun won't shine today
So I have to walk away

If I could fly (if I, if I)
You know that I'd try (I try, I try)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
You know that I'd try (I try, I try)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
Raining in my heart
It is raining in my heart

So I must leave
The place where I will go
You cannot come
I guess you'll never know
Still it's raining in my heart, every time we are apart
And the sun won't shine today
So I had to walk away

If I could fly (if I, if I)
You know that I'd try (I try, I try)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
You know that I'd try (I try, I try)
If I could fly (if I, if I)
Raining in my heart
It is raining in my heart

Raining in my heart
Raining in my heart
