You lived your life like you were on fire
But how can I dance when your soul just lifted me higher and higher and higher?

Paint bleeds, ink runs, image of your love
Your memory, our history
(Why did you have to go?)

I'd give up my eyes to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect even if I were blinded
But you have to die for me to see how to live

(For me to see how, for me to see how oh,
For me to see how, for me to see how oh)

I lived my life hiding in shadows but now I can see
'Cause your soul is lifting me higher and higher and higher

Paint bleeds, I can't breathe, need you here with me
Close my eyes I can feel you close
(Why did you have to go?)

I'd give up my eyes to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect even if I were blinded
But you have to die for me to see how to live

Angels fall
It's not your fault
Time goes on without you (without you)
Goodbye old friend
We'll meet again
Life goes on without you

(Why did you have to go?)

I'd give up my eyes to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect even if I were blinded
But you have to die for me to see how to live

(For me to see how, for me to see how oh,
For me to see how, for me to see how to live
for me to see how, for me to see how oh)
