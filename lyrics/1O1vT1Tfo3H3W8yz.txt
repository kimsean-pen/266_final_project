How much does it cost
To live the life of the dreams
And how long will I
Keep wondering how I could be

I want cost
There is a price
And it may not be nice

(Hey, oh) Where is your smiling face
(Hey, oh) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Hey, oh) How long will I wait
For the best revenge

I am
I am
I am

So how much did you lose
To live the life of the dreams
And how does it feel
To just look at me so complete

I want cost
There is a price
And it may not be nice

(Hey, oh) Where is your smiling face
(Hey, oh) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Hey, oh) How long will I wait
For the best revenge

Oh they got all the ulcers
Oh they got all the ulcers
Oh they got all the ulcers
Oh they got all the ulcers

Hey, oh
Best revenge
For the best revenge

(Hey, oh) Where is your smiling face
(Hey, oh) Say hello to a world of disgrace
(Hey, oh) How long will I wait
For the best revenge

(Hey, oh) Living well (I am)
(Hey, oh) Living well (I am)
(Hey, oh) Living well
For the best revenge

I am
I am
I am

I want cost
There is a price
And it may not be nice

I want cost
There is a price
And it may not be nice
