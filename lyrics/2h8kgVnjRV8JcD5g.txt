She burns

Today's on fire
The sky is bleeding above me, and I am blistered
I walk these lines of blasphemy every day
And still

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows what it is to burn

I feel diseased
Is there no sympathy from the sun?
The sky's still fire
But I am safe in here from the world outside

So tell me,
What's the price to pay for glory?

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows what it is to burn

Today is fire, and she burns
Today is fire, and she burns

She burns
She burns
She burns
She burns
She burns
She burns

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows what it is to burn
