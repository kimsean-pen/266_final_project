I wish I could be your last goodbye
I wish I was your man (I wish I was your man)
But I'm not, not even close to what
Not even close to what I think
I guess I'll keep disappointing you
I guess I'll miss the mark again
I guess I'm sorry
I have this tombstone quality
I wish that you could see me here
I wish that you could feel me here

I don't wanna be the only one to stay for me
Look what you've said and done for me
No one in the world has a voice that speaks to me
Hear what you've said and done to me

This morning when the fever broke
I closed my eyes and laughed
Thinking I can't go home again
I can't go home again

I know I'm not what I used to be
I know I rearranged my head
This is life, just keeps on chasing us around
Until it catches you, you're dead
They say I got right every god damn night
That's why I keep it to myself
That's why I'm sorry
I have this tombstone quality
I know you'll never see me here
I know you'll never feel me here

I don't wanna be the only one to stay for me
Look what you've said and done for me
No one in the world has a voice that speaks to me
Hear what you've said and done to me

Tomorrow when this fever brakes
I'll close my eyes and laugh
I can't go home again
I can't go home again

I can't go, I can't go home
I can't go, I can't go home
I can't go, I can't go home
I can't go, I can't go home
I can't go, I can't go home

(I can't go home)
