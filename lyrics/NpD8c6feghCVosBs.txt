A long long time ago
there was a volcano
living all alone in the middle of the sea.
He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too.
And from his lava came
this song of hope that he sang out loud
every day
for years and years.
I have a dream.
I hope it will come true.
You are here with me.
And I am here with you.
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
would send me someone to lava.
Years of singing all alone
turned his lava into stone
until he was on the brink of extinction.
But little did he know
that living in the sea below
that another volcano
was listening to his song.
Everyday she heard his tune
her lava grew and grew
because she believed his song was meant for her.
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea.
As he sang his song of hope for the last time.
I have a dream.
I hope it will come true.
You are here with me.
And I am here with you.
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
would send me someone to lava.
Rising from the sea below
stood a lovely volcano
looking all around
but she could not see him.
He tried to sing to let her know
that she was not there alone
but with no lava, his song was all gone.
He filled the sea with his tears
watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her.
I have a dream.
I hope it will come true.
You are here with me.
And I am here with you.
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
would send me someone to lava.
Oh they were so happy
to finally meet above the sea.
All together now their lava grew and grew.
No longer are they all alone
with Aloha as their new home.
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing:
I have a dream I hope it will come true.
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you.
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too.
I lava YOU!
I lava YOU!
I LAVA YOU!
