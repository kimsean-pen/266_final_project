So you thought it would happen
Good luck goodbye
I know when no one can reach you
No I don't mind
It's your word why would you fake it
These days go by
As you turn around-ow-ow-ow

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and its not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Help me keep us together
Right place at the wrong time
It takes all kinds of weather
Clear slate blue skies
So what no one can reach us
These days go by
As you turn around-ow-ow-ow

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and its not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Wasn't ever quite enough
