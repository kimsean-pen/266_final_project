Stop the season, stop the sting
A plastic mic, a broken string, oh...
Infected wound from a rusted ring
So what?

(Soon you'll be there too, soon you'll be there too)

Kissing families can't recall
A program to derail us all
Forgotten prison, it's been safe 'til now

It's no wonder that we did it this way
Kept looking forwards on paths sideways
It's everything that is connected and beautiful
And now I know just where I stand
Move on
Roll along
And that's your way
It's everything that is connected and beautiful
And now I know just where I stand

Thank god, your heart is too close

This can't be the bitter end
I know it won't

Well someone said I made a mistake
Kept looking forwards on paths sideways
It's everything that is connected and beautiful
And now I know just where I stand
Well, seasons always shift too late
Spent too much time now on paths sideways
It's everything that is connected and beautiful
And now I know just where I stand
Thank god it's over
