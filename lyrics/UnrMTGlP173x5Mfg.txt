I love the way
You slip your hand under the table at your parents' place
I hate the way
I can't concentrate 'cause I've been thinking 'bout your body

You say that I'm the one after a month
We talk about the future like we're drunk
Wanna back on you, don't bite your tongue
Don't care what this is gonna do to us

I know I'll be the one that you will never get over
You can't get over
You'll be the best I've had and I will never recover
So baby get closer
Let's fuck each other up
Let's fuck each other up
Let's make a mess of love
Let's make a mess of love

I'll need therapy
From all of the damage I wish you weren't so good to me
You you you can't forget
'Cause seven years later
You have to explain to her why you can't come in

You say that I'm the one after a month
We talk about the future like we're drunk
Wanna back on you, don't bite your tongue
Don't care what this is gonna do to us

I know I'll be the one that you will never get over
You can't get over
You'll be the best I've had and I will never recover
So baby get closer
Let's fuck each other up
Let's fuck each other up
Let's make a mess of love
Let's make a mess of love

I know that we are not forever
But we can fake it till the end
I know that no one has it bad

I know I'll be the one that you will never get over
So baby get closer
Let's fuck each other up
Let's fuck each other up
Let's make a mess of love
Let's make a mess of love
Let's fuck each other up
Let's fuck each other up
Let's make a mess of love
Let's make a mess of love
