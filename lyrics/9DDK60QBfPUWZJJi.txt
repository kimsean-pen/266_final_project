i guess the most that i can do
is make a call and tell you the truth
sing the words in melody
and hope that you'll believe me
here's another song for you
so this one this one makes two
still don't know where to begin
i'll just leave it at this

i'm sure you always feel my eyes on you
but i hope that you will never feel unwanted
wait for me to move out west
it's ok if you don't
i hope you know
you're my favorite thing
about the west coast
i wish i stayed
i hope you wait
so here i am
counting down the days
till california comes

this is the least that i can do
you know i'm bad at calling you
the best way i can accept
the lonely words i miss you
i'll say it but i'm sure you knew
you're what i look most forward to
coming back to where i've been
i'll just leave it at this

i'm sure you always feel my eyes on you
but i hope that you will never feel unwanted
if you feel unwanted
wait for me to move out west
it's ok if you don't
i hope you know
you're my favorite thing
about the west coast
i wish i stayed
i hope you wait
so here i am
counting down the days
till california comes

wait for me to move out west
it's ok if you don't
i hope you know
you're my favorite thing
about the west coast
i wish i stayed
i hope you wait
so here i am
counting down the days
(till california comes)2x
