Changing her colours she's off to the shore
She rides the soul train and he fights the law
Changing her colours she's off to the shore
She rides the soul train and he fights the law
There's a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure
So live and let live in love

One day he'll build a statue with his hands
So gentle when he tries to understand
This subterfuge he never really planned

Now you're living in the lifeline
We're moving
In the lifeline
We're walking
In the lifeline
We're throwing
So live and let live in love

Exchanging their letters their exits begun
With deathless precision he's aiming his gun
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sum
So live and let die in love

Neither has the ghost of a chance
Those decisions only can be made once
You never really know just what you're giving

'til you're living in the lifeline
We're moving
In the lifeline
We're walking
In the lifeline
We're throwing
So live and let live in love

He could have built a statue with his hands
So gentle when he tries to understand
You never really know just what you're giving

Now you're living in the lifeline
We're moving
In the lifeline
We're walking
In the lifeline
We're throwing to you
But I'm not leaving

So live and let live in love
Lifeline
In the lifeline
In the lifeline

So live and let live in love
Lifeline
In the lifeline
In the lifeline

So live and let live in love
Lifeline
In the lifeline
