Strike, illustrate
Cease, every moment grey

I concur
Retracting these splinters

Take, navigate
Disarm, in cycles crawl on

I concur
Retracting these splinters
Etched always
Lasting, reacting
In movements so permanent

I concur
Retracting these splinters
Etched always
Lasting, undying

A score unmarked

There is no way to compose the unchartered and unknown
The concept of a world without, the severity of it all

To comprehend the fragility
Lost in the harshness of endless
Cursed by what will embody
Lost in the harshness of endless
The cruelty of that which is cherished
