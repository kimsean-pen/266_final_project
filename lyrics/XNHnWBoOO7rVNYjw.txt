The end of June came
And took you away
We were all crying
Felt like I was dying
Black dress and black shoes
Tied laces for you

The saddest of days
Why couldn't we save you?
Why couldn't we save you?

Inside my head
At the edge of the bed
Where somberness lay
In your children that day
As goodbyes are spent
Holding on to what's left

The saddest of days
Why couldn't we save you?
Why couldn't we save you?
Nothing but ashes

In the old fire place
With all of the memories
He has erased
Heavier heels
His mourning concealed

On the saddest of days
Why couldn't we save you?
Why couldn't we save you?
