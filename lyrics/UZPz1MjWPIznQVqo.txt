So, what does it take
To reel me in to your embrace?
To hold me close with the fear of god,
If that's what it takes

But don't look into my eyes and tell me you love me

So, I am in pain.
I need your love, your embrace
So turn away with the fear of god,
I'll leave you to pray

Don't look me in the eyes and tell me you love me

You will leave me here to die
You will leave me here to die

Don't look me in the eyes and tell me you love me
