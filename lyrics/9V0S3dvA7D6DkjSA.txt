You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

Trying to break the chains, but the chains only break me down
They break me down

With your wine-stained lips, you are nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but you're warm as a devil
Oh, I gave you my heart, but you won't heal my sorrow
Tasted a break and I can't get more

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

Trying to break the chains, but the chains only break me down
They break me down

Baby, tell me why, why do you do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why do you do me wrong?

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love

Trying to break the chains, but the chains only break me
