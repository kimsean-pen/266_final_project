I see right through to you
See right through to you
See right through to you

I see right through to you
It's not like I don't feel your mood
What you have for me is different
Then the rest that moves
I'll be positive I know that I could be that too
Cuz you have it all, have it all

I see right through to you
See your every move
See right through to you
See your every move

I know you now
I reach your mind
You've shown some how
What I could find
On the inside
There you will see
We're all alike you and me

I see right through to you
See your every move
See right through to you
See your every move
