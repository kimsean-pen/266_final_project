He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face
Want to powder his nose
He will deflower the freshest crop
Dry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores

Dead is what he is
He does what he pleases
The things that he has
You'll never want to see
What you're never gonna be now
Sketch a little keyhole
For looking-glass people
You don't want to see him
You only want to be him
Mommy's got a scarecrow
Gotta let the corn grow
Man can't always reap what he sows

He is the maker
He is the taker
He is the savior
He is the raper

Dead is what he is
He does what he pleases
The things that he has
You'll never gonna see
What you're never gonna be now
Sketch a little keyhole
For looking-glass people
You don't want to see him
You only want to be him
Mommy's got a scarecrow
Gotta let the corn grow

Get back you're never gonna leave him
Get back you're always gonna please him
Get back you're never gonna leave him
Get back you're always gonna please him

He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face
Want to powder his nose

Dry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
