Moscow calling

Getting on a phone with a busy line
Knocking on a phone and losing my mind
Never never never never realize
It feels so far, like a millions miles
Give me give me give me give me little hand
Just listen to your heart, don't consider it
I'm looking out at the city night
I see your eyes in city lights

Moscow calling
Operator don't tease me
Moscow calling
Operator what's going on
Moscow calling
All the circuits are busy
Moscow calling
I'm going on ain't giving it up

Party party party party somewhere, going crazy
Night is calling me out, but I grip the phone
I'm having no choice
No coffee, no beer, no cigarettes, and line's still busy
Operator on the other end I need your voice
I need to hear your voice

Moscow calling
Operator don't tease me
Moscow calling
Operator what's going on
Moscow calling
All the circuits are busy
Moscow calling
I'm going on ain't giving it up

I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac

Moscow calling

When I hear your voice I wanna kiss the phone
I wanna get paid for the weeks I stayed alone
I have no one else to call, for you I wanna save it all
But it doesn't get through
I'm going on and on
I feel I'm gonna break this telephone

Moscow calling
Operator don't tease me
Moscow calling
Operator what's going on
Moscow calling
All the circuits are busy
Moscow calling
I'm going on ain't giving it up

I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
I'm phono phono phono phonomaniac
