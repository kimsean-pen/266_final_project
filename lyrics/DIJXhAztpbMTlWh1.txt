A three-letter word
You didn't need a reason
You played your cards
He took what he needed
And now you're running wild with the horses
On open fields, you're feeling free
Rose petals on an empty bed
You're holding on to a teenage dream
Dancing in a wedding dress but it is only in your mind

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves

The painful truth you'll have to let him go
Tears don't last long no I'm here to let you know
I still love you with all of my feelings
So much I can't count the ways now
I'd die for you a million times
And I hope that echoes through the end of time
I hope that echoes through the end of time

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves

Leaves
(She's falling with the leaves)

The idea scares me knowing one day you'll grow up
Will I embrace the change like seasons come and go?
I want to be there when you take your first steps and
Watch you climb to the top of a mountain
Treasure life in a million ways
Let your dreams and your heart light the way
Let your dreams and your heart light the way

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves

Color green, color green
The grass is red from all the cherry trees
Velveteen, velveteen
So sweet and soft she's falling with the leaves
