when I was like you
I might have had less thoughts about murdering myself
but when I see you I'm so happy that I went
you sit there as a company of rundown longhaired
I smell your clothes your brand new fingernails
and i hear you whispering about me
but I will avoid your eyes
because I know I am the world's ugliest lady
I used to have less worries of life
but when I see you I'm so happy that I went
i never dressed like you
I don't know what it is this feeling of belonging
I ran away from school haven't we had such a great time together
no I won't reply to any of your emails
I never I've just lost interest
and I still hear you whispering about me
but I will avoid your eyes
because I know you all just hate me
And now i have a very good life
a very good life a very good life
but people like you don't need to be in it
