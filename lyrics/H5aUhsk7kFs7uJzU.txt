Reaching depth of clarity, I'm not supposed to be like this
I should be on the top of the world, is anybody out there like me?

I followed, something's missing
Self-control forcing me down
Whispers consume the air
Above her I'm endless

When the rain comes falling, I'll freeze, I'm so afraid
When the things start to flood me
I will drown in seconds

Fear, there's a way out
Touch of red, break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's a way out

As if I ever had a choice
All in the hands of the energy
Once again I feel the quicksand swallow me
Tonight I won't struggle

Fear, there's a way out
Touch of red, break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's a way out

The weak in me should know
I'm as sober as I could be

Fear, there's a way out
Touch of red, break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's a way out (there's a way out)
