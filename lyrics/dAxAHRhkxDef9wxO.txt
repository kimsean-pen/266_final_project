I won't pretend
That we can control the night
Or what kind of road we're on
Or where we will see the light
But right now I'm talking to ya
I'm looking into your eyes
Right now I'm trying to show ya
That we're gonna be alright

Oh I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh, all I know
Is that my love,
It knows no end

All these pieces they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry
You every time
Because I'm forever on your side

They'll beat you up
But don't let em keep you down
You're always tough enough
And I'll always be around

Oh I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh, all I know
Is that my love,
It knows no end

All these pieces they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry
You every time
Because I'm forever on your side
Oh I'm forever on your side

Oh I can't promise
That a day will never come
Where the ground beneath us
Falls out and we got no where to run
Oh but you won't be alone
When the water starts to rise up
No you won't be alone
My darling when the rains come

Oh I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh, all I know
Is that my love,
It knows no end

All these pieces they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry
You every time
Because I'm forever on your side
Oh I'm forever on your side
Oh I'm forever on your side
Oh I'm forever on your side
