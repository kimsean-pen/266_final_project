The concept of fashion is the one to blame.
Painting the portrait of
Conviction-less existence.

Well, it must be difficult being so gorgeous.

Well it must be difficult,
Claiming to be the kings and queens
But it's all
But it's all
But it's all
But it's all for nothing.

This shall pass.
Megalomania.
This shall pass.
Megalomania.

Congratulations on mutilation for a life.
For a life.
Life, life, life, life, life, life.

I'm going to hope for you,
I'm going to pray for you amongst the wreckless and the black.
Salvation lies within.
I'm going to hope for you,
I'm going to pray for you amongst the wreckless and the black.
My time is yours my friend.

We all find ourselves so horribly weak.
(Oh God,)
Where's an offering.
Where's an offering.
Offering, offering.
