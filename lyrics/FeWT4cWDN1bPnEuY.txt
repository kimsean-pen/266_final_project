I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm going to start over tonight
Beginning with you and I
When this memory fades
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
With chances taken
Hope embraced
And have I told you?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable
We've tied our pain below
And no one ever has to know
That inside, we're broken
I tried to patch things up again
To cut my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you, have I?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

It's not faith if
If you use your eyes
Oh why

We'll get it right this time (this time)
Let's leave this all behind
Oh why

We'll get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes
Oh why

I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm going to start over tonight
Beginning with you and I

I don't want to run from anything uncomfortable
I just want, no
I just need this pain to end right here

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
'Cause it might save you
Yeah, it might save you
Oh, it might save you
It's not faith if, if you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
