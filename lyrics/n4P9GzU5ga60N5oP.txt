I met her at a racetrack
It was right before some concert
On a blanket selling bracelets
She was searching for a sponsor
I moved her to Montana
We hung on for several summers

It got druggie and we crumbled
But still I never haven't loved her
When you panic in the city
It feels like one too many walls
When it thunders in the canyon
You get the feeling you're too small

I washed up and I wandered
I did whatever business looked the best
I found a savior then I lost Him
Had a kid and all the rest
Then the doctor left a message
Said we're looking at these numbers from your test

When you're lonely on the prairie
There's still a couple people you can call
When it thunders in the canyon
You get the feeling you're too small

The detective was expensive
But he thought it was something he could solve
Found her serving breakfast
In a cafe in the Skyway in St. Paul
When we got to the Twin Cities
I said man I know some songs about this place
When they swept up all the empties the
parties always seemed like Such a waste

When you panic in the city
It feels like one too many walls
There's an absence in the middle
The people are all high or in withdrawal
When you're lonely on the prairie
There's still a couple people you can call
When it thunders in the canyon
You get the feeling you're too small

When they're down there on the blankets
You can see the lifetime in their eyes
You can purchase what they offer
Or see if they've got something on the side
You live your whole life
Just to travel to the place you're gonna die
You travel your whole life
Just to get out to the place you're gonna die
