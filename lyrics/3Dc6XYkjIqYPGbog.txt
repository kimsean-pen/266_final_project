Sleeping has never been so easy
Though I'll still toss and twitch my feet
You walking by every one of my dreams
Makes closing my eyes easier than it seems

And if it seems you don't feel the same
That's alright with me
I understand with me isn't quite the best place to be
But your smile reminds me of a place that I can't put my finger on so
Just say the word and I'm gone

I linger on all the things that you've said to me
Always wanna be your flower
I wanna make you feel real easy
I wanna hear you talk for hours

And baby love, if it's bad
If it's not what you'd hoped for
You can always take it back
I'd give you what I can afford
'cause everything you do I adore
So maybe you could let me hold your hand real tight
And tell you why the sea reminds me of you

And then sleeping has never been so easy
Though I wish that you could be near
It feels like I've fallen for you completely
Maybe it's best that you can't be here
