Here I come again now baby
Like a dog in heat
Tell it's me by the clamor now baby
I like to tear up the street
Now I been smokin' for so long
You know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You best get oughta the way

The road I cruise is a bitch now baby
But no you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way baby
You know I'll burn it down

You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You better trust your f-a-t-e...

Yeah sometimes you wanna get higher
And sometimes you gotta start low
Some people think they gonna die someday
I got news I've got to go
Come on come on up
Come on come on up
Come on come on up
Come on come on up
Come on come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on come on up
Come on come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on
Road I cruise is a bitch now
You know you cant turn me round
And if a house gets in my way
You know I'll burn it down
You ran the night that you left me
You put me in my place
I got you in a stranglehold baby
That night I crushed your face
