Woe is me
Faithless you and selfish me
I will leave a key for you outside my doorway

Woe is me
One if by the land or two by sea
So won't you leave for me a light outside your doorway

On a ladder from there to here I'll climb
All this clatter between my ears I find
Does it matter if I can't clear my mind
There's a right and a wrong time

Woe is me
Sentimental you and faithful me
And I will be the one to gaze on you discreetly

Slow your speed
Turn yourself around and follow me
'Cause I will be the one who preys upon you sweetly

On a ladder from there to here I'll climb
All this clatter between my ears I find
Does it matter if I can't clear my mind
There's a right and a wrong time

On a ladder from there to here I'll climb
All this clatter between my ears I find
Does it matter if I can't clear my mind
There's a right and a wrong time
There's a right and a wrong time
There's a right and a wrong time
