Once church emptied out
We lobbied hard to look at track homes open houses
With our mom and dad
Fantasizing the air conditioning
Instead of quiet time in my room
Where Sunday afternoon felt like a tomb

Never not dreaming big
Looking at model homes again
Tired of where we live
Hoping that it's not if but when

Shuffling our shoes on brand new carpet
Freeze tag with static electricity
Wondering how our lives would be
I wanna live with someone else
Give them my whole self
I wanna not be lonely

Never not dreaming big
Looking at model homes again
Tired of where we live
Hoping that it's not if but when

When will the wait be over?
When will the wait be over?
