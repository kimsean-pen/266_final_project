Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause you know, Sloopy, girl,
I'm in love with you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And so I sing out
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy wears a red dress, yeah,
as old as the hills (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But when Sloopy wears that red dress, yeah,
you know, it gives me the chills, oh, oh (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, when I see you walkin',
walkin' down the street (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I say, "Don't worry, Sloopy, girl,
you belong to me" (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And so I sing out
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy, Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
