Just breathe
The midnight air will do you well
Believe
I miss your taste, I miss your smell
The past mistakes that brought you here
I'll break the fall for you, my dear
I'll ask the nurse for bandages
And send me on my way
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Every other day
I sit and wait for the same bad news
Can you hear me say
I've got nothing left to lose?
Someone please start making sense
And beg the Lord for accidents
I've seen the worst case scenario
Slowly letting go
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe
