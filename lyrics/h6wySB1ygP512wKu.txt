I have become a silent movie
The hero killed the clown

Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

Nobody knows what he's doing
Still hanging around

Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

The slow motion moves me
The monologue means nothing to me

Bored in a role, but he can't stop
Standing up to sit back down and lose the one thing found

Spinning the world like a toy top
Till there's a ghost in every town

Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound
Can't make a sound

Eyes locked and shining
Can't you tell me what's happening?

Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?
Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?

Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?
Why should you want any other
When you're a world within a world?
