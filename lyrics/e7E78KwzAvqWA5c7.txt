I remember stormy weather
The way the sky looks when it's cold.
And you were with me, content with walking
so unaware of the world

Please don't drive me home tonight,
cause i dont want to feel alone.
Please don't drive me home tonight,
cause i don't wanna go

Tuesday morning in the dark
I was finding out who you are

I took your picture while you were sleepin
and then i paced around the room
If I had known then that these things happen
would they have happened with you?
ohh

Please don't drive me home tonight,
cause i dont want to feel alone.
Please don't drive me home tonight,
cause i don't wanna go

Tuesday morning in the dark
I was finding out who I was

And if you turned around to see me
and i was gone
Should have looked outside your window
cause the sun was coming up
the sun was coming up

Please don't drive me home tonight,
cause i dont want to feel alone.

Tuesday morning in the dark
We were finding out who we are
Tuesday morning in the dark
We were finding out who we are
who we are
who we are
who we are
who we are...
