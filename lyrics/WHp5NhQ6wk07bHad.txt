Wrote a little book ... your name
Turn the page and wrote the same
I wrote in blood
Turn around the corner and see your face
Every time I look something breaks
I wrote in blood
We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new
Made a little call on the telephone
Tried to see if you're alone
I wrote in blood
Took a little pill to see your face
found the sleep in your embrace
I wrote in blood
I wrote in blood
We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new
