Seventeen a nature's queen, know what I mean
Twenty one, a long one, and you can see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of God above you, before the spirits meet

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

Shadow work is closin' in above the lamps in your street
Lucifer goes walkin' down free to meet
Minutes pass so slowly by the, hands on your clock
Heaven don't open when you knock

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

With all darkness closin' in, will the light reveal your soul?
One sweet kiss on your clay cold lips, I'll not sleep you'll never know
Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go from here?

Seventeen a nature's queen, know what I mean
Twenty one, a long one, and you can see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of God above you, before the spirits meet

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
