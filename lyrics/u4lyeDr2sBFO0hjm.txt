If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep the secret if it's what you want
Here we are
4 am
Champagne lies
Say I'm just a friend
But like a sun
You came and went
In the dark alone again
I've been on the outside
Looking into your life
Reading into blurred lights
Even if it's just for tonight
If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep the secret if it's what you want
Such a fool for believing
We're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat
Every time that you call
When you need someone
I can be someone
Made up my mind
Made up my bed
You come around and mess them up again
And like a breeze
It's so effortless
The way you blow off everything
I've been on the outside
Looking into your life
Telling little white lies
Even if it's just for tonight
If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep the secret if it's what you want
Such a fool for believing
We're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat
Every time that you call
When you need someone
I can be someone
If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
If you need someone
I can keep the secret if it's what you want
Just for tonight
If you need someone
Doesn't have to mean that we should fall in love
(I can be someone)
If you need someone
I can keep the secret if it's what you want
(If it's what you want, what you want)
Such a fool for believing
We're more than we are
But my heart skips a beat
Every time that you call
When you need someone
(I can be someone)
I can be someone
(I can be someone)
Oooh, oooh
I can be someone.
