Every time I look at you
I see it in your eyes
Your pretty, yeah but no, not like diamonds in the sky
I look into your soul
Don't like what I can see
But you can make me hope
This puppy still broken me
This puppy still broken me

But don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok
So don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok without you

Don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok
So don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok without you, without you, without you
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

Now look at where we are
Can you see how far we've come
We moved but never left
â€˜Cause it's over yeah we're done
You said we had it all
But it all we have is you
It was never room for us
This puppy still broken me
This puppy still broken me

Now others left to do
Let's clean up all the pieces
I clean up after you
Until my love decreases

But don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok
So don't you worry
I'll be ok, I'll be ok without you, without you, without you
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
