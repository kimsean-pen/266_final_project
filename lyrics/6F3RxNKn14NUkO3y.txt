Could you be near me,
There's something that I need to say
It's kind of a strange thing,
Just tell me that it's okay
Have you ever felt like
You'd always be alone
Like no matter what you do
You'd always feel this hole

If you could just read me
I would make everything right
Inside there's a real me

Who's been shying away from the light
Don't you believe me?
Are you alright?
Is there even a real me?
Or am I just a series of nights?

Blush
Blush

Now you have my secrets
But you haven't said a thing
Show me your darkness
Bet my shadow'll take it in

Have you ever felt like
You would always be alone
Like no matter what you do
You'd always feel this hole

If you could just tread me
I would make everything right
Inside there's a real me
Who's been shying away from the light
Won't you believe me
Are you what I need?
Is there even a real me?
Or am I just a series of nights?
