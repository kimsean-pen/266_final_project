I'm lost, then focused
I turn around and notice
We are more than kids
Growing up like this

I woke up with a feeling
A face on my ceiling
Tears fall every time I think of leaving
You mess around and I tell you how it is
What's the deal, please tell me if it's real
No trust got me losing my shit
I got it back so I'm never gonna quit
Just tell me
So just tell me now

I'm lost, then focused
I turn around and notice
We are more than kids
Growing up like this
I'm lost, then focused
I turn around and notice
We are more than kids
Growing up like this

And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is

Some people
Call me crazy
And at other times lazy
It doesn't even phase me
I'm high off what he gave me
Get it in, gotta live, can't change me
Lately
I've been feeling so alone
With a message on my phone
Telling me you wanna go
And I wish I knew better
I wish I knew

I'm lost, then focused
I turn around and notice
We are more than kids
Growing up like this
I'm lost, then focused
I turn around and notice
We are more than kids
Growing up like this

And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is

And I just wanna fight this feeling
And I just wanna fight this feeling
Can we just fight this feeling

And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
And I won't stop, can't stop
This is how it is, this is how it is
