Shall we just go little wreck of my heart
Go for the waves out there
Oh I know, these are frightening seas

When old bastards are ripping apart
All what is kind out there
All we grow and how wild we dream

Oh, somewhere in this stubborn light
Over the waves and troubles now
I look out for yours like you'll for mine
So deep in the arms of the ocean now
When the bird sees the solid ground

And now we leeway when still and so dark
Peace in the waves out here
Thunder claps in the distance warm

Another one follows I count from afar
I never get used to this
First the flare, then the silence starts

Oh, somewhere in this stubborn light
Over the waves and troubles now
I look out for yours like you'll for mine
So deep in the arms of the ocean now
When the bird sees the solid ground

I've been counting on
The wind would know where I'm going to
And when stillness comes around
I'll ask what my heart would do about drifting around
So deep in the arms of some ocean now

I see feathers on every wave
From every old used to be
Ones you loved, did you let them dream?
I still lose it, I speak to myself
I ask out in nothing too to the birds
Why I'm singing still, am I singing still?
