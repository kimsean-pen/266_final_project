I looked all around the world
No one has it better than we do, uh, huh
Uh, huh
One thing I don't understand
Why don't we help more people 'cause we can, uh, huh

Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

How many tragedies
Will we see before we come together? Uh, huh
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better, uh, huh

Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

I have a dream
But dreams are not for free
We all need to change
Or just repeat history

If we were one
Well, it's easier said than done
You can play a part, make a brand new start
Come together, live forever

Why are we separated?
I thought that we were related
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
