When I'm in a crowd
Or on an island by myself
Silent or too loud
Wishing I was somewhere else

And I can't believe
You hit me fast and hard
When you turn to me and say
Never change the way you are

Trying to catch your eye
Things will never look the same
Now I can't deny
You're the moth and I'm the flame

There I go again
I should walk before I run
How can I explain
I can't stop what you've begun

I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning up my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

What goes on inside
Is a mystery no doubt
A roller coaster ride
I may never work it out

Here's the brand new me
Skates around and floats on air
I'm a sight to see
Rainbow colors in my hair
You have set me free
The one who gets me there

I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning up my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

Here is the place where
My head is spinning
Time is beginning
To race away

You come to throw me
Knock me off my feet
You give me wings to fly
The world goes crashing by
Again

I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning up my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
