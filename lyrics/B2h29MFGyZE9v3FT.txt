Take a look at us now the tide has turned
We're gonna take it over
Everything that once was lost is soon going to be won
So this is our moment of truth
I can almost feel it, touch it
And when I've got it I will never let it go

I'm gonna try my best and find a way on the conquest
Building it in stone for centuries to come
Mother will you have me blessed
I'm obsessed with this conquest
I will make them see that they were wrong

The city had fallen, the sky was gold
The war was almost over
A new tomorrow, let's watch it unfold
Yeah, I wanted to breathe life into this
A chance that I almost missed
When letting my guard down, I was struck by a blow

So I'll take a step back try it again
Though we might be boys in a world of men
I'm never gonna give it up, not now, not ever
Will we rise or will we fall
The look on your face said it all

You know you want it
You know you got it in you
We've got to believe
