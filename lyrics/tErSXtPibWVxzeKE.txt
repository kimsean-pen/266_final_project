I don't want to barge in on your secrecy see
dependency see it means nothing to me I
don't want to hear about your problems
and I don't want to listen to your apathy see
You're not like me see
You mean nothing to me
All your cash doesn't make you any greener.

I don't need anyone(x3) to tell me what to feel.
I don't need anyone(x3) to hate the world with me.
Day in, day out It's not that bad.
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again,
Day in, day out It's not that bad.
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again,
(wont have to worry again)
you'll never be alone.

Alone, In my room with a bucket full of phlegm
I don't need a music scene to tell me
who I am I should have got a warning
should have came a year ago should I
sent her a birthday card?
My conscience tells me no.

I don't need anyone(x3) to tell me what to feel.
I don't need anyone(x3) to hate the world with me.

you'll never be, never be, never be alone.
