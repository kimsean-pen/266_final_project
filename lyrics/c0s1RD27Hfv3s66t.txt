You crossed my mind when I crossed state lines
I know I really should have called you
Between the city signs on the all night drives back home
I really should have called you but I just didn't want to

You've got me wrapped around your finger
Like a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?
'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet

I swear I saw your name in letters on a license plate last night
I must be losing my mind
Every song I've heard this week was written about you and me I think
I really should have called you, I just couldn't bring myself to

You've got me wrapped around your finger
Like a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?
You're keeping me awake in a hotel bed
You got me wrapped around your finger, so what's next?
'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet

So let's try to be honest I don't know what I want
'Cause it's too much to handle and I just get caught up
Tripping over every word I would say to you
If you let me 'cause you got me

You've got me wrapped around your finger
Like a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?
You're keeping me awake in a hotel bed
You got me wrapped around your finger, so what's next?
'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet
But I'm not down yet
