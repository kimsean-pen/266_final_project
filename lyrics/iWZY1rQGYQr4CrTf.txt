The day that we dreamed of
the day that we dreamed of
from here all the world is a raging fire
I know You can see what I see
They'll have their way

Everyone breaking down
If we turn and we flee

All I know is I'd rather die than believe a lie (Live a lie)
I cannot follow the blind
We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on
We will not relent

Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life
the day that we dreamed of
These voices are making me lose my mind
I know You can hear what I hear

They'll have their way
Everyone's heart bled dry

If we turn and we flee
All I know is I'd rather die than believe a lie (Live a lie)
I cannot follow the blind
We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on

We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life
When darkness arrives
I cower and hide

But You found a way to pull me out
They come in the night
To take what is rightfully in the hands of every son and daughter
We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on

We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life
We'll never back down
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming
As we press on
We will not relent
Now or never, till the day that we dreamed of
I see it coming to life
