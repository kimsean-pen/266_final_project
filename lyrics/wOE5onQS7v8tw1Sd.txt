White walls always weep
When I try to fall asleep
In this city by the sea
Walk the memories
Just me and the lavender moon
She knows
My heart belongs to you
Filled with secrets like these
Haunted by long gone dreams
She bends down low
Walks me home
Just me and the lavender moon
She knows
My heart belongs to you
