sleepwalker
moontalker tell me when your dreaming
tied down
hold on to words when you are sleeping
words you forget in the daylight
words that you are speaking
tied down by your dreams
words that you are screaming
cheaptalker
ten dollars
hear the words your speaking
tied down
hold on to words untill you are sleeping
words you forget in the daylight
words that you are speaking
tied down by your dreams
staring at the ceiling
tied down by your dreams
staring at the ceiling
