Mama pajama rolled out of bed and she ran to the police station
When the papa found out he began to shout
And he started the investigation
It's against the law, it was against the law
Oh what the mama saw, it was against the law
Mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa say, Oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm on my way
I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

Whoa, in a couple of days
They come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm on my way
I'm takin' my time but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
