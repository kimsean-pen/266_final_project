Girl you ain't the only one that's all alone
Now I'm only seeing you on the phone
What's a FaceTime?, I need Face to face time
Calls being dropped you think it's all my fault
I'm in the hills girl and I'm working extra hard
Don't let the long distance make a mess of us
Or make you think I'm less involved
I'll call you tomorrow
I'm tired of this

Temperamental love
Taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you

And, baby, me neither
I need to breathe you, I never need a breather
I need to see you and never say "see ya"
I need you now
I'm just as eager
I wait around that's the procedure
I don't ever do it on purpose, girl, believe me
Both getting heated
Tell me what's the reason
What makes you think for me this is easy

Temperamental love
Taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you

You give me the highs and the lows, baby
I'm hung up on it
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
You hopped on a plane with your woes baby
Do what you want but
I'm waiting up, all alone boy

Temperamental love
Taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you

(But I can't escape the thought of you, boy)
(But I can't escape the thought of you, boy)
(But I can't escape the thought)
(But I can't escape the thought)
