I'm a house wren hunting for a house
I haven't found one, I'm on the lookout
For a home to call my own
A private residence

Through the grapevine I heard an empty gourd
Is hangin up somewhere on some old lady's porch
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing at the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am halfway home

I'm a house wren who needs a summer home
A country farm house or a quiet bungalow
Not too big, and not too small
First-rate real estate

I got my eyes peeled for a window box
An old tin can, a boot or a flower pot
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing at the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home

I'm a house wren still hunting for a house
But I got a song and a lot to sing about
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go (off I'll go)
Because you know

I'm gonna sing at the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
I'm on top of the world
And it's a beautiful thing

I'm gonna sing at the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home
I am half way home
