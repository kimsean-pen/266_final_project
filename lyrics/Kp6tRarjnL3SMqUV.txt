I'd like to meet the girl I'm gonna marry
I'd like to meet the girl I'm going to see
Nothing ever changes in me
But you ain't got nothin', nothin' on me
The way everybody loves me I wish you could see
Nothin' ever changes in me

But I've go to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free

Like I said a long time ago things they come and things they go
Nothin' ever changes in me
You make me hungry then you make me see
Oh how happy my life can be
But nothin' ever change in me

I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
I've got to be free
Oh, I've got to be free
