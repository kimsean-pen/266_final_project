I'll do what I want and
I'll do what I like
When I make a million
I'll be out of sight
I'll do what I want and
I'll do what I please
I'll laugh in your face
When you beg on your knees

Ooooh, ooooh yeah
There's got to be a better way
Ooooh, and I don't care
I know that when I...

Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK
Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK

Every day is a drag
Getting caught in the rat race
You don't wanna be on the street
And every night when I crash
You can see it in my face
I look like I'm dead on my feet

So I'm saving my cash
Gonna live in the country
Cause that's what I plan to do
Cause the air's never bad
When you live in the country
The sky is always blue

Ooooh, ooooh yeah
There's got to be a better way
Ooooh, and I don't care
I know that when I...

Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK
Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK

Live in the country, live in the country
Live in the country, live in the country
Live in the country, live in the country
Live in the country, live in the country

I want the ducks and a lake and a family portrait
A pipe and a dog at my feet
I want a stall at the fete selling strawberry shortcake
And walls that are very discreet
And when my dull city friends slum it back in their bedsits
I'll live like a king every day
I'll be out of my head but they'll say I'm eccentric
And look the other way
I know that when I

Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK
Live in the country. if I live in the country
Live in the country, I'll find another way
Live in the country, get rich, live in the country
Live in the country, I know I'll be OK
