Oh, oh
Hold on ...
Ah, you know what?
Can we back it up just a little bit?
I said why, I said why (Why)
Oh oh oh
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me ...
Oh, oh ... yeah

We were born the same day
We even think the same way
It couldn't be more right
We are what they call a perfect match
It's something that you can't touch
Down to the last bone, you're my baby
But to be honest
There's just one thing
A part that is missing
You don't seem to care at all

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how(how)
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?
Why, tell me, my baby

Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong
Now I'm hearing that you're seeing someone new
And I wanna know who
But does he love you like I do my baby
But I promise you this one thing
Whatever that's missing
I will make it up to you
So tell me baby

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how(how)
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?
Why, tell me, my baby

Gettin under my skin
For messing up my mind
For never letting me into your life and
Tell me baby how come you don't wanna love me
And am how am I supposed to live without
If there is no way to make you feel the same way too
You...

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
We were born the same day
We even think the same way
We are what they all call a perfect match
Tell me, baby

How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?

Tell me, tell me, baby
How come you don't wanna love me
Don't you know that I can't breathe without you
Tell me, tell me, just how(how)
What am I supposed to do right now
Why can't you love me?
Why, tell me, my baby
