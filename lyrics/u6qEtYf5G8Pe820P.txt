The way you look at me (me)
You got me feeling weak
All the way weak (all the way weak)
Walking by the sea

Hold my hand please (please, please, please)
Never let it go, never let it go
Never let it go in the cold, cold
Never let it go, never let it go
Never let it go in the cold breath

We share the chemistry (yeah)
Chemistry, chemistry
Love is what you feel (feel)
Always there when I'm in need (I'm in need, I'm in need)
You carry my heart so gently (gently)

Never let it go, never let it go
Never let it go in the cold, cold
Never let it go, never let it go
Never let it go in the cold breath
