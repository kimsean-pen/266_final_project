Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tried to make it little by little,
tried to make it bit by bit on my own.

Quit the job,
the grey believers,
another town where I get close to the bone.

Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
What you gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...

I'm gonna get dressed for success,
shaping me up for the big time, baby.
Get dressed for success,
shaping it up for your love

Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'm not afraid,
a trembling flower,
I'll feed your heart and blow the dust from your eyes
and in the dark things happen faster,
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine.

Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
Whatcha gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...

I'm gonna get dressed for success,
shaping me up for the big time baby,
get dressed for success,
shaping it up for your love.

Look sharp!

Yeah Yeah Yeah

Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
Whatcha gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...

Dressed for success

I'm gonna get dressed for success.

I'm gonna get dressed for success,
hitting a spot for the big time, baby.
Get dressed for success, shaping it up for your love.

For your love,
Yeah Yeah Yeah

For your love,
Yeah Yeah Yeah

For your love,
Yeah Yeah Yeah

For your love,
Yeah Yeah Yeah
