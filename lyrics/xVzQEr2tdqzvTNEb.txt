I wrote your name Upon the back of my hand
Slept upon it then I woke up
With it backwards on my face
Reading forwards From my mirror to my heart

Twilight Omens in my life
Then I hear your name
Hear the radio sing your name
Should I give you a call, What can I say?
Maybe you still feel the same

I typed your number Into my calculator
Where it spelled a dirty word
When you turn it upside down
You could turn my dirty world The bright way round

Twilight Omens in my life
Then I hear your name
Hear the radio Sing your name
Should I give you a call
What can I say?
Maybe I still feel the same

Twilight Omens in my life
I keep hearing your name
I keep hearing your name
I keep hearing your name
hear the radio sing your name
