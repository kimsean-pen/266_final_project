I wanna be a star
On the runaway
People watching me
People loving it

Wanna be at the peak
Always here to bang
To prove the world that I
I am here to stay

Just wanna get that fame
Paps following me
To watch me pose for them
So they can get my name

Wanna be on the charts
Have 20 n°1s
Get so many awards
Having to keep them all

In my 3 million mansion
Be on the top position
I wanna prove the world
They were wrong

I wanna be on top
Show everyone i won't stop
Even if they get on my way

I wanna be a

I never want to stop
This music in my heart
Its playing and its keeping me alive
The feeling that in my brain
Is making me insane
And all you need to know is
