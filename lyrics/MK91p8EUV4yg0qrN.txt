I used to never understand the blues
Until the night I met you
And every day since
I've gotten better at guitar

Hold me close don't ever let me go
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For the moment to tell you so

With a couple power chords
I'm gonna let you know
That revenge is better
When you come from down the below

I still can't shake the night when we first met
It haunts me to this day with bittersweet regret
But I'll take this anyway to my grave
The part of me that you saved
It cross my heart and hope to die
With you're name on my mind

Hold me close don't ever let me go
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For the moment to tell you so

With a couple power chords
I'm gonna let you know
That revenge is better
When you come from down the below

When this song begins to play
It brings back some feelings that I cannot explain
And though kills me
I wouldn't have it any other way

I'm gonna get you back
You'll never see it coming
But when I do (yeah)
I'm gonna get you back
You'll never see it coming
But I ain't through with you
