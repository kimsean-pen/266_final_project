Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb you better pray
you're somewhere safe.

We're transfixed on a pendulum sky.
Watch another tank of gasoline run dry.
A death stare from a cold, dead eye.
As you're chopping up the carrot, sharpening their knives.
Don't blink keep your eyes on the prize.
While your rip me up to pieces, cut me down to size.
Don't dare try to keep it inside.
Cause the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Just when you thought you've seen it all.
A storm awaits behind the door.
Disgruntled right down to the core.
We still go on.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe.

Beat up, put the slate to the grind.
Another rocket launcher going off inside my mind.
Tight cuffs only hold me tight.
Every thought about the future leaves me terrified.
I'm sick of the same old lies.
Why don't you talk about your feelings? Who gives a shit about mine?
Death grips got a hold of my side.
Because the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Just when you thought you've seen it all.
A storm awaits behind the door.
Disgruntled right down to the core.
We still go on.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the time bomb nobody cares 'till it's too late.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the time bomb you better pray you're somewhere safe.

Oh we got a time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.

Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.
Watching the Time Bomb Ticking Away.

You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.
You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
Everybody needs a little help when the world is blind.
You're watching the time bomb ticking away inside,
And the only way to make us laugh is to make us cry.
