Yuh, yuh, yuh
I got no gas in the whip
No cash in my wallet
No one on my dick
No missed call from your bitch
What's going on with me I used to be the man
Nobody's pulling up to my show no more
They sick and tired of the same old
But I spit that flame though
You know my name hoe
Suicidal you know how that thing go
I used to ride around and bang it in my four door
Couldn't step outside without somebody asking me for photos
Now it seems that nobody know me
I haven't heard a word from none my homies
My bitch left me I'm lonely
Somebody set me up
Tried to wet me up
Bullets in the windshield of my Acura
Luckily they wasn't accurate
I wish they took my life
21 was from a 41
Ain't right I hate my kids
Hate my wife
What to do
Where to go
My Soundcloud don't play no more
I got to get it on the low
I hope they don't knock on my door
What to do
Where to go
My Soundcloud don't play no more
I hope they don't knock on my door

The bills due and the walls got some mildew
I been looking at this bottle wondering what these pills do
My dog died in the hallway
I been looking at the ceiling crying all day
My life sucks
My job sucks
My kids sucks
My bitch sucks
Haven't even got my dick sucked
I'm running, running, running out of luck
I'm gunning, gunning, gunning for them bucks

I used to be a veteran
Now I'm feeling like a rookie
My bitch don't give her cookie
Imma have to call a hooker
Get the quarters out the Acura and pay this hoe
I've been saving up my change for a rainy day
I should've listened to them things my mama had to say
I put myself in this predicament
My life is nothing man I wish that I could finish it
I'm working for a man that's working for a man who's working for a middle men
Get me out of here
Sick of shedding tears
I thought I was bout to be a millionaire
But now I'm struggling mugging these motherfuckers with a 44'
Do I have to mention I'm desperate
Might just pond this Double S necklace
I can't deal with all this pressure
What to do with all of these records
Trying to rebuild an empire can't even put myself together

The bills due and the walls got some mildew
I been looking at this bottle wondering what these pills do
My dog died in the hallway
I been looking at the ceiling crying all day
My life sucks
My job sucks
My kids sucks
My bitch sucks
Haven't even got my dick sucked
I'm running, running, running out of luck
I'm gunning, gunning, gunning for them bucks
