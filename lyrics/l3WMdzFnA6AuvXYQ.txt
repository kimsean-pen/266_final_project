Hey, don't worry 'bout it
Wait, don't wanna learn your name

The lines become obscure
This hit feels so impure
Your name and face is blurred
'Cause I only care for her

Hey, don't worry 'bout it
Wait, don't wanna learn your name
I don't care about it
(Hey)

These feelings come and go
High ceiling, crushing low
Slow breathing on my knees
She's all I ever need

Hey, don't worry 'bout it
Wait, don't wanna learn your name
I don't care about it
(Hey)

Hey, don't worry 'bout it
Wait, don't wanna learn your name
I don't care about it
(Hey)
