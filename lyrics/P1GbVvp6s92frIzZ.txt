Step into this picture, release all your light
I think God has gone mad here tonight
You can't believe your eyes, control is so hard to keep
Obsession can be hell from which you'll never be free
It's all for the taking, here tonight

Rip out your heart
I'll tear it apart
Throw it to the ground
All fall down

Where good girls go to die, that's where I'll be
Waiting for my love with my heart on my sleeve
Forget about the future, forget about the past
My heart beats so, my hands are cold, oh God make this moment last

You seek to fill me with virtues I lack
I'll turn your pure white wings to pure black
You've pushed too far and now you've lost control, can't you see?
You thought you were the master but you're down on your knees
It's all for the taking, here tonight

Rip out your heart
I'll tear it apart
Throw it to the ground
All fall down

Where good girls go to die, that's where I'll be
Waiting for my love with my heart on my sleeve
Forget about the future, forget about the past
My heart beats so, my hands are cold, oh God make this moment last

Where good girls go to die, that's where I'll be
Remembering our love as if it were a disease
Forget about the future, it wasn't meant to last
My heart beats slow my hands are cold - Oh God it's the end at last
