First love, last love
Only love, it's only love

First love, last love
Only love, it's only love

...
Do you miss home?
...
Do you miss home?

...
And are you cool
...
Symmetrical?
...

"Let's get married
And tick the boxes"
Says, and so she says
"Oh, let's get married

And tick the boxes"
...
Do you want to be alone?
...

D'you wanna be alone?
...
And are you cool
Symmetrical, hypocritical, analytical?

So critical
Nothing's perfect and I'm hoping I'll do, do
But I will not do
'Cause nothing's perfect so I'll have to make do
...

And it's my mistake
And no mistake

And I would take it back if I could
...

So stay with me tonight
...
And I've made my bed, I'm lyin' here
And pillow-talkin' into it
I've make my bed, I'm lyin' here
I enticed you with its leopard print
And matching velvet duvet
...
First love, last love
Only love, it's only love
First love, last love
Only love, it's only love
Only love, only love
...
It's only love
