Beams of morning light expose what's true
Cracks in all the paint that covers you
Reminded of the way
I wanted to escape
I want to, I want to, I want to
On this stiff burning light, I misled you
Things covered in white, nothing to do
All of our last days
Are lost without a trace
I want you, I want you, I want you

I believe (fallen)
There's a change in you (fallen)
Do you disapprove (fallen)
Have we slipped through (fallen)
