I believe if I knew where I was going id lose my way
I believe that the words that he told you are not your grave
I know that we are not the weight of all our memories
I believe in the things that i am afraid to say

Hold on

Hold on
I believe in the lost possibilities you cant see
and I believe that the darkness reminds us where light can be
I know that your heart is still beating beating darling

I believe that you fell so you would land next to me
Cause I have been where you are before
and I have felt the pain of losing who you are

and I have died so many times but I am still alive
I believe that tomorrow is stronger than yesterday
and I believe that your head is the only thing in your way
I wish that you could see your scars turn into beauty

I believe that today its ok to be not ok

Hold on
Hold on
Cause I have been where you are before

and I have felt the pain of losing who you are
and I have died so many times but I am still alive
This is not the end of me this is the beginning
This is not the end of me this is the beginning
This is not the end of me this is the beginning
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)(Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)(Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)(Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)(Hold on)
This is not the end of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)(Hold on)
This is not the and of me this is the beginning (I am still alive)
