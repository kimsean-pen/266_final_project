I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels that make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
"Everything will be wonderful someday"

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big (so big)
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
And tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all ok
I laugh a lot so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful some day

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big (so big)
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
No
No, I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't want to hear you say
That I will understand some day
No, no, no, no
I don't want to hear you say
That you both have grown in a different way
No, no, no, no
I don't want to meet your friend
And I don't want to start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Some days I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now...

I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now...
I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...

I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now...
I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Ooh ya
Everything is wonderful now...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Everything is wonderful now...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Everything is wonderful now...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na...
Everything is wonderful now...
