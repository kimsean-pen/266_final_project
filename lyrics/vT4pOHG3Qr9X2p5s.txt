Yesterday has been and gone
Tommorow will I find the sun
or will it rain
Everybody's having fun
Except me I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I said goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
we'll meet in the end

I've been the king, I've been the clown
now broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with the broken crown
It won't be me this time around
to love in vain

I said goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
we'll meet in the end

and I feel the time is right
although I know that you just might say to me
what you gonna do
what you gonna do
But I have to take this chance
goodbye to friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come'on now!

I said goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
we'll meet in the end

and the winter is looking fine
and I think the sun will shine again
and I feel I've cleaned my mind
all the past is left behind again
I said goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
we'll meet in the end
