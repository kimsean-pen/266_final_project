Well it's 1969 okay
All across the USA
It's another year
For me and you
Another year
With nothing to do

Last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
And now I'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boo hoo
And now I'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boo hoo

It's 1969 okay
All across the USA
It's another year
For me and you
Another year
With nothing to do
Another year
With nothing to do
It's 1969
