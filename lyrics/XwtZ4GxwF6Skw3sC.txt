Richie:
I understood the plan,

For made to make you start
(Let's ride the riders ride, we make it through the night)

Bridge:
Girls are you ready?
Girls are you ready for me?
Girls are you ready for love?
(now everybody dance)

Chorus:
Don't let the rhythm die, move your body to it
Don't let the music die, put your soul into it
Don't let the rhythm die, move your body to it
Don't let the music die, put your soul into it

Shake it to the right (oohoo)
Then move it to it
Shake it to the left (oohoo)
Just get into it
Shake it to the right (oohoo)
Then movie it to it
That makes the rhythm of life

Richie:
Last night I had a dream
It was a crazy seen
(they took us everywhere, the rhythm took there)
We move from all around, they had a brand new song
(they live in other way until eternity)

Girls are you ready for me?
Girls are you ready for love?
(now everybody dance)

Jay/Chris (rap):
So it feels it gets into it
Girls on the club get into it
You get into it to get into it
'Cause I never heard it feels so into it
All the boys around get down with it
All the girls on the floor get down with it
You got get down with it
Get down with it
Everybody even ain't got time to quit

Jay:
Now it's up to you
If you change your life
So let it through
Look inside your soul, and take control
Noone can deny
the rhythm of life
(let's dance, let's dance...)

Chorus:
Don't let the rhythm die, move your body to it

Then move it to it
Shake it to the left (oohoo)
