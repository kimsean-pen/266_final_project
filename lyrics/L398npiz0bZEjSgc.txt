In between the times when things seem real and things are real
You wake up so late
And I've been up all morning doing my best to keep still
The time it doesn't take
All too familiar
Don't you remember the indifference?
I always thought
We were escaping from it
From a culture that's come to hate us
But all that running gets exhausting
So come back and see me
So easy, it's like breathing
Gotta get a job
Gotta earn some money
Gotta feed your apathy for money
It's always been the best way
Around impenetrable gates
And everything has
And everything will change
You had to save face
And I was in a different place
And the sun is priced so high these days
Where did we stray?
Where did we stray?
Where did we stray?
I always thought we would escape
Where did we stray?
