The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(we were running)
Oh
(running with the night)

You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us
We were burning
We were gonna go all the way
And we never had a doubt

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(we were running)
Oh-oh-oh-oh...
(running with the night)
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got
We laid it down
Taking every shot
We took the town

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl it was so right... so right...
Oh (running with the night)
(oooo-oooo...)
(oooo-oooo...)
(ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Just you and I
(running with the night)
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl it was so right
(we were running)
Girl was so right
(running with the night)
(so right so right...)
So right
