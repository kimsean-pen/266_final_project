He take the thunder from the mountain
He take a lightning from the sky
He bring a strong man to his begging knee
He make the young girl's mama cry

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He got the voices speakin' riddles
He got the eye as black as coal
He got a suitcase covered with rattlesnake hide
And he stands right in the road

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump up run away
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He make the river call your lover
He make the barking of the hound
Put a shadow 'cross the window
When the old man comes around

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump and run again
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road
The old man is down the road

You got to, you got to, you got to
Hidey-hidey-hide
