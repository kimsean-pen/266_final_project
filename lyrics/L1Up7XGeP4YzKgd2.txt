Well it's about that time when all our friends around us
One by one they're stopping their old lives
And I can see it in your eyes you want some answers
Wondering when it's gonna be our time

Now I ain't never been a guy looking for marriage
That was something I just wouldn't do
But lately you've been on my brain and I go insane
Thinking 'bout a life without you
I, I know you...

You've been waiting to be taken
I, I know you...
You've been waiting so patiently
I'm ready, you're ready, we're ready, been ready
Come on girl, let's tie the knot

I'll never lie, never cheat, take care of you between the sheets
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
And after we say "I do!"
We'll go the way we want to
Drive away, "Just married" on the car
Yeah
I'm on my knees 'cause I believe
That you're the one that's right for me
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
They say the grass is always greener

Temptation is a killer
Well girl that's all lies
'Cause when we're standing in the mirror
There's really nothing clearer than you and I
I know you...

You've been waiting to be taken
I, I know you...
You've been waiting so patiently
I'm ready, you're ready, we're ready, been ready
Come on girl, let's tie the knot

I'll never lie, never cheat, take care of you between the sheets
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
And after we say "I do!"
We'll go the way we want to
Drive away, "Just married" on the car
Yeah
I'm on my knees 'cause I believe
That you're the one that's right for me
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
I can picture you all in white

So go pick out the dress that you like
I wanna spend the rest of my life
For me you are all, I will need nothing more when you're by my side
I'm ready, you're ready, we're ready, been ready
Come on girl, let's tie the knot

I'll never lie, never cheat, take care of you between the sheets
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
And after we say "I do!"
We'll go the way we want to
Drive away, "Just married" on the car
Yeah
I'm on my knees 'cause I believe
That you're the one that's right for me
Come on girl, let's tie the knot
