Black light Blue Heart
What's worth the fight anymore?
You're not, you're not here with me
I'm having all that you envisioned for me
Still I'm lonely

Oh come back to me
My baby, I'm sorry
(I know I know)
I know we could be
(Maybe we will be)
So happy (do you still love me?)
Again oooh

You are long gone
Still I cannot move on
I cannot write these songs
Without you my dear
A world of constant fear
I want to tell you everything I've been holding, for so long
Oh my love, I've been strong yeah

I wish, I knew, how to, give you back
The love the time (the love the time the joy)
Yet, once again, I'm here feeding my pain

Reminiscing the sweet fragrance you left behind

Come back to me
(come back to me)
My baby, (my baby)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
(I know I know)
I know we could be
(I know we could be)
So happy (so happy) again.

You are long gone
Still I cannot move on (lalalalala)
I cannot write these songs (lalalala)
Without you my dear (oooh)
A world of constant fear
I want to tell you everything (oooh)
I've been holding in, for so long, oh my love (For so long) oh my... I've been strong

Find your way to me
Come back baby
Though your pride hates me
I know, I have a place in your heart
I'll perfect it all and I'll be easy to love... yeah
