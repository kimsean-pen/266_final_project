There's no moon, no moon in Paris
And it's very lonely here tonight
Everywhere else there's a full moon
But not here, not now, and nothing's going right

What can I do but pretend to be brave?
And pretend to be strong when I'm not?
There's no moon, no moon in Paris tonight
And it's lonely, and that's what I got

No moon, no moon in Paris
And it's very lonely here tonight
When I think of all the moons that shone for us so distantly
All through the full moon night
It always made me gasp, gasp with love to see
But that was when I still loved you, and you loved me
There's no moon, no moon in Paris tonight
And it's lonely, and that's all I've got

Everything passes, everything changes
There's no way to stay the same
As we love, and so above
The only thing that stays the same is love

I've seen the moon in Morocco
And I've seen the moon in Brazil
Oh, I've seen it in the darkest times
Coming over the hill

In Martinique, it shines on the sea
But in Paris, it usually shines on me
There's no moon, no moon in Paris
And it's lonely, as lonely as can be
