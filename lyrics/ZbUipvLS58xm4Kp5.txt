It hit me today
If it weren't for you, always just where you are
Not where you'll always be
So wherever you are in the world
I want you to be there
And only there
Since life would be shitty before we move forward
I feel all sorts of good just thinking about it
I mean it when I say
I genuinely hope you find whatever it is you're looking for
Even if you have to find it alone
