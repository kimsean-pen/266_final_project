In silence, isolated, trying
To stand on your own
Naive and numb you feed
The leech that will feast
Off your blood
You wear indifference
As cover to hide the demise
Build up your walls,
Fill up the glass,
Let it bury your cries

You're deceived by inner demons
That were fed by your own hand
Shaded veils hide your perception,
Shooting nails into the heart

Still your mind, your soul,
Will find peace
In the dream, you end
And leave us
You'll awake, without fear
And your thoughts,
Your whole, will roam free

Submersed in draining silence
Calmly inviting the curse
All debts and broken vows
Are fragments detached
From our loss
The moonlight shone upon
You staggering out in the cold
You tried to leave this journey
Forcing your kin to behold

Still deceived by inner demons
That were fed by your own hand
Shaded veils hide your perception,
Shooting nails into your head
Still your mind, your soul,
Will find peace
In the dream you end and leave us
You'll awake without fear
And your thoughts
Your whole will roam free

Still your heart, your mind, will find peace
In this life all ends, you'll leave us
In your sleep careless you're falling
See my hopes dissolving
