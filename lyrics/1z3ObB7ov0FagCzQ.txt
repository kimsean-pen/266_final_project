little hope
little home of heavenly
come and save us from this ugly truth
little hope, sprung from necessity
may all good things in life come to you

little ghost
so innocent and carefree
they will never stop hunting you
little voice
life got the best of me
and in time that's what awaits you too

little hope
sing a song of fire
i grow up to be just like that
little hope, little hope
sing a song of fire

little hope
loudly sounding siren
if you want
your dream of life back
little hope, little hope
sing a song of fire

i've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
i've seen the picture of your perfect world
now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
so many questions so many things unsaid
