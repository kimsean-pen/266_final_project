We're so unimpressive
And we're so under pressure
It's a long way to death
But we got fast internet
Can't find it, the silence
Spilled coffee, look at me spiral
No seat on the metro ride

I just need a small victory
A silver line to get me by
I just need a win, a neon sign
An arrow shot, a tunnel light

I just need a win, I just need a high
I just need a win, I just need it
I just need it

Put tape on my webcam
My boyfriend thinks they're watching
They must be bored to tears
'Cause I don't really do much
Don't mind it, some chaos
Someone broke in my car window
They stole my damn aux cord

I just need a small victory
A silver line to get me by
I just need a win, a neon sign
An arrow shot, a tunnel light

I just need a win, I just need a high
I just need a win, I just need it
I just need it

Why is this still, keeping me up?
Why is this still, keeping me up?

I just need a, I just need a
I just need a small victory
A silver line to get me by
I just need a win, a neon sign
An arrow shot, a tunnel light

I just need a win, I just need a high
I just need a win, I just need it
I just need it
