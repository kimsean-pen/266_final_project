Sometimes I feel like I don't know
Sometimes I feel like checking out
I wanna get it wrong
Can't always be strong
And love it won't be long ...

Oh sugar, don't you cry
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes
You know I need you to be strong
And the day is dark, as the night is long
Feel like trash
You make me feel clean
I'm in the black
Can't see or be seen

Baby Baby Baby light my way
Alright now, Baby Baby Baby light my way

You bury your treasure
Where it can't be found
But your love is like a secret
That's been passed around
There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no-one can sleep
I guess it's the price of love
I know it's not cheap

Oh come on, Baby Baby Baby light my way
Oh come on, Baby Baby Baby light my way
Baby Baby Baby light my way

I remember
When we could sleep on stones
Now we lie together in whispers and moans
When I was all messed up and I heard opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb hanging over my bed

Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby light my way
