I remember the first night that she said,
"Oh, maybe I can do this on my own."
And amongst all the reassurances and reoccurrences you will not be alone,
And I know that you're holding out for better weather
And I can't promise you that I'll be round forever
If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together
(If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together)

And I will try to hold you up through those times when you are gone
Despite the weather, it gets better,
You won't do this alone (do this alone)

I remember the first night that she went
To find her little place inside this world
I won't forget the way she broke her tape down,
She needed it now
She ran into it all

And I know that you're holding out for better weather
And I can't promise you that I'll be round forever
If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together
(If there's one thing I know it's that we're good together)

And I will try to hold you up through those times when you are gone
Despite the weather, it gets better,
You won't do this alone
