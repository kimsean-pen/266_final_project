Let's go!
Staring at the dying flames
Moon as my old only guard
It's too late to hesitate
Only the weaks suffer in this life

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be king
Of battlefields

It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and Mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink!

I shall honour my blade
With deeds, not with hollow words
Men will kneel when they hear my name
Before I laugh and rip out their wretched hearts

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be king
Of battlefields

It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and Mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink!

(from Kalevala 26)
Siell on miehet miekka vyöllä
Urohot sota-aseissa
Humalassa hullut miehet
Pahat paaljo juotuansa

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be king
Of battlefields

It's the Eve of the bloodshed:
Women and Mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink!

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be king
Of battlefields

It's the Eve of the bloodshed:
Women and Mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink!
