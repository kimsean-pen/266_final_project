Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
Ah

Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
Daddy hit you in a temper, but he's sorry now
(Please come home)
Just a quarrel had with mummy, just a family row
(Please come home)

You caught mum chasing dad with a knife
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
You ran away to escape from the fights
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Now, you're lost in a maze of neon light
And she's worried, he's worried, she's worried, oh

Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
Pacing street lamps on the highway, haystack for your bed
(Please come home)
In the morning we will find you in papers to be read
(Please come home)

You heard screams from the warmth of your bed
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
You slumbered on without being fed
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Now, there's no more tears to be shed
And she's sorry, he's sorry, she's sorry, oh

Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home)
(Please come home, please come home, please come home)
Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home, please come home, please come home)
Oh, run-a, oh, run-a, oh, runaways
(Please come home, please come home, please come home)
