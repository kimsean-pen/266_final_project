The essence of the unicorn
It's eyes cause the moon to shine.
The essence of the unicorn
It's mane makes the wind dance.
The essence of the unicorn
It's laughter brings color to the sky.
The essence of the unicorn
To ride it sparks your dreams.

Oh! seek it in your dreams,
seek it in your mind,
The white unicorn.
Oh! seek it in the wood,
seek it in the night,
The white unicorn.
Oh! seek it in the books,
seek it in the tales,
The white unicorn.
Oh! seek it in the song,
seek it in my eyes,
The last unicorn!
