A wintry sky and the broken streetlight cold wind.
Unknown shadow the footprint of desertion.
Freedom was taken.

If it wakes up a gloomy ceiling.
A laughing voice sinks in the eardrum it is soiled.
And violence rapes me.

An understanding is impossible.
Why was I chosen? Someone should answer?

Douka hidoi yumedato kotaetehoshii
Doredake sakebi modae kurusimebaii
Douka hidoi yumedato oshietehoshii
Chigiresouna koede nanndomo sakennda

There is no hand of preparing of the disordered hair.
A laughing voice sinks in the eardrum a faint temperature is mixed in the midwinter.

Koewo koroshite karesouna jibunni iikikaseteita
Ikirukotowo miushinawanuyou
Koewo koroshite hurueta yoruwa itamini oboreteiku
Togiresuna ikiwo yurushite?

Douka hidoi yumedato kotaetehoshii
Doredake sakebi modae kurusimebaii
Douka hidoi yumedato oshietehoshii
Saigoni mouichidodake warattemiai
