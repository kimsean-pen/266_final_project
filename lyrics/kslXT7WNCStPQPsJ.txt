Didn't I tell you everything
is possible in this deja-vu
try the river boat the carousel
feed the pigeons, Barbeque

Look at all the people
happy faces all around
smiling throwing kisses
busy making lazy sounds

It's a bright June afternoon
it never gets dark
(wah wah here comes the sun)

get your green green tambourine
let's play in the park
(wah wah here comes the sun)
Some folks are on blankets

slowly daydreaming and
reaching for their food
let's go buy an ice-cream
and a magazine with an attitude

And put on a cassette
you can pretend that you're a star
'cause life's so very simple
just like la la la

It's a bright June afternoon
it never gets dark
(wah wah here comes the sun)
get your green green tambourine
let's play in the park
(wah wah here comes the sun)
(comes the sun)
There's a painter painting his masterpiece
there're some squirels jumping in the trees
there's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon
all my life I longed for this afternoon
It's a bright June afternoon
it never gets dark
(wah wah here comes the sun)
get your green green tambourine
let's play in the park
(wah wah here comes the sun)
It's a bright June afternoon
let's play in the park
(wah wah here comes the sun)
get your green green tambourine
it never gets dark
(wah wah here comes the sun)
It never gets dark
let's play in the park
Let's play in the park
here comes the sun
