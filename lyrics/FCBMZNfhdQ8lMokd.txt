I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea

Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?

The stars are out and shining
But all I really wanna know

Oh, won't you show me the way, yeah
I want you to show me the way

Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge

I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play this part

Someone thought of healing
And all I really wanna know

Oh, won't you show me the way, yeah
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day

Yeah, I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me

Oh I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love

Oh, won't you show me the way, yeah
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day
I want you day after day
