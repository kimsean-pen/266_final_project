Restless eyes gather casts of clay
Seated on the verge of a cursed smile
The tide drowns a promise in silence;
a bride's shadow vanished in deceit
It chokes and drinks of forgetfulness
as faces vanish into a glow
The waning voice distressed in fear...
our thin reprieve rises and blooms
Seek devotion through the scope on an endless longing
Seek devotion through the scope on an endless longing...
Imperfect words reverberate in a scar untouched
Breathless dreams conceal this echo over tired minds
A poisoned grasp exceeds limits...
this unceasing portrait,
this unceasing portrait,
this unceasing portrait
of
our
lies
I clasp a fallen, I clasp a fallen wish with broken fingers
I clasp a fallen, I clasp a fallen wish with broken fingers
I trace this faith
