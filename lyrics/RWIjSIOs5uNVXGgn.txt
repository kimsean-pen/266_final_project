there's something about them
the troubled eyes
mister soulmate
breath in for the last time
breath in for the last time
you think you are the only one
to reach for the surface
finding the courage
breathe out for the last time
breathe out for the last time
breathe out of the last time
buried in a waterfall
inhaling water
pushed against the bottom
buried in a waterfall
held in for so long
as long as you could
I'm slowly fading
you are running out of time
you are running out of time
you ran out of time
buried in a waterfall
inhaling water
pushed against the bottom
buried in a waterfall
na na na na
na na na na
na na na na
you're not the only one
you're not the only one
you're not the only one
no, you're not the only one
you're not the only one
no, you're not the only one!
buried in a waterfall
inhaling water
pushed against the bottom
buried in a waterfall
na na na na na
buried in a waterfall
na na na na na
na na na na na
