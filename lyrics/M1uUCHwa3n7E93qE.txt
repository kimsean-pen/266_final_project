If you crash your car into your best friends house
Would you be quiet as words came out of their mouths?
Stop, don't do it, I have been waiting for it
Stop, I knew it would come

If you find a god next to your girlfriend's bed
Would it be hard to sort out your spinning head?
Stop, don't say that, dear, that you wanted him here
Stop, don't give him a clear

Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them

If you are afraid don't be, I have the whole thing planned
We'll start in the ocean, baby, and when we find the land
We will be thankful to all of our friends
That they didn't leave us as we got to the end

Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them

If you find your faith in your parents' god
Don't be so quick to point out the flaws in it
You've been around and you've seen the way that things work
But you need a compass to get around your house
