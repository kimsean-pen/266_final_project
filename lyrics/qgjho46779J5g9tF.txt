I was a flower in full bloom
was born when pisces was a sign on the moon
needed a rock to anchor my roll
she gave a warm and loving home for my soul.
Gypsy Treasure
Space Dust
however you pay
the Electric Landlady wants you to stay.

through bad vibrations you will roam
she is Mother Earth calling you home
and when the cosmic boiler's on the blink
her psychic spanners out before you can think.

Gypsy Treasure
Space Dust
however you pay
the Electric Landlady wants you to stay.

Collecting the water off a duck's back
Drinking it down and turning those black heavy clouds
into rainbows and smiles
spare room for every earth child.
She is the peacock from Krishna's story
turning the serpant's poison into vitamin love.
And you want some for you and your friends back at home
In the land of the Grey and the Groan.

Her place is decked out awful nice
Her curtains made out of the fabric of time.
you wont check out
no you wont want to leave.
it's got a view that you will never believe.

Gypsy Treasure
Space Dust
However you pay
the Electric Landlady wants you to stay.
Black heavy clouds that you carry around it's not good.
