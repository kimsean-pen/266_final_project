Feel light as it flows into our homes
(Runnin' rampant round town with my head in the ground) Can't hide the fact that we're both here
(But that's just s-u-p-p-o-s-e how it's suppose to be)
Don't let it go, we're so scared (Me in the trunk making audible thumps)
(And we break and we dip and we crash and we fly)
(But it's not really a big deal, I'm a tolerable guy)
(In the age of piss when the old man whistles)
(Yeah I'm late, but don't remind me of our separate pistols)

(You mean nothing, nothing!)

(I'm ballistically drunk, I'm a triumphant lump)
(I'm an instant glow ball coffee syrup florist filled gunk)
(That beat is mystically drunk, I'm a triumphant lump)
(I'm an instant glow ball coffee syrup declog your gunk)
(Declog your gunk)
(Declog your gunk)
(Drunk, gunk, drunk, gunk, drunk, gunk...)

It's only funny in the back side of love
Well I won't let it break my self-esteem
Oh, it's only funny in the back side of love
We'll open our graves

(Move on, I caught you instantly)
(Move on, you stomping elephant)
(Move on, I caught you instantly)
(Move on, you stomping elephant)

But I'd hate, to say no
When it comes to those beautiful blue eyes
And I'd hate, to say no
When it comes to those beautiful fuckin' eyes
Hold on girl, well I promise that we'll have it all
Hold on girl, well I promise that we'll have it all

(Hello I will talk to you, I have some things to go over with)
(Are you mad?)
(Or spectacular?)
(Yes, yes so so so so fifi fifi)
(Yes but my face has been melted)
(Hello? I will talk to you)
(Are you mad?)
(Or spectacular?)

It's only funny in the back side of love
Well I won't let it break my self-esteem
Oh, It's only fuuny in the back side of love
We'll open our graves

(You've got loud as fuck sighs)
(You know how to fake cry)
(You've got that ostrich beak that's lowering your skill in sneak)

(You've got loud as fuck sighs)
(You know how to fake cry)
(You've got that ostrich beak that's lowering your skill in sneak)

(You've got loud as fuck sighs)
(You know how to fake cry)
(You got, you got, you got, you got me)
