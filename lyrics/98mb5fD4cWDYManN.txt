When will I sleep?
Where will I keep these miseries hiding out?
Where was the hit?
Where did I miss?
When do you think that you'll be coming back?

Fear of alone
Fear of my own dark mysteries peering out
Get on the phone
Tell me you're strong, tell me I'm wrong
Tell me that you're not gonna let me go

Maybe I'm faded in love
Maybe I don't try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things
Maybe I've been turning it off
Maybe it's just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things
That hurt, that hurt, that hurt, that hurt

Keep me awake
Don't ever take these melodies coming through
You were the one
When I start to run
I've been running back to you

Maybe I'm faded in love
Maybe I don't try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things
Maybe I've been turning it off
Maybe it's just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things

Maybe I'm faded in love
Maybe I don't try enough
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things
Maybe I've been turning it off
Maybe Its just a part of growing up
But my hope is just to find you
And I know it's the littlest things
That hurt, that hurt, that hurt, that hurt
