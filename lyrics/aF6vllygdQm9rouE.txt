Did you get what you want?
Do you know what it is? Do you care?
Is he better than me?
Was it your place or his? Who was there?
Did you think it was wrong?
Do you find that it's worse than it was?
Has it gone on too long?
Do you mind that it hurts me? Because
You're breaking my heart

I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
You're breaking my heart

Was it cracking the code
or just filling in time? Was that all?
So then why'd you go back
to the scene of the crime? Did he call?
Shall I take further blame
or another assault on how it was
Then we'll get to the fact
that it's always my fault just because
You're breaking my heart

I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
You're breaking my heart
I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
I don't know what you want but I can't give it any more
You're breaking my heart

Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
