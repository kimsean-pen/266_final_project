Let go
Close your eyes and you'll see me
You said you'll never let me go
And then I told you it's all in your head
Broke down at your chance
And then I told you're living a lie
And I once said I
Where's your only and only love

Let go
you'll find another less than mine
That I know
I'll spin your love
And I told you so
I'll never be the one you hold
So don't ask me why
I'm gonna love this lie
Just let it go

Now
False applications
You'll tell him you're friends
And I'm not letting go
And I told you once
I said you're living a lie
And I'm up to here with all your
Fiction, fables
Or are you gonna go?
Just hit it off

Let go
You'll find another less than mine
And that i know
I'll spin your love
And I told you so
I'll never be the one you hold
So don't ask me why
I'm gonna love this lie

It said what should I make
In different kind of way
So heavy in foot now
The rain will hurt somehow
It said what should I make
In different kind of way
So heavy in foot now
The rain will hurt somehow

Let go
You'll find another less than mine
And that i know
I'll spin your love
And I told you so
I'll never be the one you hold
So don't ask me why
I'm gonna love this lie, lie
Just let it go
Lie, just let it go
Lie
Lie, just let it go
