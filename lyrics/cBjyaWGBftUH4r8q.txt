If you're lonely, come
Seal the doubt, the pain is deep
You could long the life
Say it on that land

But, you went south on the train
She wore plastic boots for rain
And you're cruel: another thin line
You're dreading this, caught lonely.

Who will I be when I'm with you again?
Silver jet in the sky
You were the pain
Got a song, got to sing
For life

If you don't eat your-
-self no doubt the blade is deep
If you don't eat yourself
You will explode instead

'Cause I've never loved you so
Well, I know you don't love me
You wouldn't last that long
Can the weekend tear it down?

Who will I be when I'm with you again?
Silver jet in the sky
You were the pain
Got a song, got to sing
For life
