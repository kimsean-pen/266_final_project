You tell me of a place you like to go
And you say it will reach out and seize the sorrow
And we always mean to act on what we say
So come on, oh darling... hurry, hurry, let's go

We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling

I told you of a place that I had been
It was dark and I was supremely alone
No matter now if the compass fails again
'cause in your love I built a home

We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling
Yeah, We're all we need, oh darling

Yeah
Yeah, We're all we need
Oh darling
Yeah
Ooh
Yeah, We're all we need
Oh darling

Most certainly I'm where I'm supposed to be
In a molten sun; with you I am free
Today our hearts won first prize
'cause we're wise with the feeling

Yeah, We're all we need.
