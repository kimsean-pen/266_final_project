No no no no no no no
I'm looking for a band today
I see the Chivers anyway
Through my eyes

Oh oh oh
I... I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
'Cause Chivers look divine

Look away
They try to find the Milky Way
They love to drink it every day

No no no no no no no
You... you and I, it's like you said
I'm not a Chivers anyway
You look fine

Oh oh oh
I... I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
'Cause Chivers look divine

Look away
They try to find the Milky Way

I'm... I'm alone in life to say
I love the Chivers anyway
In your eyes

Oh oh oh
I'm looking for a band today
I see the Chivers anyway
I'll be a Chivers guy some day
In my mind
