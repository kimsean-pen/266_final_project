Sometimes I wish my head would just explode

Self, self, self, I wanna
Self, self, self, I gotta
Self, self, self, I'm gonna self destruct
Self, self, self, I wanna
Self, self, self, I gotta
Self, self, self, I'm gonna self destruct

I can't fight this urge to self destruct
I can't seem to stop this urge to self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct

I got the urge to self destruct
Fighting the urge to self destruct
I got the urge to self destruct
Can't stop the urge to self destruct

Self, self, self, I wanna
Self, self, self, I gotta
Self, self, self, I'm gonna self destruct

I can't fight this urge to self destruct
I can't seem to stop this urge to self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct

I got the urge to self destruct
Can't fight the urge to self destruct
I got the urge to self destruct
Can't stop this urge to self destruct

Where is the sunshine of my mind?
There is no sunshine in my mind!
How can I be everything to everyone?
Where is the sunshine of my mind?
When I don't want to be anything to anyone?
There is no sunshine in my mind!

I just want to make the pounding in my head freakin'
Stop!

Self, self, self, self destruct
Self, self, self, self destruct
Self, self, self, I wanna self destruct

I can't fight this urge to self destruct
I can't seem to stop this urge to self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct
Self destruct, self destruct
I got the urge to self destruct
Can't fight the urge to self destruct
I got the urge to self destruct
Can't stop the urge to self destruct
