Step into this
Somber storm
Endless walk
Seeking home

Winds of yearning
Clouds of harm
Aching haze
Soon be gone

What if I let you go
I hear a silent voice
Time is a river echoing words meant to hurt

Blow the candles
Kiss the thorns
Dry the tears
Soon be gone

Fields of time
Sorrow shows
All your fears
Soon be gone

What if I let you go
I hear a silent voice
Time is a river echoing words meant to hurt
