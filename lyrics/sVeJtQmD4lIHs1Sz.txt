Well I slept on
The solid ground
Near your house
And it felt just like
A barbell wrapped in a shell
When I slept on
The solid ground
Near your house
I could feel its weary muscles under the dirt
When I slept on
The solid ground
Right next to you
And the frost looked like
A castle
Wrapped up in a tale
When I slept on
The solid ground
Near your house
You could feel by
The corner
Step right in.
In Winter decay
When hope and plans seem all but gone
You have found a way
To make me seem like almost drawn
In Winter's decay
When hope and plans seem all but gone
You have found a way
To make me seem like almost drawn
In Winter's decay
When hope and plans seem all but gone
You have found a way
To make me seem like almost drawn
When I slept on
The solid ground
Near your house
