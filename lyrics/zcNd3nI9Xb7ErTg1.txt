Won't you walk with me on the wild side
With my head in the air full of some child's pride
And I'm up too far, I'm up too high
I cannot come down, I cannot meet your eye

And oh my lover, if I come knocking at your door
Please turn away now if I come asking for more
Oh my lover, you never call my bluff
Gave what you have now, but it was never enough

Now your mind is reaching for that door
As you pick your rings up off the floor
You never even questioned what that door was for
You gave me what you had and you could give no more

And oh my lover, why you leaving so soon
This place is a prison, oh a lifetime or two
Oh my lover, when will you return
I'll be back, somebody in there in a fever, a pearl [?]

And why'd you let me walk on that wild side
With my head in the air full of some child's pride
Let the sun come up, let the sun rise
As it rips the curtain of your eye

And oh my lover, is it always the same
With your pointing your finger the way that I came
Oh my lover, you never call my bluff
Gave what you have now, but it was never enough
Never enough

And oh the places you'll go
And oh the things that you'll do
Oh just to have and to hold
But now you must move

And oh the places you'll go
And oh the things that you'll do
And oh the hand that you hold
Does not belong to you
