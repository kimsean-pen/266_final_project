Memory, your lamplight is burning holes
Recover the damage
Bring it all home
Follow the bliss, just like a summer song
Please stay there forever
I'll try to remember
Come home

Memory, you gave me another note
A voice that is endless
Bring it on home
Oh, what it is, feels like a summer song
I'll stay here forever
Her face I remember

Presenting, a new beginning
Forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely
And life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together you and I

Happiness, I'm sorry you've been on hold
The doors will be open
Bring it all home
'Cause what it is, feels like a summer song
I'll stay here forever
Now that I remember

Presenting, a new beginning
Forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely
And life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together you and I

For all these symbols don't open our eyes
We'll close them instead, leave the messenger behind
But one day we will know

Presenting, a new beginning
Forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely
And life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving
Then we'll be leaving

Presenting, a new beginning
Forever you and I
And when the morning gets lonely
And life is out of sight
Then we'll be leaving together you and I
Then we'll be leaving together you and I
Then we'll be leaving together you and I
