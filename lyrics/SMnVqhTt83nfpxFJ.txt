This city shall bring
A purifying fire
For the world entire
And have all of us sing
Of its beauty and splendour
Now and forever
So now watch us try
And reconcile sword and mine

A new world Is calling
For a new unfolding
A new man is crawling up from behind
A new world is calling
For a new unfolding
A new man crawling out into light

When all beauty is tarnished
When all thought is profaned
They'll cry out for men
To invoke the iron rods again
Now this our sacred flame
Will illuminate the night
And its sparks flying on the wind
Will set the world alight

A new world Is calling
For a new unfolding
A new man is crawling up from behind
A new world is calling
For a new unfolding
A new man crawling out into light

Immer Weider Widerstand!
