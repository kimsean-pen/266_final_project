When passion's lost and all the trust is gone
Way too far, for way too long
Children crying, cast out and neglected
Only in a world so cold, only in a world this cold
Hold the hand of your best friend
Look into their eyes then watch them drift away
Some might say we've done the wrong things
For way too long, for way too long

Fever inside the storm
So I'm turning away
Away from the names (Calling you names)
Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones)
'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us

Keep your thorns
'Cause I'm running away
Away from the games (Fucking head games)
Away from the space (Hate this head space)
The circumstances of a world so cold

Burning whispers remind me of the days
I was left alone in a world this cold
Guilty of the same things, provoked by the cause
I've left alone in a world so cold

Fever inside the storm
So I'm turning away
Away from the names (Calling you names)
Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones)
'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us

Keep your thorns
'Cause I'm running away
Away from the games (Fucking head games)
Away from the space (Hate this head space)
The circumstances of a world so cold

I'm flying, I'm flying away
Away from the names (Calling you names)
Away from the games (Fucking head games)
The circumstances of a world so cold

Why does everyone feel like my enemy?
Don't want any part of depression or darkness
I've had enough, sick and tired
Bring the sun, or I'm gone
Or I'm gone

I'm backing out, I'm no pawn
No motherfucking slave to this
Never lied, never left, never lived
Never loved, never lost, never hurt
Never worry about being me or anyone else
Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about anything
Backing out, giving up
No motherfucking slave to this
Never lied, never left, never lived
Never loved, never lost, never hurt

Never worry about being me or anyone else
Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about anything
I need to find a darkened corner
A lightless corner
Where it's safer and calmer
I'm turning away
Away from the names (Calling you names)
Away from the stones (Throw sticks and stones)
'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us
I'm running away
Away from the games (Fucking head games)
Away from the space (Hate this head space)
The circumstances of a world so cold
I'm flying, I'm flying away
Away from the names (Calling you names)
Away from the games (Fucking head games)
The circumstances of a world so cold
