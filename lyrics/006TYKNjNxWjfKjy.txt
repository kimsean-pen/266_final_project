My princess why must I assist at your death
I can't endure this tragic pain
now I close your eyes while thunder strikes the sky
I cry to see the innocent die
Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin
for you I must win

Now the time has come farewell my dear old friends
Ancelot is calling for my help
From the sun of Elgard to the middle plains
for salvation of enchanted lands
I'm looking forward to avenge all those killed
to be face to face

Fire and steel
follow me through my lands
you will burn hordes of hell
in the deadly raging flames of revenge

Come out from your abyss her tears seek revenge
for this cruel tragedy flames are burning high

Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin
for you I must win

Fire and steel
follow me through my lands
you will burn hordes of hell
in the deadly raging flames of revenge
