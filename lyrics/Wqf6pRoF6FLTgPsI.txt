Haven't seen you 'round
Got me in a craze
And going through an awkward phase
I hate the taste it leaves us

I know your light's gone out
But are you still awake?
Stuck inside a downhill haze
You seem so out of reach now

You're one step in
Then out again, it's useless
It was everything
Then the colours spin, we lose it
Thought you'd be my alibi

Alibi
Alibi
Alibi
Alibi

So you're lying on my couch
But you want to give it space
I'm slipping into your disdain
Don't be so cold and reckless

Well, maybe you're too proud
I can see it in your face
Oh, the silence could have cut the air

You're one step in
Then out again, it's useless
It was everything
Then the colours spin, we lose it
Thought you'd be my alibi

Alibi
Alibi

(You're one step in)
(Then out again) Alibi

You're one step in
Then out again
It's useless, it's useless
