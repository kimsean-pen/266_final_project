Oh when Sangria is pourin' through ya
You remember me like Vegas
Oh when the haze is faded
And your veins is achin'
You call me like your dealer

Say you won't, but you will
It's nostalgic baby, it's the thrill
Say you won't, no no, but you will
It's nostalgic baby, electric feel

Ahh, Fool
Go on, take your pill
Fool, tell me how it feels
Fool, go on, take your pill, baby
Fool, tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels

When you also ask me, T-minus twenty
I pull up with that Riesling
You say this and forever
But I know, that you are a believer

Say you won't, but you will
It's nostalgic baby, it's the thrill
Say you won't, but you will
It's nostalgic baby, electric feel

Ahh, Fool
Go on, take your pill
Fool, tell me how it feels
Fool, go on, take your pill baby
Fool

Try again when it's over
We can make it to summer
Try again when it's over
If we don't fly before

Tell me how it feels
Try again when it's over
Go on, take your pill
We can make it to summer
Tell me how it feels
Try again when it's over
If we don't fly before
