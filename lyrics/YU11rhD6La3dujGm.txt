When we met
The pain stood still
It was us
Then suddenly
It's where you go
the system blew, I knew

This side of me
I want a little more
But inside it seems I'm just a little boy
Nothing else!

Don't go! It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Whoa)
Oh no! It's a wake up call
When your life went into shock (Whoa whoa)

It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go! it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up (Whoa whoa)

嘘 一つ 愛を 二つ
それでなんとかやりすごしてきたでしょう？
でもそれじゃもう僕をだませないでしょう？
じゃどうする どうしよう

Don't go! It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Whoa)
Oh no! It's a wake up call
When your life went into shock (Whoa whoa)

描きたがりな未来に明日はない (Whoa)
いっそどうせ痛むなら
痛め続けよう 続けよう

Woah Woah Woah
Get up get up get up get up
Time to make amends for what you've done
Get up get up get up get up
Running with your demons in your head

Let's shout it out completely
Never really want to know
Let's shout it out, we're screaming
Woah

Don't go! It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh no! It's a wake up call
When your life went into shock (Whoa, whoa)

It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go! It's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up! (Whoa, whoa)

Don't go! D-d-d-d-don't go!
D-d-d-d-don't go! Don't go!
