Love in space and time
There's no more feeling
Automated love
Cold and unappealing
Longing to be touched
Longing for a kiss
Whisper words of love
Tell me that you miss me

See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me
I can see you
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me

I can see you

...

Nothing to caress not a hand to hold
I don't need the touch

Cause his body's cold

He's programmed to receive
Automatic satisfaction
After love is dead

Where's the true reaction
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me
I can feel you
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
I can feel you
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me
I just wanna make love
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
Oh, how I need it
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me
You're body's cold
There's not a hand to hold
