Little notes that I write
Contemplate suicide
Every day is a lie
Should I live or should I die

The rats inside destroy my mind
Number the days to bide my time
The rats inside destroy my mind
Endure the pain, I'll give you mine

Broken down, left to rot
I'm alone and they forgot
They want to hurt, I want to heal
Is this a dream or is it real

The rats inside destroy my mind
Number the days to bide my time
The rats inside destroy my mind
Endure the pain, I'll give you mine
