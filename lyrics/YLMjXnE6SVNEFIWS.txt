I think I hit a nerve when I burst solitude
Palooka set in motion and it's drowning you
I know you feel that pop doesn't really have a clue
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

I think I hit a nerve when I burst solitude
Palooka set in motion and it's drowning you
I know you feel that pop doesn't really have a clue
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

You're educated now but you never stand a chance
Sophisticated ain't helping you to do the dance
I think you're stuck in that me myself and I romance
But that's too wild for you man to understand

I think I hit a nerve when I burst solitude
Palooka set in motion and it's drowning you
I know you feel that pop doesn't really have a clue
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

You got a true mad deep big crush on yourself
I hope you hit the ground hard when you fell for yourself
You got that crossed armed posture such a sorry sight
If you do shit like that I don't need to be nice
I got my half ass rhymes to set me free
That's why you never ever ever can get to me
I sense my loolycomotion's like a brick at you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

I think I hit a nerve when I burst solitude
Palooka set in motion and it's drowning you
I know you feel that pop doesn't really have a clue
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

Nah, can't take it, Imma break it, Im gonna shake it off me now
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
Within 27 minutes I'm gonna shake it like a diva
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
Nah, can't take it, Imma break it, Im gonna shake it off me now
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
Within 27 minutes I'm gonna shake it like a diva
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you

I think I hit a nerve when I burst solitude
Palooka set in motion and it's drowning you
know you feel that pop doesn't really have a clue
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
But even if I'm loud it doesn't mean I'm talking to you
