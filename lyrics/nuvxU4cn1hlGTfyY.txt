My barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
These idle hands inherit spoiled lands
As the hungry become the pigs
We reap and we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grace of youth
Laying with lions to hide my grief
From the beast that never sleeps
Our tired hearts tear us apart
Searching for the key
Reap what we sow
