And I'll hide it all away just to cope
And I'm hiding my face just to cope
And I'm hiding away just to cope (yeah yeah)
Keep on hiding my face just to

Back down
This is my fucking life
I won't take it till I back down
You're not my enemy
I am my enemy
Dragged down (just, uh yeah)
Watch me drag down
You're not my enemy
I am my enemy

Take your time with it
They said watch you run with it
I just left my mind in it
I can't take my life in it
Yeah, and it's devilish
I guess what you'll say
I can watch you think
I decide and wait

Push me to the brink
(You'll know what today holds)
Push me till I sink (You'll know what today holds)
They still watch me sin
It's the hate they bring
They don't do a thing
Yet they take from me
I might just go fucking hide my face
Yeah, I don't really want to show that today, uh
I might go
Just might go hide my face

Uh, taking it back like I do
I live my day like you do
Mourn on the facts that I prove
Keeping it savage and true
Can you please tell me the truth?
I have these stats, yes I do
I turn it up, yes I do
I turn the product and prove
I am the prodigal son
Someone you want
Living forever's a must

Back down
This is my fucking life
I won't take it till I back down
You're not my enemy
I am my enemy
Dragged down (just, uh yeah)
Watch me drag down
You're not my enemy
I am my enemy

Drown
Right down back to that hell hole that I came from
You want to see me burn
Right down back to that hell hole that I came from
You want to see me burn
How they judge, how they judge, how they judge
