Keep it G

Smoking all the time, I feel high
Doing the most, I feel low
Read my thoughts, baby let me see
What you're really made of
Come and fuck with me
I'll set you free

'Cause you and me
Tearing my thoughts out my head like
Wanna do me on the right side
Come fuck with me

All he wanna do is smoke yah
All I wanna do is sleep
Put him in a coma
I won't hurt ya
Let me just taste a little
A little might be too much
Come over here, let me taste a little
I might like your touch
Come and fuck with me
Come and fuck with me (fuck with me)

Smoking all the time, I feel high
Doing the most, I feel low
Read my thoughts, baby let me see
What you're really made of
Come and fuck with me
I'll set you free

Just you and me
Tearing my thoughts out my head like
Wanna do me on the right side
I know you wanna fuck with me (yeah, yeah)
I know I can see it in your face (yeah, yeah)

Haaa
Hmmm

Don't do it (yeah)
Boy don't do it
Do it (yeah)
Boy don't do it (boy don't do it)

It's too much temptation for me
I might take you home all for me
You know you know I know (I know)
I know you know you know (you know)

I ain't tryna ask no questions
I ain't tryna be no judge
Fuck all the past
Leave it behind
Falling in love
Fall outta style
I ain't tryna fall in love

'Cause you should come and fuck with me
I'm not a psychic
But I think you like it
You like having me around that's why you keep coming around
We can go outta town
If you like
Always, always in my head like
I got the juice, got the squeeze
And I know you wanna be the one to squeeze it baby

All he wanna do is smoke yah
All I wanna do is sleep
Tearing my thoughts out my head like
You wanna do me on the right side
And the left one too baby
