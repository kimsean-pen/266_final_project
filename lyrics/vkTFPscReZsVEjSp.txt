Hoy hoy
When Big Joan comes out
Her arms are too small
Her head like a ball
She tied off her horse
and galloped off into the moonbeams
She pulled up her blouse
and compared her navel to the moon
I dig my life for a while
When Big Joan sets up
Her hands are too small
She's too fat to go out in the daylight
So she rolls around all night
I'm just sorta thread
With a drooped body
I'll set up with ya Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daylight
I'll stay up all night
I won't droop if you
Won't talk about your
Hands being too small
You know something's happening
Or you wouldn't of come out like ya did
She ain't built for going naked
So she can't wear any new clothes
Or go to the beach
They laugh at her body
Cause her hands are too small
When Big Joan sets up her hands are too small
l She's outta reach
A turquoise scarf and a sleeve
Rolled up over a Merc Montclair
I'll sit up with ya Big Joan
I'm too fat to go out in the daytime
I'll stay up all night
If ya promise not to talk
About your hands being too small
Hoy hoy is she uh boy?
