I've been driving, a mid-sized car
Never hurt anyone
Is that a fact?
Is that a fact?
Is that a fact?
Is that a fact?

The price of gas keeps on rising
Nothing comes for free
Make like a stone, make like a plant
Make like a stone, make like a plant
I can tell you, how this ends

We're gonna win this
We're gonna win this
We're gonna win this

With spades and truncheons, guns and trowels
That is how the war will be won
Just swat the fly
Just swat the fly
Just swat the fly
Just swat the fly

Taking care of cars and bodies
Nothing ever comes for free
The ghosts are here
The ghosts are here
Red white and blue
Red white and blue

I can tell you how this ends
We're going win this
We're gonna win this
We're gonna win this
We're gonna win

We're going win this
We're going win this
We're going win this
We're gonna win.
