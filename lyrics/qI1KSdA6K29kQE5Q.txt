Figuring out where I went wrong
--- top collar then was gone for long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up
I wore the world upon my back
Though someone else could meet, pick up the slack
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You got me bugging in a way
That's talkin' deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Looking up
Looking up
Looking up
Looking up
