It's harder to see
With my head in the clouds
But my feet on the floor
I can't seem to keep
Any wolves from my door

The funny thing is
You wait for a sign
And then 10 come along
A swing and a miss
It never rains
But it pours

Drowning in the water
Against the current
I can barely hold on
But one thing that I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

One thing that
Keeps me going
More than you'll ever know
In the eye of the storm

暗がりにまとわりつく光の尾
向こう岸にはまだ見えぬ未知の陽

But one thing that I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

One thing that
Keeps me going
More than you'll ever know
In the eye of the storm

I remember
I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn
And that one thing will keep me going
More than you will ever ever know

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

It's the one thing that
Keeps me going
More than you'll ever know

In the eye of the storm
