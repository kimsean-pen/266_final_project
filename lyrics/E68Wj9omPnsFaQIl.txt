ome on, come on, come on
Come talk to me
Maybe the night is young
Maybe you're fantasy
Sit down, relax, your past used to be
But come on, come on, come on

Maybe being miserable is not unpredictable
Maybe that's the problem with me

Thanks for calling, thanks for letting me go
Thanks for asking, even though you know that
I'm falling

But come on, come on, come on
Come talk to me
Maybe you're not enough, maybe enough of me
Look back, your best relapse used to be
But come on, come on, come on

Maybe being miserable is not unpredictable
Maybe that's the problem with me

Thanks for calling, thanks for letting me go
Thanks for asking, even though you know that
I'm falling

Pieces falling
To pieces falling

Thanks for calling, thanks for letting me go and
Thanks for asking, even though you know that
I'm falling somewhere down below, down below
down below, down below, don't belong and

Fear of walking, fear of walking wrong
Can we stop this, 'till I need someone 'cause
I'm falling somewhere down below, down below
down below, down below, don't belong and

I am talking, fear of letting me go
No one's calling, even though we know that
I'm falling somewhere down below, down below
down below, down below, don't belong and

I don't know, I crumble, used to be
Your shadow crawling back to me
What's wrong
You know
How long
How long
How long
How long
