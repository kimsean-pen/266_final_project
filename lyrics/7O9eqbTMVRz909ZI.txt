Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh-hoo-ooh-ohh

Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Givin' everything inside and out, and

Love's strange, surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling
Down, down, down

Will you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-ohh

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defences
Vanity, insecurity, ahh

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
When you walk away

Oh, will you walk away
Will you walk on by
Come on, call my name
Will you call my name

I'll sing ooh la
Lalala la
Lalala la
Lalala la la lala la lala
Lalala la
Lalala la
Lalala la la lala la lala
Lalala la
Lalala la
Lalala la la lala la lala...
When you walk on by
And you call my name
When you walk on by
