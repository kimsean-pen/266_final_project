What say you now, the door is opening
On your vigil now I'm in my usual way
I save my breath, knowing what you're
You wanting me to say, I only love you when I'm down

You say that midnight opens it's arms to me
Leaving you alone, then I fly so far away
Until the light blurs my vision and I have nowhere to roam
I only love you when I'm down

And I only love you when I'm down
And I'm only near you when I'm gone
But one thing for you to keep in mind
You know that I'm down all the time, all the time

Well I know you're reaching out and you need to feel my hand
You want to be understood, yeah well I understand
I know you hold precious little hope for me
And in your happiness, I'm always drowning in my grief

Now I only love you when I'm down, oh
Now I'm only near you when I'm gone
But one thing for you to keep in mind
You know that I'm down all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time
