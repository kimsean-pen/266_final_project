I'm standing in tomorrow's way
future's fine
least it seems okay
Doesn't mean a miracle
should be turned away

On that day
Saw both my life and death
in two lines
felt the kick of fate
there I was invisible
out of phase

No sun, no storm
no time, nowhere
BREATHLESS
for a moment I was
nowhere Breathless
for a moment I was
BREATHLESS

Both the void and the parade
in due time
and they feel the same
Even if I wanted to
well I can't explain

How could I be standing here
across divides
unhurt, unfazed
It didn't feel impossible
but it looked that way

No sun, no storm
no time, nowhere
BREATHLESS
for a moment I was
nowhere Breathless
for a moment I was
BREATHLESS

for a moment I was fine
for a moment I was fine
