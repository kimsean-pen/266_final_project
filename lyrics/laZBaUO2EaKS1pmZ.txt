It's good feeling good
It's good feeling high
You hold me in, high on a time I'm feeling down!
It's good feeling good, it's good feeling clear
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Let's get to the back, the back seat...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Little things go on in not...
Get me down, down on the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Chorus:
You moved to. yeah you think I might be feeling better
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
I feel all real in another way
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
...but I think I might be feeling better
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away

Hold me on tight to keep from floating away!
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away

Skip taking time, it's good feeling safe, oh, oh
The whole you, I see your face, you're feeling better
It's good being here, it's good feeling real
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Chorus:
You moved to. yeah you think I might be feeling better
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
I feel all real in another way
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
...but I think I might be feeling better
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
Hold me on tight to keep from floating away!
Uh, uh, uh I'mma get away
