I'm making a promise
A promise I'll never break
To let you go
I need to let you go
So try to tell me that I'm always wrong
That our love is strong
That our love is strong
But baby it's just when the lights are off
That it all comes out it all comes out
Every single time that I'm not with you
Baby, I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
Let me tell you this place feels empty
Doesn't feel like, doesn't feel like home.
Now you're thinking of me in the middle of the
night
Baby now you're thinking how it felt so right [x3]
And our rhythm is so smooth
An hour passes and it's still just me and you
Free falling through the pale moonlight
Free falling for the rest of our lives
Every single time that I'm not with you
Baby I'm alone baby I'm alone
Let me tell you this place feels empty
Doesn't feel like, doesn't feel like home.
This one night is how I want to spend the rest of
my life Regretting nothing leaving it all behind
Is how I want to spend the rest of my life [x2]
Leave it all behind for the rest of my life
Just this one night leave it all behind
Every single time that I'm not with you
Baby I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
Let me tell you this place feels empty
Doesn't feel like, doesn't feel like home.
