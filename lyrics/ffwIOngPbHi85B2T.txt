We all long to belong
We all need to be needed
Loneliness is our disease
Still we bite the hand that feeds
Where did we go wrong
Insecure and self-sufficient
Building up walls instead of bridges

Let our lonely hearts collide
We're made to live this life
Together
Together
Reach across this great divide
'cause standing side by side is better
Together

All the pride we defend
Teaches us to pretend
Like we can make it on our own
But we were never made to walk alone

Let our lonely hearts collide
We're made to live this life
Together
Together
Reach across this great divide
'cause standing side by side is better
Together

Let the lines between us disappear
It starts now
It starts here
Yeah

Let our lonely hearts collide
We're made to live this life
Together
Together
Reach across this great divide
'cause standing side by side is better
Together
Together
Together
Together
Together
