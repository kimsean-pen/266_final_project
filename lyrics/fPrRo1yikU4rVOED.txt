Don't, don't want you back
Hey, eee, yea
Ohh, yea
Ahh, ahh, ahh
You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture
On the 'Backstreet's Back Alright'
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed, babe
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your
(Sexuality)
But now we're done and over with
(Don't, don't, don't want you back)
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back, ahh, ahh
You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize
(Realize)
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
(Hee, yea, yea)
I, I don't want you back
(Bae, yea, eee, aaa, no, ooo, ooo)
I, I don't want you back, aah, aah, aah
(No)
That's right, aah, aah, aah, aah
(No)
Baby, don't bother
Telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story
'Bout you and I
Don't want you back, that's all I know
(Don't want you back)
(Don't want you back)
All I can say
Don't want you back, you know you gotta go
(Ohh, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me
(Don't want you back)
I know
(Don't want you back)
That's all I can say
(Don't want you back)
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
(Gotta go)
I, I don't want you back
(Don't want you back, that's all I want)
(Yea, yea, ohh, no)
That's all I can say
(Yea, yea)
Don't want you back
(Don't want you back)
(You know)
I, I don't want you back
