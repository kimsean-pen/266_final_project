It's a tricky situation
It suits you
It suits you

A man, his face
And a dog, his body

It suits you
Oh it suits you

It's a place you've been
But you don't
Don't know when
I don't know when

Don't know when
Don't know when

It's a trick
It's a trick
It's a trick
It's a trick
It's a trick

(Growl)

Don't turn your back on me
I've gave you it all

Don't turn your back on me
I've given you everything

You don't know who I am
Who I can be

Don't forget me
Don't forget me
I've given you it all
