Tell me honey degi sleep
Okay, deny
You are just little tiny feet
Kicking all the time
But you know I couldn't reused
Any that I know
Wish I have this feeling though
Every night along
Tell me something hand on high
High Missed on
Do even things go in places
Far
Glass on water some on light
Blanked on your needs
Not is that forever gone
You just wait to see
Tiny little love
Always choosing
Midnight full averse
Just an illusion
Oh oh oh oh slow down
Tiny little love gets you running
Oh the lazy Daisy
Slowly going
Oh oh oh all ways
