All of the time
Out in the background
You were sublime
But tell me real live, is this real life?
Open when you're feeling okay
I know you won't
But real life is okay
At night, all the same

And I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be left behind
Do you want to be?
I want you now
So I've got to shout it
Volition!
Got to do the right thing, tonight
Uh, uh, alright

Feel light, it's real tonight
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on and retire young
No collecting bags in your eyes
Feel high, so high you'd be a real kite
I counted everything twice
I measured it and cut twice
But I know, oh, me
Me and for you know it's alright
Don't come when I'm crying
Don't have to cry, you caught my eye, why?
Summon that taste in the restaurant
Saw you with the backlight
Oh, why not be mine?

Well, I cannot lie
I don't feel right, but
I tuck you in real tight
I know you're gonna sleep tonight
I've got real life
A real better life
I tuck you in real tight
I know you'll get to sleep tonight
And I can't feel right
Without you by me side
I tuck you in real tight
I hope you get to sleep tonight
