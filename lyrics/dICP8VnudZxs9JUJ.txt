Are you gone
Did you just fly away
The sun is gone away
And I can't seem to find my way

Are you gone
Just like in dreams you said
And dreams should never die
And I just want to hide away

Are you gone
Did you just fly away
The sun is gone away
And I can't seem to find my way

Are you gone
Just like in dreams you said
And dreams should never die
And I just want to hide away
