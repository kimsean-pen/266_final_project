I think is time that I went on a holiday
I think it's time that my mind should take a break
I take the things that my friends say I should take
I think it's time that I went on a holiday

I know that you will be the one
Who leads me right into the sun
I run away, run away far from here
I run away, run away far from here

I think it's time that I went on a holiday
I listen to the people who try to fake
They all say that they need a holiday
I think it's time that we went on a holiday

I know that you will be the one
Who leads me right into the sun
I run away, run away far from here
I run away, run away far from here
