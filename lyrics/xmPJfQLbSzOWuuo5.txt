Outta my way, outta my day
Outta your mind and into mine
Into no one, Into not one
Into your step but outta time

Headstrong, What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You're right
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down, why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall, it ain't my call

It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch
Oh

Down on the sun, Down and no fun
Down and all out, where the hell ya been?
Damn it all down, Damn it unbound

Damn it on down to hell again
Stand tall,
Can't fall

Never even mend it all before you're right
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
Dragging me down, why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall, it ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
Oh, out of my way

Out of my way
Out of my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong... What's wrong?

I've already heard this song before you arrived
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

And now it's time to kiss it
Dragging me down, why you around?
So useless, yeah

It ain't my fall, it ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
No way but down, why you around?
No foolin', yeah

It ain't my smile, it ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Ain't mine
Your kind

You're steppin' out of time
Ain't mine
Your kind

You're steppin' out of time
Dragging me down, why you around?
No foolin'

It ain't my fall, it ain't my call
It ain't my, ooooh!, bitch
You ain't my...
