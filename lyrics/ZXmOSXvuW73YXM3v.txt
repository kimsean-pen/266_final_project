When the sun rested on olive shoulders
And the wind kissed the back of your neck
I would lay and absorb in the silence
In your language I haven't learned yet

In the tune of the National Anthem
Sing the words while the corrugate burns
While our burning desires are crackling
We exist in the unified verse

When your eyes became focused on absence
How the shadows were cast on the plain
Under moonlight of middle November
I was shifting to stay in the frame

Oh, and I would eat from the tops of your branches
Spit it out, break a bow, and descend
I would dream of the ways we'd get cradled
While this lullaby rings in my head

When this began
This was a thing
That we could both share

A bit of shame
The goodness fades
And we'd begin there

When this began
This was a thing
That we could both share

A bit of shame
The goodness fades
And we'd begin there
