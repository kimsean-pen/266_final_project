She said I'll throw myself away
They're just photos after all
I can't make you hang around
I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame
Is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway

I can go
With the flow
But don't say it doesn't matter (with the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go
With the flow
I can go
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?

I can go
With the flow
But don't say it doesn't matter (with the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go
With the flow
I can go
Do you believe it in your head?

Do you believe it in your head?
Do you believe it in your head?
