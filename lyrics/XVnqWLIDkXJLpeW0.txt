I thought you'd see me through the glass,
But you only caught your reflection.
I hoped you'd hear me through the noise,
Of the street poles and fire

But no, no, no,
You didn't notice.

I tried to care for a while,
But I don't feel the connection.
I'd settle for a broken heart,
Just a scar caused by infection

But no, no, no,
I didn't notice,
What you wanted
All gets lost in the fire
That warms who we are, get lost

And we're dressed up like humans,
Like we know who we are.
This map won't get you home,
If you don't know where you are.
This plastic house won't break with stones.
This road won't get you home,
From where you are.

You look like someone from afar,
When I knew the direction.
I'd settle for a broken heart,
Just a scar caused by infection.

But no, no, no,
We didn't notice.
What you wanted,
All gets lost in the fire,
That warms who we are, get lost

And we're dressed up like humans,
Like we know who we are.
This map won't get you home,
If you don't know where you are.
This plastic house won't break with stones.
This road won't get you home,
From where you are.
