I'll hug the world, suffocate it with a pillow
Pat 'em on the head, make a boy feel little
Snuck out the side door, sly on my tiptoe
He said he's hard but he crumble like Nabisco
Super sweet ice tea, apple pie
What do you really mean when you calling me nice?
You eat the peach, gotta check if it's ripe
I know he want a salad and I know he not my type and
Dust yourself off, girl, keep your chin up
You wanna hold a gun but they made you a pinup
A girl want fun and a girl wanna sin some
I want the teddy bear, now a bitch gonna win one

I know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be ne-

He says he wants a nice girl
I'm that fuck up your life girl
I don't wanna be a nice girl
Bad, bad, I ain't right, girl
He says he wants a nice girl
I'm that fuck up your life girl
I don't wanna be a nice girl
Bad, bad, I ain't right, girl

Pinkie swear that I might be nice
He says I'm a lost cause and he might be right
Fuck a faux pas, it's my time to shine
I'm in the country club getting my card declined
What's he doing? I don't need a brave knight
We can sword fight, that doesn't mean I'll behave nice
Stick it to him like a stick of dynamite
Cyanide on the side, ooh, I love the limelight
Woah, woah, we're a lousy bunch
To tell the truth, role models weren't around me much
On a bad day, you could say I'm sweeter than ice cream
They told me to be nice and I told 'em to bite me

I know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be next to me
Know he wanna, know he wanna be

He says he wants a nice girl
I'm that fuck up your life girl
I don't wanna be a nice girl
Bad, bad, I ain't right, girl
He says he wants a nice girl
I'm that fuck up your life girl
I don't wanna be a nice girl
Bad, bad, I ain't right, girl
