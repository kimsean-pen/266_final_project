I couldn't hang
hang with that same old (?)
couldn't stay home
and make my momma (?)
I got no money,
but I think's it funny how,
I don't need nothing.
Except for my gutter girl.

All on my mind she's in my head.
I know she's my gutter girl.
Forget what they say.
I'm here to stay,
here with my gutter girl.

Don't you know?
You're my gutter girl.
Don't you know?
You're my gutter.

Go rollercoaster,
yeah she took me up and down.
She's making me ill,
but I can't turn her down.
We got no money,
but I think it's funny how,
I don't need nothing,
except for my gutter girl.

All on my mind she's in my head.
I know she's my gutter girl.
Forget what they say.
I'm here to stay,
here with my gutter girl.

Don't you know?
You're my gutter girl.
Don't you know?
You're my gutter.
