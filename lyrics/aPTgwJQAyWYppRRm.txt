I don't want to be the best
I don't want to be a fast talkin' millionaire
I don't wanna
I don't want no regrets
Wasting my time, not saying what I meant
Don't want to be a fake
I don't want to beg
I don't want to be a waste
I don't want to be a lie
It ain't sincere if I hold it back

Why you want to hide
When you trying to fight?
Mark you up and hold you to the light
Why you want to hide when you trying to fight?
Do what you gotta do
Must be thinkin' I
I can't hear when y'all chatter
Calm down thinkin' y'all foolin' somebody
Won't I break dem rules I gotta
Y'all listen here I'm 'a get me what I want, I
I don't even want none
I don't want
I don't even want none, let them think they won
I don't even want none
I don't want
Make me want to hold out let them winners run
I don't even want none

I don't want
Make me want to hold out
Let them think they won
I don't even want none
I don't want
Make me want to hold out what they running from, yeah
Let 'em run, run, run, run, run
Let 'em run, run, run
Let them winners run

Walkin with the top tier
In the jet set
Crossing every line that your conscience done set
Working every day in a drab eye sore
Don't assault me on the street with your judgment
We get ahead in a way that you don't get
Talkin' 'bout your fuckin' and the star buckin' head honch
Turn your heads back looking at my headlights

Why you want to hide
When you trying to fight?
Mark you up and hold you to the light

Why you want to hide when you trying to fight?
Own up if you do
You keep thinkin' I
I can't hear when y'all chatter
Calm down thinkin y'all foolin' somebody
Won't I break dem rules, I gotta
Y'all listen here, I'm 'a get me what I want, I (I'm 'a do it, how
I don't even want none
I don't want
I don't even want none, let them think they won
I don't even want none
I don't want
Make me want to hold out, let them winners run
I don't even want none
I don't want
Make me want to hold out
Let them think they won
I don't even want none
I don't want
Make me want to hold out what they running from, yeah
Let 'em run, run, run, run, run
Let 'em run, run, run
Let them winners run
