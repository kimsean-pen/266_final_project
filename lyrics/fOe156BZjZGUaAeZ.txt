The way that girl can break a heart
It's like a work of art
And this is the worst part
She knows it

And she's so confident
That she's what everybody wants
But nobody wants
Her to know that

So fall back on all of your premonitions
And just learn to listen
To those that have more wisdom than you
And just stop
Putting so much stock
In all of this stuff
Live your life for those that you love

And I'm still waiting for
You to be the one I'm waiting for

The way that girl can turn a head
Well she is such a threat
But don't ever forget
She knows it

And she's got it all
All figured out
And she won't let you doubt
She knows it

I'm still waiting for
You to be the one I'm waiting for
I'm still waiting for
You to be the one I'm waiting for

So fall back on all of your premonitions
And just learn to listen
To those that have more wisdom than you
And just stop
Putting so much stock
In all of this stuff
Live your life for those that you love

I'm still waiting for
You to be the one I'm waiting for
I'm still waiting for
You to be the one I'm waiting for

I'm still waiting for
(Something tells me that this is going to make sense)
You to be the one I'm waiting for
(Something tells me it's going to take patience)
I'm still waiting for
(Something tells me that this will all work out in the end)
You to be the one I'm waiting for
