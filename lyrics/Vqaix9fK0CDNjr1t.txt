You're my white tiger

Captivated by a perfect view
Time stopped and I found my muse
Brighter than the morning sun
Flames burned until the night was done
My faith in love was born again
From the clouds you were Heaven sent
I could tell you we're a different breed
From the way you looked at me

And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that makes me complete
You're my white tiger

The first time I saw you standing there
Butterflies, all I could do was stare
So flawless and original
My heart dropped and I fell for you
Everything I was looking for
Like a wave crashing on my shore
Suddenly I couldn't speak
It's like an angel walked into me

And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that makes me complete
You're my white tiger

As our worlds collide
Nothing can keep us
From ever leaving this place
As our stars align
They fit together so perfectly

And there's no place that I'd rather be
When I feel your teeth sink into me
I bleed a color that I've never seen
A beauty that make me complete
You're my white tiger
