It's a long way down, and we're so far away from your old house.
There's nobody around.
Kiss you on the forehead and undo your blouse.
Drifting out, drifting through the water.
Through the sound, swim to me now.
Long way down, I can feel you fall.
Hear me now, through the sound.
I saw your eyes, shining like two beacons in the dark night sky.
They looked so wild, you looked so alive.
Maybe I'll do something wild.
Maybe I'll do something I've never done.
Maybe I'll find some magic.
Maybe I'll find love.
