Whatever i'm doing here it's not fair
Wasting water and wasting air
Stay in bed and start a sound
Keep your head cool underground
All aflame and all aflower
All alone in wigan tower
Oh lord, what a paradise to be
All alone for just an hour

Father, lover, supervisor
Bleeding hearts for the bleeding heart
