So where did you sleep the night before?
I doubt that your phone was dying
I'm supposed to believe that is what you wore
Said you were alone, I don't buy it
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time but why would you
Think you're gonna make it right but how could you
So I can't stay, surrounded by every lie

You might as well just stop crying
It doesn't mean much to me anymore
A little too late to start trying
I'm taking this love off of life support
Now I can't stay

Surrounded by every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time but why would you
Think you're gonna make it right but how could you
So I can't stay, surrounded by every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time but why would you
Think you're gonna make it right but how could you
So I can't stay, surrounded by every lie

Trying to undo the love that I'm tied to
Who haven't you lied to

With every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time but why would you
Think you're gonna make it right but how could you
So I can't stay, surrounded by every lie

Every lie that won't come true
Now you wanna take the time but why would you
Think you're gonna make it right but how could you
So I can't stay, surrounded by
No, I won't stay, surrounded by every lie
