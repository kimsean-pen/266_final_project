It's funny how we met on the telephone
You and I on the edge of the unknown
Oh, in only a moment's time
I knew my heart was yours and yours was mine

When I saw you waiting at your place
Something felt familiar in your face
Oh, you smiled as if to say
I knew my heart was yours from the first day

We were right
We stood through it all
Holding tight
Whenever we fall
What we found is second to none
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love
I knew, I knew, I knew this would be love

There were days when I thought I'd lost you
I read the letter aloud, what could I do?
Now, we're right back where we belong
Don't second guess your heart, it's never wrong
