I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger, I've got
So many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shivered with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm, can you
Show me how we can escape

(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
Unfolding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
Unfolding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Now that we can hear that sound
Now that you can hold me down
You can pull me under, you can
Raise everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
And every part of me you change
Just hold me together, tell me
You'll always want me to stay

(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love, that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love, that your love

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight (tonight)
Unfolding it all tonight (tonight)

You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've be waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight (tonight)
Unfolding it all tonight (tonight)
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've be waiting to find
(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
It's you that I've been waiting to find
(Ooh oh oh oh, Ooh oh oh oooh)
It's you that I've been waiting to find
