On occasion, my mouth still bleeds
From when I cut it when I was young
Forgive me, give me one more chance
To make my old friends laugh
To be just a footnote in their paragraph
Saw I was down but still looking up from the ditch
So they grew their nails out
They were just trying to scratch my itch

If I started over, I'd do the same again
If I started over, I would do the same
This is not my swan song or adieu so beware
When they fly my white flag in the air
I'll shoot it down
I'll shoot it down with arrows

Because I spend all of my time
Trying to find what I need
What I was biting the hand that fed me
It saw I was down but still looking up from the ditch
So it grew its nails
It was just trying to scratch my itch

If I started over, I'd do the same again
If I started over, I would do the same
This is not my swan song or adieu so beware
When they fly my white flag in the air
I'll shoot it down
I'll shoot it down with arrows

So I stopped running, started walking instead
It was all in my head
Nothing's against me
This war was more civil, I realized
I had to, to see from both sides

I left myself with no ride home
But it's the last night of summer
And I don't mind walking alone
Remember when we ran naked
In the field behind your house

If I started over, I'd do the same again
If I started over, I would do the same
This is not my swan song or adieu so beware
When they fly my white flag in the air
I'll shoot it down
I'll shoot it down with arrows
