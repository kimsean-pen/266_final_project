up, along the rocks,
it's good, it's not so hard now.
up, I bite my tongue, who cares?
this chance to drop off
all that you left you left for someone all of this hurt that's wilted off
all this relief, it's the oddest thing
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Chen, he'll never come that's fine,
I lost my thought
Wei, Huai could talk me down
still, still this chance to drop off
