The worst is over
and the sky is clear
and there's not a place on earth i'd rather be than here
but on the horizon
as the morning breaks
I can see a brand new day that's full of new mistakes
Please tell me that only the strong survive
I don't know if we'll make it through the night
I guess i'll see you in the afterlife
Please tell me that only the strong survive

Gotta keep on running
they only attack
cause the day you quit it's day you wish you had it back
They tell me that only the strong survive
I don't know if we'll make it through the night
I guess i'll see you in the afterlife
They tell me that only the strong survive

If we only die tomorrow
At least we can say
Life has been alright
yeah it's been alright
we can beg and we can borrow
but in the end
Everything's alright
Everything's alright alright

Everytime we get up were we destined to fall?
and i'm asking myself is it worth this at all?
every corner we turn we just run into walls
because loving you feels like a kick in the balls

everytime we get up were we destined to fall
(destined to fall)
and i'm asking myself is it worth this at all
(worth this at all)
every corner we turn we just run into walls
because loving iyou feels like a kick in the balls

Please tell me that only the strong survive
I don't know if we'll make it through the night
I guess i'll see you in the afterlife
Please tell me that only the strong survive
yeah
(na na na na na na.)
Hey!
(na na na na na na.)

They tell me that only the strong survive!
