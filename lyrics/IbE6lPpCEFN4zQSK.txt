Get it before
It goes to waste
Lick on my knife
And honour the taste
Taking my time
Running in place
Leaving the house
Was a mistake

I don't know if I dare
I don't know if I care
You are all I want
I am all I know

Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Stand alone
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Stay alone

If I see only what I believe
Reality's bound
By what I conceieve
Pickin' the scab
And watching it bleed
Behind the wall
Where I can't be seen

I don't know if I dare
I don't know if I care
You are all I want
I am all I know

Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Stay alone
Broken bones
Broken bones
Broken bones
Stay alone
