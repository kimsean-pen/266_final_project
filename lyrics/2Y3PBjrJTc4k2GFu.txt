Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happened
I guess you're attractive
Or something

Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me

"Girlfriend" or "girl that's a friend"?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real

It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel

I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?

I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't afford
