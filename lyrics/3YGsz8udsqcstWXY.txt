I'm too young to die
Gonna live forever
I just want to talk tough
Look mean
Life is good at seventeen

One thing that I know is that
You don't know a thing about me
You were the young, dumb
Chosen one
Now you shake your head and say
Kids these days

Mirror mirror on the wall
What's the meaning of it all?

Wasted all the time
Nothing lasts forever
Maybe I should give up the good fight
Change my image overnight

One thing that I know is that
You don't know a thing about me
I am the young, dumb
Chosen one
Losing in the loveliest way
Kids these days

Mirror mirror on the wall
What's the meaning of it all?

Adolescent intuition
Murder on the rise
Make an easy million
Blow it in the night
Tell me that I'm pretty
Tell me that I'm nice
I know you can see it in my eyes
You can see it in my eyes
You can see it in my eyes
You can see it in my eyes

Everybody tries
Tries to be somebody
To be somebody's
Wet dream, prom king
Golden boy, new toy

Mirror mirror on the wall
What's the meaning of it all?

Life is a honeymoon phase
Kids these days
Kids these days
Kids these days
