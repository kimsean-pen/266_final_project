I'm here to paint what is written on ya face
'Cause these are the days we are losing our ways
To find better ways to say what nobody says

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling

Today
It iz what it iz, shorty
Today
It iz what it iz, shorty

I got affected but I effect a lot more
They all got issues but I got a bit more
I put it in boxes and I put it in a store
I hope you really like it, I can do you some more

Yeah, I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
'Cause one day you are gonna say that
Today was bumping

Yeah, I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
And someday you are gonna say that
Today was bumping

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling

Today
It iz what it iz, shorty
Today
It iz what it iz, shorty

Maybe it's just us or maybe it just me
We can have discussions while we are playin' Wii
It iz what it iz, shorty, what it iz, shorty

Maybe it's just us or maybe it just me
We can have discussions while we are playin' Wii

Yeah, I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
And someday you are gonna say that
Today was bumping

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling

We're living on the edge
And my motorcycle's speeding
It iz what it iz
And this is how I'm feeling
