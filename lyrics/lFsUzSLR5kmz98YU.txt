This song brings on the weather
Tear drops upon my sweater
I cry in bed whenever
I see you guys together
Fuck love it's all a lie
I can't sleep I rather die
Than see that look in your eye
It sucks that I'm not your guy

I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like

I packed my bags last week
Sunrise and I'm on my feet
Let's skip town and chase our dreams
Cause this place ain't what it seems
Come home let's synchronize
My soft lips caress your thighs
You get me so fucking high
The voices in my head collide

I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like
I think you're really cool like
Keep your voice down
She don't care no
I can't breathe I've got no air
No sympathy for my despair
I cut my wrists and grow my hair
I'm outta my mind
I'm outta my mind
I think i'm outta my mind
I think i'm outta my mind
I think i'm outta my mind
I think i'm outta my mind
I think i'm outta my mind
