Huh huh
Yeah yeah yeah
Huh huh

You know everything that I'm afraid of
You do everything I wish I did
Everybody wants you
Everybody loves you

I know, I should tell you how I feel
I wish everyone would disappear
Every time you call me I'm too scared to be me
And I'm too shy to say

Ooh, I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I got a crush on you
A crush on you

You know, I'm the one that you can talk to
Sometimes you tell me things that I don't wanna know
I just want to hold you
You say exactly how you feel about her
I wonder, could you ever think of me that way?

I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I got a crush on you
A crush on you

Ooh, I wish I could tell somebody
But there's no one to talk to
Nobody knows I've got a crush on you
A crush on you

I got a crush
Hey
Hey yeah
Hey yeah aye
I got a crush
I got a crush on you

You say everything that no one says
I feel everything that you're afraid to feel
I will always want you
I will always love

I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I got a crush on you
A crush on you
I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I got a crush on you
Yeah yeah, aye aye yeah
I got a crush I got a crush on you
I got a crush
I got a crush, baby
I got a crush on you
Got a crush on you
