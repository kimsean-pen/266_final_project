I can be nice but don't test me
I can get wicked
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked
There's no escaping it
Wicked
You wanna kick it
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I'm a beast came to rip this spot up
Stick to chords cause the devil wears prada
We want peace but we can make this rowdy, stop
We don't want to hurt nobody
You can't hate me cause my nature's nice
And my heart's for the people of the world tonight
If you got a problem with it take it up with life
Cause if you try to push me it ain't going to be nice

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked
There's no escaping it
Wicked
You wanna kick it
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I am not afraid of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and not ashamed
When it washes over me I feel free

P.S. don't play me like a 3DS
These cats can't see us they checking the wrong mirrors
Cavaliers, don't mistake kindness for weakness
They never wanted to hear us blow speakers
Spittin the trinity hook, line, and sequence
In your brain like a G6 no secrets
My faith is my life it's rolling the dice
If you try to push me it ain't gonna be nice

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked
There's no escaping it
Wicked
You wanna kick it
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I am not afraid of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and not ashamed
When it washes over me I feel free

I can be nice but don't test me
I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked
There's no escaping it
Wicked
You wanna kick it
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I get wicked when you come against me
So quit it stop trying to push me around
Let's kick it if you really want to touch fire
Come get it step up I'll bring you down
Step up and get it because I get wicked
