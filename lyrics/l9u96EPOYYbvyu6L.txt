So, we fall
By the weight of the wine

My eye
It yearns

Here comes the guardian of ease
Here comes the carriage of light

Could I feel more?

You'll never know me
I will never know you

Far away
Lies on my eyes
Wake the saint
Shadow of my side

Could I feel more?

You will never know me
I will never know you

So we fall, we falter
In the light, I'm golden
So we fall, we falter
In the light, I am bare
