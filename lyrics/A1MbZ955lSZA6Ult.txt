Oh my, oh my, oh my, what if it was true?
And oh my, oh my, oh my, tell me is it true
Did He, did He, did He die upon that cross?
And did He, did He, did He come back across?

Jesus walking on the water
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky
Sinking sand He took my hand
He raised me up and he brought me up
I can hold my, my, my head high

Will I, will I, will I be true to my birth?
And will I, will I, will I give what I'm worth?
Oh yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, I come when you call
And yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, Jesus, my all-in-all

Jesus walking on the water
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky
Sinking sand He took my hand
He raised me up and He brought me up
I can hold my, my, my head high

Oh my, oh my, oh my, what if it was true?
And oh my, oh my, oh my, tell me is it true
Did He, did He, did He die upon that cross?
And did He, did He, did He come back across?

Jesus walking on the water
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky
Sinking sand, He took my hand
He raised me up and He brought me up
I can hold my, my, my head high
