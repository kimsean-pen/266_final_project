Lights-lights-lights back-back-back on
Lights-lights-light o-o-o-on

I'm tangled up, no strings attached
You gave your heart, but now I think you want it back
You are my ocean and the tide
It's little wonder why, I'm drownin' in your eyes
The powers out, we lost it all
I'm fallin' hard, you pulled the rug and watched me fall
Now you're dropping coals, I think we're breakin' up
Got my love on stand-by

Why'd you hit the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Circuit break the love we had to star-ar-art
Why'd you click the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Can you turn my lights back on?
Turn my lights-lights back-back o-o-on o-o-on
Lights-lights-lights back-back on
Lights-lights-lights o-o-on o-o-on

You've blown a fuse, I see the smoke
Your love, my life, I think you made a mess of both
Electricity is what we know
I chase the life that you just never show

Why'd you hit the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Circuit break the love we had to star-ar-art
Why'd you click the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Can you turn my lights back on?
Turn my lights-lights back-back o-o-on o-o-on
Lights-lights-lights back-back on
Lights-lights-lights o-o-on o-o-on
Lights-lights-lights back-back on
Lights-lights-lights o-o-on o-o-on
Click the- click the killswitch on my hear-ar-art

Shut me down, let the power go out
Shut me down, let the power go out
Shut me down, let the power go out
Power go out, power go out
Shut me down, let the power go out
Shut me down, let the power go out
Out, out, out

Why'd you hit the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Circuit break the love we had to star-ar-art
Why'd you click the killswitch on my hear-ar-art
Can you turn my lights back on?
