Filling with fear I'm getting cold again
Losing my grip and I slip now he's pulling me under
Drowning in my old friend
Caught in the swell I have to keep my nerve
Swallow me whole
Your control leaves me dead in the water
Dead in the water

Stormy night I'm washed ashore
I catch my breath and wait for dawn
I catch my death I'm back for more

As the tides they bring me home
(Waves crashing down over me)
Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
(Floating to the surface from the blue)
Like the sea as it leaves me cold
(Waves crashing down over me)
Your spirit has been overthrown and it's drowning

I am the one I am strong kept my head above water
Sailing away from you
Your love is like a hurricane
Devastating, wracked with pain
I won't be scared I'm not afraid

As the tides they bring me home
(Waves crashing down over me)
Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
(Floating to the surface from the blue)
Like the sea as it leaves me cold
(Waves crashing down over me)
Your spirit has been overthrown and it's drowning

As the tides they bring me home
(Waves crashing down over me)
Feelings I should leave alone to the ocean
(Floating to the surface from the blue)
Like the sea as it leaves me cold
(Waves crashing down over me)
Your spirit has been overthrown and it's drowning
