Lady, it's running through my veins.
Lady,
Oh!
Why won't you look at me?
Lady,
Oh!
What else is there to see?
Oh,
It's all coming back.
Oh,
It's when I see best.
Because I was fool for loving her,
over you.
And if I fall,
I really hope you call me
'cause I'm not over you
Lady, can't always get your way
Lady, can't trust you as you may
