Easy now
We don't need this
Take a breath
And believe it's just a phase
That we're going through
I try to shout
But my words go in and out
Did you even hear me say
That I still love you

We are losing our way
Can't you hear what I say
Like a child calling out in the night

We're lost in Babylon, Babylon
Time is slipping away
Holding on, it won't be long
Until the dawn of the day
Lost in Babylon, Babylon
Still we need to believe
When love is gone
We're moving on
Not a long, long way from home

Back to back
We're too proud to face the facts
Though we sleep in the same bed
There's no coming through
Face to face
I can see you through a maze
Of the words we spoke in vain

You know this will go out of hand
If we don't understand
This confusion of tongue
Feels so wrong

We're lost in Babylon, Babylon
Time is slipping away
Holding on, it won't be long
Until the dawn of the day
Lost in Babylon, Babylon
Still we need to believe
When love is gone
We're moving on
Not a long, long way from home
Lost in Babylon

There's a right to your wrongs
There's a truth in my lies
I can't hear from your words
But I see in your eyes

We're lost in Babylon, Babylon
Time is slipping away
Holding on, it won't be long
Until the dawn of the day
Lost in Babylon, Babylon
Still we need to believe
When love is gone
We're moving on
Not a long, long way from home
Lost in Babylon
