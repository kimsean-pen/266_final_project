Santa Claus is in the closet
Santa's in the water closet
Takin' off his leotard
PJs, underwear
Oh, ho-ho-ho

Santa's gone and lost his apron
Santa's cooking up some bacon
(?] on the [?)
[?] took away

Santa's in the closet
Santa's [?]

Sixty candles, make a wish
Santa's cake is on the dish
Steady [?] rock instead
Rocking at the kitchen door

Santa Claus is in the closet
Santa's in the water closet
Takin' off his leotard
PJs, underwear
Oh, ho-ho-ho

18 karat, ginger snap
[?] push is coming back
(?)
And he doesn't know jack

(?)
[?] spices at the door
(?)
And he doesn't know jack

Up the [?] pull the latch
[?] footsteps down the hatch
Santa's movin' down the hall

Santa Claus is at the bar
Santa wants to break the law
Santa's goin', goin' down
And Santa wants to go to hell

18 karat, ginger snap
[?] push is coming back
(?)
And he doesn't know jack

Santa's locked in the closet
(?)
I don't know how he got there
Or what he's doing here
