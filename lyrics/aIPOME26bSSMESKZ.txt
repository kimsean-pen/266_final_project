You cannot be
You're the mistake: calamity
Sent to destroy all the good on this Earth, killing me
You're killing me
The mother of ruination comes to fuck all
Mutilating everything
Spread wide open, beckoning
Beckoning me

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse encaged in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Spewed from the wound
Of this life's worst cavity; the
Nightmare spreads its cancerous lamentations, poisoning
Force-feed the plague
Drunk from the milk of death's overflowing sick tit
Nourishing the misery
Gives birth to the ugliness
That grows inside

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse encaged in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Isolate
The heart from the brain
Permeate
Inject us with pain
Holding our breath now, we're screaming without sound
We're trembling as everything falls completely apart
Meteor crash down, come crater our woe out
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

Holding our breath now, we're screaming without sound
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

You came to be
You're the mistake: calamity
Here to destroy all the good on this Earth, killing all
Killing us all

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse encaged in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence
