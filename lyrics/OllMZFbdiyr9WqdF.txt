I can tell by your eyes that you've prob'ly been cryin' forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, oh, my heart?

If I stand all alone, will the shadow hide the colors of my heart
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, oh, my heart?

I don't wanna talk about it, how you broke this ol' heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, oh, my heart
My poor old heart, my heart?
