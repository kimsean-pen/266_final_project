A night robber stopped me on the freeway
No cash baby I'm a cheapskate
Work a graveyard shift on the weekdays
Split my wallet and my heart in to three ways

No cash baby I'm a cheapskate
Work a graveyard shift on the weekdays
Split my wallet and my heart in to three ways

A night robber stopped me on the freeway
No cash baby I'm a cheapskate
Work a graveyard shift on the weekdays
Split my wallet and my heart in to three ways

No sleep, I don't get rest
But I always try my best
And it feels like I'm obsessed
Yet somehow you're not impressed

No sleep, I don't get rest
But I always try my best
And I tend to get upset
When you waste the dollar signs I invest

A night robber stopped me on the freeway
No cash baby I'm a cheapskate
Work a graveyard shift on the weekdays
Split my wallet and my heart in to three ways

A night robber stopped me on the freeway
No cash baby I'm a cheapskate

Split my wallet and my heart in to three ways

Got me working to the bone
That's when I show my truest colors though
