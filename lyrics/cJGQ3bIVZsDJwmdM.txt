There's never sunlight without you.
It never rises, my world's turned still.
hoo-ooh
With every blink looking for your face,
but you still
hide.
Now every song is about you.
Trapped in a second that I can't kill.
oo-ooh
Wish every night I could take your place,
but you still
hide.
Hope I find you
awake tonight.
When I'm dreaming
I can't hold onto you.
Never falling
asleep tonight.
'cause I fear
the dream will end too soon.
There's never sunlight without you.
It never rises, my world's turned still.
oo-ooh
In every whisper I hear your name,
but you still
hide.
Hope I find you
awake tonight.
When I'm dreaming
I can't hold on to you.
Never falling
asleep tonight
'cause I fear
the dream will end too soon.
Here lies a heart that time won't break,
and all
the distance won't take you from me.
Inside
the shadow of your grave,
but all
the gods refuse to speak to me.
Hope I find you
awake tonight.
When I'm dreaming
I can't hold on to you.
Never falling
asleep tonight
'cause I fear
the dream will end too soon.
Hope I find you
awake tonight.
When I'm dreaming
I can't hold on to you.
Never falling
asleep tonight
'cause I fear
the dream will end too soon.
