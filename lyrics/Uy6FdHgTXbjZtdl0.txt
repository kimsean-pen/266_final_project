Drown into these hands of fate
Without a sound and celebrate
Shinin' like the brightest skies
Cross your hearts and keep the faith
Look into the mirrorball
Loose everything and take it all
Sing hallelujah and encore
Forevermore

We run into the unknown
Far from what they call life
Somewhere must be another aim
One day we'll come together
Under a beautiful sign
Every dream is one night away

Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sacrifice the night
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Forevermore

Meet me beyond in the twilight
Million lifetimes ago
Then our imprisoned minds unfold
Night flight across endless meadows
Bonfires arrows and bows
We found us and it feels like home

Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sacrifice the night
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Forevermore

Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sacrifice the night
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Sing! - Hallelujah
Forevermore

Look into the mirrorball
Loose everything and take it all
Sing hallelujah and encore
Forevermore
