Daisy, always climbing up the same tree
Finding love in all the wrong scenes, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, always walking down the wrong streets
Starting fires out of dead weeds, Daisy, you got me

Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me

Daisy, always dancin to the same beat
Broken records stuck on repeat, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, don't you know that you're amazing?
Broken heart just keeps on breaking, Daisy
And I would take the light out of the stars to help you see
Anything to guide you straight to me

Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me

Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me

I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
