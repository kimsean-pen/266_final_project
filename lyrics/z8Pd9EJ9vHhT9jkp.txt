I was supposed to go back home
But that was until I got your call
I, rushed to party all night long
Tonight, I won't be alone

I'm gonna let you touch my body
Let you put your hands on my body
I'm getting freaking excited
Bout you and me
I'm gonna let you feel me baby
Let you make my heart go crazy
But i hope you know we're dreaming
Baby

Tonight, i'm gonna put my body on yours
Not gonna care of anything anymore
Yeah when I touch your body we
Burn the house down
Take the house
Vogue the house down low
