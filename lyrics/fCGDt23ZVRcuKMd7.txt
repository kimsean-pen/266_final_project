If you believe in dreams
and the trance-like state
that will come around,
when youre not awake,
then once in the sea of thoughts
I saw raging sharks,
biting bits into my camouflage.
Hey,
the lights are breaking
I see all the worlds go past,
I never stop!
O-oh! The lights are low,
turn the page, and let it go!
O-Oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
Melyse are you still awake?
Melyse are you still okay?
They told me to turn away
from a dead way
making my teeth fall out
in the strangest way.
I was the calmest one
in the dream that day,
with no teeth I had nothing to say.
Hey the lights are breaking,

O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
So when I woke,
I played a game
with all the promises you made.
But I don't see you in my dreams no more,
no more.
No, I don't see you in my dreams no more.
Hey the lights!. (Melyse you're not awake!)
They are. (Melyse youre not okay!)
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
O-oh! The lights are low!
Turn the page and let it go!
Hehehe
Melyse youre not awake
Hehehe
Melyse youre not okay
