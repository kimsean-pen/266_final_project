I like it better when you're not there babe
I feel you just a little bit better when you're not near me
Boy I just want you to call me
When I be feeling lonely
But I prefer it when you're not there babe

I guess distance makes my heart grow fonder
Sorry I can't be no closer
We did so much better in my mind (My mind)
And I know that you're just temporary
Standing in for others since he
Sorry if I'm wasting your time

You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction
You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction

I know guys like you are hard to find (Mm-hmm)
But I ain't feeling you I don't know why
My friends all think I'm crazy
'Cause you'll be so good to me
But I can't bring myself to call you mine

I guess distance makes my heart grow fonder
Sorry I can't be no closer
We did so much better in my mind (My mind)
And I know that you're just temporary
Standing in for others since he
Sorry if I'm wasting your time

You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction
You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction (Whoa, yeah)

You call me and you say you're confused
Find it hard to wrap your head round the truth
You're listing out all of the things that you do
But it won't last, no baby it won't last

You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction
You're just a distraction
Just a superficial attraction (Whoa, yeah)
