There was a little boy
Too different to belong
Too lonely to be strong
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)
Laying on the ground
He said that falling down
It wouldn't make a sound
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)

So now I'm gonna show ya
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)
So now you're gonna know, yeah
Why I'm gonna shine
Why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin', I'm On Fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
(I'm burnin' in a new way)
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'

There was a little girl
From a broken family
With a silent fantasy
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)
Her head was in the sky
Heart was made of stars
Her skin was made of scars
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)

So now I'm gonna show ya
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
(On Fire, On Fire, oh)
So now you're gonna know, yeah
Why I'm gonna shine
Why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
(I'm burnin' in a new way)
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'

Oh, I'm burning, I'm On Fire
Oh, I'm burning
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I'm burnin', I'm On Fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
(I'm burnin' in a new way)
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'

I'm burnin', On Fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore
Don't need your oxygen
(I'm burnin' in a new way)
Here I am, taming the flames
Not afraid anymore
Strong like a warrior

And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare

I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', –in' –in'
