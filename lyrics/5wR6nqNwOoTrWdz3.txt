So come down and see what you've repressed
For every error there's a blessing within
Yet some people think its funny to dilute and berate
While you keep missing the point, mine will only get sharper

This is ascension
This is regression
This is all that you were programmed to be afraid of
Reformat and take another good look
At the beauty underneath the disease
Let the rest roll off
