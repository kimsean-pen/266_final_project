Everybody wants to know
If we fucked on the bathroom sink
How your hands felt in my hair
If we were high on amphetamines

And everybody wants to hear
How we chain-smoked until three
How you laughed when you said my name
And how you gripped my hips so mean

We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time
No no no
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night

But the ending is the same every damn time
They think I'm insane
They think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything

Anything
And I'm gonna write it all down
And I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
That's the beauty of a secret

You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oooh
That's the beauty of a secret

You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
Everybody's waiting up

To hear if I dare speak your name
Or put it deep beneath the track
Like the hole you left in me
And everybody wants to know

About how it felt to hear you scream
They know you walk like you're a god
They can't believe I made you weak
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time
No no no

We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time
They think I'm insane
They think my lover is strange

But I don't have to fucking tell them anything
Anything
And I'm gonna write it all down
And I'm gonna sing it on stage

But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oooh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
These days I can't seem
To get along with anyone
Get by with anyone
These days I can't seem
To make this right
Well is this fine?
Will you be alright?
They think I'm insane
They think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything
Anything
And I'm gonna write it all down
And I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oooh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything
Anything
