I can feel the heat of the light on my face
As I'm walking away from you
I can feel the beat of the night in my chest
I feel like I'm a galaxy away from you
I am losing myself, talking to myself in the dark

When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart

You make my heavy metal heartbeat beat oh oh
Oh yea my heavy metal heart heart heart oh oh
Oh yea, you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heartbeat oh oh oh
Of my heavy metal heart

I can see a fish in that smudge, you'll be mine
Slowly turning away from you
I can see it all standing outside of time
Yea, there's only one thing for me, love to lose
I am losing myself, talking to myself in the dark

When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart

You make my heavy metal heartbeat beat oh oh
Oh yea my heavy metal heart heart heart oh oh
Oh yea, you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heartbeat oh oh oh
Of my heavy metal heart

You turn around to your bike
I'm never coming back
The way I was before
I'm not her anymore
Anymore
Anymore

You make my heavy metal heart beat
My heavy metal heart
You make my heavy metal heart beat
My heavy metal heart
You're my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
You're my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
