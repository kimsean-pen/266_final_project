Disillusioned, pure confusion
Where I'm rolling, never, never knowing
Walkin' minefields, all is surreal
Where I'm rolling, never, never knowing

Walked out of my mind
Don't wanna find whatever's left

Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze
Smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk, completely gone
My world is here to stay

Ain't no silence, constant violence
Where I'm rolling, never, never knowing
Demolition, crucifixion
Where I'm rolling, never, never knowing

Walked out of my mind
Don't wanna find whatever's left

Stoned and drunk completely gone
My world is here to stay
Hide my fears and kill my doubts
Whatever's in my way

Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze
Smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk completely gone
My world is here to stay

Walked out of my mind
Don't wanna find whatever's left

Stoned and drunk completely gone
My world is here to stay
Hide my fears and kill my doubts
Whatever's in my way

Poppin' pills and drinkin' booze
Smokin' everyday
Stoned and drunk completely gone
My world is here to stay.
