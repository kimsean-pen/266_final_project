what we do
for our kids
and we don't know who
or what it is
what we do
for our own love
what if
what if
what is
what if
i'd be down
to break my fall
using
my guitar
someone on
the subway pole
forgets, the term style
so
last minute
oh oh oh
to be in it
when you're young
you're too young
when you're old
you're too old
too few ideas
or too many
i'm reminded
of a dance party
when you walk
into the rest stop
you got me feeling so clean
