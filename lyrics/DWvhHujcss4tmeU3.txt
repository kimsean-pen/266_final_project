Hope you are, hope you are who you say
If you aren't who I thought
It'll break my heart

Hate to ramble on about it
I am not too proud about it
I've been on the run, I've been tryna ride around it
I've been tryna go around it
It's too much, I am astounded
Wow
You're too good to be worth a shot
What are you not saying that I should know?
'Cause I should know
If you're for sure or all for show

Don't play with my love, messing with my heart
That's gonna be tough for you to pull off
Gave me a new start, taking it too far
It's gonna be hard if you really aren't
Who you say that you are

Hope you are who you say you are
Hope you are who you say, you are the one
If you aren't who I thought
It would break my heart
Hope you are who you say you are
Hope you are who you say, you are the one
If you aren't who I thought
It would break my heart

Caught me slipping, I was tripping and I almost gave up
Now I'm living in your vision, I don't wanna wake up
From a dream lover, I'ma lean on ya
Please don't lead me on
You know I don't play that
How I'm living, I don't want no playback
From a past lover, bad lover
Please don't do me wrong

Don't play with my love, messing with my heart
That's gonna be hard for you to pull off
Gave me a new start, taking it too far
It's gonna be hard if you really aren't
Who you say that you are

Hope you are who you say you are
Hope you are who you say, you are the one
If you aren't who I thought
It would break my heart
Hope you are who you say you are
Hope you are who you say, you are the one
If you aren't who I thought
It would break my heart

Break my heart, don't break my heart
I pray to God, don't break my heart
Don't break my heart, it's all I got
I swear to God if you break my heart

Tell me that it's something special
Tell me you never felt it
Tell me I'm your new obsession
Tell me that you really are the one
If you aren't who I thought
It would break my heart
