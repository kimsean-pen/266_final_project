Tell me, are you just pretending to care?
I bet your fingertips have never felt so bare
Answer the question; I've only been fighting fair

And I know that you're listening now
I felt the earth shift like your eyes to the ground
Best of luck with digging up with those funny new hands you found

'Cause the skies of mine are clear
And for that I'm forever in your debt, my dear friends
I'm coming back to life again
Resuscitation of the year

Oh, you will never see me again (You will never see me again)
No, you will never see the me that you knew again
But if your gaze does catch a glimpse, there's something to understand

You'll be faced with the flesh you knew
But the blood and the mind of a betrayed soul
I know this feeling is cold, so desperate and hollow
Get used to it

'Cause the skies of mine are clear
And for that I'm forever in your debt, my dear friends
I'm coming back to life again
Resuscitation of the year

Excuse me
I'm new to misery
If I could only catch my breath and shake off this sudden death

'Cause the skies of mine are clear
And for that I'm forever in your debt, my dear friends
I'm coming back to life again
Resuscitation of the year
