In the house made of the dawn
In the house made of the evening twilight
In the house made of the dark cloud

Where the zig-zag lightning stands high on top
Where the he-rain stands high on top
O, male divinity

With your moccasins of dark cloud, come to us!
With your leggings of dark cloud, come to us!
With your shirt of dark cloud, come to us!
With your head-dress of dark cloud, come to us!

With the zig-zag lightning flung over your head, come to us, soaring!
With the rainbow flung over your head, come to us, soaring!
With the zig-zag lightning flung high on the ends of your wings, come to us, soaring!
With the rainbow hanging high on the ends of your wings, come to us, soaring!

I have made your sacrifice,
I have prepared a smoke for you.
My feet restore for me,
My legs restore for me,
My body restore for me,
My mind restore for me,
My voice restore for me.

Today take away your spell from me,
Today take away your spell from me.
Far off from me it is taken!
Far off from me you have done it!
Happily my interior becomes cool,
Happily my eyes regain their power,
Happily my head becomes cool,
Happily my legs regain their power,
Happily I hear again!
Happily the spell is taken off
Happily may I walk

In beauty, I can walk
In beauty, I can walk
In beauty, it is finished
In beauty, it is finished.
