You got me going in circles
You were using words, and they got no purpose
And you don't say what you don't say
And you're saving me no time
You're just a contradiction
Never saying anything with conviction
And we don't say what we want to say
And it's the same thing every time

You think everything sucks
I really couldn't give two fucks
And why do you rely on luck
When it don't really work like that?
And man, do I wish it did
Imagine me throwing a fit
I can't because you're being cryptic
And I can't really work like

'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to anything you throw at me
'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to everything you want from me

You got me singing in verses
I can be alone when I've got no service
And in some way, it's okay
When we're working overtime
You don't wanna cause friction
We can all agree that we've got ambition
And in some way, would you say
It can be so hard to define?

You think everything sucks
I really couldn't give two fucks
And why do you rely on luck
When it don't really work like that?
And man, do I wish it did
Imagine me throwing a fit
I can't because you're being cryptic
And I can't really work like

'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to anything you throw at me
'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to everything you want from me

You think everything sucks
I really couldn't give two fucks
You think everything sucks
I really couldn't give two fucks
And why do you rely on luck
When it don't really work like that?

'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to anything you throw at me
'Cause I'm so heartbroken
I'm sick of being so open to everything you want from me

Everything sucks
Everything sucks, I know
Well, everything sucks
Everything sucks, I know
Well, everything sucks
Everything sucks, I know
