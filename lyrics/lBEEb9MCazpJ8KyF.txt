Something rolled sweet
At Tirol we'll meet
We'll then kick it and fool
You say I don't know what to think, I think that that's cool
I think that that's cool
Blushing you're sweet
Give it a chance and we'll meet
But today you're cruel
I don't know what to think you'll be missing out my life's not for you
I think that that's cool
