How long will it take?
Have I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the Blue Line
Take a bus from the station
And I'll meet you out there
Get a drink, if that's alright

Don't care what we do
'Cause the night is ours
As long as we do
What we're doing for hours
How long will it take?
Have I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the Blue Line

I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I
I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I

I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Red, amber, I lose
And I hope that you gonna get there soon
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you

It's cold outside
I've been waiting for an hour
But it's feeling like forever
I put my best dress on
With a low-cut top
Guess I should have worn a sweater

And every passing car leaves me wondering
Did you read me wrong?
What's happening?
Did the driver say:
"Go the other way
And look for something better"?

I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Red, amber, I lose
And I hope that you gonna get there soon
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you

I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I
I could wait all night, -ight, -ight, I
I could wait all night
I could wait all night

I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Red, amber, I lose
And I hope that you gonna get there soon
I hope that the traffic lights don't change
Keeping me away from you
