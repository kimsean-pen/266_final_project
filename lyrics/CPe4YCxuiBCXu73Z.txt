James don't forget yourself when you're across the water
Those sirens sing songs of love do they know what you're made of
cause it might not be across the water now

Be sure to pack a good alarm to pick you up in the
morning to turn your head to things that may go wrong and
though the arms of a lover can be so comforting
We all need a little warning, sometimes. James

Now love I have seen you wear pulled over your eyes
thorugh a small tear I have seen my best friend crying
5000 miles you wish to roam and there you'll build a new
home under the hot sun but it is what your burning for now

Nobody wants to live alone,
We all know it's better to share than to own
And though the arms of a lover can be so comforting,
we all need a little warning

Nobody wants to live alone
We all know it's better to share than to own
And though the arms of a lover can be so comforting,
we all need a little warning

Sometimes... James
