From the beginning I knew I was different
I embraced it, but you didn't
Your normal life, 9-5
it's just not for me, I need to feel alive.
I won't fall like the rest of them.
They've come and gone with the wind.
I hear the doubt in the back of your mind but still I'll see this through to the end.
Maybe if you paid more attention
asked more questions and actually listened
you would see this is not just a dream
but a path I've chosen that means everything to me.

Don't you see the minds that have changed?
Don't you see the lives that have been saved?
Don't you care to see the difference I've made?
Listen closely
the hallways call my name.
Don't you see this is my everything?
(My everything)
It may not seem right to you and you might not approve but it's real.
So this is the only thing that makes me feel.

What more do I have to do
to finally prove myself to you?
What is it that you need to see
to finally believe this is who I'm supposed to be?
Most days I feel like your punching bag
but I will never let it hold me back.
I just wish for once
you knew how it felt to be brought down lower than everything else.

Don't you care to see the difference I've made?

Listen closely
the hallways call my name.
Don't you see this is my everything?
(My everything)
It may not seem right to you and you might not approve but it's real.
So this is the only thing that makes me feel.

THIS
IS
WHO
I
AM!
THIS IS
MY LIFE
I come alive in the lights!
I come alive in the li-
i
i, -igh
i, -igh, -ight
OH!

What will be written on your tombstone?
You sat behind a desk. You had no backbone.
What will be written on your tombstone?
You sold your soul, grew old alone.
Would you prefer that I become a lifeless
hollow shell
Such as yourself?
Would you prefer that I give up my dreams
and lose all hope just like everyone else?

Don't you see the lives...
that have been saved?
Listen closely, the hallways call my name.
Don't you see this is my everything?
(My everything)
It may not seem right to you and you might not approve but it's real.
So this is the only thing that makes me feel.
