Yo, I got dis ting from London
West London Chelsea, near King's Road
She don't care bout' ma area code
She's about like she aint aware of the road and
I know twins from Essex
But one of them wants me bad I might dead it
I don't wife these tings i'll stress it
Undress it I go in when I press it
Melina from brums Algerian
She's got bare problems I aint hearin em
She said baby my features are yours and I swear to God you won't catch me sharing em
Shouts to the girls round the UK peng, L, peng, Yasmin peng
Do a show with with ma [?] you might see me again
Ma last ting don't miss me
Cos she hates tracksuits they're shifty
I said I wear them cos I do road on ma nike 5's to imports 250
I got a posh bad ting in the Uni
Hollywood like she star in a movie
Her dad's rich so she's coated in diamonds eyes are emeralds and her lipstick's ruby
Ma close friend, I tryna mash dat
But she's a blue foot with da fatbacks
LV from her feet to her handbag
But I ain't that so a nigga wa hangback
All ma ex tings still hate me
Like work in a love don't pay me hold tight Jess and Chelsea they're real, still think Kate's buff but I don't like Kaylie
Someone tell Lotte I'm a wife gat
Tell her bring her bags round my gaf
Got the game tapped like a iPad
Fly in fly out when I like fam
Sheyshayan and Tina all fluffy
Faces clean but their mind mind so dutty
Man are gonna catch me a ducky
Arched her back and give them stick brukky
Girl likes the way that I'm rhyming
Try scratch up ma back when I'm hyping
Poom poom fresh up and wet when I'm sliding
Rate that she's back when her riding
I go from right hinge to pedigree
Doggy that when I'm pissed of the hennesy
She's always cloud 9 from her lemonny
Check dat rarely she got too much energy
Relationships all get sticky
I need a cute ting like Vicky
I was down south with ma blood line ext I link da hunnies and the motive got sticky
I got a peng ting and she's from tottenham
True say that the ting lives in tottenham
