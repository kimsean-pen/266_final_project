You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Hearts go astray
Leaving hurt when they go
You went away
Just when I needed you so

Finding your way
You'll come back wanting me
I'm gonna stay
Loving you endlessly

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, there's no need to hide
Never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Look in my eyes
See my love burning strong
No more goodbyes
In your arms I belong

Our time has come
All my dreams have come true
Two hearts as one
Loving me, loving you

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, there's no need to hide
Never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love
You are my everlasting
You are my everlasting love

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, there's no need to hide
Never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, there's no need to hide
Never be denied, everlasting love
