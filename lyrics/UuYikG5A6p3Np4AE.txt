I can't believe you've got the nerve
To say you love me and you left me for dead
I don't love you anymore
I hope you're happy
Since I don't know you anymore
You were a part of me
And now you're just nothing but a memory

No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space

Now I'm just like the pictures that you take
I'm nothing but something that once was
Like colors that fade away in the sunlight
They're nothing special like they used to be
They're gone and they're never coming back
No, they're never coming back
They're gone and they're never coming back

No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space

I woke up today and realized that what we had is dead
I'm just a pile of lifeless bones to you
I've spent too many years
Thinking about somebody that doesn't even think about me

No matter how bad I want you in my bed
I know that you found somebody else to be there for you
I'll keep sleeping sideways in my empty bed
To fill up the lonely space
I'm just a kid with too much lonely space
