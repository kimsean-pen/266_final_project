I was so young
Had so much to feel
At the cherry tree
I loved to breathe beneath
This air is so sweet
The violet steam
Treasured in crystal
To keep time away

Viscid like honey
The vanished days
Like liquid gold
Dripping into my heart
Blearily drinking
The purple bliss
To turn back time
To feel this again
