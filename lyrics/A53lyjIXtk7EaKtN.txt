It's electric how my lipstick
Makes its own way right into your kiss and
It's pathetic how we both get kind of fucked up
Hangin' on each other

We're ahead now
Should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

Uh huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wantin' it the most, like

Uh huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill, like

Uh huh (uh huh)
Uh huh (uh huh)
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill

It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'

We're in deep now
Should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

'Cause I'm gettin' some kind of shake without you

Uh huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wantin' it the most, like

Uh huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill, like

Uh huh (uh huh)
Uh huh (uh huh)
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill, like

Uh huh (uh huh)
Uh huh (uh huh)
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill

Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill

It's rare when the panic in my mind feels so damn good
Woo!

Uh huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wantin' it the most, like

Uh huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill, like

Uh huh (uh huh)
Uh huh (uh huh)
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill, like

Uh huh (uh huh)
Uh huh (uh huh)
But I know it's my emotions goin' in for the kill

Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill

Uh huh
