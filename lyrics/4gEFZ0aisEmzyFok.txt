Tana, Tana, Tana
Aye, Woah

They be talking, talking, talking
Say I'm fake, say I've changed
But I'm still the same bitch
Just no more minimum wage
Taking downers, you ain't working
And you tweaked
I'm an upper, I been working
All week
Came from the Prius
But I'm in Suburbans
These hoes are so basic
I'm buying at Urban
When they shop at Urban
They think that they splurging
Bitch I can't drive but I'm in the row swerving
You been in LA, but your parents ain't knowing
Get to the cake, like my birthday this morning
Bitch is so plain, like when is you boarding
Bitch I'm your daddy like take me on Maury (Daddy)

I'm taking W's
I'm taking W's
Sorry for your loss
I'm taking W's
I'm at the W
I'm making double you
Sorry for your loss
I'll take your dub from you

Jump on this beat act different
Uber outside wait a minute
Your whole team seem different
My whole team they filthy rich
Brand new Gucci I don't even wear
Your head ass can't walk in here
Living in a dream, no nightmares
I don't give a fuck, life's unfair
These hoes suck your dick for a retweet
Bitch I'm your dad, I'm a deadbeat
Hop on the track, it's a dead beat
Your bitch buy tickets to my meet and greet

I'm taking W's
I'm taking W's
Sorry for your loss
I'm taking W's
I'm at the W
I'm making double you
Sorry for your loss
I'll take your dub from you
I'm taking W's
I'm taking W's
Sorry for your loss
I'm taking W's
I'm at the W
I'm making double you
Sorry for your loss
I'll take your dub from you

Sorry for your loss
I'll take your dub from you
