This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do
I don't know where to turn
If I can't turn to you, no
Cause I made enough mistakes
To last us both a lifetime
And it'll take that long to realise
That you're not mine

Cause it seems like now
I've got a lot to be okay with
We never got to say we made it
My favourite colours gone and faded
Makes me wonder, did we waste it

But you don't owe me anything
Don't hear me out, I'll just sing
If you don't wanna know
I understand, but just know
Oh, that you don't owe me anything
Don't listen to me, the words just sting
If you want me to go
I understand, but just know, oh

This is what it feels like to lie
And you're missed
And though you ripped the heart of
Someone you loved out of your chest
Oh, no
And I guess that this is how it feels
When you got nothing left
And you could have done something
But you gave up instead,
Oh, no

Well it seems like now
I've got a lot to be okay with
We never got to say we made it
My favourite colours gone and faded
Makes me wonder, did we waste it

But you don't owe me anything
Don't hear me out, I'll just sing
If you don't wanna know
I understand, but just know
No, that you don't owe me anything
Don't listen to me, the words just sting
If you want me to go
I understand, but just know

Don't hear me out, I'll just sing
If you don't wanna know
I understand, but just know
That you don't owe me anything
Don't hear me out, I'll just sing
If you don't wanna know
I understand, but just know
No, that you don't owe me anything
Don't listen to me, the words just sting
If you want me to go
I understand, but just know
