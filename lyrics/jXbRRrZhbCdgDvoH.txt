Overbearing panic attack
Entrenching my veins
In an hour i'll be ok
I pray this pain will go away
Permanently someday
I've seen more than
I should have to
I've seen this on my own

This song is a
Poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire
Break the glass and
Move on into your own
Your own.

Reoccurring drowning effect
Entrenching my brain
I hope you'll be ok someday
So I can say that you
Moved on in the right way
We've seen this and
We've breathed this and
We've lived this on our own

This song is a
Poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire
Break the glass and
Move on into your own

This song is a
Poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire
Break the glass and
Move on into your own
Your own.

Break!

This song is a
Poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire
Break the glass and
Move on into your own

This song is a
Poem to myself
It helps me to live
In case of fire
Break the glass and
Move on into your own
Your own
Your own
Your own!
