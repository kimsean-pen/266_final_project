Don't wanna live in that room
When I think about today
I know our lives will be fast
And have a lot of ways to prove
I see a brunch of fun in your room
Like something special waiting for you
And thinking about this game
Every fear and every place
All words always sound the same
In my ear and makes me insane

Don't wanna prove me inside
All the things sound the same
Everything inside
Everything in my mind
What I have to sell again

And living the years
Thinking about the tears
Of a past that's far away
