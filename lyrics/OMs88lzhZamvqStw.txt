Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind...
And I've kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger, or wink you eye,
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings,
And there's nothing that I can do
I can't help myself,
I love you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love 'ya see
Wanna tell you I don't love you,
Tell you that we're through
And I try...
But ev'ry time I see your face,
I get all choked up inside
When I call your name,
Boy, it starts to flame
Burning in my heart,
Tearing it all apart.
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide...
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
You know that I'm waiting for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugar Pie Honey Bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else
