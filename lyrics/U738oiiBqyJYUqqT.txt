I pressed my ear to your chest and heard something personal
A whisper that knew my name
Is this how your heart treats all strangers,
With love and affection?
Then I feel cold and empty

I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make this happen
No stone unturned
I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make something happen
No stone unturned

I held your hand while you were sleeping
The whole night you gripped to mine
A grip that begged me to stay
Is this how your limbs treat all strangers,
With love and affection?
Then I feel weak and empty

I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make this happen
No stone unturned
I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make something happen
No stone unturned

Strangers don't hide
The morning hunts you down
And there's nothing stranger than to love someone
Strangers don't hide
The morning hunts you down
And there's nothing stranger than to love someone

I heard the water beat on your skin a shower of discipline
As heavy as iron
And I imagined the hand that gripped mine
Now gripping the gaps in the tile
Just holding on tight

I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make this happen
No stone unturned
I've got a sense of urgency
I've gotta make something happen
No stone unturned

Strangers don't hide
The morning hunts you down
And there's nothing stranger than to love someone
Strangers don't hide
The morning hunts you down
And there's nothing stranger than to love someone

Strangers don't hide

Strangers don't hide
