Follow the lines, obey the rules
Don't loose yourself, don't be a fool
Life was an easy game to play

Call of the wild cried out for me
Promises of a life to be
Something I thought not meant for me

Nobody said it'd be easy
Nobody said it'd be this hard
Felt all my defences come down falling
Wanting and longing
So I chose to turn and walk away
But it was hurting all the way
Yes It was hurting all the way
