I'll die fighting,
Inside me there's a fire that burns
(whoa)
My life begins
And ends without the faith that we learn
(whoa)

Save me from the darkest places
Save me from myself

I'm a loaded gun
An only son
But I'm nobody's hero
I've come undone
I'm on the run
Yeah, I'm nobody's hero
Nobody's hero

To heal, your scars
I will give you everything I can
(whoa)
This war, of hearts
We will rise again and take a stand
(whoa)

I can lead you to salvation
Yet I am just a man

I'm a loaded gun,
An only son,
But I'm nobody's hero
I've come undone
I'm on the run
Yeah, I'm nobody's hero
Nobody's hero

(nobody's hero)

This martyr's cross gets too heavy to exist
(whoa)
And we feel the loss of the lives
I left to risk

(C'mon)

I'm a loaded gun
An only son
But I'm nobody's hero
I've come undone
I'm on the run
Yeah, I'm nobody's hero

I'm a loaded gun
An only son
And I'm nobody's hero
I've come undone
I'm on the run
Yeah, I'm nobody's hero
Nobody's hero

(nobody's hero)
I'm nobody's hero
