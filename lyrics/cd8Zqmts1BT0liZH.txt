Life was simple,
Roger was working 'round the clock to make a living,
No computers, none of that, he used his two hands,
Ignored the cold war
His wife would keep him warm,
On the weekends,
He'd load the car up with the kids and they'd go fishing,
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession,
Damn right he smiled a lot
They'd lay awake at night
So in love

It was a good good year
The kids were alright,
"Highway to Hell" beat out "Stayin' Alive",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
in 1979.
It was a good, good year.

In the morning,
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen,
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him
And he would hold her tight
When they were newlyweds
He'd say maybe
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready,
And they would dance so slow to "Just the Way You Are".

It was a good, good year
The kids were alright,
"Highway to Hell" beat out "Stayin' Alive",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love.
In 1979.
It was a good, good year.

All the decades and the years have passed,
Not every family is built to last,
No time can take away these memories
Remember when you said to me
That we'd be alright.

Oh oh ohhh
The kids were alright,
"Highway to Hell" beat out "Stayin' Alive",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
In 1979
It was a good, good year.

Oh oh ohhh
Disco couldn't survive
With the Dream Police and Rock N Roll High
Blondie brought out "Heart Of Glass"
And mom and dad bought their first house.
In 1979
It was a good, good year.
It was a good, good year.
