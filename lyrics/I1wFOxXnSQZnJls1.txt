Working from seven to eleven every night.
Really makes life a drag, I don't think that's right.
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah.

'Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling, how I love you, baby, I'm in love
with you, girl, little girl.
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah.

Everybody trying to tell me that you didn't mean me no good.
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you, let me tell you I really did the best I

could!
I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said It kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag...
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, no, no!
Since I've been loving you

I'm about to lose my worried mind.
Watch out!
Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them? Don't you hear them falling?

Don't you hear? Don't you hear them falling?
Do you remember mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more, yeah.
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam.
You know, I must have one of them new fangled, new fangled back door man.
I've been working from seven, seven, seven, to eleven every night and It kinda makes
my life a drag...
A drag, drag, oh yeah, it makes a drag!
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about lose, lose, my worried mind.
Just one more, just one more.
Oh yeah!
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind.
