Behind your eyes, dark clouds are formin'
I see his memory rollin' in
He let you down, he left you broken
So afraid to love again
It ain't easy, girl, I know
But you've gotta let him go
Let the tears come crashin' down
You and I will ride it out
All I wanna do is shelter you
Let the rivers rise and rage
When his memory's washed away
I will remain after the rain
After the rain
Take my hand, take forever
I'll still be here with love to give
Lay your head here on my shoulder
There's no need for us to rush in
The mornin' sun is gonna rise
But, pretty baby, for tonight
Let the tears come crashin' down
You and I will ride it out
All I wanna do is shelter you
Let the rivers rise and rage
When his memory's washed away
I will remain after the rain
Let the tears come crashin' down
You and I will ride it out
All I'm gonna do is shelter you
Let the rivers rise and rage
When his memory's washed away
I will remain, I will remain
After the rain, after the rain, after the rain
I'll be standing there by you
After the rain
I'll be standing there by you
After the rain, after the rain
