Over!
It must be over right now...
Nightmare!
This nightmare has just begun!

Two eagles are cruising around over my land.
Two eagles are trying to break a branch they've already bent
Two martial birds hunting each other
Two pairs of wings try to bring a brother up against his brother.

The moment when I could hug my friend
It is forever lost
And now they want us to pay the cost
And now they want us to pay the cost!

When two empires collide!

The day "war" was just a word is gone
The time when peace was just a children's song is gone.
We never believed terror would ever burst into our home
That was just an image on someone's wall

The minute when I could hug my brother is forever lost
I wonder if our blood is enough to pay the cost!
It's enough to pay the cost!

The moment when I could hug my friend
It is forever lost
And now they want us to pay the cost
And now they want us to pay the cost!

The moment when I could hug my friend
I hope it's still not lost!
When they want us to pay the cost
We refuse to pay the cost!

I call to cut the strings!
I urge to fold down your wings!
We call you out to free us from your strings!
We urge to lay and fold down your wings!

When two empires collide!
