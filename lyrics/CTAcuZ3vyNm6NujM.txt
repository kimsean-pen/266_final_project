Call in the social
Call in the mediation
How else can a shadow
Behind her not follow

Call on the lonely
A plea for you to befriend her
Makes only you feel better
Make only you

Nothing outside will care enough
Nothing outside will care enough
Nothing outside will care enough
Nothing outside of you

This trail that you're treading
Is one flicked switch awaiting many
The coils, the echoes rattling
I hope the fears are buried beneath my love

My love, love is the everchanging spectrum of a lie
A lie, a lie to hide behind when nothings right
You take form with ink and blood
Can't you see I'm good?

Nothing outside will care enough
Nothing outside will care enough
Nothing outside of you

The dangers of showing
The dangers of showing
The dangers of showing
The dangers of showing
The dangers of showing
Any kind of weakness
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

The dangers of showing
The dangers of showing
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh, just to forget you're born
Just to forget you're born
Just to forget you're born
Just to forget you're born
Just to forget you're born
Just to forget you're born

Nothing outside
Nothing outside
Nothing outside
