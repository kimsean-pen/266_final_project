He says that he can read my mind,
the power to turn iron into gold
She says she's seen the other side
And knows the place the fire burns all night

There is an answer to the question,
so long ago down below
It's a hard real life, every day
Once you have it, it never goes away

CORO:
It's in the pocket,
when you're really, really lucky
when your fantasy
becomes reality,
living inside your imagination
It's in the pocket,
when you're really, really lucky
when your fantasy
becomes reality,
living inside your imagination

Your magic of the secret door,
I can take you down and show you more
It's easy, once you know the way,
it's farther than the closest thing you are

You've got to walk right through that fire,
it will not burn you
and the once you may love,
only life, won't make it or just burn away

CORO:

It's in the pocket,
when you're really, really lucky
when your fantasy
becomes reality,
living inside your imagination
It's in the pocket,
when you're really, really lucky
when your fantasy
becomes reality,
living inside your imagination

You've got to walk right through that fire,
it will not burn you
and the once you may love,
only life, won't make it or just burn away

Imagination,
Imagination,
Imagination,
Imagination.
