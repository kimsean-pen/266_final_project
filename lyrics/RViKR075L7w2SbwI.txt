If you meet Santa Clause tonight boy
You better run for your life

T'was the night before Christmas
Was just five years old
My parents were butchered
In the blistering cold
He seemed jolly at first
In his suit stained with red
He let out a laugh
But then left us for dead

That scene
So vicious
Taught me the meaning of Christmas
Punish the wicked
Don't ask for Santa's forgiveness

You will believe in me
Slaughtered under the tree
Don't believe a witness
So much for a Merry Christmas
Now Santa's claws are out
The sinners scream and shout
Made sure the noose is yule-tide tight
So much for a silent night
A silent night

T'was just three years later
Now orphaned and bruised
When the hands of the holy inflicted abuse
Tied down and lashed
Singled out from the pack
Took my season's beatings
Now it's time to give back

That scene
So vicious
Taught me the meaning of Christmas
Punish the wicked
Don't ask for Santa's forgiveness

You will believe in me
Slaughtered under the tree
Don't believe a witness
So much for a Merry Christmas
Now Santa's claws are out
The sinners scream and shout
Made sure the noose is yule-tide tight
So much for a silent night
A silent night

So now I'm slashing through the snow
And the hearse is on its way
With the mistletoe tags
Thank God it's Christmas day

I'm making my list
You're a slave to your vice
So I'm gonna find out who's naughty or nice
It's time to wreck the halls
Let nothing you dismay
Santa's taking out the trash
IT'S FUCKING GARBAGE DAY!
Taking out the trash
Garbage day is today
Taking out the trash
Garbage day is today

You will believe in me
Slaughtered under the tree
Don't believe a witness
So much for a Merry Christmas
Now Santa's claws are out
The sinners scream and shout
Made sure the noose is yule-tide tight
So much for a silent night
A silent night

Fa-la-la-la-la
Feliz navi-dead!
