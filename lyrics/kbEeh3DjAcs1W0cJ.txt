Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lil Tracy

I'm so luxurious (luxurious)
Them pearls on my neck got 'em furious (they mad)
Alex McQueens got these bitches lookin' curious
But I don't want none of these hoes' bacterias, yeah
I slowed down on them drugs, now I run it up (I run it up)
But my diamonds got no cuts, boy, they really bust (they bust down)
I don't shop at Saks Fifth 'cause everybody does
Chanel pearls on my neck from 1991, bitch (1991)

I'm a country boy, drip came from Italy (drip, drip)
I'm self-made, I don't depend on the industry (oh no)
I remember the first time I seen 10G's (10 racks)
Now I spend 400 dollars every time I eat
I still remember how I felt when I found out Gus died
I seen his mama cry and I swear that made me cry (hey)
They didn't give a fuck when we was sleepin' outside (hey)
Now I do a show, I got 'em waitin' outside (yeah, yeah)
I had to cut some people off just like my dreads (just like my dreads)
I don't trust these niggas,
don't trust these bitches,
don't trust the feds (don't trust the feds)
Only thing that's promised in this life is death (yeah)
I live life on the edge, but you know I watch my steps
Balenciaga jacket, don't spill shit on me (don't spill shit on me)
Can't play no games like I got a fuckin' injury (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, and I got soldiers with artillery (rah!)
Don't play around, like a chain, get bust down

I'm so luxurious
Them pearls on my neck got 'em furious (they mad)
Alex McQueens got these bitches lookin' curious (they curious)
But I don't want none of these hoes' bacterias, yeah (bacterias)
I slowed down on them drugs, now I run it up (I run it up)
But my diamonds got no cuts, boy, they really bust (they bust down)
I don't shop at Saks Fifth 'cause everybody does (okay)
Chanel pearls on my neck from 1991, bitch
