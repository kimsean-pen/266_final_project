This is how I'm spending six AM
Scraping ice off a windshield, freezing
I'm late to work again
Another double shift
I'm gonna pull my weight in this world cause it's all I have
I'm on to something
I can feel it
It's like you're drawing battles lines in your head
For a war that doesn't exist
And I don't want to fight in
It's not worth it
If you want me to go then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening
I can't get my footing steadied in all of this
I'm always ducking swings or looking over my shoulder
When I should be making progress
This is the shit that they don't teach you how to deal with
Like an army of self-righteous kids that only like the 7 inch
I'm putting miles between myself and this bullshit
If you want me to go then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening
If you want me to go then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening
'Cause I'm listening
I guess this is what it's like
The life of a pigeon
I know we're hard-pressed to find some common ground
But I won't let this world wipe me out
If you want me to go then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening
If you want me to go then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening
