Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises
Everywhere I go
Rebellion rises

Walks of life, let's stand together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system I protest
And we are its biggest threat
The plague of consciousness

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises

Jah call up on all people
To reject the principles of hate
And rebel against those doctrines
And the violence that they create
They say time changes everything
But we change times

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises

This is the age of awareness
Oh sooth my soul it's so restless
Turning the page to see what's next
And find us a way to pass this test
So I would a never treat you cruel
We just can't keep living by those rules
So come on people, don't be fooled

Walks of life, let's jam together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system we protest
And we are its biggest threat
The wave of consciousness

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)

(Rebellion rises) every city (the level is rising)
(Rebellion rises) every country (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
(Rebellion rises) and it grow and it grow
and it grow and it grow (the level is rising)
(Rebellion rises, the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
(Everywhere we go)
