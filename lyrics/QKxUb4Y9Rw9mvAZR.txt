Words are playing songs of the things
Claims to a piece of what you think is true
Like is an elephant in space
Trapped in a body turned in black and blue
Maybe with something
Your eyes could build the world you believe
Baby with nothing
Baby with you
I'm everything you need

Tell that I'm not just matter
Tell me that I matter to you
And if you're not my ever after,
Tell me what comes after you (Youuu)

Eyes are jealous when does the dreams
Reflexions of purpose on the galaxy
Endlessly chasing perfection
Live far in safety in the cemetry
I know something
So much more than you expected to be (to be)
I know what you thinkin'
But don't be afraid
Just say it all to me

Tell that I'm not just matter
Tell me that I matter to you
And if you're not my ever after,
Tell me what comes after you (Youuu)

Tell that I'm not just matter
Tell me that I matter to you
And if you're not my ever after,
Tell me what comes after you (Youuu)

You got nothing left to prove (you got nothing left to prove)
Stars are coming in to you (stars are coming in to youuuu)

Tell that I'm not just matter
Tell me that I matter to you
And if you're not my ever after,
Tell me what comes after you (Youuu)

Tell that I'm not just matter
Tell me that I matter to you
And if you're not my ever after,
Tell me what comes after you (Youuu)
