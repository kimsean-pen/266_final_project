There once was an answer out there I swear
Tied to a bottle I swear, I swear
And you can ask the Madonna if she cares, she cares
But she's hooked on the bottle I swear, I swear

You know you know it's the end of our sweet universe
You know you know that we blame it on ourselves

I wanted to laugh it off
And I want to forget that I got caught
And I wanted to laugh it off
Make a beast of myself just to kill them all

Lost in the lava, who cares, who cares?
The heats getting hotter I warned her she'd fail
The crisp white collar is on us and we want it
But I'm lost in the lava, I care, I care

You know you know it's the end of our sweet universe
You know you know that we blame it on ourselves

I wanted to laugh it off
And I want to forget that I got caught
And I wanted to laugh it off
Make a beast of myself just to kill them all

Cause it's harder than we first thought
I believe I believe you're the antidote
I believe I believe you're the antidote
If there's an answer out there it deserves to be caught
I believe I believe you're the antidote
I believe I believe you're the antidote
You know you know it's the end of our sweet universe
You know you know that we blame it on ourselves
I wanted to laugh it off
And I want to forget that I got caught
And I want you to laugh it off
Make a beast of myself, kill 'em all
