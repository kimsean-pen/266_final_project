Oh 1... 1, 2, 3, 4
I've got a sheet for my bed
and a pillow for my head
I've got a pencil full of lead
and some water for my throat
I've got buttons for my coat
and sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Now it's getting hotter
Oh it's only getting sweeter
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan
And some shoes on my feet
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly

And nothing's gonna bring me down
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
Food in my belly and a license for my telly

and nothing's going to bring me down

Nothing's gonna bring me down
But best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
But best of all (best of all)

I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine

And nothing's going to bring me down
Best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
Best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
Not today... no, no
