Life's uncertain, a rat-race of pain
Endlessly searching for more
Hopeless and aimless, held back by the chains
Until we can't take any more

Hold on, stay strong
Breaking out from the past life fading
No more, what for
All we got is to keep on praying

Wait for their downfall their lives in dismay
Witness the final decay
Suffering in silence for years we were blind
But, now we got something to say

Hold on, Stay strong
Till the end not afraid dying
No more, what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free under blue skies but time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of fire

Legions of darkness from beyond the grave
Spill their blood under the sun
Voices are calling with anger and rage
The final war now has begun

Hold on, stay strong
Till the end, not afraid dying
No more, what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free under blue skies but time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire
Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight

The pain will slowly fade away
The shadows of our lives
Will wash away the memories
Before the last sunrise
We'll keep holding on
In times of changes
Standing strong against the wind
Until the end of time

Hold on, stay strong
Till the end, not afraid dying
No more, what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free under blue skies but time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire
Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight
Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight
