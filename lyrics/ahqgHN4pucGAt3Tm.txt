Someone's thinking of her
A fifteen hour trip away
Life is so much slower
Than a charter trip delay
Tomorrow, she won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugar kiss
Tomorrow, heavenly no sorrow
She will lose gravity
Tomorrow
Someone's thinking of the her
Trough the hazy scenery
Life is blue as water
When you're missing somebody
Tomorrow, she won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugar kiss
Tomorrow, heavenly no sorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow
She won't feel half of this
Tomorrow morning is a sugar kiss
Tomorrow she will lose gravity, girl tomorrow
