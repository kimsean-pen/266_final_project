I kn-kn-know a girl
She gets what she wants all the time
'Cause she's fine
But for an angel, she's a hot, hot mess
Make you so blind
But you don't mind

'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, give-me-some-more girl, girl

She'll make you take her to the
club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the
floor, and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back

Sayin' yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

You kn-kn-know that if you don't shut your mouth
She'll freak out
You better get your shit together
'Cause she's bringing you down, now
Yeah, boy, you better, you better

'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, give-me-some-more girl, girl

She's got a wicked sense of humor, can't believe what she says
She drinks Bacardi in the morning till it goes to her head
And all you want is just to hold her, but she don't go for that
She has a hard time coming when she can't hit back

Sayin' yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

Every now and then she makes you just a little bit crazy
She'll turn the knife into your back and then she's calling you 'baby'
Crazy

She'll make you take her to the
club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the
floor, and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back

Sayin' yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
Yeah, and you want her
Yeah, you want her
Yeah, I know how you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)
