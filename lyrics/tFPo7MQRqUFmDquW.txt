And I heard
With every emphasis you put, on every word
With every lesson that you taught but never learned
With every bill you had to pay with money I had earned
Say you always felt the heat but never burned

In your nest
When you gather all your things to head out west
When you check if there's still something in your chest
Cause you think you really tried, you did your best
To convince yourself you're good before you rest

Face the sun, face the sun
Face the sun and fall
You'll be the one, be the one
Be the one, tomorrow
Please remember me, I was seventeen
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow

In your home (in your home)
Contemplating consequences all alone (all alone)
Where you think of jumping fences but you've grown
And the things you have, no you don't own
Held together like your wings they're on its own

Face the sun, face the sun
Face the sun and fall
You'll be the one, be the one
Be the one, tomorrow
Please remember me, I was seventeen
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow

Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck, oh!

Please remember me, I was seventeen
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck and follow
And follow

I was seventeen, I was seventeen
Break your neck, break your neck
Break your neck
