I'm gazing upward
A world I can't embrace
There's only thorns and splinters
Venom in my veins

Its okay to cry out
When it's driving you insane
But somehow, someday
I'll have the face the pain

Its all gone cold
But no one wants the blame
It's all so wrong
But who am I, who am I to say

I'm begging for forgiveness
Everything I've done
If God is listening
He knows I'm not the only one

Its okay to lash out
From the rules that I'm enslaved
But somehow, someday
I'll have to turn the page

Its all gone cold
And no one wants to change
Its all so wrong
But no one wants the pain

Its all gone cold
There's nothing left to gain
Its all so wrong
But who am I, who am I to say

(Guitar Solo)

My heart's an endless winter
Filled with rage
I'm looking forward to forgetting yesterday

It's all gone cold
And no one wants to change
It's all so wrong
But no one wants the blame
It's all gone cold
There's nothing left to gain
It's all so wrong
But who am I, who am I to say
To say, yeah
It's all gone cold
But who am I to say
It's all gone cold
But who am I, who am I to say
