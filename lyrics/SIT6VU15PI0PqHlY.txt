Got those heels on that you love
The ones that drive you crazy
Exactly what you're dreaming of
I'll give it to you, baby
150 miles away
Singing out my lungs
Driving fast all through L.A
Warming up my tongue

Heart's beating fast
When I'm turning the key
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

Before I think, I start to run
But you can't even face me
Know exactly what you've done
Know exactly, baby

Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can

Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me
