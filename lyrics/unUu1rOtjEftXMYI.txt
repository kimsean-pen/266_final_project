Take a walk
On a sunday mornin'
Have a talk
Be silent inside

Did you only want the shelter
What is turnin' round your mind

Loreen, Loreen
They are down on you
Could you ever find again
Just what you've been before
Loreen, Loreen
You're so down and blue
It's gettin' better every day
But you're about to lose your way

Take a walk
An' I tail behind you
Range your thoughts
Look over your life

An' I know what you're recitin'
What is turnin' roun' your mind

Loreen, Loreen
They are down on you
Could you ever find again
Just what you've been before
Loreen, Loreen
You're so down and blue
It's gettin' better every day
But you're about to lose your way

Loreen, Loreen
They are down on you
Could you ever find again
Just what you've been before
Loreen, Loreen
You're so down and blue
It's gettin' better every day
But you're about to lose your way
