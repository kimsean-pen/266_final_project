You're as cold as ice
you're willing to sacrifice our love
you never take advice
someday you'll pay the price, i know
I've seen it before
it happens all the time
closing the door
you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
yet throwing away
a fortune in feelings
but someday you'll pay
You're as cold as ice
you're willing to sacrifice our love
you want paradise
but someday you'll pay the price, i know
I've seen it before
it happens all the time
closing the door
you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
yet throwing away
a fortune in feelings
but someday you'll pay

you know that you are
(cold-cold) - (as-as) - (ice)
as cold as ice to me
(cold-cold-cold) - (as-as-as) - (ice)
you're as cold as ice
cold as ice i know
you're as cold as ice
cold as ice i know
oh, yes i know
you're as cold as ice
cold as ice i know
oh, yes i know
