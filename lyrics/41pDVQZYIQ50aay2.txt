I'm not the one to tell you that you're not the one
Just throw it out and take it back
Could be the drinks or history
But either way you get to me, I give you that

Got me up and down, but a lotta up without you
I said I wouldn't try another time, but I'm down right now
Feel the opposite about you
Didn't think I'd ever do, but I want you to

Ooh, pull me closer
And I changed my mind
Ooh, it ain't over
And I changed my mind
I wasn't really sure about us
But now I'm pretty sure about us
Ooh, pull me closer
'Cause I changed my mind

And I changed my mind
I changed my mind

There's nothing wrong with hanging out and catching up
But I know when you're next to me
I'm gonna fight myself and lose myself and find myself
Yeah, you have that effect on me

Got me up and down, but a lotta up without you
I said I'd never let myself rewind, but I'm down right now
Feel the opposite about you
Didn't think I'd ever do, but I want you to

Ooh, pull me closer
And I changed my mind
Ooh, it ain't over
And I changed my mind
I wasn't really sure about us
But now I'm pretty sure about us
Ooh, pull me closer
'Cause I changed my mind

And I changed my mind
I changed my mind

I said I wouldn't let myself rewind but I
I just needed to try another time 'cause I
I changed my mind
Ooh, pull me closer, yeah
Ooh, it ain't over

Ooh, pull me closer
And I changed my mind
Ooh, it ain't over
And I changed my mind

Pull me closer
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
