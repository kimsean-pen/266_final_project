Absentee
Completes me
Our vapid clouds depleted
I'm a stranger
In my mind

Oh lord
Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met
I would confide in myself, say that:
" Once you give her everything"
"She'll turn, and she'll die on you"
But time won't let me go

Never gonna make i ton your own
I'm never gonna make it 'cause
I cannot
I wanna second-guess but I take the fall

Never gonna make i ton your own
I'm never gonna make it 'cause
I cannot
But I never had feels like this before

Oh lord
Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met
I would confide in myself, say that:
" Once you give her everything"
"She'll turn, and she'll die on you"
But time won't let me go

Self-inflict
Your projected
I've seen what you deleted
Now I'm a stranger
In my mind

Oh lord
Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met
I would confide in myself, say that:
" Once you give her everything"
"She'll turn, and she'll die on you"
But time won't let me go

Never gonna make i ton your own
I'm never gonna make it 'cause
I cannot
I wanna second-guess but I take the fall

Never gonna make i ton your own
I'm never gonna make it 'cause
I cannot
But I never had feels like this before

Oh lord
Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met
I would confide in myself, say that:
" Once you give her everything"
"She'll turn, and she'll die on you"
But time won't let me go
