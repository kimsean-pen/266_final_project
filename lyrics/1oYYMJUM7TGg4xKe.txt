I got a faulty parachute I got a stranger's friend
An exciting change in my butcher's blend
A symbol on the ceiling with the flick of a switch
My newfound hero in the enemy's ditch

Well somebody's something was left in the room
And now that it's gone, well of course we assume
Somebody else needed something so bad
They took everything somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well it all, it all just seems to change

The mark was left, man, it's never the same
Next time that you shoot make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
Brand new night with the same old stars

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well it all, it all, just seems to change

Feed the fool a piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system, make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies and maybe he'll find
His place in heaven cause he might just die

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well it all, it all, just seems to change

Hanging on is easy
When you've got a friend to call
When nothing's making sense at all
You're not the only one who's afraid of change
