Tuck you in to sleep, cuddling your feet
Give you what you need
Just so you know
Ready now to start kissing every part of you

Just so you know
I'm giving something true
Giving something true, hold on
You taught me how to see the very best in me, who I aim to be

Just so you know
So perfect as you are I'll never be too far from you
Just so you know

I'm giving something true
I'm giving something true
I'm giving something

Familiar like the back of my hand
You got it all good
I know you, like the back of my hand
I'm all over you

Familiar like the back of my hand
You got it all good
I know you, like the back of my hand

I'm all over you
I'm giving something true
Giving something true
Giving something, do hold on
