My shallow heart
Will never let me love you
The way I want to
And that's for sure
I'll walk thousand miles
Because you told me to
Just to get close to you
I know
A lot of things
I could do to make you want me
But that's not real
That's just the game I play
I have thousand things
I could sell you
To make you love me
And the things I say

Not real when it comes to love
It's just an evil act
And baby if I'm giving you my heart
Just to give you my heart
Would you give it right back?

You never used to listen to the thing I said
Now that you wish you never did
How you playing with a soul like mine?
I guess you did it how you live

Not real when it comes to love
It's just an evil act
And baby if I'm giving you my heart
Just to give you my heart
Would you give it right back?

My shallow heart
Will never let me love you
The way I want to
And that's for sure
I'll walk thousand miles
Because you told me to
Just to get close to you
I know
A lot of things
I could do to make you want me
But that's not real
That's just the game I play
I have thousand things
I could sell you
To make you love me
And the things I say

Not real when it comes to love
It's just an evil act
And baby if I'm giving you my heart
Just to give you my heart
Would you give it right back?
