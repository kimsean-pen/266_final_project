I want my innocence back
And if you can't give it to me
I will cut you down
And I will run you through
With the dagger you sharpened
On my body and soul
Before you slit me in two
And then devoured me whole

I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back

I want my innocence back
And if you can't pacify me
I will break your bones
You think I'm bluffing, just try me
I will never forget

The words you used to ensnare me
Till my dying day
You'll suffer for this, I swear (I swear)

I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back

And I demand
You put my heart back in my hand
And wipe it clean
From the mess you made of me
And I require
You make me free from this desire
And when you leave
I'd better be the innocent
I used to be

I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
I want my innocence back
