Every concept...
Every nation has a counterpart.

Yet, every ideas' opposite...
It's just the absence of the idea itself.

Absence is the absence of presence...
But presence is the absence of absence.

Any perceived difference...
Is in fact also a deep connection.

In this way, opposing forces are unified.
The world becomes a collaborative web...
Of independent pieces.
