I know it's not exactly what you're looking for
but that doesn't mean that you can disregard
all of the things that you told me before
I think back to all the times I kissed your hands
and how I can't stand the touch of any other hands
you tell me I should quit well I think you should sit
right there and think about how your words make me feel

take me back to water breaks and burning insides
way back when we got high for the very first time
I try so hard not to show how much I like this
'cause I feel happy again

so take me back
I'll wait

I know it seems like I'm wasting my time away when things that still don't matter I don't care who can shotgun faster
but when the goat runs dry what's left behind is someone.
I don't mind I'm dying with
