Your vile sawed in half
Exudes a demigogic school
And your little bit of dropper down
It lows and reaches up...
And I pray, and I pray
And slowly rise upon my knees
And praise the little bit of dropper down
That hardens in me

I'm wishin I could feel but I know
I know it's bigger
Cuz I know even though my pride's growin'
I could fall
Take it through the eyes like men
Your scared of what could come
Cuz I know my only pain comes through the eye
Through the eye

Wishing that I could feel it but I know
You can take yours
Cuz I know it's a runaround like a chump
[inaudible gibberish]
