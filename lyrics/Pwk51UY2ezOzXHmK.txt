No life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking about it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
50 sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off it

I don't wanna look bad, get the fuck back
You look like my children, look like Rugrats
I just dropped some new shit, you should cop that
Rolling off some poison, now my eyes black
This not even out yet, fuck an outlet
I know where the snakes at, set the mouse trap
Blowing on the loud pack by the trash bags
Everyday I wake up, different houses
You look kinda suspect, I don't like that
20 on my left wrist, 'cause I swipe that
She know me from IG, I don't like back
I just need a Nike cap and a white mask
First I get your face scanned in my webcam
I just need a rope man and a hangman
Thaiboy pulled out ten bands, call the dopeman
100 on the smoke man, we the smoke gang

No life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking about it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
50 sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off it

No life left, eat the night, no stars out
I've been thinking about it
Bro came out with the knife, black sky cries
Bleeding rain down on me
50 sack in my Nikes, that's for one night
Spent my last cash on it
I'm no longer alive, play with my life
I am getting off it
