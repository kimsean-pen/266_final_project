Summer in San Francisco
Kissing chlorine in the swimming pool
Out of fuel at the Phoenix Motel
I slept alone again that night
In sweet dreams of Mother Ireland
and Father Albion

Sweet dream that you come near
And I see my future clear
And the threshold appears
And I am carrying you over
Carrying you over

You come near
I see my future clear
And the threshold appears
And I am carrying you over
Carrying you over

Into the hallway of our new home
Chaos outside but I've got your back
We've got our own paradise
And we are private worlds away from public eyes
I say I love you
More than my life
Truth completely

You come near
I see my future clear
And the threshold appears
And I am carrying you over
Carrying you over

You come near
I see my future clear
And the threshold appears
And I am carrying you over
Carrying me over
Into the best days
Of the rest of our lives

Into the future
Carrying you over
Carrying you over
Into the future
Carrying me over
