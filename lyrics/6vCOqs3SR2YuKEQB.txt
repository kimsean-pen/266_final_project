I saw you staring out of
Your own abyss again
Waiting for something you're not
Sure even still exists
Don't be afraid to wonder
Don't be afraid to be scared
It should never be a prison

So I apologise if you feel something
But love is all we have, feel something (I know)
Or if I steal something
Please, remember it was mine
Real something
