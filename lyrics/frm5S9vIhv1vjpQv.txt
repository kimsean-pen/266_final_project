Sometimes, I feel the enigmatic something from inside of my ribs.
It oozing from the center of my heart. It dissolved me as thin acid.
like salty, like sour, or It might be bitter. I have sour behind my eyes.
Painful. Painful. Someone help me from this agony.
But nobody can help me.

So I continue to resist it.
I have no choice but to do so
I continue to resist it until dirty little pottery is broken.

you'll get relief of pleasure soon.
You'll immediately released from its pain.

The feeling as to began to rot from the toes.
It's badly sad feeling but I don't know what.
severe pain is not there anymore.
But I'm very painful for some reason.
like salty, like sour, or It might be bitter. I have hard sour behind my ribs.
