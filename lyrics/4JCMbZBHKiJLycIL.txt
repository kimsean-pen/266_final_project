A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
It can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
In days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lovers sing
"I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
But home was a dream, one I'd never seen
'Til you came along

So girl, hang your dress up to dry
We ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
Carries this house on the stones like a piece of drift wood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
