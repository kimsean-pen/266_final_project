Found something crying, it was my soul
I fed it milk so it wouldn't grow old
We crossed the borderline at dawn
And woke up in a field of corn
The farmer told me I was late
I better start oiling the gate
Said that those who rush will fall
But I don't wanna wait for waves
I don't wanna wait at all

Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things
They're so cute
But our dreams are all we really need to know

Found something dying, it was my light
It had resigned itself to night
So I threw it out a fishing line
Said catch your reel and then catch mine

Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things
They're so cute
But in the end they're just a suit

Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Time's not on our side
Well it never was
We know that deep inside
Oh just look at you
With your ruffled hair
Oh I love you and that's all you need to know

Annie, Annie... (fade)
