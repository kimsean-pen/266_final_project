Björk
Wait for me underneath the water,
Wait for me I have to go now
Into the big city,
She pulls me firmly towards her.

Wait for me underneath the water,
Wait for me here,
You'll be fine underneath the water,
I'll be back early next summer.

Einar
We met again at the lake,
After all these years,
You said "want a drink?"

Björk
I love you,
And you know I will be back,
Hold your breath,
And nestle into the ice,
Wait for me underneath the water
Wait for me and count to ten,
You'll look up and I will be there
Wait for me.

Einar
The lake was frozen,
You took me for a walk over the ice,
I cracked, The ice cracked, I fell into the lake,
I watched you through the eyes.

Björk
Love into you, lover, i want you,
Wait for me underneath the water,
Wait for me and singalong,
"She's coming, coming, coming,"
Wait for me, I'm coming.

Einar
I watched you through the ice
I expected you to crawl for help
I smiled, you just stood there
I tried to kiss you through the ice,
You just walked away

Björk
Under frozen, over water, under, over
Frozen mountain...
Wait for me underneath the water
