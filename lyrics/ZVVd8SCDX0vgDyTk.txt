Liar, liar
You're such a great big liar
With the tallest tales
That I have ever heard

Fire, fire
You set my soul on fire
Laughing in the corner
As it burns

Right between the ribs
It's sinking in

Oh oh, the sirens sang so sweet
And watched the sailors going down
Oh oh, you talk to me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
Anyone would drown

Sick and tired
Of this mad desire
Fluttering inside me
Like a hawk

Wire, wire
You've got my hands on wires
Well, heaven help you
When I get them off

Right between the ribs
You'll feel it then

Oh oh, the sirens sang so sweet
And watched the sailors going down
Oh oh, you talk to me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
Anyone would drown

All the ships go down
Following the sound
All the ships go down

Oh oh, the sirens sang so sweet
And watched the sailors going down
Oh oh, you talk to me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown

Oh oh, the sirens sang so sweet
And watched the sailors going down
Oh oh, you talk to me in siren song
Yeah, anyone would drown
Anyone would drown
