this is my christmas list
even if it's six months 'til
smoking cigarettes
me and you, we both pretend

and even if I could wait for someone else, I know I could count on you
and even if I could wait for someone else, I know I could count on you
and even if I could wait for someone else, I know I could count on you
even if

all my friends, all my friends
are in my room, I pretend
all my friends, all my friends
are in my room, I pretend

even though we grew up since
we can play games just like we're ten
and the way we didn't care at all
if only these we're things I didn't want, I wouldn't care

and even if I could wait for someone else, I know I could count on you
and even if I could wait for someone else, I know I could count on you

all my friends, all my friends
are in my room, I pretend
all my friends, all my friends
are in my room, I pretend
my best friend, my best friend
is in my room, I pretend
