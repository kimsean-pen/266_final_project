You know it's funny, funny how time flies
As I watch days turn into years
You never know if it will last forever
You can only try to keep it new

Late around midnight
When you're holding me near
It feels so good to me
Feel like crying those tears

It's still a thrill
When you hold me
It's still a thrill
When you're loving me

Your passion, passion moves me
Like the ocean runs so deep
I'm walking in this mile for you
Just to get the things you do

Feels like the first time
When we met
Your charms still overwhelms me
Tell me, how can it be?

It's still a thrill
When you hold me
It's still a thrill
When you're loving me
