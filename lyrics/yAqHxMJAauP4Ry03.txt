Electric guitar gets run over
By a car on the highway
This is a crime against the state
This is the meaning of life

Tune this electric guitar
Tune this electric guitar
To tune this electric guitar
Tune this electric guitar

Electric guitar is brought in to a court of law
The judge and the jury
Twelve members of the jury
All listening to records
Is this is a crime against the state?
This is the verdict they reach

Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar
Never listen to electric guitar

Electric guitar is copied
The copy sounds better
Call this the law of justice
Call this freedom and liberty

I thought I perjure myself
Right in front of the jury
Is this a crime against the state?
No, this is the verdict they reach

Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitar
Someone controls electric guitar
