pull the bolt back
fire a full clip
into the ones, who own the guns
click off the safety
squeeze off a quick round
into the brother, who betrayed you

pull back the bolt
pull the pin
detonate the vest strapped to your waist
and take as many with you as you can

check you out on the runway
turn your good side to the camera
and read your manifesto to the world
lights, action, camera

pull back the bolt
pull back his bolt
