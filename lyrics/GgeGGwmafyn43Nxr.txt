Warriors fighting
A thrill made of iron and steel
Charging horses
It's a never ending wheel
Due to my orders
A Thousand lives are gone.
Screamin louder from the cliff
I feel as a Master Of Peace
But I can't face what I see what I feel
How to find my bliss?
Oh god I promised
We would go to war!

THE HILLS THE GRASS THE TREES
ARE SLOWLY TURNING RED
FOREVER
AND EVER
THESE FIELDS WILL TASTE OF OUR BLOOD.
FATHER FORGIVE ME CAUSE I HAVE NO REGRETS NO COMPLAINTS.

Fifty Thousand
Lost fallen souls
The Victory needs Sacrifice
And both of the armies
Have Lost their half or more
I can't pay the price
Oh god I promised
We would go to war!

THE HILLS THE GRASS THE TREES
ARE SLOWLY TURNING RED
FOREVER
AND EVER
THESE FIELDS WILL TASTE OF OUR BLOOD.
FATHER FORGIVE ME CAUSE I HAVE NO REGRETS NO COMPLAINTS.

All Victories have a price

THE HILLS THE GRASS THE TREES
ARE SLOWLY TURNING RED
FOREVER
AND EVER
THESE FIELDS WILL TASTE OF OUR BLOOD.
FATHER FORGIVE ME CAUSE I HAVE NO REGRETS NO COMPLAINTS.

I got no regrets
No more
Oh god
No more!
