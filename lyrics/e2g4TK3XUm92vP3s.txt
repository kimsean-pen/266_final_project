We made a joke about it long ago
Those thoughts are always on my mind,
You know
I used to try your number now and then
How have the colours all aligned again?

I wandered in and out of touch with you
Four photos taken of us when we moved
I can remember how we spent the days
Just hanging out under that ocean here,
It's clear
