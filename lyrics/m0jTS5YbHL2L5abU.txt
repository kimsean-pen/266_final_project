Broken mirror on the wall
You give no reflection of me at all
your wicked ways i won't understand intoxicating weaker men
Rusting scissors in the drawer pull me closer to a life no more
why am i so confused, unimpressed and unamused?

No, something's not right
Open your arms to the sky
focus the light

It's a combination of numbers
oh and a set of missing keys
I've been painting pictures but the colours disagree
and bad things come in threes

The wind is blowing
I am falling through a hurricane
as buildings tear up from the ground
No way of knowing where I'm going
circulating through the wildest night
give in to these sudden urges for more

Something's not right
open your arms to the sky
focus the light

I've been, I've been painting pictures
I can't, I just can't taste the freedom
I've been, I've been painting pictures

Stuck in a room full of voices
Oh with nobody to be seen
I can sense the danger as the colours now agree
and the picture is obscene

The wind is blowing
I am falling through a hurricane
as buildings tear up from the ground

I can't, I just can't taste the freedom
Ive been, I've been painting pictures
Tempted and enticed I neglected Eden
You know that I can't, I just can't taste the freedom

Give me forgiveness, total regression, remedy
Double the vision, triple the tension, trickery
Total division, given destruction, synergy
Double the vision now
Give me devotion, total remission, remedy
Double the vision, triple the tension, trickery
Total division, given destruction, synergy
Give me devotion now
Give me forgiveness, total regression, remedy
Double the vision, triple the tension, trickery
Total division, given destruction, synergy
Double the vision now
