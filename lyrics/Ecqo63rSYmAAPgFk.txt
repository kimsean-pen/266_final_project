Maybe you were joking when you said that you were walking out on me,
Maybe, maybe.
Maybe I was joking when I said that I was running out on you,
Maybe, maybe.
I could be wrong, so wrong.
I could be wrong, so wrong.

Oh, I could be wrong.
I don't know but it's been said,
Decisions travel far from heart to head,

Maybe, maybe.
Maybe it was over when you chucked me out the rover at full speed,
Maybe, maybe, oh, baby.
I could be wrong, so wrong.
I could be wrong, so wrong.
I could be wrong, so wrong.

Oh, I could be wrong, so wrong.
Ooh-eeeah!
I could be wrong, so wrong, (Oooo)

Oh, I could be wrong, so wrong, (Maybe, maybe)
I could be wrong, so wrong (Walking out on me)
I could be wrong, so wrong (I was running out on you)
I could be wrong, so wrong (Maybe maybe)
I could be wrong, so wrong
