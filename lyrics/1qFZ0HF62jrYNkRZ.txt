Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
We're shining, we're shining through the mud
Soon enough we'll see the sunlight
Rise up and finally breathe light
Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
Whoah, whoah

Right under their nose
With no sense of smell
Thinking we'll stay, stay, stay
Hidden in our shells
But we're, we're waiting for our time
We've been waiting for our time, yeah!
Whoah, whoah
We don't need fame, we don't need wealth
We use our passion as our medicine to bring us health
We'll get to the top, with or without
The poison that flows out of their mouth

Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
We're shining, we're shining through the mud
Soon enough we'll see the sunlight
Rise up and finally breathe light
Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
Whoah, whoah

Out of the shadows we saw the signs
The tables have turned now it's our time to shine
A little patience, it goes far
We've been dancing, in the dark, yeah!
A clear blue sky hides behind all the dark clouds

Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
We're shining, we're shining through the mud
Soon enough we'll see the sunlight
Rise up and finally breathe light
Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
Whoah, whoah

The shore that breaks the wave
The earth above the grave
There are some things that just don't change
Dream to stay awake and live another day
We try to learn from our mistakes

Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
We're shining, we're shining through the mud
Soon enough we'll see the sunlight
Rise up and finally breathe light
Like diamonds, like diamonds in the rough
Whoah, whoah
