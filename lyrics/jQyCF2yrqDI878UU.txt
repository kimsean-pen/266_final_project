Oh rain falls, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move, they're shaking all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes

When a woman cries

Fire burning through your brain
Turn to face the train
Hey, it's magic, said the mother to the child
It's stronger than a smile
Let it go

When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries

Just when you think it's pretend
Here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever
Maybe we'll still just never know

Oh rain falls, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move, shaking all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes

When a woman cries

Fire, magic, shaking all the earth
When a woman cries
Oh stars move, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, yeah
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
