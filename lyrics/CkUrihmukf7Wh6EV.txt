I'm sure that I'm fine but I heard there's a bath in a river of glass so I'll take it
I've always known that the smiles that were shown were plastic and hollow lines
and I'll be damned, your metaphor dollar-fed God got into my head

Hey now, plastics gather 'round now you're waitin' with your hands out for the blood flies to come and carry you home

doubt is a crime and I caught me at last running circles in rounded-off places
scanning for hope but these windows of gold play tricks on my eyes...

...why don't we pull apart, look inside the curtains of origins that imitate life
and where you are is where I'll be floating arms of azure seize
who will you inspire?
as I watch this world below, and the world I watch grows smaller and smaller
fear and love all collide and all at once
the piper plays green tearing the sleeves pulled up from the sea and thrown through the ceiling
stepping stones so carefully untouched
you'll only leave this world alone

strange that you think you can fly
strapped to a stone in a blinked needle's eye

I'll be damned, your all-time-low just lowered again
hey now plastics gather round now you're waitin' with your hands out, waitin' for the war flies,
waitin' for the blood flies to come and carry you home
