You let your hair down
Your face is made up
You know this town so well
You talk a lot, it's okay
Pretend that you look the same
A crowd of a different age
You wonder where it went
Home feels so far from home
Trying to fill a hole
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
A night at the chateau
It feels so far from home
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
Third quarter moon light
Rev of an engine
The rusty neon glow
Complain a lot, it's okay
The city just ain't the same
Shadow of a brighter day
You wonder where it went
Home feels so far from home
Trying to fill a hole
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
Night at the chateau
It feels so far from home
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
When you keep crawling
Time starts running by
No sight ahead, just behind you
You keep crawling, time starts running by
The fact is there's no one behind you
Home feels so far from home
Trying to fill a hole
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
Night at the chateau
It feels so far from home
Sunset in the rearview
Losing your control
