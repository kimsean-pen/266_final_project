Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep

Enter my chamber you never will leave
Festering bodies will cover the streets
Satanic prophecies, Christian hypocrisy
Bury me deep in the filth and disease
Open my mind and then hammer it closed
Into the darkness I'm strangled and choked
Tracing the patterns and numbers in smoke
Blood on my dagger from enemies throats
Crucify ghosts in a frozen abyss
Ocean of planets in total eclipse
Nowhere I wander wherever I drift
Using a razor to open my wrists
My body is vacant, my soul is enslaved
To a hatred as ancient as day and night
Ladder of Jacob, the devil awakened
In hell I'm created I pray tonight

Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep

Same wolf from that folklore
Drinking blood right out of that that goat horn
I'm post-mortem, these boys want war
I transport 'em, right to Hell
In a trance when I write the spell
Leave the blood on my hands cause I like the the smell
In the death business, you the clientele
Motherfuckers can't win cause I'm trying to fail
Flesh is the fabric that covers my robes
Blood is the matter that built up my throne
Nothing but shadows, I'm waiting alone
Deep in my coffin, I call it my home
Cowering and broken
I'm a victim of my evil deeds
But I don't need your sympathy
I'm comfortable in misery

Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep
Corrupted by the darkness, now you fall into an endless sleep

Part II

"Sure he's a gangsta on the corner, that's exactly what we wanted
Does he have some sort of social responsibility?
Should he change his style?"
"We are just the painting, we are the canvas, we are the artwork
When we look at in the broader scheme of things
When we realize that we are not our bodies
That the building in front of you is
nothing more than energy, just slowed down
When we also realize that we are not seeing everything as it is
Nothing is what it seems at all,
a lot of the times this is liberating."

Part III

Aye yo, I saw my man the other day he say he need a handout
Said he had some live and some boy but it ran out
His partner had a number, but connections didn't pan out
And every other road he dialed was looking like the same route
Told him he could blame it on the cocaine drought
Since the boys got arraigned and all the names came out
Now I don't know nobody dealing, sitting on the steps
By the library building, busted him a short
Then I asked about his children, told me he ain't seen 'em
Since they momma tried to kill him, laughed and told the homie
"I forgot about that shit, she caught you in the crib
Rollin' off in a fat bitch, tried to pull the heater
But you hid under the mattress and jumped out the window
Butt naked, it was classic" I paused
Cuz my homie wasn't laughing with me
So I tried to switch the topic up causally
He exhaled smoke and threw his hat in the street
Said, "Playa, I don't understand what happened to me
Remember how I used to live extravagantly
White Jays, scuff free, with immaculate steez
Stacked Gs, cop keys like they was practically free
Now I'm scrambling these streets in this raggedy tee"
I was puzzled by his feelings of inadequacy
Then I saw the track mark when he pulled back on his sleeve
Yeah, my homie got a habit it seems
Sad, cuz I kinda wanna dap him and leave
But I been down the same road so I put it on front street
Then he stepped back like he wanted to punch me
Told him, sit down, it's been a minute since we hung out
Apologized for bringing up the fact that he was strung out
Caught me off guard, and I know that life's hard
But I really hate to see the homie in the graveyard
Cuz all I wanna do is see my people live large
I always try to see my people better than they are
He told me he would clean up, said it was a promise
Looked me in my eyes to imply that he was honest
But I know that I would lie too, back when I was on it
So even when I nodded I was feeling broken hearted
He the homie though, regardless, so I know I gotta trust him
Told him I won't bring it up in any more discussions
Then I hit him with some ones, probably bout a dozen
He told me he was staying with his auntie and his cousin
But I saw the bitch later and she told me that he wasn't
Told me if she saw him she would snitch him to the government
Said he on some foul shit, she ain't even love him
I was bugging, I know he on the needle
How she talking hopeless,
told me that he was evil, he didn't have emotions
Said they found his babies with their throats slit, and he the culprit
I'm like, oh shit, step back, how she go against blood like that?
That's the homie from the way back
Looking at the stars, "what the fuck could make you say that?
Naw love, I can't even play that"
It's hard to light a smoke when you trying to breathe
Cuz deep down I know she ain't lying to me
Cuz deep down I know she ain't lying to me
Cuz deep down I know she ain't lying to me

Ayo your homeboys change sometimes
Ayo the thoughts rearrange in their brains sometimes
It's too hard dealing with the pain sometimes
But you gotta let go, you can't save their lives
Your homeboys change sometimes
The thoughts rearrange in their brains sometimes
It's too hard dealing with the pain sometimes
But you gotta let go, you can't save their lives

Part IV

"What are you doing?"
"I don't know"
