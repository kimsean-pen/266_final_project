All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was supposed to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew

All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was supposed to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

Go!
I spread the fuel with ire, desire (desire)
To incinerate all
Behold I rise
Phoenix, phoenix

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all
Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was supposed to be
Was supposed to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove
Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove
