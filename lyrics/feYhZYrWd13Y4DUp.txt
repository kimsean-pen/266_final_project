One day will meet again
one day will see quickly did back then.
Old friend,
you're still my old friend.

No deserters
remember the music you meet
knows who around
became a deserter.

One day will meet and no one will cry
one day I won't ask why
old friend,
you're still my old friend.

All deserts
amongst those friends that you knew
all gave the word
all deserters now, mhhm.
