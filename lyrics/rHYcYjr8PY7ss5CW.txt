If there is ever the impregnable question
Of why what did or didn't pass
It would help to seek
But I really don't --
We don't see eye to eye
And you're always on my mind
Whether there is or isn't any position
You care if I take or I don't
What we shared so long
And though we don't see eye to eye
And you're always on my mind
Through time and through many a situation
We both look forward side-by-side
We have shared it all
We have both stood tall
What is mine is yours, in happiness and strife
And I want you in my life
