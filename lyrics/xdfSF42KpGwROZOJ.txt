If I could command the wind
I would make it blow a whisper to you
On a soft and quiet breeze
'Cause I see what you're going through

If I could convince the angels
I would have them blowing
Words of wisdom in your ears
With the dinging sound of bells
Just to make you understand what I mean

That there's always more
There's always more
Always more to Learn
There's always more
Always more
There's always more to know

'Cause there's always a reason
There's always a way
There's always a better word to say
And there's always an answer
There's always a why
There's always a chance to give a try

Always more, always more
There's always more to know

Always more, always more
Always more to love, to live, to cry, to sing...

'Cause there's always a reason
There's always a way
There's always a better word to say
So let's say you have answers
So let's say you know why
Let's say you have reached the final line

There'll always be a way
And always more to learn
Always more for us...
