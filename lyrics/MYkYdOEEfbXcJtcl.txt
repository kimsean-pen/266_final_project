I don't usually care about what I'm drinking
You can buy the round or let it sink in
So many opinions passing the poison
Try to resist them, drown out the noises
Sometime I think that I should try to love it
But this doesn't sit well in my stomach
Everyone's talking, I don't want to listen
Before you start pouring

I ain't sipping on the Kool Aid
I ain't in no other roleplay
That cherry flavour got your lips stained
And I don't want that look on my face

So, oh, you do you and I'll do me
We'll agree to disagree
Hear your breach but no thanks
I don't care about that shit taste
I ain't sipping on any Kool Aid

I ain't tripping on the Kool- Kool Aid

You're talking talking but it's turning sour
Don't make it sweeter when you're saying it louder
You're giving me extra but I wasn't lacking
You're throwing me answers but I wasn't asking

I'm not saying I'm well put together
But that doesn't mean I don't know better
I've spent enough time here so do me a favor
Don't even pour it

I ain't sipping on the Kool Aid
I ain't in no other roleplay
That cherry flavour got your lips stained
And I don't want that look on my face

So, oh, you do you and I'll do me
We'll agree to disagree
Hear your breach but no thanks
I don't care about that shit taste
I ain't sipping on any Kool Aid

I ain't tripping on the Kool- Kool Aid

Everybody everybody everybody's talking, just talking
Everybody everybody everybody's talking, just shhh
Everybody everybody everybody's talking, it's exhausting
Everybody everybody everybody's talking, just shhh

I ain't sipping on any Kool Aid
I ain't in no other roleplay
That cherry flavour got your lips stained
And I don't want that look on my face

So, oh, you do you and I'll do me
We'll agree to disagree
Hear your breach but no thanks
I don't care about that shit taste
I ain't sipping on any Kool Aid

I ain't tripping on the Kool- Kool Aid
I ain't tripping on the Kool- Kool Aid
