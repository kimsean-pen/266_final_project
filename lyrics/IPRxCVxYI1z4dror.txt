God save the Queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
A potential H bomb

God save the Queen
She's not a human being
There is no future
In England's dreaming

Don't be told what you want, you want
And don't be told what you need
There's no future, there's no future
No future for you
God save the Queen
God save window lean
God saves human beings

God save the Queen
Tourists are money
And our figurehead
Is not what she seems

God save history
God save your mad parade
Lord God, have mercy
All crimes are paid

We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the romance behind the screen
We're the future, no future

God save the Queen
We mean it man
We love our Queen
God saves

God save the Queen
Tourists are money
And our figurehead
Is not what she seems

No future
No future
No future for you

No future
No future
No future for me

No future
No future
No future for you

No future
No future
No future for me

No future
No future
No future for you
