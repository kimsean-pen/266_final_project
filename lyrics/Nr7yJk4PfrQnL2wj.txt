You
you look full of wonder
of miracles I see

You
emotions getting stronger
why don't you feel like me?
I feel it every second
my heart recalls your name

I'm searching for an answer
why don't you feel the same?
You
looking for a lover
a man I want to be.
You
need someone to hold on
why don't you look at me?
I feel it every second
my heart recalls your name.
I'm searching for an answer
why don't you feel the same?

Everytime I see you
I feel it's not a game . . .
