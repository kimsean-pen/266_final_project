Oh, morning
Come bursting
The clouds amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water that your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop
I lost a friend
My drunken hazard daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface
And just start again
Lift off before trouble
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us
And see roses in the rain

Sing
Slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
