Calling a dream feel
Hillsides around us
And do we last with certain about
To the fields, to the fields
Now we wait for our lives

Calling a line sky
Stay to the south part
Place the way, way to my feet
Here comes, here comes
Like we never thought will begin

So I was waiting on the other side of the road
Always looking for a way to make me fall down

Let it go now
You are so young
We're still waiting, but wasting my time
There is love in your hands
I would wait for you myself

So I was waiting on the other side of the road
Always looking for a way to make me slow down
But what you're doing now?
Your own score will be reading through

Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so bad
