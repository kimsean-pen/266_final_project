Doctor Jekyll and Mister Beanbug
And now my Hyde again
If he comin' wrappin' on my door
I'm not gonna answer it

I've been grievin' old fashioned at the seed,
My seemless friend
I've been grievin' old fashioned at the seed,
My seemless friend

Circle once, rise, this bust has a rusted drive
Slip your flux right past your fortress
We all are born to die
We all are born to die, yeah

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) x2

(Hey yeh yeh oh oh) x16

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) x6

Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Awake this light
Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Always in flight

Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Awake this light
Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Always in flight

Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Awake this light
Least this here, now, sweet peace of mind
Always in flight
