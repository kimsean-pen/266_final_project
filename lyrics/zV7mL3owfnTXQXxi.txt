My love is in league with the freeway
It's passion will rise as the cities fly by
And the tail lights dissolve in the coming of night
And the questions and thousands take flight

My love is a-miles in awaiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns, and the pain that grows dark
And it's you once again
Leading me on (leading me on)
Leading me down the road
Driving me on (driving me on)
Driving me down the road

My love is exceedingly vivid
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing and, my thoughts do provide
Should I rest for a while at the side

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back
No
There is no turning back

On the run
My love is in league
With the freeway
Oh with the freeway
And the coming of the night time
My love
My love
Is in league with the freeway
