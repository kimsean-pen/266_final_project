glad to see your wide awake
this is the great escape
from a life that tried to mould you
and the lie it sold you

what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?
what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?
what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?

did you try to reason why
look yourself in the eye
what you are is all you have been
what will be is all you do now

what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?
what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?
what would you do?
what wouldn't you do?

spill a tear as your sense of self slowly
melts away
melts away
melts away

until death's mirror reflects
the meaning of our lives
we wander aimless and mesmerised
as the fear starts to rise.

Can you rely on the safety of a system?
Those masochistic messages run deep into your soul, tearing through years of subconscious defences.
In a split second the foundations for a peaceful fulfilling life can be blasted away to the four corners of reality,
almost as if it were an act of a truly evil god.
