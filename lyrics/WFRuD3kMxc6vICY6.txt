free and radical
shrapnel in the blood
20 seconds: 20 hours
calculate my consciousness
I see my reflection in the stain of every hardwood floor
when Im too tired to look up

alive by midnight, and dead by the morning star
this is all I know
do you know who you are?

the more that I bleed, the more it takes the pain away
