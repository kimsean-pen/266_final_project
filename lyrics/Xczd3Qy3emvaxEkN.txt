Shut it all down
The facts and the memories
I have been running around inside
On this borrowed time

The medical poison
It stabilizes and drags me back
Though it is against my will

Locked inside
This suite of flesh and blood
Stranded on clean sheets forever
With the parasites in my veins

I can hear your cries
I can feel your breath to the end
You have been visiting me for so long now

Erase the map of the past
I am fighting with my heart as an enemy
Falling through a black hole for eternity

Caught in an endless sleep with this hollow dreams
Capture the light and pour it over me
A benefactor forbidden to all humanity
Bring me a trail and please let me feel pain

Turn to the next page
Ease your depression
You will find it better
When I'm gone this will lead you insane

I can hear your cries
I can feel your breath to the end
You have been visiting me for so long now
