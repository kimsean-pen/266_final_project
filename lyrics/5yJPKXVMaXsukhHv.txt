I need love, love
Ooh, ease my mind
And I need to find fine
Someone to call mine

My mama said "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said "Love don't come easy
But It's a game of give and take"

"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes"

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Is to feel my strength, you know it's almost gone

But remember mama said "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"

How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
'Cause my heart, heart to break

And no, I cant bear to live my life alone
I grown impatient for a lover to call my own
Oh when I feel that I, I can't go on
You don't feel my state

You know I'm almost gonna remember mama said
"You can't hurry love
Oh, you'll just have to wait"
She said "Love don't come easy

It's a game of give and take"
"You can't hurry love
Oh, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time

No matter how long it takes", and now break
When love, love don't come easy
I know I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice

To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting
(Ooh, till that day)

But it ain't easy
(Love don't come easy
No, you know it ain't easy
My mama said
"You can't hurry love
Oh, you'll just have to wait"
She said "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
"You can't hurry love
Oh, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes"
