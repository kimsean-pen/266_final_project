Awaken by the moon, amongst the stars doth I rise
To feel a breeze, to gaze the fires
My naked feet bleed the soil
To the father orb, begs my skin, drink the sun
I am dying, of feeding this life
To take existence -- Bleed it out

If heaven cries
Its tears fall too late
On our charred remains
Cremated and given to the river
To fall to the sea -- to flow to the abyss
I have become
You have become
We have become
The abyss

We have nothing -- raped from us
We shall remain like these stars
That shine brighter then the heavens
Obscure, we are only to leap from shadows

What hand shall I fear?
No one!
What path shall I fear?
The distance!
What God shall I fear?
No one!
What existence shall I feel?

Wait... Wait... Oh, please wait
Don't go
