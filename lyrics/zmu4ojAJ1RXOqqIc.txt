I'm gonna tell you a secret
I saw out there tonight
Every time that you're sleeping
I stay awake til dawn

'Cause I can feel the rhythm
I can't control myself
It's like Saturday on Monday
And I just can't keep still

Don't you know that I wanna keep on dancing?
Dancing to the beat of your heart
Yea you know that I'm gonna keep on dancing
Dancing to the beat of your heart

Beat beat beat of your heart
Beat beat beat of your heart

I'm a day with Christmas
Walking the crowded street
But every time you're with me
I can't control my feet

'Cause everywhere there's music
It follows you around
And I can hear your rhythm
I can't ignore that sound

Don't you know that I wanna keep on dancing?
Dancing to the beat of your heart
Yea you know that I'm gonna keep on dancing
Dancing to the beat of your heart

Beat beat beat of your heart
Beat beat beat of your heart

Beat beat beat of your heart
Beat beat beat of your heart

Beat beat
Beat beat
Beat beat
Beat beat
Beat beat

Don't you know that I wanna keep on dancing?
Dancing to the beat of your heart
Yea you know that I'm gonna keep on dancing
Dancing to the beat of your heart

Don't you know that I wanna keep on dancing?
Dancing to the beat of your heart
Yea you know that I'm gonna keep on dancing
Dancing to the beat of your heart

Beat beat beat of your heart
I wanna keep on dancing
Beat beat beat of your heart
To the beat of your heart
Beat beat beat of your heart
I wanna keep on dancing
Beat beat beat of your heart
