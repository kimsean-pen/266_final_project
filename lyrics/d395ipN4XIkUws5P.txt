There's something strange going on in my head
That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound.
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say,
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing
So stare up at the clouds
And at least you know
you're always looking up

So Casey can you remember
sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
and talking about life

Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you can affect a guy like me
All the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

We'd stay inside just to watch the time go by
and sleep the whole day till the night
with everything you said
I'm sure you've got some place that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song
and thinking about me
cause Carolina was waiting for you
it's what you always wanted

Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
With the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away
Cause the sky looks different when you're in another state
It's everything I've always wanted
And everything I've worked so hard for

Is it in me
To put the bottle down?
well Is it in me?
to put the bottle down?
well is it in me? (blue skies sunrise and all the space between)
to put the bottle down? (its amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me)
well is it in me?(with the pictures, memories, and all the times we had)
to put the bottle down? (do you think that some things, are better left unsaid?)

Is it in me
Is it in me
