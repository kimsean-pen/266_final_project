I thought I was ok
Realizing I made a mistake
I been doing some thinking
Ever since I saw you today maybe
I said some things that I didn't mean
Trying to change your ways
But my days ain't the same maybe you should've stayed

I had a flashback, flashback
I really love you so sad so sad
Thought I was over you to fast to fast
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback
The mistakes you made weren't even that bad
Now that I saw you I want you bad
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback

I wish that I could get back with you now
Don't wanna see another woman around
All these memories thought I had you outta my mind
Baby I keep trying I keep trying and it wont stop
These flashbacks I don't want that
I just wanna go back where you messed up and erase that
I'm trippin I'm in the zone It's nothing but a flashback

Flashback, flashback
I really love you so sad so sad
Thought I was over you to fast to fast
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback
The mistakes you made weren't even that bad
Now that I saw you I want you bad
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback

In the car come pick me up
Take me somewhere no one knows
Oceans candlelight lay me down and take it slow
I'm expecting messages just to say hey beautiful
Gave me attention make sure that you kept me close
But it's over now But it's over now
But it's over now But it's over now

Flashback flashback
I really love you so sad so sad
Thought I was over you to fast to fast
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback Flashback
The mistakes you made weren't even that bad
Now that I saw you I want you bad
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback

Flashback flashback
I really love you so sad so sad
Thought I was over you to fast to fast
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback
The mistakes you made weren't even that bad
Now that I saw you I want you bad
I wish I could re-live the past the past
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback, Flashback
