Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name and it feels like home...

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

I'm like a child, you whisper softly to me
You're in control, just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Life is a mystery (Oh, oh)
Everyone must stand alone (Oh, oh)
I hear you call my name (Ohhh...)
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there (Oh, oh)
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery (Oh, oh)
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem (Ohhh...)
Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Ohhh)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Just like a dream to me)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, whoa)
It's like a dream to me (Like a dream, like a dream)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Ohhh)

Life is a mystery (Just like a prayer)
Everyone must stand alone (Your voice can take me there)
I hear you call my name (You call my name)
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there (Just like a prayer)
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery (Your voice can take me there)
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem (Just like a dream)
Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there
