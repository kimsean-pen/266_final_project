Her life was magazines and faithful TV screens
Selling an empty dream of cars and calories
Everything in between the sun and Saturn's ring
The price tag can't be seen
And it took bites out of her insides
Till she was just a hollow shell

Grew up in east LA
Watching celebrities
Living out all her dreams.
The plastic canopy of the U.S. royalty
Drew her gaze towards the sky
Away from her own mind
And it took bites out of her insides
Till she was just a hollow shell

And at her home her mother cried
Cause daddy had somethin' on the side
They didn't look up when she sighed

When august came around
Bathing suits on the ground
Replaced by a cotton cloak
To see her own reflection was like squinting in the sun
And when all tomorrow brings is a set of broken wings
Well it takes bites out of your insides
Till you are just a hollow shell

And it took bites out of her insides
Till she was just a hollow shell
