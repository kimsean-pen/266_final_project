I took a Sharpie to your face
On the picture in the picture frame
Blacking you out
Like you do every Saturday
Sharpie to your name
By the buzzer where I buzzed you in
I told my building
Not to answer if you ring again

I shoulda never let
I shoulda never let you in
I shoulda never let
Let you in my picture frame
I shoulda never let
I shoulda never let you in
I shoulda never let
Let you in my picture frame

You are important and hot
No wonder I couldn't stop
I don't really like to whine
But, I really miss the wild
Nights like this, yeah
You already made your bed
Now you lie alone instead

I took a Sharpie to your face
On the picture in the picture frame
Blacking you out
Like you do every Saturday
Sharpie to your name
By the buzzer where I buzzed you in
I told my building
Not to answer if you ring again

I shoulda never let
I shoulda never let you in
I shoulda never let
Let you in my picture frame
I shoulda never let
I shoulda never let you in
I shoulda never let
Let you in my picture frame

All good by myself
You are something else
All good by myself
You are something else
