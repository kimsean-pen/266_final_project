My wrist dancing, neck dancing
Nails dancing, my ears dancing
These bitches dancing
They pussy popping
They jaws dropping
He take me shopping
Robin jeans, with the wings
Chanel bags, double, double c's
A hundred grand, quadruple g's
I'm so fly, I need some wings

New machine, zoom zoom
Big guns, boom boom!
Bitch you dusty! I need a broom
Only bad bitches, allowed in this room
Top flight, jet tight
You so broke, you fly a bike
My neck froze, it's all ice
Put a ring on it, and name it Mr. Nice
His credit score 800, call him Mr. Right
Red fox, silver fox
Mink coat, chinchilla top
Maserati keys, drop the top

My wrist dancing, neck dancing
Nails dancing, my ears dancing
These bitches dancing
They pussy popping
They jaws dropping
He take me shopping
Robin jeans, with the wings
Chanel bags, doble, double c's
A hundred grand, quadruple g's
I'm so fly, I need some wings

Uh
Money broad, I ain't got her
I'm on an island, with your father
Blowing smoke, on a boat
I'm so cold, my clear coat
Red bottoms, they on fire
You baby father, he a buyer
Airport, passport
When we land, they clear port
Tell the driver, I got a show
Fifth classy shot
Versace stomp, Giuseppe stomp
I got it all, I need some more
The jewelry stall, I rake up

My wrist dancing, neck dancing
Nails dancing, my ears dancing
These bitches dancing
They pussy popping
They jaws dropping
He take me shopping
Robin jeans, with the wings
Chanel bags, doble, double c's
A hundred grand, quadruple g's
I'm so fly, I need some wings
