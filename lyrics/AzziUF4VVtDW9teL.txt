Breeze is always colder by the sea
But it's warm to me
Unsettled in my skin
The air is clean, and I build a dream

Haven't we all?
Haven't we all?

Never looking back or looking down
Alone forever
Caught up in it all
I thought about it many times before

Haven't we all?
Haven't we all?

What am I?
What am I, alone?
Leave it all behind you, I'd love to
Cause I've got tired eyes and nothing to sink into
Somewhere to belong, to
Heaven knows I could find my place to be

River runs for miles
Untied, unchanging in time
Deep in thought of nothing more
I'd be free as the roads we walk

Wouldn't we all
Wouldn't we all

What am I?
What am I, alone?
Leave it all behind you, I'd love to
Cause I've got tired eyes and nothing to sink into
Somewhere to belong, to
Heaven knows I could find my place to be
