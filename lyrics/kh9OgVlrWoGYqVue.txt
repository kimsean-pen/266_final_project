Too much alcohol starting to say shit
Didn't mean I love you I'm just wasted
Just one night monogamy overrated
Damn she look too good when I get faded
Drink another one, start getting naked

Oh I've felt this feeling before
My god
It's coming in hot, it's coming in hot
I'm sorry I can't do this no more
'Cause girl

I'm sickened by the thought of it all
Oh don't take it personally please
I'm just sickened by the thought of it all
Oh this feeling weakening my knees

Now it's weird let me try to inform you
Love related sorrow I've grown numb to
Heartbreak just ain't something I can go through
New age love a game don't wanna play you

I'm sickened by the thought of it all
Oh don't take it personally please
I'm just sickened by the thought of it all
Oh this feeling weakening my knees
I'm sickened by the thought of it all
Oh don't take it personally please
I'm just sickened by the thought of it all
Oh this feeling weakening my knees

Liar she said I'm her only desire
Afternoon get home to find the bedroom on fire
There she lay as I left it and preach in the choir
Some recycled bullshit heard it all this girl a
Liar she said I'm her only desire
One I'd die for we had all the plans to conspire
Only if I knew nothing more than a supplier

I'm sickened by the thought of it all
