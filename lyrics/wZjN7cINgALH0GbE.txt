My thoughts can be so vicious
Committed to a plan
The fear becomes ambitious
Taking me till I am gone

I don't know how it started
Beating up myself
I've come to realize
I barely carry on each day

This life is so destructive
It's blowing out my mind
My breath is running short
I'm lost here
(Deep inside, deep inside)

In this maze
I'm running through the halls of emptiness
In this maze
I can't find the way to get back to the end

In this maze
I'm feeling like I'm stuck inside a cage
In this maze
I won't feel the breeze till I break this maze and run

I don't know how it started
Thinking to myself
I've come to realize
I couldn't carry on each day

This vibe is so destructive
I'm smoking up my mind
So by the time she left
I was lost here
(Deep inside, deep inside)

In this maze
I'm running through the halls of emptiness
In this maze
I can't find the way to get back to the end

In this maze
I'm feeling like I'm stuck inside a cage
In this maze
I won't feel the breeze till I break this maze and run

Will I ever see the sun
Shining through the prison clouds?
In the darkness, you can hide
Go inside, free your mind

In this maze
I'm running through the halls of emptiness
In this maze
I can't find the way to get back to the end

In this maze
I'm feeling like I'm stuck inside a cage
In this maze
I can't find the way to get back to the end

In this maze
I can't find the way to get back to the end
In this maze
I won't feel the breeze till I break this maze
Break this maze and run
