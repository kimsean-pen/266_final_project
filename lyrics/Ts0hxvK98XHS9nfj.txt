God cannot save my soul, it's straight to hell for me, I know
And when I get there, at least I found a place to call my home
But they say the truth will set you free, then why am I still here?
I've got no truth left, don't you see? Am I making myself clear?

Resolution, no solution

God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?

The spirit's stuck between two roads and waiting there on me
The first path is the way to go, the life I wanna lead
The second road's my crazy past, the darkest parts I try to mask
The drugs, the guns, the lies, the love, the dreams I had of waking up

Resolution, no solution

God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that you should?

Don't tell me I'm not worth the time
I will be fine
All these prayers have gone unanswered
Where were you? Where were you?

God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?
God, if you are above, I fear
That one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?
