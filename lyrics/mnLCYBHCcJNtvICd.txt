When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided

You say you think you met your wife way too soon
You say you're 28 and wasting your youth
You say you've hit rock bottom, now I have too
I hope you find yourself out there in the blue
Yeah, I hope you find yourself out there in the blue

Hold on to me
Baby, hold on, hold on to me, my darling
Keep touching me
Baby, touching and touching my body
Oh for the very last, very last time

And that's when you said that this is the end
That your problems ain't my problem anymore

When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided
Alone in your bed
Without your best friend
Guess our love was not a love we were fighting for
When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided

Remember binging shows on slow internet
We'd make up theme songs every morning in bed
I'd rub your stomach all those times you were stressed
Oh love, those things are way too hard to forget
There are some things I just don't wanna forget

Hold on to me
Baby, hold on, hold on to me, my darling
Keep touching me
Baby, touching and touching and touching my body
Oh for the very last, very last time

And that's when you said that this is the end
That your problems ain't my problem anymore

When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided
Alone in your bed
Without your best friend
Guess our love was not a love we were fighting for
When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided

Remember me
Remember me, my darling
Come back to me
'Cause there'll never be someone who loved you like I did
Oh, just one more time
'Cause there's no coming back if you say goodbye

And that's when you said that this is the end
That your problems ain't my problem anymore

When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided
Alone in your bed
Without your best friend
Guess our love was not a love we were fighting for
When you said goodbye
Gon' have to live to what you decided
And when you heard it inside
Gon' have to live to what you decided
