Bright room, dark shades
Smokey eyed, no shame

You wish you could explain

Broken hearts, silly dreams
That help you to believe

This insanity

Begging a smile if they all knew
What you are going through

You're the great pretender

Your game, your strain
Clean up your communication

You have died inside

No one can really understand
You're not that whole but you pretend
No one can really understand
You're not that cold but you pretend

Can you still play the game your way
You're the great pretender

Heavy brow, crack a smile
Live your life, you're numb

There is no sensation

Feel weak, falling deep
Crave to be free

Just wanna feel like a woman

Bright room, dark shades
Smokey eyed, no shame

Oh you, you wish you could explain

Broken hearts, silly dreams
That help you to believe

This insanity

No one can really understand
You look so whole but you pretend
No one can really understand
You're not that cold but you pretend

No one can really understand
You look so whole but you pretend
No one can really understand
You're not that cold but you pretend

Can you still play the game your way
You're the great pretender
