Hate them, hate them
Live your farce
Same thing, same way
Your karma will come

Ask me no questions
I tell no lies
Ask me again
I spit in your eyes

Live your life, leave me alone! (Leave me alone)
Live your life, leave me alone!

Face me, face me
Feel the cut
Open sore
Always bleeding

Live your life, leave me alone! (Leave me alone)
Live your life, leave me alone!

Spit!
Spit!
Spit!
Spit!
