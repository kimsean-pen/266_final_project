Dressed up for the letdown
Write songs for the wrong crowd
And I fear friend, this could be the last song
But we're all good to go cause it's time for the show
When I take back my soul

Dressed up for the letdown
I'd start if I known how
And I fear friend, this could be the last song
But we're all good to go cause it's time for the show
When I take back my soul
