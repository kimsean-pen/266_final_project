There is no hope here for a better tomorrow
Broken and black on the inside

So keep your mouth shut

We have forgotten the meaning of silence
Nobody wants your dumb opinion

Paradise was unendurable

My voice will bring you nothing but bad news
I can't wait for it all to come crashing down
I'm pulling down the walls

There, there is no other choice
What do you do where do you go

When everything is lost
No one is innocent of being evil

We cause our own destruction
We cause our own demise
There's no hope for a better tomorrow
I am awake, I am awake, I am awakening

There's no hope

I AM AWAKE, I AM AWAKE, I AM AWAKENING

I AM AWAKE, I AM AWAKE, I AM AWAKENING

There's no hope

We are born alone and we will die alone
There is no hope here for a better tomorrow
We are born alone and we will die alone
There is no hope here for a better tomorrow

Inside we all are empty.
