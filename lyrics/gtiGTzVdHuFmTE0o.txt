Someone to talk to

I have a piece of glass, I'm ready to carve
Your name across my chest, consider it art
No contusions, I wanna see stains
Fix the problem, not the blame

I'll catch a fever, it's a wonderful high
I wanna go the way of the superstars
I got my razor and I'm willing to slice
All the way to my heart

We had a love but where did it go?
I never thought we were vulnerable
I begged you baby, Can you please not go?
Cause I need somebody to talk to

You have a feast at last, I'm ready to starve
You ain't got nothing left, I've only it all
I have to live here, you get to leave
Fix the problem, not the blame

I'll catch a fever, it's a wonderful high
I wanna go the way of the superstars
I got my razor and I'm willing to slice
All the way to my heart

We had a love but where did it go?
I never thought we were vulnerable
I begged you baby, Can you please not go?
Cause I need somebody to talk to

We had a blast, yeah we did explode
I want to see where the shrapnel goes
I always thought we were impenetrable
But I need somebody to talk to

This is all you've ever known
Take a truth, turn it to stone
The more you lie, the stranger you seem
We won't be careful cause we know we can
This is all in the name of the wee man

When the body ends, do we decay or rise again?
Do we surround ourselves with simple common sense
Or do we hold onto consciousness?

When the body ends, do we decay or rise again?
Do we surround ourselves with simple common sense
