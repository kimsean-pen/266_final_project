Way up in the sky
That is where am I
I breathe the thin air
I like it way up there

In a bunch of trees
I'm down on my knees
I know what you are
I know what you are

I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
Mess around up there

I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
Mess around up there

Angels in the skies
Watch you with their eyes
They know what you are
They know what you are

Everything I say
Comes back to me one day
Everything you do
Comes back to stare at you

I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
Mess around up there

I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
No, I don't think you wanna
Mess around up there

Way up in the sky
That is where am I
I breathe the thin air
I like it way up there
