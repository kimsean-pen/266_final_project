Egoism dictates human relations
A world where fashion outshines morality
Is written in blood red colors
Designed by the thirst for power

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful
Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all to ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter, so bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught with the world wound web

A time represented by the void
An excuse without content
Stuck in the abyss of existence
With a content void excuse

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful
Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

Shout
[incomprehensible]

An all to ordinary story, this is my story
With an aftertaste so bitter, so bitter
Losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught, I'm caged, I'm gone

An all to ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter, so bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught with the world wound web
