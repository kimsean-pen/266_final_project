I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red...

Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh)
Find myself, high in the distance (Uh)
Find me up, lyin' in this ditch (Uh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo!)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Uh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Uh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Uh)
Ain't no tellin', no tellin', so call the coroner

Aye, I'ma just bounce with that
In fact, I bought a whole damn house with that
Aye, hand me where the ounces at
Tell me where the damn these ounces at
Aye, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at
Aye, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at

It's gettin' hot, you best just−
(Woo!) Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
The effects can't touch this
(Woo!) Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Stepped up, stand down, bitch
(Woo!) Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Wait, wait, wait

I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I−
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you
Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I−
Baby, when the karma gets you
Maybe you can run away with us

In my bag in the vault, movin' on, move along
Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregard the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playin' games with you to play your part
Standin' up with pride behind my battle scars

Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big ass house and big ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife, rewind
Don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut when they know the place
But you don't know me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwin' curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawin' on my wood like a termite
Enterin' my world like a parasite (Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)

Praise God! Hallelujah! I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, can't find that shit!
Woo, praise God! Hallelujah! I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, I can't−

Let me find my way out of this bitch
"I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red..." (Damn!)
(Uh) With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
(Ooh, da-aa, da, da, da, da)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Uh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Uh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Uh)
Ain't no tellin', no tellin', so call the coroner

Sittin' on your porch across parkin' lots, and you
Light it up, better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playin' with your locks
I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
Sittin' on your porch across parkin' lots
(That's all I got for you)
And I'll never get sick of playin' with your locks I- I-
(That's all I got for you)
Sittin' on your porch across parkin' lots and you
(That's all I got for you)
Miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
(That's all I got for you)
Sittin' on your porch across parkin' lots
(That's all I got for you)
And I'll never get sick of playin' with your locks
I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots
I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
(That's all I got for you)
