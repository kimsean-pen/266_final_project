I know I'm a mess, I didn't choose it
(I didn't choose it)
I know you're scared I'm gonna lose it
(I'm gonna lose it)

And now I'm just waiting for someone to take me
And tell me that I'm doing fine
'Cause you won't fuck off from my mind
('Cause you won't fuck off from my mind)

I'm sorry, and I hate the old me
I don't know how not to be lonely
I didn't believe that
Loving was easy
I'm sorry for all of my faces
But you giving me all your patience
And I'm never leaving
And you are the reason

You are the reason
You are the reason

I know I'm lost, I couldn't fake it
(I couldn't fake it)
It's all too much for you to take it
(For you to take it)

And now I'm just waiting for someone to take me
And tell me that we'll be alright
'Cause you won't fuck off from my mind
('Cause you won't fuck off from my mind)

I'm sorry, and I hate the old me
I don't know how not to be lonely
I didn't believe that
Loving was easy
I'm sorry for all of my faces
But you giving me all of your patience
And I'm never leaving
And you are the reason

And now I'm just waiting for someone to take me
And tell me that I'm doing fine
'Cause you won't fuck off from my mind
('Cause you won't fuck off from my mind)

I'm sorry, and I hate the old me
I don't know how not to be lonely
I didn't believe that
Loving was easy
I'm sorry for all of my faces
But you giving me all your patience
And I'm never leaving
And you are the reason
