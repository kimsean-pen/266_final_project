Wreckless heart
Take hold of the wheel
You're headed for a fall
For a fall

Torn apart
Is how you'll feel
But it's all for love
All for love

Gonna ride that river to the sea
Gonna cry that river out of me

There's no cure
For time separated
But I'm holding on
I'm holding on

You can be sure
That time heals the pain
And what's done is done
What's done is done

Gonna ride that river to the sea
Gonna cry that river out of me

Gonna ride that river to the sea
Gonna cry that river out of me
Gonna ride that river to the sea
Gonna cry that river out
