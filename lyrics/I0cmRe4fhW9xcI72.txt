They call me the breeze
As I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
As I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carrying me no load

Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
I ain't hiding from nobody
Ain't nobody hiding from me

I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know

They call me the breeze
As I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
As I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carrying me no load
