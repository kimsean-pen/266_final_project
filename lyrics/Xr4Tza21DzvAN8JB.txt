Feast on flesh of newborn life.
Commencing ritual of ancient baptism.
Raise high the fetal excrements.
Bless this birth for it must be cleansed.

Into damnation, sacrifical rite of the newborn child.
Ritualistic mass forever with the god.
Rid the afterbirth of sin...

Into the dark they see, visions of immortality.
Ready to feast on corpses, awaiting the flesh of mortals...

Christening the afterbirth...

Bodies putrified beneath.
Unholy sepulture yet to be revealed.
Decayed beyound recognition.
Preparing the form of a black mass...

Christening the afterbirth...
