I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other girls you hang around
It's kind of funny
But they always seem to let you down

And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore, oh
I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah

Don't want to pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I want to be the only one who makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I want to turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh lover, I want to be the only one you come for

I wanna be your mother
I wanna be your father and your sister too
There is no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you

And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
They say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild

Don't want to pressure you, baby
All I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I want to be the only one who makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I want to turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh lover, yeah, I want to be the only one you come for

Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh love, ooh, ooh
