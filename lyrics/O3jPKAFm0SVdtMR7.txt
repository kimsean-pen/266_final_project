It's down to this
I've got to make this life make sense
Can anyone tell what I've done
I miss the life
I miss the colors of the world
Can anyone tell where I am

'Cause now again I've found myself
So far down
Away from the sun that shines into
The darkest place
I'm so far down
Away from the sun again

Away from the sun again

I'm over this
I'm tired of living in the dark
Can anyone see me down here
The feeling's gone
There's nothing left to lift me up
Back into the world I know

But now again I've found myself
So far down
Away from the sun that shines into
The darkest place
I'm so far down
Away from the sun
That shines to light a way for me
To find my way
Back into the arms
That care about the ones like me
I'm so far down
Away from the sun again

Ohh no
Yeahhh
Ohh no

It's down to this
I've got to make this life make sense
And now I can't tell what I've done

And now again I've found myself
So far down
Away from the sun
That shines to light the way for me

Because now again I've found myself
So far down
Away from the sun that shines into
The darkest place
I'm so far down
Away from the sun
That shines to light a way for me
To find my way
Back into the arms
That care about the ones like me
I'm so far down
Away from the sun again

Oh no
Yeah
I'm gone
