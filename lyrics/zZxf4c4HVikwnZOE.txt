Naivety and childhood left behind deprived of the goodness of mankind,
past encounters have made her strong, strong enough to carry on and on.

Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down no need to care, lights are low exposed and bare.

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked.

Naked
She knows exactly what to do with men like you,
inside out in her mind there's
no doubt where you're coming from,
mystery will turn you on.

Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down no need to care, lights are low exposed and bare.

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked.

(spoken) Hello...
Hello, its me
I thought you'd understand
Well maybe I should have kept my mouth shut
I keep seeing such a pretty picture
I'd rather be hated than pitied
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination
I just want to be me

This angel's dirty face is sore, holding onto what she had before.
Not sharing secrets with any old fool, now she's gonna keep her cool.
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked.

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked.

Repeat to fade
