Fine art collector
An angel investor
And you really caught my eye

Oh, I see a value where they wouldn't dare to
You shine like a diamond who's lacking refinement
You never thought you were a prize
Well, you might not show it but dear I just know it
You fine

So fine
It's just a matter, a matter, a matter, a matter of time
You'll realize
That you fine, you so fine, you so fine, you so fine
In their eyes
And than I'll have to go wait in line

Like Jerry Maguire
An agent for hire
I only rep those that can win

I don't hedge my investments and vest my assessments
On whimsical missions or nearsighted visions
Or shooting stars in the sky
You might not see it but darling believe it
You fine

So fine
It's just a matter, a matter, a matter, a matter of time
You'll realize
That you fine, you so fine, you so fine, you so fine
In their eyes
And than I'll have to go wait in line

You fine
Oh, you fine
You fine
You fine

So fine
It's just a matter, a matter, a matter, a matter of time
You'll realize
That you fine, you so fine, you so fine, you so fine
In their eyes
And than I'll have to go wait in line
