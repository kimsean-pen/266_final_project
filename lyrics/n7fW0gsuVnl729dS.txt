My heart's as heavy as these nights are long
And I curse these spaces between my fingers where
For a time you belonged

And you'll find somebody new who's worth your time
Someone whose words sound sweeter than mine
I'll hope to mend, trying my best just to get by

Can you tell me what hurts more?
Is it remembering or forgetting?
The best that once was ours
Am I remembering, still remembering or forgetting?

I've cut your portrait framed within my mind
It remains untouched of your paints and brushes
Yet, still it changed all the time

When you left, not without warning or regrets
Nothing would fill this hole in my chest
Here's our farewell, I wish you nothing but the best

Can you tell me what hurts more?
Is it remembering or forgetting?
The best that once was ours
Am I remembering, still remembering, or forgetting?

So my love, goodbye
So my love, goodbye

Tell me what hurts more
Is it remembering or forgetting?
The best that once was ours
Am I remembering, still remembering?

Can you tell me what hurts more?
Is it remembering or forgetting?
The best that once was ours
Am I remembering, still remembering
Am I remembering, still remembering, or forgetting?
