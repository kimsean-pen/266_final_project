What keeps the world on spinning?
what keeps the stars in the sky?
what is reaction without no reason?
what is this thing, human being? (4x)

where is the truth, with no beginning?
where is the? in your eyes?
where do we go, when we go bye bye?
what is this thing, human being? (4x)

why do people hate each other?
why came we just be brother and sister?
?
what is this thing, human being? (4x)

why does the truth hurt so badly?
when only lies get you by.
why is love so surreal?
what is this thing, human being? (4x)

oh, what is this thing, human being?
what is this thing, human being? (4x)
