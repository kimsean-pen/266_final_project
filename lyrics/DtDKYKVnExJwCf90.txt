Got caught running up a tab
Couldn't drive home so I had to share a cab.
duced herself by her last name
The kind of girl you steal from the football team.
Brought up a sliver-spoon mess
Always trying to tear off her Catholic dress.
Told me she's over this place
Needs to feel the Midwest wind in her face.
But the alcohol made its way down.
She was the last thing that I saw last night before I hit the ground.

Oh God I did the wrong thing to the right girl.
My mind was only in it for a minute.
I had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb, not giving a... (Hey!)
The blank stare
Out the window
If I could just sober up, I could just admit
I did the wrong thing
To the right girl
It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.

It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.

I've never been the best with my mouth
Try to say smart but the dumb comes out
Maybe I'm shy, I drive an old car
Maybe I'm amazed that it got this far
And I got my stand-bys waiting
On the line (Got them on the line)
But the hardest part is knowing
That
It won't be her this time

Oh God I did the wrong thing to the right girl.
My mind was only in it for a minute.
I had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb, not giving a... (Hey!)
The blank stare
Out the window
If I could just sober up, I could just admit
I did the wrong thing
To the right girl
It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.

It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.

Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back

She came back, thought she had it all planned out
Went to marry some guy she had talked about
A tear in her dress and a tear in her eye
Just like that her whole life flashed by
She won't remember what you said last night (What you said last night)
That if you ever needed someone to pick up the pieces in your life
Oh God I did the wrong thing to the right girl.

My mind was only in it for a minute.
I had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb, not giving a... (Hey!)
The blank stare
Out the window
If I could just sober up, I could just admit
I did the wrong thing
To the right girl
It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.
It was your world baby
And I just lived in it.
Oh, it was your world, oh
(Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back)
It was your world
And I just lived in it.
(Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back)
