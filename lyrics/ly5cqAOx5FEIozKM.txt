Can you, heal me
When nothing is mine
A weak smile won't mean a thing
To my bitter mind

And please wipe my tears away
Stay with me for one more day
Or must I find my realese in pain?
Without you I am alone
Without you everything's wrong
You left a crevice inside my soul

A short chance, can stop now
All my sweet fears
Be with me and bask in my
Deepest agony
