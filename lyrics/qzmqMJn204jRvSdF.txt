Picked you out
Cut you off
Brought you in our house
Dressed you up
Took photographs
Stood around with open mouths
Starved you of your water
Till the needles piled around

Sweeping up
The needle dust
By the light of the TV
The humor of the metaphor
Isn't lost on me
All the water in the world
And I can't force myself to want a drink

Tell me what is missing in my mind
I feel the problem is essential
It's memory is blackening my mind
I'm taking everything back
Evergreen

Twist the rag
Spray the glass
Swirl the wet around
We do our best thinking
While we're working in this house
All the world is always staining
I can't settle till it's out

Tell me what is missing in my mind
I feel the problem is essential
It's memory is blackening my mind
I'm taking everything back
Evergreen

Tell me what is written in your eyes
I feel the problem is essential
My memory is keeping me alive
I'm taking everything back
Evergreen
