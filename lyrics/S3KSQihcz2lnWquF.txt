It's a time
Too much time
To deny
All my lies
Though I love them
Like the truth in your eyes

I lose time
Precious time
So cold inside
Still in denial
If you show me your sweet dreams
I'll take them out

Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it

No means no I didn't do it
No means I know I didn't do it
No means I keep doing it
No means you know I keep doing it

Like the [?]
I'm alone
Gotta feed my need
Send back the phone
Feel the pressure in my head
Going fast

I've got time
Endless time
Eternity and more
To distract my mind
When you see me
Remember old good times

Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it

No means no I didn't do it
No means I know I didn't do it
No means I keep doing it
No means you know I keep doing it

Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it

No means no I didn't do it
No means I know I didn't do it
No means I keep doing it
No means you know I keep doing it

Trust me, I'm around
You can trust I'm not around anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it

No means No I didn't do it
No means I know I didn't do it
No means I keep doing it
No means You know I keep doing it

Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it
Good Times, you know I keep doing it

No means no I didn't do it
No means I know I didn't do it
No means I keep doing it
No means you know I keep doing it
