Foot a-against the pedal
Burning gas
I guess we ran out
We got high off each other
You stayed up and watched me come down

'Cause I found somebody new
Who makes me feel like you used to
And I'm done after all these years
Sometimes love just disappears
No one knows where it goes
But it ain't here
It ain't here

Dark skies, fade in
But there's cloud above
Where you're standing

Talking over tightropes
Words are thin
It's hard to balance

'Cause I found somebody new
Who makes me feel like you used to
Now I'm done after all these years
Sometimes love just disappears
No one knows where it goes
But it ain't here
No, it ain't here

Foot a-against the pedal
Burning gas
I guess we ran out
