Cards and quarters
Means to ends
Surgeon general
Warns against

Safe in the knowledge
Short walk back
Punchline I ruin
But we both laugh

Leaves steeping longer
Knowing glance
Make our appearance
Our minds have gone back home

Brave in her movements
Scared to dance alone

There's a cave made of sheets
And I, I, I know we want to be inside
Take off all of your clothes and climb
Into a cave of sheets tonight

Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets

Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets

Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets

Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets

Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
Steal away you and me
To a cave made of sheets
