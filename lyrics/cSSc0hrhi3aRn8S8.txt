Some people may seem bound for glory
Some never look you in the eye
Some people kick off without warning
Some people hit you from behind

The world won't play a broken record
How come you keep on wasting time
Mind what you say because it echoes

I want to see you shine
I want to see you shine
Some people make it before you know it
Some take their time to find a way
Some get so far before they blow it
Some people drive the world insane

The world won't play your broken record
Maybe it's time to change your song
Get on up, make up your mind
The world won't wait

I want to see you shine
I want to see you shine
You're just wasting time
I want to see you shine

I wish you would see
The things that I see
When I look at you
I see a man
Heart full of soul
So much to give
So much to show

Shine
I want to see you shine
I want to see you shine
You're just wasting time
I want to see you shine
I want to see you shine
Cause you're just wasting time
I want to see you shine
I want to see you shine
