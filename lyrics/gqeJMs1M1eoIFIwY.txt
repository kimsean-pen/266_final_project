Yo, yo, yo no motherfucking topic for this one
Just a freestyle

Ssup' Shibuya, it's the Saiya's return
Stand up, rise up, let's your cosmos burn
Pah pah pah, demonstrate some Saiya Style
Stay gold like a saint, represent this vibe
Focused on the curveball like an animal
Welcome to the jungle, town to town
R.O.T. to the motherfucking N
One day one show, take a look around

To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play it fair
Follow the trend, we don't care

Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die
Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die

I've been educated so I use the key
But to break the window, call me Jagi
I'm a big lunatic, forgive me for that
White socks white shoes, all dressed in black
My inner self tells me to find
A sensitive flow with a big fat sound
Write our story, represent our name
Forever whatever, not matter the pain

To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play it fair
Follow the trend, we don't care

Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die
Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die

We came to the stadium, play in Japan here is the mission
After two years, demonstrating our Saiya Style in Tokyo, cheers
First album is out
There is a new big challenge to confront
Become a generation leader
Here is the goal

Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die
Again and again and again and again, we smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo till I die
