I can't keep track of all my socks
I'm irresponsible not because I'm a rockstar
You can call me what you want
I think I like to hear you talk

If I set fire to these walls right now (right now)
Would I set foot inside your mind? (your mind)
And if you say yes am I allowed back in?
I hate the way it falls down
But I like the way it all sounds
Since you came back
I been long gone
Watchin' my walls
And when you movin'
I think I knew then
That everything was
And all I want is your time

If I set fire to these walls right now (right now)
Would I set foot inside your mind? (your mind)
And if you say yes am I allowed back in?
