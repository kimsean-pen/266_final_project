washing windows with angelina
i don't understand anything
violent angles from side to side
how'd you get so tangled up in my life?
how'd you get so caught?
how'd you get so tangled up?

i love you like it's the old days
when i could ask you anything
how'd you get so tangled up in my thinkin?
how'd you get so caught?
how'd you get so tangled up?
