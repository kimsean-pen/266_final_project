I think I was born in the wrong generation
Nobody talks to me
Nobody is relating
Am I so invisible or am I so hated
We swing our fist's and kick our legs
To know we're still breathing

I know what it's like
When you're all alone
Just look in my eyes
We are so alike
Black blood
Black blood

They-won't-drag me to the ground
Up against the world
Fucked at birth
What's a life worth? (Ah)

Black blood

You can kill me but I'll never fucking die

(Ah)
