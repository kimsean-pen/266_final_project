You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
My songs go on while your's just begun
Don't wait too long
Fall is a lovely time of the year
When the leaves turn to gold and brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin' down, oh
Why must the moments go by in such haste?
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming, we've no time to waste
Don't wait too long
And while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Don't wait too long
...
So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing this song
Share every precious moment with me
Don't wait too long
