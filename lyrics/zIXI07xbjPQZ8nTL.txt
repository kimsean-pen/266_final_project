Rise!

You took a part of me
I've wasted all this time just giving up
The revolution's starting
Why don't you try and stop it?

We've lost control of our minds
You think we're giving in?
It's time to prove yourself
So let the battle begin

We're not the same kids you used to know
So you wanna play this dangerous game?
Well we're ready to go (Yeah, we're ready to fucking go)
So at the end of the world
Let's let 'em hear us say

(We are, we are, we are) The creatures that you've hunted
(We are, we are, we are) The ghosts of hope you've killed
(Stand up, stand up, stand up) We're taking back tomorrow
(Become, become, become) Become the cog and crown

You think you're done with me?
Like you can light the match and not get burned?
We are the kids you love to hate
The ones that never learned to be part of the system

We were born to tear shit inside out
So sharpen your teeth
Ready your guns
The revolution starts now

We've already died if we give in to everything they ask
So become more tonight
We are your bloodline
We've already died if we give in to everything they ask
So become more tonight
We are your bloodline

Unleash hell!

This is your bloodline, bloodline
We are your, we are your lifeline, lifeline
This is your bloodline, bloodline
We are your, we are your lifeline, lifeline
So let them hear us say

(We are, we are, we are) The creatures that you've hunted
(We are, we are, we are) The ghosts of hope you've killed
(Stand up, stand up, stand up) We're taking back tomorrow
(Become, become, become) Become the cog and crown

(We are, we are, we are) The creatures that you've hunted
(We are, we are, we are) The ghosts of hope you've killed
(Stand up, stand up, stand up) We're taking back tomorrow
(Become, become, become) Become the cog and crown

Become the cog and crown
