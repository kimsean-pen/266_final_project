I don't mind

Letting you down easy but just give it time
If it don't hurt now just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more

You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Ain't it fun

Living in the real world

Ain't it good
Being all alone
Where you're from

You might be the one who's running things
You could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble

When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you
Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Ain't it good
Being all alone
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Don't go cryin to your mama
Cause your on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin to your mama
Cause your on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin to your mama
Cause your on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin to your mama
Cause your on your own in the real world
Ain't it fun

Ain't it fun

Living in the real world
Ain't it good
