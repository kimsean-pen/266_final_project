Sometimes you just make me loose my mind
Or sometimes you just make me loose my mind
But if you died I'd die right by your side
Yeah, if you died I'd die right by your side

Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
(If you died I'd die right by your side)

You're the troubles that I always find
Oh, you're the trouble that I always find
But if you died I'd die right by your side
Yeah, if you died I'd die right by your side

Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
(When you die I'd die right by your si-)
(If you died I'd die right by your side)

We always win the fight
You left hood and my right
But if this took good time
I'll be by your side

We always win the fight
You left hood and my right
But if this took good time
I'll be by your side

Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
(If you died I'd die right by your side)

Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
(If you died I'd die right by your side)

Hey now, hey now, hey now girl
(When you die, if-if you die)
(If you die I'd die right by your side)
