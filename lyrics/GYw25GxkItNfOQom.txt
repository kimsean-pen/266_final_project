May you die wide awake
With a look of great surprise
May your eyes be taken just before you can weep
'Cause you see what you stole, stolen from you

May you die with your mouth still agape
With a word stuck in your throat
May your mouth be taken just before you can speak
When you know what you stole has been stolen from you

May the sound of our voices ring out
With a song of great delight
Oh, a cheer, loud and clear, the last thing in your ears,
As you hear what you stole has been stolen from you
