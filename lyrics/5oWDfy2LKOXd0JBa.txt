Make you into dark
Straight into your heart
Sorry all you are
I don't really care

I know you are
Robots, robots
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech
Spoken rabies
Spastic, plastic, battery acid
Yank on the leash
Dragging you backwards
Oh my, closed eyes never see it coming

There's no thing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
Sadistic twist, you'll never learn

Battery acid
Battery acid

Battery acid in my veins
Unidentified remains
Yes button broke to automatic
Irrational dosage of furious static

Erasing what you are
You were

(Jealous) To feel the way you do
(Dementia) The lie you call the truth
(Beautiful) Nothing except yourself, and nobody else
I got nobody else

There's no thing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
Sadistic twist, you'll never learn

Battery acid
Battery acid
