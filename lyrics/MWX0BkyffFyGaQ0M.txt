When the night, has come
And the land is dark
And the moon, is the only, light we'll see

No I won't, be afraid
No I won't, be afraid
Just as long, as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin' stand, by me
Oh-oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky, that we look upon, should tumble and fall
Or the mountains, should crumble, to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no-no-no I won't shed a tear
Just as long, as you stand, by me

And darlin', darlin' stand, by me
Oh-oh-oh, stand, by me
Oh darling, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Whoa-oh-oh, ay-ay
Ma-ma-my, my-ee

If the mountains should crumble to the sea

Ma-ma-my-my-my

When the night, has come
And, and the land is dark
And the moon, is the only, only light we'll see

So darlin', darlin' stand, by me, oh-oh stand by me
Oh darling, stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand, by me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand, oh-oh, oo-oo, oh-oh
As long as I know I got you right here
Right here by my side
Come on, come on, stand, stand right here
