Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young

Girl, the night's not over,
We're not getting older
They can't chase forever.

'Cause in the morning
There's a million years to choose from.
You don't care
Just take one.
Leave a place to rest on.

Because you're too young
Oh, you're too young
Oh, you're too young
Oh, you're too young
Oh, you're too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young
Oh, too young

There goes another morning
Just wrap it up
We own it
This night's so scared we own it
And in the morning
Why'd you tell me
That it's over?
You think you'd do better
To stick with someone older.

Because I'm too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young
Too young

Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
Oh yeah, we're too young
