Your love is fadin' i can feel your love fadin'
Woman its fadin' away from me
Cause you lost your touch its grown cold

As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh Hunny, I'm losing you
Can feel it in the air
It's there everywhere

ohhh, I'm Losing you
Can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be off and gone
Ohh I'm losing you

It's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Could it be i'm losing you
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see
Ohh no i'm losing you

I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me
mmm, mmm, mmm
Your love is fading can feel it fading
Ohh away from me
I feel it in the air
mmm,
I feel it everywhere
ohhh
I'm losing you
I don't wanna lose ya
But i know i wanna groov ya

ohh no i'm losing you
oww, oww
(get out)
oww, oww
oh yeah
(get down there)
I don't wanna lose ya
But i know i wanna groov ya
ohh no i'm losing you

oh yeah, oh yeah
Your love is fading
I can feel it fading
ohh, i'm losing you
