I can be something more, now I see what time is for, now I know how little I can hold
I can be what I'm shown, I will treasure what you know, I won't be the man who walks alone

You, I can make you love me, even when I take it all
and you, I can make you love me, I always do

Always is a word that I never say but I feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
Someday, when I feel like I'll never change
I wanna feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
I fill in the void in my mind
feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
always seems like no time tonight
feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'

Yea you will question my will to take it all in stride, but I know my mind is on the line
if you leave, take with you, all the things you put me through, I don't need the burden to remind

You, I can make you love me, even when I take it all
and you, I can make you love me, I always do

Always is a word that I never say but I feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
Someday, when I feel like I'll never change
I wanna feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
I fill in the void in my mind
feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
always seems like no time tonight
feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'

I'm blown away, by the things I teach you
I found a way to bring up the past and run by to beat you
I'm blown away, do you think I read you
I kinda need you, I kinda need you

and I can make you love me
even when the things you taught me create my heart
and I can make you love me

Always is a word that I never say but I feel like, feel like, feel like tryin'
