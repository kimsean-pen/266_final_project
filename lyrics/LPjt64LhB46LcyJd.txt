My fear and doubt is non
I like you better when you're high
I love your dealer
Yes, I say it all the time
I like that magic in your eye
I know that you know you're my fucking hero

Girl, I'm on what you on
Whatever's in your red cup
Just recognise me when it's a blur
Baby, this is your song
Dance however you want
I'm happy to say that I was there

'Cause I'm some type of witness for ya
They don't see angels, but I see your halo
Let me be that witness for you
I wish the gospel, I'll be your Bible
Oh oh oh

If I could go back into time
I'd probably do the same thing twice
I'd crash into ya, yeah
When our bodies intertwine
You turn my water into wine
I've read about ya
You're some type of saviour, right?

Oh, I'm on what you on
Whatever's in your red cup
Just recognise me when it's a blur
'Cause baby, this is your song
Dance however you want
I'm happy to say that I was there

'Cause I'm some type of witness for ya
They don't see angels, but I see your halo
Let me be that witness for you
I wish the gospel, I'll be your Bible

You know I'd carry the cross
I'd walk the streets, take the screws if I have to
You know I'd carry the cross, darling
Some day, they'll say that we were magic

'Cause I'm some type of witness for ya
Didn't see angels, but I see your halo
So, let me be that witness for you
I wish the gospel, I'll be your Bible
