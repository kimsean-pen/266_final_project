He's got long skinny legs and holes in his pants
I love the way he sings, I've never really seen him dance
He's got high hopes for the future
He's the kind of guy you might say
something like "Maybe in another lifetime"
And really mean it
And I might believe him
Well, who hasn't talked to God like he's a man?
I do it all the time on accident
Sometimes I talk to you that way and I'm sorry baby
'Cause it's me
I leave you with my image and if I ask you to understand

They see what I see
And I see what I get
You know I'm nothing other than human
Human

I want a day with you, evening then to myself
I won't go runnin', not to anyone else
But you'd probably say in some kind of linked way
That you're human and you don't love me like I am

You see what you see
You see what you get
And nothing, nothing else really matters
Human
