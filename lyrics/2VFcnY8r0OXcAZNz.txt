Many long years amongst the trees
Many long years in the ground
To be with one that's never seen
The one that stands and watches over

I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise

With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
And we see no sin

This is what we all have seen
Too many years caring down
Even thought we couldn't believe
It's only clearer in a mirror
Now

I wonder when we'll realize
This is what we got left
And it's our demise
With the water rising
And the air so thin
Still the children smiling
Can we see no sin
