Don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets
Tell me some lies
Give me no reasons,
Give me alibis

Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes

Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

And don't it make my brown eyes

Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
ooo
ooo ooo
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
ooo
ooooo
