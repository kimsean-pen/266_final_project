I think the postman intercepts everything I try and send to you
Cos he's infatuated and he's the fulcrum between us too
And I can't say I blame him cos I'd cheat a priest just to get to you

Oooh ooh oh oh ooh

She works in a dental practice 9 'till 5 how does she manage?
Considering her nights don't pass out 'till 3
So I guess that flossing is he last thing in her health routine

Oooh ooh oh oh ooh

And I don't mid that she gets hammered and goes home with other guys
There's no jealousy 'cos she's little miss pipedream fantasy

I saw her slam back tequila's like Oliver Reed on an Irish stag do
And I'll wait if you stay 'cause foggy London town's not built for me or you
Don't leave miss pipedream cos I love you!

Oooh ooh oh oh ooh

And I don't mind that she gets hammered and goes home with other guys
There's no jealousy though, she'll grind it out with friends but not with me
She's my little pipedream fantasy

Oooh ooh oh oh ooh
