I see you everywhere, I hear you're anywhere
It's just stories is what you told me
And with her fingers crossed, can she connect the dots
In-between what you really mean

But I don't m-mind the games you t-try
To wind me up with and leave me stuck with
Feeling inside so I can't deny the endless cycle, we let it spiral
But love comes round again

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating, my adoration

They say it comes with age, that we will re-arrange
All these stories to things you told me
So let me reminisce, till I can feel your lips
Up against me, in twenty twenty

But I don't m-mind the games you t-try
To wind me up with and leave me stuck with
Feeling inside so I can't deny the endless cycle, we let it spiral
But love comes round again

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating, my adoration

But I don't m-mind the games you t-try
To wind me up with and leave me stuck with
Feeling inside so I can't deny the endless cycle, we let it spiral
But love comes round again

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating

She keeps me calm but keeps my heart racing
All of the time when I am out chasing
Me out my mind, but leaving behind
Contemplating, my adoration
