Take your time
To analyse
Every move they make
Drenched in light
They're terrified
They all need a break

Watch them run
Watch them fall
The greatest fun
It's not fun at all

Acid drops
On burning crops
I won't hesitate
Walking back
The same old track
I just need a break

Watch me run
Watch me fall
The greatest fun
It's not fun at all
