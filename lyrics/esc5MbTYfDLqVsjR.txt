This girl is like a dream
My wildest fantasy
And right when I think I'm gon' wake up
She's pullin' me right back in
To serenity

Girl I can't believe you're so unreal
Oh it's just somethin' about the way you move
You're like a flower in bloom
It's crazy how you can make me
Forget what I've been doin'

Oh it's a problem and growin' more and more each day
Girl whisper your sweet nothings in my ear
'Cause every word can speak to my soul

It's outta my control
Oh when you say my name
It sounds like a song
And I'd listen all day long
Oh I don't understand it
But I can't turn it off
Baby don't ever stop

Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical

I wanna hear you sing it every night
I can't help this feelin'
Like I know your secrets
Hope it lasts forever, I want it, I want it
Whisperin' so gently
Eyelids gettin' heavy
Make it last forever, I want it, I want it

You make me ay, ay, ay
You got me driftin' in and out of this slumber
You make me ay, ay, ay

I know for sure I never wanna wake up
Lovin' the touch of your fingers
In my hair it still lingers
Tell me is it truth or fiction baby
Still can't believe you and me are makin' music each day
Anythin' from your lips got me thinkin' it's all okay
I don't need fortune or the fame

As long as I'm with you
Oh when you say my name
It sounds like a song
And I'd listen all day long
Oh I don't understand it
But I can't turn it off
Baby don't ever stop

Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical

I wanna hear you sing it every night
I can't help this feelin'
Like I know your secrets
Hope it lasts forever, I want it, I want it
Whisperin' so gently
Eyelids gettin' heavy
Make it last forever, I want it, I want it

If I'm dreaming, don't ever wake me up
I wanna hear your melody, the only thing I could need
'Cause if I had to live without you I'd be lost
And in this moment, I want more

Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical

I wanna hear you sing it every night
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
