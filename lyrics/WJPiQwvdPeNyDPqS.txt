Oh start, send me grieves and before breathing

I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me
I was only one and we weren't prepared for one (before dreaming)
I have your voice on tape in a southern accent screaming at me

Know things look lovely to you
Holding back, now and forever sweetheart
know things look lovely
lonely boy, it's midnight and I'll deny
You were walking so peculiar (still so deadly)like you had something to hide
Sweet penance for a sound - it might explode in our hands

Bordered in a brown pigmentation ahh
Where the element guards cut short, turned in and stopped
I've been watching rose giving in and I wish that I could Taper away so
I've been watching rose give in to it severing the ties between mother and son

Know things look lovely to you
Holding back, now and forever sweetheart
know things look lovely
hoping for midnight and I deny
You were walking so peculiar like you (still so deadly) had something to hide
Sweet penance for a sound - it might explode in our hands (it might explode)

oh, I once saw many place the end, I promised the world and a dozen roses.
