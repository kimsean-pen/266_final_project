You had demons to kill within you screaming
With a gun loaded with guilt
You opened their eyes
Love preys the living and praises the dead
In the heart of our hearts, by death, we were wed

Bleed well the soul you're about to sell
For passion deranged
Kiss and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail
For reasons insane
Kill and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
In hell

"No love lost under her will"
I heard you weeping
And on those words, a church was built
To keep the pain in
If death is the answer to love's mysteries
Then bleed on, my darling, to the sound of a dream

Bleed well the soul you're about to sell
For passion deranged
Kiss and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail
For reasons insane
Kill and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
In hell

Bleed well the soul you're about to sell
For passion deranged
Kiss and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail
For reasons insane
Kill and tell
Baby, we're bleeding well
We're dying in hell, hell, hell

We're bleeding well in hell
