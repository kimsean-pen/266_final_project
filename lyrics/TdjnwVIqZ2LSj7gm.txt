We are all comatose
We are overfed and
Under undernourished, yearning for something more
Never starving yet
Never quite satisfied
Carnal but without useful flesh or mind.
Yeah…
I am a walking contradiction
That's found consistency
Consuming everything
All without producing sustenance
In the parallels we struggle
Struggle to upkeep
There is a better way for us to be set free
From all it is we crave
There must be more to life
Than to simply stay alive…
To simply stay alive
We are not the same
As I hope to show
There is a better way
If we just let go
We are not…
We are not the same
We are not…
We are not the same
Let go…
In the tension between devouring want or simple need
It's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve
We are not the same
As I hope to show
There is a better way
If we just let go
We are not…
We are not the same
We are not…
We are not the same
Let go…
We are not the same
And in the parallels we struggle to upkeep
There's a better way for us to be… for us to be set free
And in the parallels (parallels)
We struggle to upkeep (struggle to upkeep)
There's a better way for us to be… for us to be set free
We are not the same
As I hope to show
There is a better way
If we just let go
We are not…
We are not the same
We are not…
We are not the same
Let go…
we are not the same
