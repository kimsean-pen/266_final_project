Wanting meaning, wanting more than the same things
Wanting everything, just to start at the ending
I found another face to show
Just because what you say is what will go

Doubt, in it all for me
I've hit the wall, all that's left for you is doubt
Better you than me, I've so far to fall
All that's left for you is doubt
In it all for me, I've hit the wall that's left for you is doubt
Better you than me, I've so far to fall, but I can't change now

Missing the life gone by that I have lost
I'm missing the better times that I had lost
When you're near me I get tired when you follow
When you speak what you say is what will go. will go
What you say is what will go

Doubt, in it all for me
I've hit the wall, all that's left for you is doubt
Better you than me, I've so far to fall
All that's left for you is doubt
In it all for me, I've hit the wall that's left for you is doubt
Better you than me, I've so far to fall, but I can't change now

Chorus repeat once more
