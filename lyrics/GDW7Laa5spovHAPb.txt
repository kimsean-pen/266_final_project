Setting out
City in your sight,
You want an overview
Of the underground
The pressure's off
So your feelings rise,
You got to hit that peak
Before you crash back down

You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe in a heartland
In a heartland

All mixed up
In the heartland heat,
In a chemistry of
Commotion and style,
You' re thrown in
You've got to lose yourself
Before you find yourself
Back in exile,

You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe in a heartland
In a heartland

You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe in a heartland
In a heartland
In a heartland

I said You got to believe in a heartland
