ts everywhere,
surrounding me,
the heat of it.
It lays so deep inside.
I didnt want you to
wake the lion
that we hushed to sleep,
but its so tender that I dont care
where its leading me.
Last night, we got
married in a taxi.
I swear I love you,
I love you like its no tomorrow.
And I got no time
for second thoughts now.
We got tonight,
and then I have to go.
Oh, my body shivers.
I got this feeling
of time being old.
Its just that
somebody used to say
she had a fear of getting
close to the fire.
Its gonna break my heart.
I know it. Im at a steep now.
Im falling.
Last night, we got
married in a taxi.
I swear I love you,
I love you like its no tomorrow.
And I got no time
for second thoughts now.
We got tonight,
and then I have to go.
