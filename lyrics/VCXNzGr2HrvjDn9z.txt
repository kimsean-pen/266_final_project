I'm falling down
And fifteen thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down
No one is gonna save this town

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here
No, it wasn't here

I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two
No, I will not forget you

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
No

Falling away
You would never see me through
No, I could not forget you
Falling down
Five thousand house burning down
No one is gonna save this town

Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
No

Falling down
Now the world is upside down
I'm heading straight for the clouds
