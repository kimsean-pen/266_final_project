A fiction romance
I love this love story
That never seems to happen in my life
A fiction romance
All love and glory
That never seems to happen in my life

Dreams of love and dreams of pain
And dreams again again again
A gain which can be yours just by taking hold
Dreams that I can realize
Are quite contained within your eyes
Say fiction romance is not so old

A fiction romance
The love of the ages
That never seems to matter in my life
A fiction romance
On magazine pages
That never seems to feature in my life

Dreaming scheming unaware
That quite somewhere some unaware folk
Are not thinking 'bout what they have been told
Something strange is happening to
The way I see the world I view
That fiction romance is not sold

As a fiction romantic
I never expected
All these things to happen in real life
And no fiction romantic
Could ever've predicted
All the things that happen in my life

When I don't know what to do
I just think about me and you
If I was a little stronger then I'd be bold
Something strange is happening to me
I don't know what these shivers mean to you
Is this fiction romance getting hold
