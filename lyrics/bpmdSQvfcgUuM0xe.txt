Oh love
Will you promise
To be mine
And I'll be yours
When the roses grow
I'll be there to smile
And kiss you
Love me more

Only heaven knows
What's in store for us
In this simple act
We call love

You [?] you can't deny
When you heart is [?]
And yet you become his love

So my little one
When you fall in love
The sun and the moon
Always shine for you
But love is blind
You will live to see
When your heart starts to love

Oh love
Will you promise
To be mine
And I'll be yours
When the roses grow
I'll be there to smile
And kiss you
Love me more

Oh love
Will you promise
To be mine
And I'll be yours
When the roses grow
I'll be there to smile
And kiss you
Love me more

Only heaven knows
What's in store for us
In the simple act
We call love

You [?] you can't deny
When you heart is [?]
And yet you become his love

You [?] you can't deny
When you heart is [?]
And yet you become his love

You [?] you can't deny
When you heart is [?]
And yet you become his love

You [?] you can't deny
When you heart is [?]
And yet you become his love
