Raging winds roam over Babylon like a primal chaos spread
Emaciated beasts howl with angel voices
Thou shalt be desolate forever, Thou shalt be desolate forever
In this place shall infuse the venom
Drop by drop, in bloody mire, until the hearth of the earth
O abhorred, for so much in death and carnage you delight
Behold and rejoice, freed from the skein of time
Fulfill your sublime destiny and reveal your divine essence
In fire and hail, in fire and hail!
I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters
Saith the Lord Almighty

In remembrance, they shall pray backwards
As to pray is to breathe God
Words were spoken, a bilious stream alike
As the Spirit gave them utterance
Like a funeral larvae on the tongue
Like a gash on the holy bread
An ignited halo makes the skin taut

Verily I say unto you
It is a God that came to you in malevolence
(And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord
Shall give thee rest from thy sorrow)
And ordained the unity
(Be ye separate, saith the Lord)
What communion hath light with darkness?
Whatt concord hath Christ with Belial?
This congregation was cast out of humanity
Under this dire sun of frost
Like an abominable branch!
