You'll never get that taste out of your mouth
You'll never get the paw prints out of the hen house now
And you can't go back same way you came
Round all the pieces up, but they just don't fit the same

White knuckles
Maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
So let it all come down

So can we let it all out? Let it bleed?
Did you get what you want?
Did you get what you need?
And behind the lines
Behind the wall, tell me,
Was the bed you made really that bad after all?

White knuckles
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles
Maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down

So just how far is far enough?
Everybody needs to sleep at night
Everybody needs a crutch
But couldn't good be good enough?
'Cause nothing never doesn't change
But nothing changes much

Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles
Oh, maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down

Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
Just let your hair down now
White knuckles
Oh, maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down
