You'll be given love, you'll be taken care of
You'll be given love, you have to trust it
Maybe not from the sources you have poured yours
Maybe not from the directions you are staring at

Trust your head around, it's all around you
All is full of love, all around you
You just ain't receiving, your phone is off the hook
Your doors are all shut

All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love
