The stars are getting in and out of automobiles
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real
Keep waiting for a Santa that will never come
A real party not just people who're faking fun
But everything gets erased before it's even said
And all that glitters isn't gold when inside it's dead
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
I went to your concert and I didn't hear anything
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
I went to your concert and I didn't see anything
(Oh Baby) Why won't you talk to me?
(Oh Baby) You just want me empty!
(Oh Baby) You don't say anything!
(Oh Baby) Why won't you answer me?
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
I sat through your movie but I didn't see anything.
I went to your comedy club and didn't laugh at all.
I went to your movie and I didn't hear anything.
I went to your concert and there was nothing going on.
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say anything...
