Yeah you know that algorithm weren't relying on chance
When Deep Blue eyed the champion like a charlatan
His name was Kasparov, the one that all the girls loved
And in the U.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.R. he was a god
Deep Blue was a 64 bit lightning war
He was a data crushing Viking of a Commodore
He was the Mongol horde of the checker board
He was shock and awe with an Intel core
And a thing for the extinction of the dinosaurs

Chuck Norris vs Boris in the Valley of Death
A sky without a world
A shore without a sea
A sun without heat
Shining light you can't see

I used to worry one day they'd have feelings too
But these days I'm more worried that that is not true

Kasparov staked his prowess on his claim to life
And he wasn't about to lose it to a traffic light
But machines don't cry, they don't concede
Like the shogun with the grogan you're about to eat

If silicone is prone to make your dreams come true
You could probably say the same thing about nightmares too

Programmed for the pogrom, RAM set to shock
All the veins in Garry's forehead went POP POP POP
If IBM is here to make your dreams come true
It can probably do the same thing for your nightmares too

If you ain't worried they're gonna to do your work for you
You'll recall they said the same thing about farming too

Kasparov saw our fate and cried out in despair
"we are commanded by the monsters we have brought to bear!
And nobody does the dishes, the turkeys vote for Christmas
Gaslighted by the telephone that put Steve Jobs in business
And no one in the future plays chess, or cares!"
