Wake up at night
Drink your last glass of wine
And put your red lipstick on
You get to the bar
Trying to look hot
But you're not cool
Like the other girls are

And we can dance on the dark side of the moon
Be the freaks no one wants to talk to
We can dance on the dark side of the moon

And don't worry if they're watching us
'Cause we don't see them when our eyes are shut
You don't have to be afraid to touch
So put your hands on me
It don't matter if they want to judge us
'Cause we can dance like freaks

Just one more shot
Then we'll be the last one's standing
Oh, running for the last bus home

And we can dance on the dark side of the moon
Be the freaks no one wants to talk to
We can dance on the dark side of the moon

And don't worry if they're watching us
'Cause we don't see them when our eyes are shut
You don't have to be afraid to touch
So put your hands on me
It don't matter if they want to judge us
'Cause we can dance like freaks

And don't worry if they're watching us
'Cause we don't see them when our eyes are shut
You don't have to be afraid to touch
So put your hands on me
It don't matter if they want to judge us
It don't matter if they want to judge us
It don't matter if they want to judge us
'Cause we can dance like freaks
