Oh, I'm rising from within
I see it every morning
Tell you where the rhythm ends

Is it cold tonight my love?
I whisper through the screen
And there is nothing I can say or do in between

Ooh, it always changes, I don't understand
I keep moving through the edge and now
Here comes a feeling I can't stop
Emotionless and dead
Ooh ooh, yeah
Oh, you said

You played my brother like fire
You walked him through the rain
And ignored all the cold, you known the same
But the feeling that I get
The warmth of your embrace
There is nothing I can do if I am going away

It was all so innocent
You could feel my loving arms
Then I saw you in the moving light
You were standing in my door
Emotionless and bored, ooh ooh, yeah
I've endured, yeah, be one of those

All my way it was in vain
I walked alone in pain
Through the early morning rain
Feel the warmth of my embrace
Hold me underneath your shadow
Once before I get erased

But my love is on the line
I pushed my way through the back
I kept sliding out of time
Now our moon is on the rise
There is always something bigger
Leaning on the other side, yeah

But you wanted me
On the wrong path
I've been hanging on the other side
Keep on pushing back

We belong here
I'll take all I can get
I've been hanging on the other side
I keep pushing back
