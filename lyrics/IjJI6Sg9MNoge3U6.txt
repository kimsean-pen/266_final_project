You thought I was a loner
Till I went out on my own
She said, slow down stranger,
there are two kinds of good.
But I'm always there to win
Oh I wasn't in and then
I guess it's a point of view
Born in December but there's nothing but a cold
gain it something more than.
In my heart, it's a hope
But I'm always there to win
Oh it wasn't anything
Guess it's a point of view
And I know it's hard to be alone

'cause I know it's hard to be alone
Count the days, count the nights, but don't get by.
Safety came in numbers, but all I needed was just one
You're a four leaf clover, you're the only kind of one.
Thought I'm always there to win
Oh it wasn't anything
Guess it's a point of view
And I know it's hard to be alone
Count the days, count the nights, but don't get by,
'cause I know it's hard to be alone
Count the days, count the nights, I don't get by.
And I ain't hanging out to you.
