Words I can't make out
Sights I just can't explain
Can't answer right now
No thoughts on my brain

And if you wanna take me down
You can take me to the ground
Just go 'head and turn around
Never lost but just got found

I think I found love
I think I found love
I think I found love
I think I fou-found love

Tears run down my eyes
Takin in your breath of air
Keep crushin my pride
Some things I can't prepare

And if you wanna take me down
You can take me to the ground
Just go head and turn around
Never lost but just got found

I think I found love
I think I found love (found love, love)
I think I found love (love love luh
I think I fou-found love (luh love love)

This feelin I can't explain
Pleasure then feel the pain
Feelin I can't explain
Pleasure then feel the pain

This feelin I can't explain
(This Feelin I Feelin I Can't explain)
Pleasure then feel the pain
Feelin I can't explain
(This Feelin I Feelin I Can't explain)
Pleasure then feel the pain
