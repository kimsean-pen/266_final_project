Beween the father and his son
Between the city and the one
Between the teacher and the test
Between the journey and the rest

The shining eye will never cry
The beating heart will never die
The house on fire holds no shame
I will be coming home again

Four hundred miles
Without a word until you smile
Four hundred miles
On fields of fire

Between the woman and the boy
Between the child and a toy
Between the following of the west
Between the journey and the rest
