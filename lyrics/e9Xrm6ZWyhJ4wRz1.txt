Down over South Street Philadelphia
Out from Avenue C
I seen it in the eyes
It was ready to freeze
From the valley hotel

I don't care about you
Fuck you
I don't care about you

I see Hollywood boulevard
Welfare hotel
I spent the night in jail
Near the Wilcox hotel

I don't care about you
Fuck you
I don't care about you

I've seen an old man
Have a heart attack in Manhattan
Well, he died while we just stood there lookin' at him
Ain't he cute?

I don't care about you
Oh
I don't care about you

I see man rollin' drunks
Bodies in the street
Some man was sleepin' in puke
And a man with no legs crawling down 5th street
Trying to get something to eat

I don't care about you
Oh, no
I don't care about you
Fuck you

I don't care about you
Hey, hey
I don't care about you
