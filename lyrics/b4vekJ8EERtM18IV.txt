At the Cherry street donut shop
On my way to the parking lot
And the cops are right outside
Want to take you for a ride

I saw you that night
You did look alright
I'll play, beautiful
I can not see your phone (???)

Cherry street donut shop
(???)
(???) running in the parking lot (???)
Helicopters going to Cherry street shop (???)

(???)
And wait for you, my love
Helicopters flying round'
Spotlights shining down

(???)
Say that you all forget
(???)
(???)

Cherry street donut shop
On the sidewalk (???)
(???) running in the parking lot (???)
Helicopters going to Cherry street shop (???)

(???)
(???)
(???)
(???)

I saw you that night
You did look alright
I'll play, beautiful
I can not see your phone (???)
