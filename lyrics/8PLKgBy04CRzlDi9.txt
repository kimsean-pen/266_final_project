I wish, I wish, I wish
I could be what you want me to
I could love you like I'm supposed to do
Fuck you like you need me to
I know that's what you're hoping boo

I wish, I wish, I wish
I could be the girl of your dreams
The one you fantasize about
The one you tell your parents 'bout
You take me and your niggas out

But I keep getting in my own way
And I know that I'm fucking up but I'm really hoping to stay
I'm willing to stay, baby
And I keep giving my demons away
But please believe that ain't me, it ain't me

It's my vultures
Baby it's my vultures
They keep on circling me
Circling me

I wish, I wish, I wish
I didn't love alone a lot
I know you like me in ya spot
But I need room to roam about
That's fucking with your future plots
You see

But I know, I know, I know
I'm never gon' be home to you
I'm never gon' be home by 2
I'll never be this perfect glue
That pulls together what you choose

But I keep getting in my own way
And I know that I'm fucking up but I'm really hoping to stay
I'm willing to stay
Baby
And I keep giving my demons away
But please believe that ain't me, it ain't me

It's these vultures
Baby these vultures
Keep on circling me
Circling me

It's cool, it's cool
I'm not mad at you
If you choose to lose
Your faith in us too
I'll be okay
I know you like shit your way
It's killing me
Cause I won't be
This cliche idea of happy
You know I'll be okay
You know I like shit my way

'Cause I keep getting in my own way
And I know that I'm fucking up but I'm really hoping to stay
I'm willing to stay
Baby
And I keep giving my demons away
But please believe that ain't me, it ain't me

It's my vultures
Baby it's my vultures
They keep on circling me

I'll never be the same after I been
treated like the dirt you've left on my hands
The dirt I had to dig through to sell your
records, to make your money to build your name
I hear the wolves dressed in suits
selling dreams like bait in dress shoes
Can you hear them?

They showed their teeth
Like white pearls
Coated with meat
From all the girls
They liked to eat
I prayed I wouldn't see
These wolves hunting me

They're running fast
See their feet
Those packs of wolves
With suits and deeds
Tempting the girls with pretty things
Just to share them piece by piece

Can't you hear
Can't you hear them howling
Can't you hear
Can't you hear them howling
Ho, ho, hooo, ho, ho, hooo
Ho, ho, hooo, ho, ho, hooo
Can't you hear
Can't you hear them howling
Ohhh
