Crunch... Flesh and bone
Gush... Blood and body fluid
Stench of death
This horrid show is a very bad dream

墮落の園 腐乱気味の果実
This show is very horrid
Do you want to eat me?
飢餓の果て瞳孔は開き 歪む境界線

Don't touch me! Shut up! Damn it! Shut up!
Stop joking

Hope is nil

I destroy hatred in your mouth
Don't blink
Delete a mosaic
This is not an accidental thing
All is a bad dream
I destroy hatred in your mouth
Don't blink
Delete a mosaic
This is a dream
All is a bad dream

You are next...

感情失くし剥き出した本能 赤い口元 飢えた眼
絶無の希望 摂理に喰われる鼓動
誰もが「明日は我が身」と知らず生き 絶望の淵で夢見心地
飢餓のループに今夜は誰が消える?

Don't touch me! Shut up! Damn it! Shut up!
Stop joking
Is it not allowed to betray God?
Answer. Is this right?
Shut up! Damn it! Shut up!
Stop joking
