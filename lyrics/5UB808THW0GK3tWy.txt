Man down
This hardened shell is broken
My fate is bound to what I've done
Regrets - I shuffle down the hallway
Precious time - It's all gone overboard
Here is your calm down pill
I'll never be the same - It'll never be the same
With eyes wide open - My body's floating down the river
This live - What have I confined you for? It's all inside - It's all in silence
When the raven gets its way
A Million thoughts are swept away
And then you leave it all
You leave it all behind

And maybe next time we'll meet again
And maybe I'll be less of a bitter man
When I feel more
I refuse to pay the ferryman - I'm so attached to my temple
He has to burn it down to get me
Ebony demon, shriek all you want - I'm not tagging along
The shade, the burning blackness - It is my protector
Fear before the fall - I can't grasp it all
But at least I'm trying
A light, a smoldering cinder
Getting colder, ashen
And letting all this go
I'm not letting go
I'm not really done here
I won't let go
Life's to short to be wrong
And maybe next time we'll meet again
And maybe I'll be less of a bitter man
And if I could do it all over again
I'd be the same man all over again
When I feel more
