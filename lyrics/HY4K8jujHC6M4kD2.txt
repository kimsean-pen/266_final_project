When I lived in the woods,
When I lived in the woods,
When I lived in the woods,
Everything was alright.
Everything, everything was alright.
Never knew where we are,
Never needed enough,
Never need enough, just where we are.
Everything was alright.
All the people, all the people were living the light.

As I breathe in time
To be where I was,
And if I need you,
Baby, give me all your love.
If we need
To find the time,
We'll never see
All your love.

If you find yourself in need,
If we gotta go then bring along some company.
And if you find yourself alone,
If we got it all then we got just what we need.

Why? Why? Why?

As I breathe in time
To be where I was,
And if I need you,
Baby, give me all your love.
If we need
To find the time,
We'll never see
All your love.

When I lived in the woods,
When I lived in the woods,
When I lived in the woods,
Everything was alright.
Everything, everybody was alright.
Well ya gotta get out, gotta make some money,
Baby, gotta grow,
Baby, gotta get bigger.
All the people will lift it up.
All the people, all the people will help you out.

As I breathe in time
To be where I was,
And if I need you,
Baby, give me all your love.
If we need
To find the time,
We'll never see
All your love.

Why? Why? Why?
