Step outside in the midnight rain
King of the queen of the streets again
Got young love runnin' through our veins
And it keeps us numb like Novocaine

Alright, we can go all night
'Cause we gotta whole lot of fight in us
And I see a lone road, that we gotta follow
Before tomorrow catches up

Oh, we just take it easy
Hold on to this feelin'
Oh, off and to leavin'
And we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow

(Caught up in the afterglow)

Can't stay here, but you can't go home
Did you hear that line somewhere before?
And you look just fine on your own
But we look better in the afterglow

Alright, we can go all night
'Cause we gotta whole lot of fight in us
And I see a lone road, that we gotta follow
Before tomorrow catches up

Oh, we just take it easy
Hold on to this feelin'
Oh, off and to leavin'
And we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow

(We ain't got nowhere to go)
(Caught up in the afterglow)

Oh, we just take it easy
Hold onto this feelin'
Oh, no, we don't need a reason
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow

When the lights go down come find me in the afterglow
Waiting to be found, I'll meet you in the afterglow
When the lights go down come find me in the afterglow
Waiting to be found, I'll meet you in the afterglow
