This is the modern world
This is the modern world

What kind of fool do you think I am?
You think I know nothing of the modern world
All my life it's been the same
I've learnt to live by hate and pain
It's my inspiration drive

I've learnt more than you'll ever know
Even at school I felt quite sure
That one day I would be on top
And I'd look down upon the map
The teachers who said I'd be nothing

This is the modern world that I've learnt about
This is the modern world we don't need no one
To tell us what's right or wrong
This is the modern world

Say what you like 'cause I don't care
I know where I am and going to
It's somewhere I won't preview
Don't have to explain myself to you
I don't give two fucks about your review

This is the modern world that I've learnt about
This is the modern world we don't need no one
To tell us what's right or wrong

Modern word, this is, this is, this is
This is, this is, this is, this is
Hey, we don't need no one
To tell us what's right or wrong

This is the modern world
This is the modern world
