I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing, you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

Baby let's forget the morning, forget the morning
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They say that your body is full of sin
But they can't see the world that we're in
Your body is the door through where peace begins
I give you more, we can take a spin, spin

Baby let's forget the morning, forget the morning
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh

I got paid and all my dreams killed
True, true, true
Now they're waiting in my car for you
You, you

I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing, you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

Baby let's forget the morning, forget the morning
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger
Baby let's forget the morning, forget the morning
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
