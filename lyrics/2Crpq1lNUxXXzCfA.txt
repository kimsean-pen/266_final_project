I don't wanna fucking be here anymore
I'm leaving forever, if you'll miss me whatever, I don't care
I'm tired of your face and the way that you hate everything

You make me want to start smoking
Cigarettes so I die slowly
Anything that's bad for me
Yer killing me
Yer killing me

I don't wanna fuckin hear it anymore
I know you got problems and we've all got problems too
I'm sick of being your shoulders, you know I need shoulders too

You make me want to start rolling
Fat ass blunts 'til I start choking
Anything that's bad for me
Yer killing me
Yer killing me
