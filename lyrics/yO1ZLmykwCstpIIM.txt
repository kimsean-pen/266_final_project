When you found me
In that dungeon
Bright but tired of the punches
Oh that sweetheart
You were always mine

Hide beneath the forest branches
Do your dance, take some chances
Oh the sky has never looked so blue before

Oh and I reach out to you
I reach out to you

Call out my name I will find you
If you're reeling I will find you
Your burdens lifted now they are mine
Oh mine darling
Stand up tall and know I'll champion
All those things locked in your dungeon
Nothing you could say could ever make me flinch

Oh and I reach out to you
Oh I reach out to you

You're bright as fire
I hope you know
You wind me up
And let me go
I hate to see you so low
So I will sing this solo
My love for you
Don't ever doubt
You fill my heart so sing it out
While we keep moving forwards
This is a song for the birds

Fathers, mothers
Sisters and brothers
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
You can change the day

When the darkness comes to take me
Hold me down upon awakening
Tied and bound to you
You have my soul forever

And I
I reach out to you
Oh I
I reach out to you

You're bright as fire
I hope you know
You wind me up
And let me go
I hate to see you so low
So I will sing this solo
My love for you
Don't ever doubt
You fill my heart so sing it out
While we keep moving forwards
This is a song for the birds
