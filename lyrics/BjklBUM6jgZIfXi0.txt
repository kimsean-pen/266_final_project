It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At christmas time
We let in light and banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of Joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
The bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of Doom
Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life, Ohh

Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all? Ohh

Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun

Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world

Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world

Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
