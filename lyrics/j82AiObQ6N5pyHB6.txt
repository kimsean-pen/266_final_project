Shadow Stalk, were you lost Scavenging
empty camps, dry as bone, quietly?
Silent storms glow remote and light the seas
in our eyes you are fright, frightening
Sheltered Hunt, will you run to the trees?
or to the town, our stomping ground silently?
Cabins stir. Face obscured, you watch us sleep, oh
in your eyes, we are fright, frightening
I won't run from you
