Now, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let her be
Mmmm, she is the little queen of spades, and the men will not let her be
Everytime she makes a spread, hoo fair brown, cold chill just runs all over me
I'm gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if the last thing that I do
Eee, gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if it's the last thing that I do
Well, a man don't need a woman, ooh fair brown, that he got to give all his money to
Everybody say she got a mojo, now she's been usin' that stuff
Mmmm, mmmm, 'verybody says she got a mojo, 'cause she been usin' that stuff
But she got a way trimmin' down, hoo fair brown, and I mean it's most too tough
Now, little girl, since I am the king, baby, and you is a queen
Ooo eee, since I am the king baby, and you is a queen
Le's us put our heads together, hoo fair brown, then we can make our money green
