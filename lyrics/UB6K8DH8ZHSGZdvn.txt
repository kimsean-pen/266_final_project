Floating over empty streets. Away from pain, away from everything.
Pray that we will survive the night. Buildings falling, the soul vaporised.
Watching you sleep, but I know that your heart has grown cold.
Let me dream if only for tonight, that we leave together in the first morning light.
Alone and forgotten. I bow my head in shame.
Before you all answers reveal. So I sink my sorrows in the sea.
