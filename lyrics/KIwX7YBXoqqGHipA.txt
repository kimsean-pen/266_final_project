La da da...
So sweet...
In my daydream...
Every night you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep but it's a fantasy

every night you creep into my dreams
it's so real
in my daydream
it's just a sweet
it's just a sweet
and oh
in my daydream
it seems so real
you touch me...

come into my dreams
come to me
but it's just a fantasy
it feels so sweet
but it's just a dream
oh baby
it's just a sweet
fantasy

daydream is all that i can do
I feel rapture over you

in silence
i keep it to myself
come take me
don't want nobody else

sho do ooo
and it's sweet...
so sweet...

you're like a candlelight
burning in the sky
but it's just a fantasy
oh baby
come into my dreams
its just a fantasy...
