Ask me no questions, tell me no lies if you don't mind, and come with me.
There, where the sun flies.
There, where the sky is bluer still is where we'll be.
Take nothing with you.
I'll give you everything I can, have no fear.
For if you stumble, or should you fall down on the way, I'll be there.
Close your eyes, my love.
Close your eyes, gently, come.
And in the morning, don't tell a soul of what you saw, it's just for you.
Keep this a secret, make me a promise that you will.
I'll make one too.
Close your eyes, my love.
Close your eyes, gently, come.
Ask me no questions, tell me no lies if you don't mind, and come with me.
There, where the sun flies.
There, where the sky is bluer still is where we'll be.
