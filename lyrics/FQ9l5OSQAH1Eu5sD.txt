She likes to walk
Down the lanes to the fields
In the woods she finds a stream
The water feels cold in the cup of her hands
Down among the trees
She spies butterflies
Against the leaves
With one brush of her hand
They are captured and taken
From the top of the hill
Looking over the edge
So far out of reach
Further and further away
She likes to see
All the colours of the wings beneath the glass
Then she turns down the light
To keep them from fading away
She likes to walk
By the stream down to the shore
From the source
To the sea
Looking over the edge
Where the sky meets the waves
So far out of reach
With just one step
She'd be free
With one bound, with one leap
A part we all play
Oh, the end is the start
Is the place where we came from
A part we all play
Oh, the end is the start
Is the place where we came from
Looking over the edge
Counting the waves
Follow the faultlines
Up the side of the hill
All the marks of an ancient sea
You can see the traces
At the end of the hedgerow
Out of the field
Looking over the edge
As far as you can see
Under the ordinary light
She loved the colours of the wings against the green
The first thing she saw and the last she hopes to see
The parts we play, the start the end and everything,
Everything in between
She likes to walk
By the stream down to the shore
From the source
To the sea
Looking over the edge
Where the sky meets the waves
So far out of reach
With just one step
She'd be free
