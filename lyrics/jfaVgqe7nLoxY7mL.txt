Remember before the fall
It was the summer before
900 parking lots 81 songs in a row
Our international tour, coffee in Amsterdam
Walking the crescent moon castles in English sand

Rendezvous, sidestage, parlez-vous, anglais
Get up and grab our guitars in basements
and backyards singing together under the stars

It's such a beautiful world
Life is beautiful
Sometimes it's all too much but thank God that we're not alone
I look to you to my left you
Look to me to your right
We look together to the future
standing side by side

Put our hands up head down, both eyes closed breathe in heart pounds

And then we stop making sense
Walk off the stage in a trance
Perfect our English tans
Climb over barbed wire fence
Turn up the radio
Overnight to the next show
Locked on a bridge in Berlin
Back of a Mercedes-Benz

Rendezvous, sidestage, parlez-vous, anglais
Get up and grab our guitars in basements
and backyards singing together under the stars

It's such a beautiful world
Life is beautiful
Sometimes it's all too much but thank God that we're not alone
I look to you to my left you
Look to me to your right
We look together to the future standing side by side

Put our hands up head down both eyes closed
Breathe in heart pounds

After we walk off of the plane back at JFK
Climb in a stranger's car cross a bridge halfway
Statue of Liberty close enough to reach
Seems like a dream from a world that seems so far away, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Remember English Birds and American Beer
Newcastle acappella, blue green room was built out of mirrors
Two black umbrellas in the sun underground
Carrying two black guitars our echo swimming around

Rendezvous, sidestage, parlez-vous, anglais
Get up and grab our guitars in basements
and backyards singing together under the stars

It's such a beautiful world
Life is beautiful
Sometimes it's all too much but thank God that we're not alone
I look to you to my left you
Look to me to your right
We look together to the future standing side by side

It's such a beautiful world
Life is beautiful
Sometimes it's all too much but thank God that we're not alone
I look to you to my left you
Look to me to your right
We look together to the future standing side by side

Hands up head down, both eyes closed breathe in heart pounds
