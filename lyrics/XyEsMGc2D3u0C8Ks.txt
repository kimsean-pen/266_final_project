All the lies aside
We gasp the same air tonight
Reading the burdened signs
We all die sometimes

Swept in dust we are
Swept in black I am

Searching what's left
I reflect my trails
When we've collided
You've put me down to sleep
Something so pure
Fragile and feeble
Craving attention
Fly high and sink deep

I am the victim of greed

Swept in dust we are
Swept in black I am
Swept in dirt we are
Swept in black I am

Your arrow I will be
In this life of disbelief
We'll find a way to go to sleep
Forever taking me in
