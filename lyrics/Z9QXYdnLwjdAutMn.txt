Can you guess where i'm calling from?
the las vegas hilton,
i know it's hard to hear,
it's just the echo on the line.
Yes, that's right i'm calling from
the las vegas hilton,
i just want to say that i'm feeling fine.
I'll be home on a monday,
somewhere around noon,
please don't be angry,
i'll be back with you real soon.
I was hoping to catch a glimpse,
of the man from memphis,
they told me that he had gone,
never leaving a trace.
I just could never get involved
with those one-armed bandits,
sure am craving for the smile on your face.
I'll be home on a monday,
somewhere around noon,
please don't angry,
i'll be back with you real soon, yeah.
You looked so lovely when i left i nearly didn't go,
twelve thousand miles is such a long way,
help me get to grips with hollywood,
you're getting through to me,
hollywood, you're in my movie.
I'll be home on a monday,
somewhere around noon,
please don't be angry,
i'll be back with you real soon.
(repeat)
Can you guess where i'm calling from?
yes, that's right i'm calling from
the las vegas hilton.
