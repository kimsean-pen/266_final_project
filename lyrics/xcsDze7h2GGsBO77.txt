Are you afraid of me?
Because I'm afraid of you
Cause I'm afraid of what this could mean
And I'm afraid of what this could do

Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner

These bittersweet notions of forever
Blossom and find me in my dreams
If we should die, I hope we die together
If not, at least I'll know just where we'll be

Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner

Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
