Bow down in position
Against the polished steel
This is something different
You like the way this feels
No time for asking questions
No time for wondering
We've had enough of you now
You've heard everything

You want to play a new game
You put on this blindfold
You do what we tell you
You do as you're told
Used to be the leader but
Now comes the time to serve
Maybe we'll show some mercy
Maybe you'll get what you deserve

Countdown to the end, gonna make it go faster
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster
Countdown to the end, can I get a little faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master

You've left quite a mess here
Under your stewardship
You thought you'd figured it out but
You'll find your place in this
You think its so convincing
You think you see the truth
Give us so many things now
We've got in store for you

Countdown to the end, gonna make it go faster
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster
Countdown to the end, can I get a little faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master

Come on down
