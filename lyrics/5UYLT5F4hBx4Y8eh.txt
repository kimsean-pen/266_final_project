In my arms, I'll keep you warm
Be the eye of a storm
In another world,
we never knew I could stay close to you Another world
You go back home to let them see
That you are ok and now happy

In another world,
you'd make it through
Live a life full of hope
You can feel the rain washing over you Somewhere is a lonely day
When the demons are full awake
We're alive to live for
Love love love
Somewhere in another world
Another world
