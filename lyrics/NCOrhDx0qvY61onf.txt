Baby, just ask once more
'Cause I saw your door wide open
The floor's still freezing
Well, Hailey, I was sick, and I'm still quite unwell
Tell me it's you or nothing at all

'Cause I stole your soul
You said I'd never be able
But oh, the whole world, is still on my string

Second time now and you've done this before
Drive around the back
So I can't see them
But you're still freezing
Well, let me take your coat, and your keys, and this car
'Cause I've been unwell
Far too long now

'Cause I stole your soul
You said I'd never be able
But oh, the whole world, is still on my string, ohh

But oh, the whole world, is still on my string
But oh, the whole world, is still on my string
Yeah, is still on my string
But oh, the whole world, is still on my string
Yeah, is still on my string
But oh, the whole world, is still on my string
Yeah, is still on my string
