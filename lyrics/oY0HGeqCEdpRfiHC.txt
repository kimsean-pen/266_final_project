There is still so much to see
There is still so much to do
I can't be more than half way through
I know I'm wasting precious time
But I'll take it in my stride
I've got a lot of things to put right

Don't get upset
It's not my time yet
I ain't saying my goodbyes
Don't get upset
It's not my time yet
I ain't saying my goodbyes

You won't take life out of me
You can't take it out on me
I know a good enough reason will come along
I can't tell you how it feels
Ain't no other way you'll heal
All these young men obsessed with death

Don't get upset
It's not my time yet
I ain't saying my goodbyes
Don't get upset
It's not my time yet
I ain't saying my goodbyes

You don't get upset
You don't get upset
You don't get upset
You don't get upset
