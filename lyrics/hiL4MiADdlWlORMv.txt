When our time is up
When our lives are done
Will we say, we've had our fun
Will we make a mark this time
Will we always say we tried

We're standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
This is all we got now
Everybody scream your heart out

All the love I've met
I have no regrets
If it all ends now, I'm set
Will we make a mark this time
Will we always say we tried

Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
This is all we got now
Everybody scream your heart out

Standing on the rooftops (wait until the bomb drops)
This is all we got now (scream until your heart stops)
Never gonna regret (watching every sunset)
Listen to your heartbeat (all the love that we felt)
Standing on the rooftops (wait until the bomb drops)
This is all we got now (scream until your heart stops)
Never gonna regret (watching every sunset)
Listen to your heartbeat (all the love that we felt)
Scream your heart out
Scream your heart out
Scream your heart out
Scream your...

Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
This is all we got now
Everybody scream your...
