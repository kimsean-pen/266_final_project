When I was sturdier I'd talk about how
"Certainly we all will die.
We will eat shadows, we will bury candles.
Die."
When I was sturdier I thought,
"So what? I am forever mountainous!"
I bravely said, "No death of any kind
could matter to my mountain mind.
Come years, Come surging, I am tall!"
When I was "sturdier" I was secretly scared,
and the fear was blinding.
As you can see, I am no rock.
As you can see, through mountain wind,
What I actually am is thinning clouds.
