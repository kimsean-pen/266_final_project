"I wanna say thank you to every single person that is here
You rule!
Thank you for getting the album
Thank you for coming down today"
"Yeah"
"And thank you for being awesome in general!"
"Hey, wait"
"Thank you very much!"
"Give it up for yourselves!
Give it up for you guys!
Alright! Here we go!"
"Last song we gonna play is a cover of barbie girl!"
"This is She Looks So Perfect
Thank you so much!
Sing along if you know it!
Good night!"

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Simmer down, simmer down

They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
But look around, we've worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
"You!"
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

You look so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down

Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out, I found myself alone
"Lemme hear it"
just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket, and a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
I made a mix tape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

You look so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

You look so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
"HANDS UP!"
that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now,
"And everybody gotta dance"

You look so perfect standing there in my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
that I'm so down
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now,
that I'm so down

"THANK YOU!"
