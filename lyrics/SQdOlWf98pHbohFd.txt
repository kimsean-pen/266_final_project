Oh, how I need you now!

Want you beside me

Oh

How I need you!

Alone with a heavy heart

Why can't you see me?

Feeling my luck wear thin

Drive away with me
Straight into the rain
Never coming back again
See the rivers flow
Heading for the ocean
I know that's where we belong

Meet me up in the light
Now that it's calling
Sing to a quiet stream
Oh, how I long for light
A light that won't leave me
Never to go away

(And I know you know)
Let the ocean bathe me
(And I know you know)
Let the ocean bathe me
(And I know you know)
Let the ocean bathe me
(And I know you know)
Let the ocean bathe me
(And I know you know)
Let the ocean...

I know there's a love star
Shining down on the old house
Nowhere near the tried lines
I know where the keys are
The keys to the old house
Nowhere near the guidelines

And I know you know
See the rivers flow
And I know you know
(And I know you know)
Let the ocean bathe me
And I know you know
See the rivers flow
