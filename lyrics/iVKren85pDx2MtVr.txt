Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you Julia
Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia
