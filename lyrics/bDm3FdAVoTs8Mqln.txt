Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Take me home, take me home
Oh, can't you see I want you near
Take me home, take me home
Ooh, baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere
Your place or mine
Just a one night affair
Would be so fine

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
So much in heaven

Take me home
Take me home

One night with you
Lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
So much in heaven

Take me home
Ooh, baby, take me home
Come on and meet me, baby
Come on and take me, take me home

Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home

Music, candlelight, so right
Take me home
In your arms tonight, hold me tight
Take me home

Just me and you forever
Take me home, home with you
We can be together
Take me home, home with you

Take me home with you
With you, I've been walking
Right out that door

One night with you
Lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

Well, I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
So much in heaven

Take me home, take me home
Ooh, I wanna feel you close to me
Take me home
Ooh, with you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
Take me, take me home, I'm with you

Come on and take me
Ooh baby, baby, take me home
(Take me, take me home, I'm with you)
You'll be lying next to me
Baby it'd be ecstasy
(Take me, take me home, I'm with you)

Oh, can't you see I want you near
Baby, baby let's get out of here
(Take me, take me home, I'm with you)

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
Take me home
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
Take me home

I gotta be with you
I gotta be with you
Take me home, home with you
I gotta be with you
I gotta be with you
Take me home, home with you

I want you to take me
I want you to take me
Take me home, home with you
I want you to take me
I want you to take me
Take me home, home with you

I want you to take me
I want you to take me
Take me home, home with you
I want you to take me
I want you to take me
Take me home, home with you

I want you to take me
I want you to take me
Take me home, home with you
I want you to take me
