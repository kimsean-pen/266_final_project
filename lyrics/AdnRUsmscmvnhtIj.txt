He don't remember how it got there
He had a number written on his forearm
It spelled disaster

He entered the club scene
All hoping, all hoping for dancing
He was looking, a'looking so stunning
His clothes reflected light, all right

She sat, she sat in the backseat
The car was plush but had no hea
And no, not no one was blushing
Their technique was so damn right, all right

And he read the note in the black light
He thought he read minds and was not right
That line still made him seem charming
His clothes were shining, shining
