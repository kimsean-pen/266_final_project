Well, when I'm good
I'm very good
When I'm bad
I'm better

I wanna play like you
You wanna play like me
I know you're all I got now
I want you all up in my
Heart in my soul
I know you feel it
Don't let go
We're gonna miss the fire

'Cause I'm dangerous
I only wanna catch the buzz
Now, boy you know you like me
You never wanna see me fight it
And I'm leaving at dusk
There's only one bass to trust
Yeah, boy you know it's soothing
The way the beat's got me moving
And I'm

Too much tonight
We could be alone tonight
We could be alone tonight
My heart my heart
We could never be apart
We could never be apart

Come on now baby now run
With the red street light on
Come on now baby now run
'Cause I got my sight on

Well, when I'm good
I'm very good
When I'm bad
I'm Better

Coming out when I call you
Making love at a corner
And I can feel we've started something
And I can feel we've started
Something
Something
Something

I wanna play like you
You wanna play like me
I know you're all I got now
I want you all up in my
Heart in my soul
I know you feel it
Don't let go
We're gonna miss the fire

'Cause I'm dangerous
I only wanna catch the buzz
Now, boy you know you like me
You never wanna see me fight it
And I'm leaving at dusk
There's only one bass to trust
Yeah, boy you know it's soothing
The way the beat's got me moving
And I'm

Too much tonight
We could be alone tonight
We could be alone tonight

My heart my heart
We could never be apart
We could never be apart
Coming out when I call you

Well, When I'm good
I'm very good
When I'm bad
I'm Better

Coming out when I call you
Too much tonight
We could be alone tonight
Making love at a corner
And I can feel we've started something
My heart my heart
And I can feel we've started something
We can never be apart(something)
Something

Come on now baby now run
With the red street light on
Come on now baby now run
'Cause I got my sight on
