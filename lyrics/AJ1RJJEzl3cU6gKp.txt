Rainy girl
I can't wait to meet you
And I can't wait to hear your name and sing it too,
the skys above
Rainy girl.
Wash away my memory
Swimming through infinity, for you will be my love
Sometimes when i'm falling, in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess were going everywhere together
Rainy girl
The sun is coming up for me
Blackbird on a wire sings a song
So blue
Sometimes when i'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
Guess were going everywhere together
Rainy girl
Home at last, following the cloud
sometimes when i'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess were going everywhere together
Guess were going everywhere together Rainy girl.
I can't wait to meet you.
