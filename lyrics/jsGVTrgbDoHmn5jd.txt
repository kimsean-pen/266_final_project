Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
Takin' my friends out for a mighty good time
Drinkin' bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Couldn't buy me no friends,
Have no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it,
Till the eagle grins
I said nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket, you ain't got one penny
And your friends, you didn't have any
Just as soon as you get up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long-lost friend
Oh lord without a doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
I say nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you
When you're down and out
