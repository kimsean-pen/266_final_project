I need a cigarette
Those fuckers talked over my whole set
But I don't have any time to reflect
I gotta sell some shirts to try and make the rent

I think I'm sick of transit
My anxiety is spinning on a compass
I used to be a romantic
Now I'm a dude in a laminate

I can't see shit, I'm blinded by the light
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight
I'm on the road with no one I love in sight
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight

And make that drink stiff
I gotta drown out this emptiness
I'm tired of playing all my old hits
But my new songs are too depressing

I'm hungover in a hotel bed
I'm gonna hop in a big red van
Go to some city, do it all again
I hope tonight it turns out different

I can't see shit, I'm blinded by the light
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight
I'm on the road with no one I love in sight
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight

I can't see shit, I'm blinded by the light
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight
I'm on the road with no one I love in sight
I swore that I'd quit but I need a drink tonight

I need a cigarette
Those fuckers talked over my whole set
