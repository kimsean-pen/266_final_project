Hollow, my ancestors have access
Hollow, I'm falling down the abyss
Hollow, looking for some answers

Generations of mothers sailing in
Somehow they all were shipfolks

Hollow, the ground is opening up
Swallows, me up
The trunk of DNA

Trunk of DNA, trunk.

Now come forth
All species
Come forth
Hollow.

Like a bead in necklace
Thread me upon this chain
I'm part of it
The everlasting necklace

Jewels after jewels after jewels after
Jewels after jewels after jewels

Breathe out
I yearn to belong, let me belong, let me belong
