V.u. version
------------------------------------------

Lisa says that it's allright
When she needs to be alone at night
Lisa says that she has a fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone.

Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says
Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes his trip
She knows her heart will beat

Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says
Looking for a part and some action
Going to make it feel okay
But what do you find
When the time has come on, now
Look at it run

Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says
Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says...

Lisa says on a night like this,
It'll be so nice if you'd give me a kiss.
And lisa says for just one little smile,
I'll sit next to you for a little while.

Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says
Lisa says you must be some kind of fool,
The way you treat everybody so cruel.
And lisa says you must be a funny kind of guy,
The way you're always staring at the sky.

Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says
If you're lookin for a good-time charlie,
Well that's not really what I am.
You know a good-time charlie's wastin time.
Cause the good-time charlie,
That's not baby where I am.
You know that good times just seem to pass me by.

Lisa says on a night like this,
It'll be so nice if you'd give me a kiss.
And lisa says for just one little smile,

I'll sit next to you for a little while.
Lisa says, lisa says, lisa says, lisa says

Why am I so shy, why am I so shy.
Good times you know they just seem to pass me by.
Why am I so shy.
First time I saw you I was talkin to myself
I said wow she's got such pretty pretty eyes
Such pretty eyes...

Now that you are next to me I just get so upset
Oh will you tell me why am I so shy
Why am I so shy, why am I so shy.
Good times you know they just seem to pass me by.
Why am I so shy.

Lisa says on a night like this,
It'll be so nice if you'd give me a kiss.
Lisa says you must be some kind of fool,
The way you treat everybody so cruel.
