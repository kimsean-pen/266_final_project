Everything looks bright standing in your light
Everything feels right, what's left is out of sight
What's a girl to do? I'm feeling you
You're on my mind

I wanna be with you
'Cause when you're standing next to me, it's like wow
Ya know your kisses seem to set me free, it's like wow
And when we touch, it's such a rush, I can't get enough, it's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Should I hesitate when it feels this great?
Don't wanna make a big mistake
Don't wanna make ya think I'm playin' games
I'm just tryin' to say

I wanna be with you
'Cause when you're standing next to me, it's like wow
Ya know your kisses seem to set me free, it's like wow
And when we touch, it's such a rush, I can't get enough, it's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, what?
It's like wow

Have I waited long enough? My mind and heart are all mixed up
Feeling higher than a cloud, all my senses are like wow
