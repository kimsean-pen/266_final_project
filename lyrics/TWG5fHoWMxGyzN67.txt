Winters night, Oslo
Just a burning light in the snow
Keep me warm, shelter me from the storm
On this night, Oslo
Brandnew start, Oslo
Lighting my heart, red glow
Drinking wines, dance on the loaf of Christ
In the burning streets, oh Oslo
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
You're the one that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
I hope you'll still be here
Next year
We'll go home and become close
In upper coast and we're so close
I keep you warm, shelter you from the storm
Winters night, Oslo
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
You're the one that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
I hope you'll still be here
Next year
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna go
You're the one that's in my heart
And it makes me feel at home
I never wanna leave
