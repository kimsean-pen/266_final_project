Hey man, what are you doin' tonight?
How 'bout me and you go for a ride?

Said you'd be late
You're barely awake
It's all I can take!

You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I don't wanna see you around this place
You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I'm better off alone anyway

Man, just how much shit are you gonna talk?
I know you spent all night in a bathroom stall
I think you're a fake (FLAKE!)
That's okay, this is LA
But we're not gonna make it after all

(Come on) Said you'd be late
(Come on) You're barely awake
Gimme a break!

You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I don't wanna see you around this place
You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I'm better off alone anyway

You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I don't wanna see you around this place
You're a flake
And I need a, need a break
You're a flake
I'm better off alone anyway
