I can tell by the way that you feel
Something ain't going your way
Jeans too tight and your hair ain't right
We all get some of those days
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, you know it's gonna be okay

Take it down, shake it out
On the floor, you'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothing
Everybody's something
You and your friend
Everybody jumping
Look at us now
Everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside
Get it what you're inside
Open your eyes
You deserve the spotlight
Don't be from them
Everybody's something

Oh, oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight

I got enough of, oh, my face
Wish I could press "Delete"
We all got something we don't like
Even Angelina Jolie
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, don't be going M.I.A.

Take it down, shake it out
On the floor, you'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothing
Everybody's something
You and your friend
Everybody jumping
Look at us now
Everybody shout out

Oh, in the spotlight
No matter what you're outside
Get it what you're inside
Open your eyes
You deserve the spotlight
Don't be from them
Everybody's something

Oh, oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight
Oh, in the spotlight

I can tell by the way you talk the talk
That something ain't going your way cause
Your jeans too tight and your hair ain't right
Well, we all get some of those days just
Take another deep breath, try to hit your reset
You know that I can relate, throw your
Hands in the air now, let me hear you shout
It will get out of my way

Take it down, shake it out
On the floor, you'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothing
Everybody's something
You and your friend
Everybody jumping
