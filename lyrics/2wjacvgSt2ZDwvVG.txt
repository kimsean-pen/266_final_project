I know you gotta go
There's some shit you gotta do
And Oh, all this talk is bringin' me down

Oh yeah, It's getting late
All these things we've been saying
It's the same, oh circle goin' 'round

But baby don't get up yet
Don't get up yet

I'm not through
I'm not through

It's always been true
Gravity's not my strong suit
And maybe I've gone on a little long

But if you, just give up now
Get on up and walk on out
Might as well just call the whole thing done

So Baby don't get up yet
Don't get up yet

I'm not through
I'm not through

Baby don't get up yet
Don't get up yet
Baby don't get up yet
Don't get up yet

I'm not through
I'm not through

I know you gotta go
I know you gotta run
But, babe I'm not done

I'm not through

I know you gotta go
I know you gotta run
But, babe I'm not done
