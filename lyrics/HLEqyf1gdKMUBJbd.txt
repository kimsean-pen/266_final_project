Paroles de You Pulled Me Through:

i was in the darkness
i was out in the cold
seemed nothing could heal this
this hole in my soul
you reached out your arms to me
held out your heart to me
pulled me back from the edge
thought i reached the end.

when i was drowning
when i was so confused
you you You Pulled Me Through
i was in the shadows
lost, nothing left to lose.
you, you, You Pulled Me Through.

you gave my faith back
faith was so hard to find
you gave me my life back
you were my lifeline
the love that you gave me
is love that has saved me
your strength is what made me strong
you held me and i held on

when i was drowning
when i was so confused
you oh you You Pulled Me Through
i was in the shadows
lost, nothing left to lose.
you, you, You Pulled Me Through.

out of the dark
into your arms
into the light
your love saved my life

when i was drowning
when i was so confused
you, ooh you, you (pulled me through)
(when i was drowning) when i was drowning
i was so confused (when i was confused)
yea you ooh you yea you You Pulled Me Through
(You Pulled Me Through, you) you, You Pulled Me Through
