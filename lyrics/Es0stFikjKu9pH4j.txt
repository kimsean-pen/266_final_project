Golden hills
You live below
That bridge is everlasting
Bold and bright
You blazed the night
That trail is never fading
Not without the fleeting light

Range of Light
Adorned in white
In fields, first dawn is yawning
Not without that fleeting light

The future
Unfolding
The fall light
Instilling
Hot granite
Climbed Half Dome
The tan lines
In sun-chrome
And westward
Found tea pool
And beach walks
With Tiny
The steeple
The belfry
Surpassing
The old scenes
Come chanting
The
And cliff side
We'll shore up
Small winged
The big trees
Wawona
You miss me
The future
Unfolding
The fall light
Instilling
Hot granite
Climbed Half Dome
The tan lines
In sun-chrome
