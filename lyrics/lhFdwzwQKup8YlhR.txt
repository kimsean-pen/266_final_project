Where's the snow?
Fall again
From the sky
And let it burn
Feeling numb
From your demons
Key the vault
Burying love
Praying to God
Ain't she'll met you?
They should die
And let it go

Lurks, the snow
Feel again
From the sky
And let it burn
Feeling numb
From your demons
Key the vault
To be in love
Praying to God
That she'll met you
They may die
Let it go
