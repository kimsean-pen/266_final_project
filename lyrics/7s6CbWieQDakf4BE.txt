When I met you
You were so unique
You had a little thing I'd love to keep
Every movement
Carried much mystique
I knew right then I'd carry on
To you I knew my heart belongs
You know, you

You give me something
Something that nobody else can give
And my heart
Has started thumping
You know now you're the one I truly know I dig

Like the sunbeams from
A perfect summer day
Heaven only seems a step away

When I'm with you
I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message gets through
There's never been someone like you

I had nobody
But on you I'd lean
'Cause you got these little things that I
I know I've never seen

You know now, you
You give me something
Something that nobody else has got
And this love
That I've been wanting
Oh baby's turning out to be too fast to stop
You know now (ooh)
You give me something

Something that nobody else can give
See my heart
Has started thumping
You know babe
You're the one I truly know I dig

Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
You give me something that nobody else can give
Ooh, will you give me... something
You give me something that nobody else can give
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
Ooh, will you give me... something
