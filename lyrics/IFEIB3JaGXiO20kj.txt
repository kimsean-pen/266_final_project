I'm keeping an eye on the future
An eye on the past
And the present in my pocket
Just in case I need a door

Into a brave new world
Where all solutions end up with my head
Buried to my neck in sand.
Enough, enough

Bowing down to disillusion
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Evolution
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected you're not paying attention
It's too good, too good, not to have an effect.

I'm keeping an eye on the pulse
An ear to the track and
Penance in a locket
I'm dropping from the highest floor

When it hits ground
I watch it smash to pieces
Songs of liberation
Echo from the dust, the dust
Enough

Bowing down to disillusion
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Evolution
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected you're not paying attention
It's too good, too good, not to have an effect

Enough, Enough, Enough, Enough, Enough
Bowing down to disillusion
Hats off and applause to Rogues and Evolution
The ripple effect is too good not to mention
If you're not affected you're not paying attention
It's too good, too good, too good
Yeah.
