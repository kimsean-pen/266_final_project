Where I come from, silvery tree
Diamond on leaf, can't you see it?
Why did I leave?

The clipping of wings, the draping of kings
I was here long before you
Now kindly leave

This was far, far away
And I knew I would not stay
Down on the ground I'll be found

I opened up my mouth
Didn't make a sound
I could not cut you down, down, down

I was a girl and you were a boy
With innocent thoughts getting colder
Than it was before

This was long, long ago
And I knew we'd never know
Down on the ground I'll be found

I opened up my mouth
Didn't make a sound
I could not cut you down, down, down

Down, down, down
Could not cut you down
