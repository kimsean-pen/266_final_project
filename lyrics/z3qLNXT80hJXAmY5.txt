So long to all of my friends
Everyone of them met tragic ends
With every passing day
I'd be lying if I didn't say
That I miss them all, tonight
And if they only knew what I would say

If I could be with you, tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take
The light behind your eyes

One day, I'll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark
Just remember
You will always burn as bright

Be strong and hold my hand
Time it comes for us, you'll understand
We'll say goodbye, today
And we're sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry
Then I'll tell you just what I would say

If I could be with you, tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take
The light behind your eyes

I'll fail and lose this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember
You will always burn as bright

The light behind your eyes
The light behind your

Sometimes, we must grow stronger
You can't be stronger when I'm gone
When I'm here, no longer
You must be stronger and

If I could be with you, tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take
The light behind your eyes

I failed and lost this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember
You will always burn as bright

The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes

The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
