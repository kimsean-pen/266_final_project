Tell me when it hurts
'Cause I can't keep finding out
Tell me when you cried
'Cause I can't keep breaking up

Just when I convinced myself I couldn't live without
Your coincidence, it never seemed to get me down

But
I'll follow into
I'll follow this into the darkness
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly

Tell me when the lights start shining down on all our teeth
Only to (?)
The song keeps playing on
When it stopped I never (?)
I keep running on and no way to turn

I'll never slow down
I'll follow this into the morning
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly

I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly
