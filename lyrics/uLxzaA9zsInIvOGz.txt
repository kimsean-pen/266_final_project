Made a thousand copies of myself
I send them out to you
For everyone to listen to
A girl like me for once
I'm moving in to your life, every life
I made a thousand copies of myself
A stalker in your speaker
Sending out true love
A stalker in your speaker
Reaching out for your love
Hear me out
I can't live without you watching me
I'll help you out, you can't live
Without your own copy of me
You can have a duplicate of me
It's not for free but
You're one of my closest friends you're
One of thousand, yes you are
My mother says I can't be loved
By everyone, yes I can
A stalker in your speaker
Sending out true love
A stalker in your speaker
Reaching out for your love
Hear me out, I can't live without you
Watching me
I'll help you out, you can't live
without your own copy of me
I'm in the left speaker
I'm in the right speaker
I'm in the upfront speaker
I am in the far speaker
I'm all around, almost like god
So praise me, hold me up high
Push up the gain, turn off the light
And kiss me, kiss the membrane
A stalker in your speaker
Sending out true love
A stalker in your speaker
Reaching out for your love
Hear me out, I can't live
Without you watching me
I'll help you out, you can't live
Without your own copy of me
