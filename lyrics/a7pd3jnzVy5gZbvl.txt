I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
Now, see her walk by
Peppermint coat
Button-down clothes
Buttoned up high
Diamonds and stones
Hang from her hand
Isn't she smart?
Isn't she grand?

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me

Now, silver and gold
Strawberry clothes
Money will buy
Something to hold
See in her eyes
Nothing will last
Like emerald stones
And platinum

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me

Now, silver and gold
Strawberry clothes
Money will buy
Something to hold
See in her eyes
Nothing will last
Like emerald stones
And platinum

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
I knew her when winter was her cloak
And spring her voice she spoke to me

I knew her when summer was her crown
And autumn sad how brown her eyes
