Prey on me, come hold me down
Shoot the arrow through my chest
Why do you like to watch me bleed?
Why do I keep saying yes?

How did you get me here again?
Why you're twisted, why you're so unfair?
Given all of this unholiness
But you're the only one who's in my prayer

And I pray for the day
That you call
Out my name
Say that I am the one

The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love
The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love

I don't wanna fight the feeling
There's gotta be some good in this
Wicked love, wicked love

What gives you that confidence?
That desire to have all control
I wanna find an innocence
And believe you're just a tortured soul

Because the way you make me feel
So beautiful go to rot
I don't wanna be disposable
But I let you treat me like a toy

That you play
Pull my strings
Getting me to do all matter of things
Say that I am the one

The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love
The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love

I don't wanna fight the feeling
There's gotta be some good in this
Wicked love, wicked love

Like the devil on my right hand's shoulder
Your heart couldn't get much colder
And I pray for the day
That you call out my name
Say that I am the one

The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love
The only one that can deliver you from
Wicked love, wicked love

The only one that can deliver you from
I don't wanna fight the feeling
There's gotta be some good in this
Wicked love, wicked love
