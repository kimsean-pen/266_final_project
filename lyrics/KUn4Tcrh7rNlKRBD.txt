I said her from the city
so her got to witty, witty

She said him from the country

so him got to be funky, funky

Mama i'ma Millionaire but I feel like a bum.
Mama i'ma Millionaire but I feel like the only one.
I, I, I, I woke up early this mornin,
I don't think ya'll heard me,
I woke up early this mornin,
I don't think ya'll heard me,
I woke up early this mornin.
I don't think think ya'll heard me,
I woke up early this mornin,
but i still ain't seen the sun.

Where there is cheese there are rats
Where ever there are rats there are cats
Where ever there are cats there are dogs
If you got the dogs you got bitches
Bitches Always out to put
Their paws on your riches
If you got riches,you got glitches
If you got glitches in your life
Computer turn it off and then reboota
Now you back on
Can't just put the cap on the
Old bottle once you pop it that will spoil it
Gone and drink it and enjoy it.
Mama i'ma Millionaire
