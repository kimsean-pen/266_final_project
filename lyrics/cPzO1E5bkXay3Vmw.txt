I wonder where we'll be
Will everything we see still look the way it does today
Will everything we have be everything it is
If we go our separate ways.
Down by the river every summer
We had nothing but time on our side
Talking about forever how we'd always be together

Life keeps us runnin'
Chasin' and fallin'
But we won't let go
When the world keeps on turnin'
Our hearts are hurtin'
But we won't let go

I wonder where we'll be when were thirty-three
Will we still be who we are
Will everything we know be everything we hoped
Will we still have this world
Another cold December and I can still remember
The way
You say
We'd always be together no matter what the weather

Life keeps us runnin'
Chasin' and fallin'
But we won't let go
When the world keeps on turnin'
Our hearts are hurtin'
But we won't let go

When the distance hurts and it all gets worse
These are the times that (we will remember)
When the darkness fades we will still remain
Inseparable, unstoppable, invincible

Down by the river every summer we had nothing but time
Talking about forever how we'd always be together

Life keeps us runnin'
Chasin' and fallin'
But we won't let go
When the world keeps on turnin'
Our hearts are hurtin'
But we won't let go
