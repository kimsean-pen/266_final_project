We would stay up 'till quarter to three

I didn't mind it, wasn't up to me

We would stay up late, the night was long

Then we would hide when the sun would start to come

Lay your hands on me
(Like you did a hundred times before)
Is this what you need from me?

We used to feel the light

I believe it's true
Running through the night

Feeding off our hope
Holding on to me so I couldn't get away

But I don't have a reason to stay
I just need you

We would get bored then we would get high

I didn't mind, it happened all the time

We'd stay in bed 'till quarter to three
We didn't care, it was only you and me

Lay your hands on me
(Like you did a hundred times before)
Is this what you need from me?

We used to feel the light

I believe it's true
Running through the night

Feeding off our love
Holding on to me so I couldn't get away

But I don't have a reason to stay
I just need you

We used to feel the light

I believe it's true
Running through the night

Feeding off our love
Holding on to me so I couldn't get away

But I don't have a reason to stay
I just need you
