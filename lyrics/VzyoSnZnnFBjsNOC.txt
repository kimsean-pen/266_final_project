Gazing at gold, the ancient crime
Rise up, fall down
Cities come alive and they will die
Rise up, fall down
Ten thousand years are left behind
Rise up, rise up tonight

Given your sentence,
you're handed the snakes of divine

Suffer the scourge by the powers invested in night
Running the course of the wolves and they're killing our kind
Oh how their claws come ripping

Suffering peace, the endless time
Rise up, fall down
Gazing at gold, the ancient crime
Rise up, fall down
Cities come alive and they will die
Rise up, fall down
Ten thousand years are left behind
Rise up, rise up tonight

Blacked out sky, and beliefs in pillars time
Manifest death and our killers come to life
Breaking this spell and end my master's life

Repelled
Repelled

Blacked out sky, and beliefs in pillars time
Manifest death and our killers come to life
Breaking this spell and end my master's life

Repelled
Repelled

Blood trickles down through histories
Given your sentence,
you're handed the snakes of divine
Blood trickles down through histories
Given your sentence,
you're handed the snakes of divine

Gazing at gold, the ancient crime
Rise up, fall down
Cities come alive and they will die
