Many times I've been told that I should go
But they don't know what we are, baby
Then they not see the love in you, the love I do
And I'll stay right here

Sweet, sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing I am sure of
That I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever

Sugar wishes don't change what is real
Or how it feels in the bad times
For whatever is he is mine all the time
And we'll get by with our troubles

Sweet, sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing I am sure of
That I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever

Aah Sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing that I'm sure of
See I, I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever

Baby
Would I ever find, my sweet
Just the two of us, my sweet
That we've come this far together, baby
So I'm here to stay, my sweet
Cause without you baby, my sweet
I can't go any faster

Aah Sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing that I'm sure of
See I, I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever

Sweet, sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing I am sure of
That I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever

Aah Sweet baby life is crazy
But there's one thing that I'm sure of
See I, I'm your lady, always baby
And I love you now and ever
