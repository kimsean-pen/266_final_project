From the fall I hold the word conviction
And the thrill to the swell is in your golden touch
But the flesh is weak and without reason
So I slave to your beat and soul for all time

God give a little love
Bring me back a dog in the next life
God give a little love
Wanna be a dog in the next life

When you strike with soul and quick precision
I'm snagged by a nervous twitch and cold desire
But they say the wretched get their kingdom
Breathe on, it's my time, let's go, we all die

God give a little love
Bring me back a dog in the next life
God give a little love
Wanna be a dog in the next life

The trouble is me, you
The trouble is me, you
Oh, the trouble is me, you
The trouble is me, you

God give a little love
Bring me back a dog in the next life
God give a little love
Wanna be a dog in the next life
