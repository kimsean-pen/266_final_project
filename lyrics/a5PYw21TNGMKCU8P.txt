You're so bad for me
And I know it
But here I am in you're arms
And, yeah, we're crawling like a secret
But it's just the calm before the storm
Cause baby, you're lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
You're lips like fire
Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline
Your voice follows like an echo
Won't someone wake me from this dream
The bluest skies turn to black clouds
And the wind is drowning out my scream
Cause baby, you're lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
You're lips like fire
Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline
Late at night, telling me "If I was a rose, you'll be the thorns and you won't get
better"
But I say "Baby, you're more like a stab", stand in the rain cause I like the weather
Even though when we're done know I've left these ashes
Baby, those lips like fire
My blood like gasoline
Sparked the fire
That burned down everything
Lips like fire
And my blood like gasoline
When we're striking
Burning up everything
Smoke is rising
It's getting hard to breathe
You're lips like fire
Ignite my gasoline
My blood like gasoline
Ignite my gasoline
Cause baby your lips like fire
Left burns all over me
