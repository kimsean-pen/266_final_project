Disgraced.
Expendable, we are not really real.
Mirage of solitude,
Is what they try to heal.

And I will not be made to feel,
We are sealed in a fake charade.

Spewing vile atrocities,
Bringing existence to its knees.
I will manifest my sins,
And I will kill mercy within.
Immersed in this hypnotic spell,

Influenced by the hate that swells.
I'm not terrified anymore,
There's nothing left but open sores.

Disengaged.
Relinquish the reality I've known.
I'm feeling like I'm alienated,
From my own.
And I will not be made to feel,
We are sealed in a fake charade.

Spewing vile atrocities,

Bringing existence to its knees.
I will manifest my sins,
And I will kill mercy within.
Immersed in this hypnotic spell,
Influenced by the hate that swells.
I'm not terrified anymore,
There's nothing left but open sores.
