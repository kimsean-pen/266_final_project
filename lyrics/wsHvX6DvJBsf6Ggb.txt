I still hang on every word
in the world of faded memories
where your still in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
you look as if your major Tom has lost control

I must hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my faith in you
I cant hold on
this happens all the time
I still find my way to you

If a dreams all that I've got
then I wish your in a fairy tale
where your still in love with me
I could see it in your eyes
the look as if your hero fell and lost his soul

I must hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my faith in you
I cant hold on
this happens all the time
I still find my way to you...

To you...
To you...
To you...

I must hold on
This happens all the time
I still find my faith in you
I cant hold on
this happens all the time
I still find my way to you
