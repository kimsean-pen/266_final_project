Now you've got to breathe
It's only where your feet fell
People so cool
Somebody wants you
A lover come back
I want to dance like her
Like nobody's watching
But nobody's watching

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
feel real Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing oh

Even when you know
Hits you hard
Leaves slow, comes back fast
When you can't take it
don't swallow your pain
Been around once
It'll be around again

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing .
feel real Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing

That's the time it took
To calm these things
Better to have been with than live without it
Hold yourself, howl and scream
Finally feel everything joining underneath.

Now you've got to breathe ya
It's only where your feet fell
People so cool
Somebody wants you
A lover come back
I want to dance like her
Like nobody's watching
But nobody's watching

Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
feel real Now
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing

That's the time it took
To calm these things
Better to have been with than live without it
Hold yourself, howl and scream
Finally feel everything joining underneath.
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing
Now ya ya. feel real now. oh oh ohh.
Forever meant nothing when we had nothing yaaaaaaaa.
