My eyes have adjusted to dark
And so has my heart
The weight of the world has covered me
I'm in over my head
Am I living or dead?
Can anyone hear me calling out?
I'm calling out

I'm finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
That I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me out before I am buried beneath

I built this house on the shore
All I wanted was more
Then I felt the sand start shifting
I saw the cracks in the walls
I painted over them all
I tried my best to just ignore
I can't ignore

I'm finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
That I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me out before I am buried beneath

I thought I was climbing out
But it's dragging me down
What's hidden here with me?
Thought I was alone
But it pulls me deeper now
I can't escape

I'm finally breaking
So where are you now?
It's been such a long time
That I've tried to live without
I'm suffocating
I need you to breathe
So reach down and pull me up
Pull me out before I am buried beneath
