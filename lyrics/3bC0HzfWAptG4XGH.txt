Fuck an introduction, bitch
You already know
$uicide
Death row
Riding slow mo in a 4 door with no hoes
Kicking it
Toe to toe with the po-po
All of the smoke that I blow I become a no show
Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard got your ho froze in a snow globe
Leave 'em hollering "Oh no!"
More so when I pour up
When I glo up, don't show up
You know what?
Don't throw up the motherfucking set
*59 on the grey place a bet
Slit wrist same color as the vette
Cigarette smoke etiquette
Forget the Old Testament
I'm more reckless then the almighty heaven sent
Yeah we never fucking met again
Snake skin belt cutting off my blood flow
Check the motherfucking severance
Jacket full of bullets check the motherfucking letterman

Ticky tricky Time
That's why it's $uicide till the fucking afterlife
Leaving a fucking knife right next to the seat
Thinking you want to die when you move close to me
Nose bleeds for the dope fiends sleeping next to me
Hopefully I will just be in a bad dream
But it seems that the codeine turned me into a dope fiend
Now I'm in a nightmare as my mind screams for that more money, more murder
More junkies, more serving
No running, no turning
No swerving on an ice cold road
Yung Scarecrow be looking like death row
Blood colored bathrobe with an ice cold ho ya know?
Fifty nine grey killers looking for a fucking homicide
