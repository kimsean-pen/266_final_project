I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

If I had
The money to go to a record store
I would
I-I would

If I had
The money to go to a record store
I would
I-I would

Go, to the record store
Go to the record store
(Go to the record store
Put records in my clothes)

Go, to the record store
Go to the record store
(Gotta walk out the record door
Past that record man)

Go to a record store
And put it in my clothes
And walk past that record man
Got to have the sticky hands

When your ass is broke
When your ass is broke like me
Like me

Go to that record store
Steal some record man
Go to that record store
Steal some records man

I'm telling you
I'm broke
I'm telling you
I'm broke
But I'm surviving and I can cope

Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddys made me

Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

It's 8 o'clock
And I got nothing to do
Can't go to the club
So I guess I go to the record store

Visit my record man
With my sticky hands
Walk out that record door
With the records in my clothes

The records in my clothes
What the f*** is you gonna do?
What the f*** is you gonna do about it?
Nothing

Push it, push it, push it, push it

Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it

Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it

I'm a Hustler baby
(Push it, push it, push it, push it)
That's what my daddy's made me
(Push it, push it, push it, push it)

Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
(Push it, push it, push it, push it)
That's what my daddy's made me
(Push it, push it, push it, push it)

Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
