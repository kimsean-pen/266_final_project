I'm sentimental
So I walk in the rain
I've got some habits
Even I can't explain
Go to the corner
I end up in Spain
Why try to change me now?

I sit and daydream
I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes
There they go on the floor
Go away weekends
Leave my keys in the door
Why try to change me now?

Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk and they stare, so I try
But that can't be 'cause I can't see
My strange little world just go passing me by

Let people wonder
Let 'em laugh
Let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown
Why try to change me now?

Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk and they stare, so I try
But that can't be because I can't see
My strange little world just go passing me by

So let people wonder
Let 'em laugh
Let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down.
Don't you remember I was always your clown.
So why try to change me?
Why would you want to change me?
Why try to change me now?
