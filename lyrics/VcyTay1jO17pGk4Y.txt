We know our reckless ways
Will never last forever
We're young, it's our escape
Perfection from the mirror

We're hollow Hollywood
Without a closer look
We're icons on display
Thirsty for affirmation

And we're always down to party
And we'll never go out of style
Rolling like a plastic army
Don't forget to fake a smile

Doing everything we can
To stay high and never be alone, no
And maybe that's why we're feeling
So loved, so lonely...

So lonely...
So lonely...

So loved, so lonely
So loved, so lonely
So loved, so lonely
So loved, so lonely

Skin deep, expensive friends
No flaws and no emotion
We pose for every trend
And post the perfect moments

Why work on what's inside
When you can hide behind
High fashion 'til we die
Chasing our own reflection

And we're always down to party
And we'll never go out of style
Rolling like a plastic army
Don't forget to fake a smile

Doing everything we can
To stay high and never be alone, no
And maybe that's why we're feeling
So loved, so lonely...

So lonely...
So lonely...
So lonely...
So lonely...

So loved, so lonely
So loved, so lonely
So loved, so lonely
(So loved, so lonely)
