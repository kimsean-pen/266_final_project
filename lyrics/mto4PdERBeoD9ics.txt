What I like about you
You hold me tight

Tell me I'm the only one
Tryin'a come over tonight
Yeah!

Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true (that's what I like)
That's what I like about you (that's what I like)

You really know how to dance
When you go, up, down jump around
Think about true romance
