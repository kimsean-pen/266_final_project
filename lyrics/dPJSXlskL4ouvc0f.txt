If God wills this time tomorrow
Bound for Boise via plane
Willful mispronunciation of my destination's name
I'd like to write a sequel to
"The state that I am in", sic

If God wills this time tomorrow
In the early morning rain
I'll unpack the boots I borrowed
And turn back the way I came
I'd like to write a sequel to
"The state that I am in"
And I'd like to call the song "New Wine, New Skins"

"God's will" or "come what fortune gives"
Or is this truly how you'd choose to live:
Managing the narrative?

Come, unfastening android limbs in the moonlight through translucent skin
Now we've both been there and back again
To the state that I'm no longer in
With carbon fiber lips whereby came thought reflex personified
Now a scorpion in the sky, harmless as a butterfly

You can pin and mount me likewise

If you fail first, some warm, bright day
I'll unperform at your unmarked grave
And you can tell me what those eyes have seen
But for now the Creek-don't-rise routine
With churning engine, fix my head
Up north in the Gold Fork riverbed
From the misuse of intelligence and all I wish I'd said pours out
New wine, new skins

"God's will" or "come what fortune gives"
Or is this truly how you'd choose to live?
Or is this truly how you'd choose to live?
