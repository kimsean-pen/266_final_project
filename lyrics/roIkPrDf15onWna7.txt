There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
Something strange going on tonight

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
Something strange going on tonight

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
