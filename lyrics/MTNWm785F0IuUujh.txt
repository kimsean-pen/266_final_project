If I lose my head
I'm sorry
I don't wanna go
so slowly
No I won't forget
don't worry
'Cause I know you're the one
And only

Hold tight
I will meet you right here
Late night
Promise I won't disappear
I'll find us
A way out of here
Alright

If I lose my head
I'm sorry
I don't wanna go
so slowly
No I won't forget
don't worry
'Cause I know you're the one
And only

Deep down
I know something's gotta give
But now
I want everything but ease
I know now
The end is so near
Alright

I don't want to lie
But something ain't right
If I did explain
Would it blow your mind?

If I lose my head
I'm sorry
I don't wanna go
So slowly
If I lose my head
I'm sorry
I don't wanna go
So slowly
No I won't forget
Don't worry
'Cause I know you're the one
And only
