Maybe...
Oh, if I could pray, and I try, dear
You might come back home, home to me.

Maybe
Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand
Ooh, you might understand.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe... yeah

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, dear
I guess I might have done something wrong
Honey, I'd be glad to admit it
Ooh, come on home to me!
Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe... yeah

Well, I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, babe
Ooh, honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do
Can't you see I'm still left here
And I'm all alone in needing you

Please, please, please, please
Oh, won't you reconsider, babe
Now come on, I said come back
Won't you come back to me!
Maybe, dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe
Let me help you show me how.
Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.
Ooh!
