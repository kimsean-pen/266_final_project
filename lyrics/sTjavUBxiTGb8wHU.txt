Everyone's getting so high
Losing their minds
Looking for you
Looking for you
I don't even know what I'm doing here
Why don't you just tell me?
Cause I'd rather be lonely

You are so happy
Your heart is strange
You wanna love me
But honey, that ain't okay
You're not so heavenly
Not much a euphony
But in the morning, it might just change

Oh, baby, won't you stop it
You and I haven't got it

Oh, baby, won't you stop it
You and I haven't got it, got it

Now I don't even know what to say to you
I feel like you're getting to me
And I know that's what you're into
Your face isn't enough (never enough)
To make me stay, stay, oh

Oh, baby, won't you stop it
You and I haven't got it

Oh, baby, won't you stop it
You and I haven't got it, got it

Do you think that you can have me tonight?
I think my- Think my heart is alright
I know, baby, think that I've got all the time
But in a few hours, I'll be out of my mind

Oh, baby, won't you stop it
You and I haven't got it
