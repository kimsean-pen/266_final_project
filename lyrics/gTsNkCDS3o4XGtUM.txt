Life could slip away in absent minded numbness
I'm only sayin' this 'cause I wish for the best
When you always stay in self-incarceration
I thinks it's such a shame

Don't stay home this time, no, don't stay home
If he don't have to, he don't want to
Don't stay home this time, no, don't say no

Oh, how I'd like to diffuse your time bomb anger
It's screaming danger danger
This kind of world, don't care if you're home
So you better get some

Don't stay home this time, no, don't stay home
If he don't have to, he don't want to
Don't stay home this time, no, don't say no

Everything I'm sayin' you can dismiss
Because I sat alone on this past Christmas
I deserved to be alone
But I guess I should have gone home

Hey, don't break the mold kid, just eat around it
Yeah, that's what I did
I'll be running around the block for no apparent reason
Somethin' you'll catch me doin' in any season
Gotta break a sweat man gotta go bust out
Biddy by by by by, good-bye to the drought

Don't stay home this time, no, don't stay home
If he don't have to, he don't want to
Don't stay home this time, no, don't say no

Don't stay home this time, no, don't stay home
If he don't have to, he don't want to
Don't stay home this time, no, don't stay home
