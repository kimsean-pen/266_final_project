I just want time in a tree
I need a place just for me
Somewhere that I can be free
Keep the faith and just be
What you'll be

I guess rules are there to break
But I make mistakes like they were handed on a plate
When I try to leave sometimes, I'm standing in the way
I'm on the edge of crying all the time, 'cause I can't human right

What a state

I get wound up, from the ground up
And I don't know why
Turn the sound up, drown the noise out
Swallow, don't cry
Got an anxious heart, and it's stone made
Can't take paper or heartbreak
Did Billy Joel have self esteem?
Maybe Vienna wouldn't wait for me

I just want time in a tree
I need a place just for me
Somewhere that I can be free
Keep the faith and just be, what you'll be

Do you ever feel like, you could live a real life?
Everybody else in the real world
You could be a real girl
You could be a wizard. You could be in NASA
You could write fiction, you could tame raptors
Most days I struggle and I get snappy
Fuck all that, I just wanna be happy

Swimming against the current, am I wrong?
Can you show me a warrant, honestly, I'm a bomb
Abhorrent, I'm on it, get it, I've got it
I wanna be 10 again, just me and sonic
And nobody telling me I should be more than I am
Back when I had a plan

I just want time in a tree
I need a place just for me
Somewhere that I can be free
Keep the faith and just be, what you'll be

I've seen things that I never should've seen
Said too many things I didn't mean
Hurt myself too many times to count
I need to let it out, and just release

Been lying to myself too long
Been trying by myself too long
I can't relax, I'm too distracted
I can't hack it, uh

I'm needy, greedy
Love me, feed me
Let's be a family
It'll take a village to make a man of me
So why couldn't you love me?
It's all I need

I just want time in a tree
I need a place just for me
Somewhere that I can be free
Keep the faith and just be, what you'll be
