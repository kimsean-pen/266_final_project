If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got have till I am dead.

If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got have till I am dead.

Now I've got these chores
Now I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done

Now I've got these chores
Now I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done

If I (x9)

If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got have till I am dead.

If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got have till I am dead.

Now I've got these chores
Now I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done

Now I've got these chores
Now I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done

If I (x36)

I only want the time
To do one thing that I like
I want to get so stoned
And take a walk out in the light drizzle.
At the end of the day
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching

At the end of the day, when there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching

Its not going to happen.
