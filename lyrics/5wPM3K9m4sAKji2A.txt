So baby tell me
What's the deal with your new boyfriend?
He wears a hat to the side
With a bill he doesn't want anyone to bend
I heard a knock at the door
She walked in
It's a sin to keep her begging for more
I watched her clothes hit the floor
I could never say no
It's a game, she's to blame
But who's keeping score?
You can tell by my grill
That I've done this before
So let the games begin
So baby tell me
How does it feel to break and bend?
You just can't choose between us two
It's a game you'll always lose
I hope that's him at the door
Will the truth finally find her?
Will she run will she hide?
The truth's creeping up slow
It's a game, she's to blame
But who's keeping score?
You can tell by my grill
That I've done this before
So let the games begin
It's the thrill
It's the thrill
It's the thrill that I live for
It's the thrill
It's the thrill
It's the thrill that I live for
It's the thrill (it's the thrill)
It's the thrill (it's the thrill)
It's the thrill that I live for
It's the thrill
It's the thrill
It's the thrill that I live for
So let the games begin
It's a game, she's to blame
But who's keeping score?
You can tell by my grill
That I've done this before
It's a game, she's to blame
But who's keeping score?
I'm not in it to win
You can tell by my grill
That I've done this before
So let the games begin
Yeah, let the games begin
