crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming/confusing
this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling/i can't seem

to find myself again
my walls are closing in
(without a sense of confidence and i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
i've felt this way before
so insecure

crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting/reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection
it's haunting how i can't seem...

crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal

confusing what is real, confusing what is real
