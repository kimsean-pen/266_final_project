there it was the land of decay
we should pack our things and run away
rest in the quick sand
shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand
sink slowly not take flight
let silence take us at daylight
take a deep breath as we go, as we go

wanting higher
wanting higher up
wanting higher
'til morning forces us to climb back down
i'd rather stay, i'd rather let us drown

what a harsh unpleasant hello
the paranoia i've learned to live with although
i will never shake what's there behind
your songs are still playing in my mind
all that white only turns you blue
look after me and i'll look after you
take a deep breath as we go, as we go
