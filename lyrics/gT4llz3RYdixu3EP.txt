I'm tired of sitting around and waiting
On things that ain't gonna come
I want it all on the table
I want to know what I've done
I should be singing your praises
And not here banging this drum
I'm tired of sitting around and waiting
I'm moving on

I'm moving on
I'm moving on

I remember the first time I met you
Your heart was cold like a stone
You said, I better forget you
Better leave you alone
But then you reached right inside me
You showed my heart where was home
I remember the first time I met you
I thought my time had come

I thought my time had come
I felt my time had come
I felt my time had come

Well if you've got blood in your heart
If you've got flesh on the bone
You should be playing your part here
Not rushing off all alone
We should be planning on a windfall
Instead of banging this drum
I'm tired of sitting around and waiting
I'm moving on

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

I'm tired of thinking about you baby
Waiting for you to come
One day you're gonna leave me, maybe
And I'll be long gone
I should be plan your praises
Instead of banging this drum
I'm tired of thinking about you baby
I'm moving on

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

One day you're gonna need me, maybe
And I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Yeah I'll be long gone
Long gone
Long gone
