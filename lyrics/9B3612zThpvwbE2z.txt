It's not the way you smile
That touches my heart
It's not the way you kiss
That tears me apart

Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
('Cause baby, it's you)

You should hear what they say about you
They say you've never, never, never been true, oh, whoa, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I'm gonna love you any old way

What can I do
When it's true?
(Don't want nobody)
('Cause baby, it's you)

Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home I cry over you
What can I do?
(Can't help myself)
('Cause baby it's you)
(Wah-sha-la-la-la, la-la-la)
(Ooo)
