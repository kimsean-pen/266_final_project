Major revelation; come to your corps
Sign the disclaimer win hope for us all.
No, I won't mind being in her arms all night
All tangled up in our woollen slumber
No, wait

D.I.L.E.M.M.A

You don't even pay attention.

Her elegance bathes me in grace
Perfectly ambient, it kills the ringing tinnitus.

Alone, through time zones to Asia running
Lost to the scent of burning heroin.
No I won't mind her, not even if I try
Spinning continents collide on a bedside globe light.

D.I.L.E.M.M.A

She can't even get arrested.

Her elegance, bathes me in grace
Perfectly ambient, it kills the ringing tinnitus.
Her elegance, an infinite hum
An air so ethereal, it's clearing my lungs, curing me.
You don't even pay attention.
D.I.L.E.M.M.A
She can't even get arrested.
Her elegance.
