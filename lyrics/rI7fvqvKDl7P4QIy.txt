Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he turn up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

So here it is
Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your Granny always tell you
That the old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

So here it is
Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What will your daddy do
When he sees your mama
Kissing Santa Claus?
Aha

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow
Will to start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head
Then you've been slayed

So here it is
Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is
Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is
Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
