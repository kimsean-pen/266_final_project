You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns, man
And it makes you feel real small

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles, broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on your hands

You run around and spray paint
Graffiti on everybody's wall
You think that's bitchin', man
That ain't nothing at all!

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles, broken glass
But it ends up with a swift kick to your ass

You yell out in defiance
Backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns, man
Makes you feel real small

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles, broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on your hands
