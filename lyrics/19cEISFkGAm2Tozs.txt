Did we lose our minds?
Were we ever fine?
Did we lose it all?
Oh, were we both at fault?

How did we let us get here?
You're supposed to save me from me
I save you
Guess we'll see where life takes us
Hope to meet again

No way I'd live without you, mmm
No way, no way, no way
Did we lose our minds?
Were we wrong or were we right?
Was it bad timing?
Was something missing?

How did we let us get here?
You're supposed to save me from me
I save you
Guess we'll see where life takes us
Hope to meet again
