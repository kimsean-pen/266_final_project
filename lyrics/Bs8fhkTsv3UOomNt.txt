Can you feel the wind
Of Venus on your skin?
Can you taste the crush
Of a sunset's dying blush?
Stars will always hang
In summer's bleeding fangs

Can you feel the rings
Of Saturn on your finger?
Can you taste the ghosts
who shed their creaking hosts?
But seas forever boil
Trees will turn to soil

Stars will always hang
In summer's bleeding fangs
Seas forever boil
Trees will turn to soil
