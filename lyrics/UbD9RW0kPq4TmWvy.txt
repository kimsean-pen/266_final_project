A sea of waves, we hug the same plank (Saw your end...)
Just as I rehearsed over in my brain
(Saw your end...)

The waves...
Suck... you in
And you drown
If, like, you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down with you... you...

You hang the anchors over my neck (Saw your end...)
I liked it at first but the more you laughed, (Saw your end...)
The crazier I came...

The waves...
Suck... you in
Then you drown...
If, like, you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down with you...
Is that what you want?...
You...
Is that what you want?...

Waves...
Waves...
it's like...

If like you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down with you...
Is that you want?
With you.
Is that what you want?
You?
You...
Escape... below...
