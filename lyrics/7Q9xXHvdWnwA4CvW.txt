Sometimes it feels like everyone's eyes are on you
What will they think? You're so afraid to make a move
You're second guessing every every step yeah

And show the world who you are
When you get down on the floor on the floor on the floor

Come on and dance like nobody's watching
Let me see your hands no don't ever drop them
Just let yourself go oh whoa and be bold oh whoa
Forget about what everyone else says
Show what you got and that you're ready to rock it
Just take a chance yeah come on and dance

Doesn't matter what anyone else is doing yeah
Just close your eyes be yourself and feel the music
So go and do whatever feels so right yeah
Let out all the amazing there inside
And show the world who you are
When you get down on the floor on the floor on the floor

Come on and dance like nobody's watching
