I have walked out in rain
And back in rain
I have outwalked
The furthest city light
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
I have... been one... acquainted... with the night

I'll take you through the night
Through the night
Show you all the city lights
I'll take you through the night
Through the night
Show you all the city lights

I'll take you through the night
Through the night
Show you all the city lights
Show you all the city lights

I have walked out in rain
And back in rain
I have outwalked
The furthest city light

I'll take you through the night
Through the night
Show you all the city lights
I'll take you through the night
Through the night
Show you all the city lights

I have... been one... acquainted... with the night
