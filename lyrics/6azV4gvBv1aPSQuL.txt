Please don't say i love you,
those words touch me much too deeply.
they make my core tremble.
don't think you realize the effect you have over me.
and please don't look at me like that,
it just makes me want to make you near me always.
and please don't kiss me so sweet.
it makes me want to crave a thousand kisses to follow.
and please touch me like that.
makes every other embrace seem pale or shallow.
and please don't come so close.
it just makes me want to make you near me always.
Bridge:
please don't bring me flowers,
they only whisper the sweet things you say.
and don't try to understand me,
your hands already know too much anyways.
makes me want to make you near me always.
And when you look in my eyes,
please know my heart is in your hands.
it's nothing that i understand,
but in your arms you have complete power over me.
so be gently if you please.
'cause your hands are in my hair,
but my heart is in you teeth babe,
and it makes me want to make you near me always,
your hands are in my hair,
but my heart is in you teeth babe,
and it makes me want to make you near me always,
want to be near you always.
want to be near you always.
want to be near you always.
