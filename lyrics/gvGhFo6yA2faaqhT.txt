Eyes
Watching a strange show

I had to work up out of the mud for this shit, ay
Still juggin', I ain't done getting rich, ay
Yeah, twistin' up the doobies with the females
Sit back in a G-Class Benz, ay

Pour a little Henny with my boys, yuh, ay
Pour a shot of Henny for my girl
Sippin' Dom PÃ©rignon in the Rolls now, ay
That's what happen when you do the work
Now I got some commas on my checks
Take a puff and pass that to my left
I feel the marijuana in my chest
Bitch, you do not know me and my friends

Boy, who the fuck you came with? What the fuck you here for?
Did you sign a deal? How much did that check clear for?
Where the fuck you been? What the fuck you disappear for?
Even if I never made a dollar I would volunteer for it

I could never switch up, never switch up, ay
That shit for the fans right there
No, I never switch up, never switch up, ay
Your boy gon' hold it down another year

I'ma hold it down for Neko, hold it down for Aahj
Hold it down for Christ, that's my big brahj, ay
Shout my crew, shout my entourage, yuh
We be steady working, we been on the job

Rolling marijuana in the studio it's non-stop
Sip a little Henny out the bottle with some model thots
We be taking bottle shots, she gon' make it wobble yah, ooh
She put it down and she make it pop, ooh

How you boy so cold, in the summer with the wrists so froze
Top back in the new polo
Bad bitch, and my teeth rose gold
Y'all know

I'll go a million miles an hour
And you'll stay behind me
You say that now we go but then they find
A way back to guide me
