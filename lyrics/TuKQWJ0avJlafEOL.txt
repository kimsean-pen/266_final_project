Take your time
And talk to me when you're all fine
'Cause what is happening now
Is only holding us down
I'll take this
And turn it into something real
Oh, how would it seem
If this was all but a dream?

Yeah, colours fade as I wait for you to come back to me
You'll always be inside my head
I'll be waiting on the other end

When we get
The deepest of our thoughts in line
You can't pretend that we're just
A demonstration of lust
It's more than
Enough to banish all denial
It's on the obvious side
Of all the feelings you hide

Yeah, colours fade as I wait for you to come back to me
You'll always be inside my head
I'll be waiting on the other end
Yeah, colours fade as I wait for you to come back to me
You'll always be inside my head
I'll be waiting on the other end

I've had this dream a thousand times before
I never can be sure (I don't know anymore)
I've waited long enough for you to change your mind
I've had this dream a thousand times before
I never can be sure (I don't know anymore)
I've waited long enough for you to change your mind

Yeah, colours fade as I wait for you to come back to me
You'll always be inside my head
I'll be waiting on the other end
Yeah, colours fade as I wait for you to come back to me
You'll always be inside my head
I'll be waiting on the other end
