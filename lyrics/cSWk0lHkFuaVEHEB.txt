I can't believe I had to see,
The girl of my dreams cheating on me.
The pain you caused has left me dead inside.
I'm gonna make sure you regret that night.

I feel you close, I feel you breathe,
And now it's like you're here
You're haunting me.
You're out of line.
You're out of sight.

You're the reason that we started this fight.
But I, I, I know I just gotta let it go.
I, I, I should've known,
I gotta learn to say goodbye now.
I throw my armour down.
And leave the battleground.
For the final time now.
I, I, I know I'm running from a warzone.
In our house, I hate that place.

Everywhere I walk I see your face.
Try to erase a memory with a flame.
And hope I never see you again,
Standing here in this burning room.
You know the end could never come so soon.
It's clear to me the lies you used,

The ones that kill me ain't hurting you.
So I, I, I know I just gotta let it go.
I, I should've known.

I gotta learn to say goodbye now.
I throw my armour down.
And leave the battleground.
For the final time now.
I, I, I know I'm running from a warzone.
I'm running from a warzone.(warzone, warzone)
I can't do this anymore.
I'm running from a warzone.(warzone, warzone)
What are we fighting for?

I'm running from a warzone.
I, I, I know I just gotta let it go
I, I should've known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down.
And leave the battleground.
For the final time now.
I, I, I know I'm running from a warzone.
