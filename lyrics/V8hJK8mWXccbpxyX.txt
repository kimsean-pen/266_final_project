You were different to anyone I've ever known
Used to have a tendency to drink alone
But when I met you I felt like I wanted
To save you somehow

I loved the way that you always put me first
You gave me your best and I gave you my worst
Took it for granted 'cause I couldn't see
Why you'd let me in just to get hurt

And moments stay when people leave
But I can say that I still remember when

I met you there with a nervous smile
And I left knowing you'd be here a while
I loved last December
Don't think that I don't remember it all now
Drinking mulled wine and seeing the lights
You lit up London in my eyes
I loved last December
Don't think that I don't remember it all now

We sat in the graveyard, talking about life
We'd drive for hours playing the
Different lights
Then we run off
With enough love to
Keep us up for nights
Mmm
You were the safety blanket I needed most
But you were always so anxious
Of my ghosts that came at night
From my past life

But moments stay when people leave
And I can say that I still remember when
When, when

I met you there with a nervous smile
And I left knowing you'd be here a while
I loved last December
Don't think that I don't remember it all now
Drinking mulled wine and seeing the lights
You lit up London in my eyes
I loved last December
Don't think that I don't remember
All the late nights and buses
We would start running
Never making the last train in time
Laughing and fighting, 'till I would start crying
'Cause you were so drunk out your mind

I met you there with a nervous smile
I left you there with nothing but
Memories of December
Now it's all I remember yeah

Drinking mulled wine and seeing the lights
You lit up London in my eyes
I loved last December
Don't think that I don't remember it all now

Ahhh
And it's all I remember
But that was last December
And this is now
