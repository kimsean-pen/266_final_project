The sun fills the kitchen in my house
it's warm and cosy and it helps me breathe
and I wonder if you're making people laugh
'cause you're funny, you're funny
The trees out of my window dance
oh they do, dance with the wind
and I wonder why, I wonder why,
I wonder why we are apart.
'Cause we're funny people, beautiful inside.
The sun, the trees, the moon, the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun, the trees, the moon, the sea
The sea goes quiet when the night is dark
with the lights reflected jump in from the sky
and I wonder if we'll see the moon walk by
'cause it's shinning, it's shinning
as it lights the sadows, see the moon walk by.
The sun, the trees, the moon, the sea
the clouds above hang over me
The sun, the trees, the moon, the sea
The sun, the trees, the moon, the sea
