Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe

Now the dark can see
You're welcome to take my place
Would you keep me company?
I had the vision of a time
I wanted to forget
(Now)
I'm a victim of my pride and memories

Well, the good days are gone and
I'm sad you won't look back
'Cause I still love you
Now I was just thinking of
Everything you never said
I will still I love you

Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe
Baby you are
Baby you are
Babe, babe

I had the vision of a time I wanted to forget
(Now)
I'm victim of my pride and memories

(Your pose for the moments
look out into far distance
This is how usually begins
Layer by layer
bit by bit)

Well, the good days are gone and
I'm sad you won't look back
'Cause I will still love you
I was just thinking of everything you never said
I will still I love you
Well, the good days are gone and
I'm sad you won't look back
'Cause I will still love you
