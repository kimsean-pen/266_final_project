Elephant in a tiny room
Can you see it?
Can you hear it too?
That hot air inside your head
Puppet dancing on your bed

And I don't know how to be
Can someone please show me?

Here in my generation, I got something to say
Let's not have conversations that just fade away
Here in my generation, I got nothing to lose
I'm just a skinny white boy aching, just trying to sing the blues

Well don't you stop
Oh don't you stop
Oh don't you stop

Elephant in a tiny room
And you see it
And you feel it too
Hot air inside your head
Puppet dancing on your bed

I don't know how to be
Can someone please show me?

Here in my generation, I got something to say
Let's not have conversations that just fade away
Here in my generation, I got nothing to lose
I'm just a skinny white boy aching, just trying to sing the blues

I keep coming at you
I keep, keep coming at you
And I keep coming at you now
Well I keep coming at you
I keep, keep coming at you
And I keep coming at you now
I say yeah
I say no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Here in my generation, I got something to say
Let's not have conversations that just fade away
Here in my generation, I got nothing to lose
I'm just a skinny white boy aching, just trying to sing the blues

Can you feel it now?
Coursing through your veins

This is my generation, I got something to say
Let's not have conversations that just fade away
Here in my generation, I got nothing to prove
Just a skinny white boy singing the blues
