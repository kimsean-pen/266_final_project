Wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect, I reject
Photos I took of you

Well, times that I passed through
So many faces, so many places
I have got to have a memory

I have never been there
I have never been there
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

I can't remember
Give me your reminder
I can't remember
Give me your reminder

I collect, I reject
Memorabilia, memorabilia
Memorabilia, memorabilia

Key chains and snowstorms
Taste of your sweat
The look in your eyes

I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you
I have been inside you

I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like
I know what it feels like

I collect, I reject
I collect, I reject
I collect, I reject
Memorabilia

Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
I can't remember

Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
Give me your reminder
I can't remember

I collect, I reject
I collect, I reject
I collect, I reject
I collect, I reject

Memorabilia, memorabilia
Memorabilia, memorabilia
Memorabilia, memorabilia
Memorabilia, memorabilia
