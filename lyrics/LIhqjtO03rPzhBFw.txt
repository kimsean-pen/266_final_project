Shut down the gold rush in my head
Because we're out of work
I'm living proof of compromise
Be back in ten with no return
I'm sick of being in Houston
I'm sick of everything, I've been around enough to get used to

I'm proof of consequences
And exhausted common sense
And I kill what I built
The commonless confidence

I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na)
I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na na)

I wish I was royal but I'm not
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not

You've painted your future
But I'm just not in the picture
Maybe I missed the frame
Maybe I'm seconds late, always late

'Cause I work myself to death
Don't believe me? Ask Geoff
And I'm doing alright
But is alright enough?
'Cause I'm living my dreams
But I live at home
'Cause everything is on the down low for now

I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na)
I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na na)
I wish I was royal but I'm not

(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not

You won't like what you see
So keep your eyes off of me
I fall in love with everything
That wants nothing to do with me
I know that there's no dealing
With the way I'm feeling
I'm so out of touch with everyone
And everything's a blur to me

I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na)
I'm two-faced from your double exposure
Stop right there, don't come any closer
(Na na na na na na na na na)
I wish I was royal but I'm not

(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not

(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh woah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh)
I wish I was royal but I'm not
