How the fuck are we supposed to know
When I'm a monster with the way you refuse to die
How the fuck are we supposed to know
If we're in love or if we're in pain

I'm a tight rope walker, I can't find my circus
And I'm damaged beyond repair
You're just a coffin of a girl I knew
And I'm buried in you

You never said I'd end up like this
You never said I'd end up like this
No, no, no, no

Sometimes I dream I'm an exterminating angel
Traveling executioner from heaven
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know
Call the grave and make the reservation

You never said I'd end up like this
You never said I'd end up like this, no
You never said I'd end up like this
You never said I'd end up like this
No, no, no, no, no, no

Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love, love, love, or are we in pain?

How the fuck are we supposed to know
When I'm a monster with the way you refuse to die
How the fuck are we supposed to know
If we're in love or if we're in pain

Why is my wound a front door to you?
Am I my own shadow?
Why is my wound a front door to you?
Am I my own shadow?
