If this is what it is
And if that's where we're about
Where we never put the rules
And we never let it out

It's soul killing, that's what you need now
That's what you need now
It's soul killing, that's what you need now
That's what you should need

If you always have to wait
Well, in this morning we'll be gone
Is this what you really want?
You should never say never never ever, come on

If you never hold us down, they can never hold us down
If you're from a big city, I am from a little town
Then you never hold us down
(Shoot, shoot, shoot)

Strongly come straight down the meadow
Stand up, straight as a Buddha
Hold this, act like a diamond
It's best even if falling that you live your personal history
All this can shine like a diamond

It's soul killing, that's what you need now
That's what you need now
It's soul killing, that's what you need now
That's what you should need

If you never hold us down, they can never hold us down
If you're from a big city, I am from a little town
If you never hold us down, they can never hold us down
If you're from a big city, I am from a little town
(Keep rockin')
