I saw blood beneath the pillows
I saw blood beneath the sheets
I saw blood upon the handle of the door
I saw blood amongst the dollies
I saw blood upon the skirt
I saw blood stick on the token on the floor

No way back out
No saving grace
No way back out for you from here
From this sullen lonely place

But here in the raven's heart
Your heart is beating on
I ween that you are better where you are
You're here in the raven's heart
No matter where you've gone
I'm sure that you are there among the stars

I saw hope in all your poems
I saw hope in all your tears
I saw hope beside your overwhelming hurt
I saw hope in all your colors
I saw hope in all your black
I saw gold that needed brushing off the dirt

No way back out
No saving grace
No way back out for you from here
From this sullen lonely place

But here in the raven's heart
Your heart is beating on
I ween that you are better where you are
You're here in the raven's heart
No matter where you've gone
I'm sure that you are there among the stars
Bon voyage
Bon voyage
Bon voyage

Here in the raven's heart
Your heart is beating on
I ween that you are better where you are
You're here in the raven's heart
No matter where you've gone
I'm sure that you are there among the stars
