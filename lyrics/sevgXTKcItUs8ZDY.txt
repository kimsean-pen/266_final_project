I don't really care about making any plans
Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can

And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you

To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you could light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah

We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you, you, you, you
