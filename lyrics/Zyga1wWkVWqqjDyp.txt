He's on the phone,
and she wants to go home;
shoes in hand,
don't make a sound,
it's time to go.

(Ooh-ooh)
Someday (someday), someday.

He's on the phone, doesn't want to go home.
The hotel life
forget your wife,
you're on your own.
Academia girl;
her life's a gas,
she loves the trash
inside his world.
Can't find his way there,
got the cash,
feeling flash
in Leicester Square.

Yes.
She never meant to call,
she did anyway,
and now he's trying to find
the words to say
Someday (someday), someday (someday.)
Yes.
She never meant to call,
she did anyway,
and now he's trying to find
the words to say
Someday (someday), someday.

It's five to twelve
and she's nervous as hell,
with nothing to lose,
it's hard to choose
it's hard to tell.
(The remix has this additional couplet:
And her's is lilac and gold; /
the things she has,
she's feeling sad,
she's feeling old.)
Skin is dewdrop and warm;
the lipstick kiss,
reminisce,
awake 'til dawn.

Yes.
She never meant to call,
she did anyway,
and now he's trying to find
the words to say
Someday (someday), someday (someday.)
Yes.
She never meant to call,
she did anyway,
and now he's trying to find
the words to say
Someday (someday), someday (someday.)

Et c'est alors que supposement blesse par le commun des mortels,
Je resurrecte encore et encore.
Je resurrecte
encore
et encore.
