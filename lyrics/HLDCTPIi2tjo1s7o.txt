Keep close to me now
I'll be your guide
Once we have black hearts
Then love dies

Look at us
Through the lens of a camera
Does it remove
All of our pain

If we run
They'll look in the back room
Where we hide
All of our feelings

I just close my eyes as you walk out

I'll keep your eyes wide open tonight
Keep the car on the road now
Feel love bite

Look at us
Through the lens of a camera
Does it remove
All of our pain

If we run
They'll look in the back room
Where we hide
All of our feelings

I just close my eyes as you walk out

You fall from grace
We fall with such grace
You fall from grace
We fall with such grace
You fall from grace
We fall with such grace
You fall from grace
We fall with such grace

Look at us
Through the lens of a camera
Does it remove
All of our pain

If we run
They'll look in the back room
Where we hide
All of our secrets

I just close my eyes as you walk
I just close my eyes as you walk
I just close my eyes as you walk
I just close my eyes as you walk
I just close my eyes as you walk
I just close my eyes as you walk out
