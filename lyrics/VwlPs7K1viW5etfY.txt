my baby loves me even though i'm one of the boys
can't say i love you when i look her in the eyes
but when she talks about her poems or how time flies
i am so happy that she let our worlds collide
and i can say that just fine
i can say that just fine

my baby loves me even though i'm one of the boys
she can't say i love you when she looks me in the eyes
but when she comes home, she holds me so tight
says 'don't let go' and she does that just fine
and she can do that just fine
