Everybody's asking what I'm thinking of you
Wanna show and tell about the things that we do
I know what I'm feeling and you're feeling it too
You're feeling it too

You're feeling it too
Call me up and wonder why I'm making a fuss
Wanna hear the little little secrets of us
I won't tell them anything, they don't have a clue

About me and you
About me and you
Take me on a roller coaster

Round and round and up and over
Hold me close, I'm ready for the ride
Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
No, I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Hey

Whatever we want
Let's call it
Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever we want
Don't you know I'm not another typical girl
Skip the fancy dinners, we go straight for dessert
I don't need no flowers, you can give me the world

Give me the world
Give me the world
We are never gonna try to play by the rules

And every little thing that we should say or do
Uh, Oh, Uh, Oh
Uh, Oh, Uh, Oh
Is wrapped around my little finger
Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close, I'm ready for the ride
Yeah
Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything

No, I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever

Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Hey
Whatever we want
Let's call it
Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Take me on a roller coaster
Round and round and up and over
Hold me close, I'm ready for the ride
Our love needs no name
We got a thing we can't explain
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
You, me, got everything
No, I don't need a diamond ring
Don't care what people say
Let's call it whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Hey
Whatever we want
Let's call it
Whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever we want
Let's call it
