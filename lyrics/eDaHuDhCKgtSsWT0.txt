Far, far away
I hear you call
Haunting yet beautiful
Refrain
You spy with your regretful eyes
Don't break my heart again in vain

Can't you wait for me, baby please?
Won't you wait for me, baby please?(x2)

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
You are my destination

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
I was your destination

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
You are my destination

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
I was your destination

You died inside
Jaded, I cry
Slave to our memories, no more

When you broke down
I hung around
Lonely but dignified
Stood my ground

Can't you wait for me, baby please?
Won't you wait for me, baby please? (x2)

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
You are my destination
You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
I was your destination
You are my destination

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
You are my destination

You are the air I breathe
You are the earth beneath
I was your destination.
