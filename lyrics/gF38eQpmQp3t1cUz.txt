I've learned many lessons
Count on all your blessings
Make a good impression always
Baby your impressing always
Say no to the yes men
Cause their the ones that don't question
How your feeling week to week or
They don't give a fuck about you or me so

Smile for the camera always looking right at ya
There's no time to be sad
There ain't never space for that no
There is not a place for that here
Uh but no pressure no pressure dear
Be patient you'll have your year

Someone fills up your diary
Can you just turn up on time, please
And make something we can vibe with no pressure
Fifteen hundred for the studio but no pressure
No pressure no pressure

You ain't never liked me
Cause you ain't seen nobody like me
Can't go wrong with the right team no pressure
You ain't never gonna get no get no better
No better no pressure no pressure noooo

They'll never give you something for nothing
(well, well, well, well)
I'll always give you something for lovin
More then you touching don't miss call my bluffing
You're everything they need and wanting
Turn up on the carpet now they wanna start shit
Gonna make a hit regardless

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You ain't never had enough no
You can't ever have enough
You put your name down what you expect
When you sign that signature
Don't let them build you up to shelf you now
Don't you ever lose your crown
All the real ones around you no pressure
