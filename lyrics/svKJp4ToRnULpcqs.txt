Why did I ever think
life is about to go on
in a minute

And did I ever see
life is about to go on
in a minute
Life never goes on
Those are empty words

This is the back door
that will lead you out
to find the alley of your dreams
They try and tell you
They're just empty words

It's just a frame of mind

This is the back door
Leading me out
Sweep you away
We'll never go on
We're used to these empty words

It's just a frame of mind
