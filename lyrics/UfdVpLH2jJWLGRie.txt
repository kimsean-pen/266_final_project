At night, high up in the heavens we fight
Faster than lightning we strike
Like fires that rip through the night
Surrounded by light

Raging thunder in the skies
Time has come to sacrifice

We are warriors, born from the light
An army for freedom, defenders of life
Warriors, euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness we bury all lies

The knights, outcast and lost in the skies
Returning to heaven denid
Louder than thunder we ride
Ready to strike

Call for us and you will survive
Follow us to paradise

We are warriors, born from the light
An army for freedom, defenders of life
Warriors, euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness we bury all lies

Here we are, the warriors of light
Here we are, we came from the night
Here we are, the warriors of light
Here we are, euphoria will rise

We are warriors, born from the light
An army for freedom, defenders of life
Warriors, euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness we bury all lies
We are warriors, born from the light
Warriors, euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness we bury all lies
