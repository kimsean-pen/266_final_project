Before the earth was round,
There was no end to things
No one tried to measure what they knew

Everything was warm
And everyone would love
And every contradiction was true
The sun worked twice as hard
And the moon was twice as far
And the sky was still honestly blue

The sky was still honestly blue

But when the time came
Everything spiraled in
And everyone forgot what they knew

War became a job
And love became a mystery
And heart and head were bent out of tune
Fear and doubt began
And God threw up his hands
And the sky didn't know what to do

The sky didn't know what to do
The sky didn't know what to do
