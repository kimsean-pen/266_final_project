I'd rather be honest
I fell for the way you knew I would fall
So what if I want it?
You know what you do
You painted a target
Right on my heart
You shot at the mark
And, oh, look you caught it
You know what you started
Can't get you close enough
Think that I got you then you're gone, you're gone
I need to say it once in case tomorrow never comes, oh

I want you
You say the word, I'll come through
Something in the way you move
Don't keep me waiting on you
I want you

I want you
Don't keep me waiting
I'm not used to chasing
I beg and I steal just to borrow your heart
But girl, let's just face it, there's no one like you
And everyone knows it
I know you don't notice, can't keep my focus
I just be open
Won't hide what I'm showing,
Can't get you close enough

Think that I got you then you're gone (you're gone)
You're gone (you're gone)
I want you
You say the word, I'll come through (come through)
Something in the way you move (you move)
Don't keep me waiting on you
I want you
I want you
Don't keep me waiting on you

(Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you)
(Nobody, nobody)
Don't keep me waiting on you
Don't keep me waiting on you
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you)
(Nobody, nobody)
Don't keep me waiting on you
I want you
You say the word, I'll come through (come through)
Something in the way you move
(Something in the way you move)
Don't keep me waiting on you
(Don't keep me waiting)
I want

I want you
Don't keep me waiting on you
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you)
(Nobody, nobody)
Don't keep me waiting on you
Don't keep me waiting on you
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you)
(Nobody, nobody)
Don't keep me waiting on you
