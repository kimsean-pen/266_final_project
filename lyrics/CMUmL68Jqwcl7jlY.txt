Maybe I was yours to keep
Burning in the eyes you weep
Someday I will take your hand
Moving through another land
And every single second tears
It's given from the love you had

But I'll be right behind your eyes
Turning to a love you hide
And every single breath you take
I'll be holding on against the weight

Maybe I was yours to fall
Turn into this sinking stone
Every single heart forgave
Must' have filled the arms of grace

I'll be right behind your eyes
Looking through the walls you hide
'Til every single warmth betrayed
I'll be holding on against the wave

Moments only seem to pass
Days are never going to last
Without you I never had a chance
From the moment you held my hand
I was trying to be someone I can't
But this feeling wouldn't let me back
Now I'm tired of waiting for you to rise

Hanging on a single breath
Screaming 'til there's nothing left
This is all we'll ever find
Broken as the world unwinds
