Don't go
'Cause I can't see you go
And if you were to go then I would probably dig a hole
Underground, I'd be safe and sound
I wouldn't have to see you
Or your other friends in town
Don't stare
'Cause I can't see you there
I know it annoys you when I act like I don't care
I do
I once did love you
But now I'm feeling opposite
Like red does blue

So get out my face
And leave me be
I don't love you
And you certy don't love me
So this is all wrong
Your argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
And I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone

Your smile
That was worth the while
You say you don't love me
But I say you're in denial
I prove
I once did love you
But now I'm feeling opposite and I don't know what to do

So get out my face
And leave me be
I don't love you
And you certy don't love me
So this is all wrong
Your argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
But I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone
So fuckin' bad

And I know you
Don't want me in your world
But let me tell you
I'm fine with that, girl
If you really
Think me as a tool
I might tell you
My feelings on you

(So won't you get out my face?)
(And leave me be?)
I don't love you
And you certy don't love me
So this is all wrong
You're argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
And I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone

I said I wish you were gone
I said I wish you were gone
I said I wish you were gone
So fuckin' bad.
