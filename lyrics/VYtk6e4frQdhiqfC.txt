I've never felt so free
I've never felt so free before
You can't stop me
From walking out the door
I've never felt so free before
We'll put the bad times behind us
Put some sugar and stir it up
I know we're gonna make it better
No more bittersweet loving
No no no more
I've never felt so free
I've got a place to go
That I call my own
I'll say it out loud
Standing proud
Free to browse
On my own
I've got a place to go
that I call my own
On my own
No bittersweet lovin'
