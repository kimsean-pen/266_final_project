Beaucoup bitches in the lobby
Bust it open like piñata
Beaucoup bottles on the counter
This is how you start a party
This is how you start a party
This is how you start a party
Tell your friends to tell somebody
We about to start the party

I told my niggas I'ma pull up to the party, give me 20 minutes
Show up in some leather pants
With some bitches you ain't even know existed
Tossed up a lot of mothafuckin' money
She said, "Let me guess, you a drug dealer"
Said, "Nah, I just brought a lot of money and a whole lot of drugs with me"
You don't smoke loud, be quiet
Shut the fuck up, nigga, be quiet
All hail that nigga Swae Lee
I done told y'all too many times
Five bad bitches sittin' in line
Fuckboys, they know me from the side
Can't see y'all niggas, I'm blind
Y'all niggas ain't Swae like mine
Y'all niggas ain't real, stop lyin'
Them hoes I fuck be dyin'
Them bitches I kiss be yours
Everything I touch turns gold
My bankroll just won't fold
Goddamn them hundreds too old
Gettin' money my favorite sport
Corella my favorite Porsche

Beaucoup bitches in the lobby
Bust it open like piñata
Beaucoup bottles on the counter
This is how you start a party
This is how you start a party
This is how you start a party
Tell your friends to tell somebody
We about to start the party

Got your main bitch on a bean and the lean
