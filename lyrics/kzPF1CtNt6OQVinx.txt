Featureless stranger
Upon the ridge
Don't fear on your approach
There's shade all the way
Ave Maria
I am your dog
There on the horizon line
I'll be your man inside
There on the horizon line
I'll cut it all the way

Could not get [?]
Something wrong in [?] Chigaco
She sees only the hill where the buffalo roam

All my cities getting far away

Sweet pastures no matter
I'm a lover in the hay
Keep the golden suns coming
Push the broken ones away
Well, Ave Maria
I am your dog
Ave Maria
I am your dog
And in the dead of night
I'll be your man inside
And in the dead of night
I'll cut it all the way
Cut it all the way [?]
Could not get [?]

It's [?]
All my cities getting far away
I'm gonna call out
Are you wasted [?]

It's a very astute observation
Don't you say
It's a very astute observation
If I do say so myself
Put on your evening attire
We got a lot of forgetting to do

He's a good looking man
With a mild affectation
If you treat him all right
He's gonna get you to station
If you treat him all wrong
You better perfect your line
With the sisters all gone
Sat to ruin your night
Oh what a glow he wants you to know
It's all your [?]
It's out here on the line
Oh my oh my he's never heard a lie
He's never heard a [?]
If you did it all wrong lost in this song
Yes it's spelled wrong
But that's my nature [?]
I take you
Give me what I wanted
I'll show you [?]
And it is
As an aside
It is
