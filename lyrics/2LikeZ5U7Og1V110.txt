First you love me, and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I can do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms, now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on!
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache...
I'm gonna carry on!

Living for love!
I'm living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on!

Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!)

I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess (Oh, yes!)
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you!
You've broken my heart
But you can't break me down! (Come on!)
Had fallen apart, what was lost has now been found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I CAN FORGIVE, BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET!

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on!
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache...
I'm gonna carry on!

Living for love!
I'm living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on!

Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up!

(Love!)
(Llift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up! (Lift me up! Lift me up! Lift me up!...)
'Cause love's gonna lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
'Cause love's gonna lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love's gonna lift me up! (Gonna lift me up!)
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!

Living for love!
Living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on!
Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up!
(Love... Love... Love...)
