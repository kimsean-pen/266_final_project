Driving my fist down deep inside it
Oh yeah! Gonna take it to a whole new level in spite of your bullshit
Tasting sweet anxiety
Breaking through another day
Maybe I just don't care anymore what you think of me (think of me)

I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I hear it screaming, it's coming alive
I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I feel it breathing, deep down inside
Deep down inside

Tearing through shards of broken glass (broken glass)
Oh yeah! Getting one step closer to the edge and taking it all back
Surging through my blackened veins
Uncontrolled in a different way
I can't wait to get away from everything

I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I hear it screaming, it's coming alive
I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I feel it breathing, deep down inside

Oh yeah, alright
I feel it coming alive, yeah
Oh yeah, alright
I'm breakin' on through the other side

I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I hear it screaming, it's coming alive
I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I feel it breathing, deep down inside
I'll take it to the edge of life, alright
I'll take it to the edge of life, I'm so alive
I'll take it to the edge of life, alright
I'll take it to the edge of life, alright
