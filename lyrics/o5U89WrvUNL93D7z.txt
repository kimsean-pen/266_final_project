You want to move your body can't
You're stuck inside the lines
To leave it all to feel what's not defined

I want to move your body now
Collide with you tonight
But I keep my love I keep it locked 'til you can let go

I've run afraid of perfect order
This is just a thought
Inside your mind, mind When you're waiting for the world to change your life

Baby you can wait for years

Don't be searching for a symbol or a sign

Cause I know life ain't crystal clear

I want to move my body can't
We are one tonight
I know that you can live outside those lines

You want to move
For you I'll be a human sacrifice
I'll take the fall I'll take it all 'til you can let go

I've run afraid of perfect order
This is just a thought
Inside your mind, mind

When you're waiting for the world to change your life

Baby you can wait for years

Don't be searching for a symbol or a sign

Cause I know life ain't crystal clear

I've run afraid of perfect order
This is just a thought
Inside your mind, mindWhen you're waiting for the world to change your life

Baby you can wait for years

Don't be searching for a symbol or a sign

Cause I know life ain't crystal clear

Clear, clear, clear

Don't be searching for a symbol or a sign

Cause I know life ain't crystal clear
