I've never been your savior, I've never been your ghost
And as I'm pushing further, I'm playing the silent host
I feel like I am treading water, smoke's still burning my eyes
Through and through I'm still captured by disorder
Swept away by every helpful advice

Anyone could cure it with blindness
There were moments where I thought I could be
A man who's aching for the hour of closure
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs
But it's not what it seems
It's just an inner endless shriek

I won't unchain the lonely
I won't release their souls
But I will examine the wishful
And drown in the full moon shoals

Anyone could cure it with blindness
There were moments where I thought I could be
A man who's aching for the hour of closure
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs
But it's not what it seems
It's just an inner endless shriek

Embracing the culmination
As the flames keep licking the sky

Slowly rising from the murky waters
I reach for the tenebrous sky
Sons and daughters of the repressed order
Take my turn and meet the dragon's eye

Anyone could cure it with blindness
There were moments where I thought I could be
A man who's aching for the hour of closure
Darkness clearly kept on covering my needs
But it's not what it seems
It's just an inner endless shriek
