I can't hold back
My hands won't let me
It's the touch of your skin
Is it lust or envy?
Is it lust or envy?

I can't hold back
My pride won't let me
I'm seeing red
This is all too deadly
This is all too deadly

Fallout!
One more taste
One last time
I just can't help it

Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven

All seven
All seven
Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven
(Hanging from the edge of heaven)

I can't get up
Motivation left me
I let it burn
Only embers left in me
Only embers left in me

My old friend how long it's been
My original sin we meet again
You taught me to live like this
My original sin we meet again

Fallout!
One more taste
One last time
I just can't help it

Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven

All seven
All seven
Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven

You taught me this

I'll take my place
Amongst the angels
With my seven sins
I'll reign again, baby I'll reign again

Fallout!
One more taste
One last timeI just can't help it

Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven

All seven
All seven
Fallout!
I need it all
Hanging from the edge of heaven
