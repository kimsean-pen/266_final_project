It takes one piece to crumble down the walls and find peace
Undo the damage done to my state
And all my wasted breath couldn't amount to an accomplishment
I'll just wait around for something big to show
But nothing ever comes just patience and an afterglow

Take it all back
Falling off track
Biting my tongue in half with the secrets kept
I'm always flaunting old scars
Keeping friends far
Sleeping alone again, like it's always been

I miss the way I had my mindset laid out
Unquenched and with no doubts
I threw away the reasons I could never
focus up and pull myself out of this rut
I never truly learned to take the time to
smell the roses at my feet before they wilt and die
I never truly learned to take the time to
smell the roses at my feet before they wilt and die

Take it all back
Falling off track
Biting my tongue in half with the secrets kept
I'm always flaunting old scars
Keeping friends far
Sleeping alone again, like it's always been

Take it all back
Falling off track
Biting my tongue in half with the secrets kept
I'm always flaunting old scars
Keeping friends far
Sleeping alone again, like it's always been

Falling off track (I just wait around)
With your secrets kept (For something good to show)
Keeping friends far,
like it's always been (But nothing ever
comes, just a patience and an afterglow)
