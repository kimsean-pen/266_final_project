So society just can't let us be
Please don't be ashamed
We are not to blame
The future's ours to take
We will make mistakes
Scream this loud and proud
We will not back down

So lets go and relieve the pressure
Anarchy will only make it better
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

We're not scared 'cause our life in danger
Reality will only make us stronger
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I rather die with dignity

Let them put us down, hope we're not around
They pray we go away
But we're here to stay

Time is on our side
Our two worlds collide
These four words might help
Just go fuck yourself!

So let's go and relieve the pressure
Anarchy will only make it better
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

We're not scared 'cause our life in danger
Reality will only make us stronger
We can't, we won't surrender
We can't, we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I rather die with dignity

Dignity!

Don't tell me where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I rather die with dignity

Tell me where are we laying your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I rather die with dignity
