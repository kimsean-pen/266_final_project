When I think of those east end lights
Muggy nights the curtains drawn
In the little room downstairs
Prima donna Lord you really should have been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there rolling 'round the basement floor
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)

And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear (sugar bear...)

You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)

Never realized the passing hours of evening showers
Slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time
Thank God my music is still alive
(aah-aah-aah-aah-aah...)

And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
Coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone
And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear)
(sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound
Hypnotized
Sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
(someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved someone saved
(someone saved my life tonight)
