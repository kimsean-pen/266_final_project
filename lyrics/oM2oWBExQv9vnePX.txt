I'm not tryna change your life
I just wanna watch the world go by
A slice of heaven and peace of mind
The times are changing and it don't feel right

Everything's spinning
Galactic living
Life is a giant hotel
We're living fast
'Cause nothing lasts

I-I-I've been looking to the sky
For stars to show me signs
In this interstellar light
But I Try-y-y
Remember I'm alive
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything

I'm tearing up my soul
'Cause I'm searching for that pot of gold
Material life is all I know
A blimp in time and away we go

I-I-I've been looking to the sky
For stars to show me signs
In this interstellar light
But I Try-y-y
Remember I'm alive
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything

If you're sad and you don't know why
Then you're not living in a western paradise
But just winning in a losing fight
It's never perfect but we always try

I-I-I been looking to the sky
For stars to show me signs
In this interstellar light
But I Try-y-y
Remember I'm alive
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything
Don't worry all the time 'bout everything

I'm tryna change your life
I just wanna watch the world go by
