This goes to crazy ones' misfits, rebels, troublemakers
Sick as like as transvestites
nerds and self-made assholes
Sex baby mamas
Always with the drama, to the get all
It's for you and me x2

My skill is ultimate,
Streets are full of hate
Can't stop, won't stop
Let me GE-NE-RATE
Bring bro many, Im a crack baby
Stand straight from 90, try shit, shady

Notice that feel my eyes
I'm a lonely samurai, prorapsuperstar
On stage I go suicide
Full of dirty secrets
Don't ask me who am I
Im not just somebody, but the boy with wings like butterfly
First i take Estonia, then the whole world

We can sleep all day, party all night
That she get away
Come my baby,
Come, come my baby
It's a hero of love - it's time for guru
I make green tea, so laser shine through your buffer
The moshpit, like a lost it
Cant feel your legs, but it's cosmic
Goes up all for my ravers, worldwide
Dont forget to fly, cause your limit is the sky

BOY BUTTERFLY X2
