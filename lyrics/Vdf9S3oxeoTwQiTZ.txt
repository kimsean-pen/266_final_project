The streets are paved with wasted minds
I was patient
I waited
But a girl only has so much time
Late again

The smoke it rise in the sunshine
Like a storm drain to my mind
The vapours rise
A new invention for your new life
You're late again

If you need her you can call her
You can meet her in the playground
If you need it too bad I waste it
If you need it too bad

She's a Dayglow Bimbo

Did you plant a seed in a solitary teen
Can she read
Is she growing flowers
in her greasy sleeves
Late again

She's a Dayglow Bimbo
Late again
