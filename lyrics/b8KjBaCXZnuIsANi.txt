I'm losing time again, trying to figure out who I am.
Here's a rope, let's see if I will sink or swim.
I quit my job again, to try to figure out if this life, is a life I want to live.
But it's a shame, not everything is going to last.
Colorado is coming fast.
I'll be living a dream I had when I was only 14.
But we won't get this day back, no we won't.
Get this day back.
I'll miss you lying there, I'll miss the way you do your hair.
In my car with all the windows down, it costs to much to fix, but you are okay with it now.
But it's a shame, not everything is going to last.
Colorado is coming fast.
I'll be living a dream I had when I was only 14.
But we won't get this day back, no we won't.
Get this day back.
I'll write you songs, I'll write you letters.
I'll break your heart then make it better.
I'll fill the space in between, you are such a pretty thing
Not everything is going to last.
Colorado is coming fast.
I'll be living a dream I had when I was only 14.
But we won't get this day back, no we won't.
Get this day back.
