Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the color of my room where I will live
(Mmm mmm mmm mmm)
Blue, blue

Pale blinds, drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
(Mmm mmm mmm mmm)
Blue, blue

I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing and [inaudible]
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
