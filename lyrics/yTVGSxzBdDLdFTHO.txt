This is the night!
This is the night!
Heeey

Im feelin alive
Im feelin alive
My heart goes oom as the stars go blue,
Like a sea of cell phone lights,
The moon gets light as the sun goes down,
Somewhere behind the hollywood sign,
Have you ever felt like your living in the shadows?
Have you ever felt kept down?
I know sometimes the it feels like a battle,
But it can turn around,

Heeey
This is the night!
This is the night!
Heeey
Im feelin alive
Im feelin alive
The kick drum starts as the boulevard,
Fills up with all the boys and girls
From the jersey town to the l.a. Crowd,
They hear us all over the world,
Have you ever felt like standing on a rooftop,
Have you ever wanted to scream?
Everybody dance, burn it up till we blastoff,
Just like a rocket machine (yeeahh!)

Heeey
This is the night!
This is the night!
Heeey
Im feelin alive
Im feelin alive
Cause were not alone tonight,
So raise up your hands and touch the sky,
Cause were not alone tonight,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Heeey
This is the night!
This is the night! (yeeaahh!)
Heeey! (yeah-ah)
Im feelin alive
Im feelin alive (im feelin alive)
Heeey
This is the night, this is the night,
[this is the ni-ight!]
Heeey
Im feeling alive (yeeaah!)
Im feeling alive
Heeey! (yeah!)
This is the night, this is the night

Heeey
