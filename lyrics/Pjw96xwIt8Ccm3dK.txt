New day dawning, I wonder what it holds for me,
Sun is shining, I Don't think that it will shine on me
I look around, nothing seems to have changed,
This dirty town, it hasn't some how rearranged

And I stand up, but I get knocked straight back down,
"Just give it up" they say, "We just don't want you around
Not one of us, and we don't like to share."
Mouthful of dust, but I'll get even I swear...

I hear your voice, call my name, but in my heart, It's still pouring rain,
And it ain't pretty, no it ain't pretty...

But you say "Hold on, hold on... believe me,
All the plans against you one by one, will come undone."
I shall overcome.

Through my tears, I try to see your face,
But doubt and fear come calling, and crowd my head with words of hate,
I scream out please! Don't leave me hear alone,

Down on my knees, without you and without hope...

I hear your voice, call my name, but in my heart, It's still pouring rain,
And it ain't pretty, no it ain't pretty...

But you say "Hold on, hold on... believe me,
Love is here and I won't let you down, stand your ground.
Hold on, hold on... It's easy,
All the plans against you one by one, will come undone."
I know I shall overcome.

Just in time you call my name, pull myself up, to fight again.
I'll never let you down...

"Hold on, hold on... believe me,
Love is here and I won't let you down, stand your ground.
Hold on, hold on... It's easy,
All the plans against you one by one, will come undone."
I know I shall overcome.
