All the time
Every time I need it
What's the time
I'd say the time is right
Here's to me
Let's find another reason down the hatch
And a bad attitude
Salud

Wasting time
Wasting time
Down a bum fuck road and
I don't know where the hell it'll go
Heirlooms huffing fumes and I'm picking up the pace
And I'm gonna smash straight into a wall

All the time
A new years resolution how soon that we forget
Doing time
Loving every minute
Live it up on another let down
Salud

Promises
Promises
It was all set in stone
Cross my heart and hope to die
Sugar fix
Dirty tricks and a trick question
Guess I should have read between the lines

Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick

Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
All the time
Where did all the time go?
It's too late to say good night
Time flies when you're having fun
Times up when you work like a dog
