The blind don't rely on the light, they just fight
I curse my sight

Embrace the cost
Welcome to the war

Strike deep or don't strike at all
Draw full or don't draw at all
If you're to lead
Lead point or don't lead at all
We're destined to die
So make worthy of your fall

The sun's abated
Light up your torches
Expect nothing to fuel your lamp
Nothing here wishes you another breath

Into the fray you watched me charge on
I cleared the way while you waded in thought
Your feet stuck sinking prints in the floor
What the hell were you waiting for?

The blind don't rely on the light, they just fight
I dug this bed, I'll lay down my head
Let my axe put me down instead
'Cause they just can't kill what's already dead
Immortality belongs to the dead

You just can't kill what's already dead
The fame all goes to the claimer of the head

You just can't kill what's already dead
Deserters all

Lead point or don't lead at all
You're all gonna die
Make worthy of your fall
Make worthy of your fall
