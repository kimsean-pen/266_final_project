You said, "I can't take no more"
Lying by the sycamore
And I know we've both been here before

You said, "Fuck, let's leave the blame"
But heartache always feels the same
And I know we've both been here before

Here I am
Settled in
At your house
Broken blinds keep the light coming out
And I am just the shape I'm in
Here I am
Settled in
Crying out
Finding all the things that I can't do without
Oh I am giving in
Oh I'm in retrograde
Oh I'm in retrograde
Retrograde

Standing staring straight ahead
Listening when Stevie says
"Come out of the darkness"

Feeling all I've ever known
Fall away and letting go
Oh come out of the darkness

Here I am
Settled in
On your floor
Quieting all the world outside your door
And I am reckoning
Here I am
Settling
Freaking out
You bring me in to help me let me get you out
Oh I
I'm in retrograde
I'm in retrograde

Oh if only I could give in
If I could get out
If only I could break in
If you could let me out
If only I could let go
If I could sit out
If only I could get back
If I could let me out
Oh I'm in retrograde
I'm in retrograde
