Springtime in Tangier
The sky's getting wider
Renewing its splendor
The world's getting brighter

Setting out just like the sun
That's never seen the rain
Stepping out we're homeward bound
And never be the same

Ah ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah ah, we live mysterious days

American writers
Now work in the attic
Up in the casbah
There's plenty to worship

Shine again Arabian moon
And be the guiding light
Life is changing like the dunes
Wandering in the night

Ah ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah ah, we live mysterious days
We live mysterious days

Ah ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah ah, we live mysterious days
Ah ah, the spell cannot be broken
Ah ah, we live mysterious days

We live mysterious days
We live mysterious days
We live mysterious days
We live mysterious days
