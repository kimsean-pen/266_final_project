If you want my love
You gotta do what he does
If you want these sweet like sugar Gucci lips
You gotta give it up
I know you think I'm cool
But I ain't one of the boys
No don't be scared that I'm gonna tie you down
I need a little more

Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
If you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
If it ain't no thang
I won't be hanging around

But don't blow up my shit at 3 a.m. saying
"How you need me now?"
Don't call me boo
Like you're some kind of ghost
If you don't want me seeing other guys
Here's what you need to know
Baby don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again

You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
If you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

Yeah, said I'm a special kind of woman
I'm loving what you got
But I'm hating what you doing
Gotta understand that I'm looking for a man

Who can get up on a bike
Look mom! No hands!
You gotta show me off boy
But you embarrassed
If that's the case I'm all gone
You gotta treat me like a trophy
Put me on the shelf
I promise something else
Baby don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
If you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
