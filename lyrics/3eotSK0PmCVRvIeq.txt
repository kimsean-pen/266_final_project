I won't stop I'd rather take the long way home
Got myself to blame, everyday's the same
I left my dreams alone back in yesterday
But it's too late to change my ways

I fell off, took some time off, and now I'm left behind
Where am I closing my eyes
Cuz my heart's slowly beating till tomorrow
Yeah I'm scared I lost my way

I woke up with a lot weighing on my mind
Should I stay behind, or try to find
The man I told myself that I could be
It's not the easy way, but that's all right with me

I fell off, took some time off, and now I'm left behind
Where am I closing my eyes
Cuz my heart's slowly beating till tomorrow
Yeah I'm scared I lost my way.

Yeah I heard the window closed, but that's ok cuz I'll find a door instead.

I'm stuck living in the past, and I don't need it
No I don't need it
