Anchored Awake | Wringing my hands | Weighing
my time | Running down dreams | Buying your life |
Patience is a girl I've been trying to forget about |
Always rearing her ugly head when I am choosing
she's losing | She's the one who stills sits alone |
Comforting smile saves me from making the same
mistake drag it out of me | Take what you've got
make it better | I feel the loss I bear my own cross |
Enjoying the last seconds we have | My unseen
dictator grasps throats with both hands | It brings
about euthanasia | Who hold my fate in their hands |
Not you | Endless
