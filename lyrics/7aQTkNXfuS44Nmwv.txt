I'll find the courage
To fight the deamons here inside
The time has come but
I'm not feeling strong enough
To beg for mercy
Let me put all that aside
Avoiding all my doubts
And the consequences of my life

Everyday I try to explain
How my mind is bound in chains
There's no way
What a shame

But if I say if I say leave me alone
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray I will pray for your return
What if I say if I say I won't let you go
Let you go anymore
I'll know how broken promises hurt deep down inside

And promise me now
Let's find a way to heal my scars
We'll look up above reaching for the stars
What I feel what I like
Is behind your perfect smile
When it rains you are my sun

Yes if I say if I say leave me alone
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray I will pray for your return
What if I say if I say I won't let you go
Let you go anymore
I'll know how broken promises hurt deep down inside

I'll write about
What it means to feel reborn
Don't waste your life
Apologizing every time

There's more to discover
Take some advice
Pack all your bags
And know the world outside

But if I say if I say leave me alone
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray I will pray for your return
What if I say if I say I won't let you go
Let you go anymore
I'll know how broken promises hurt deep down inside

But if I say if I say leave me alone
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray I will pray for your return
What if I say if I say I won't let you go
Let you go anymore
I'll know how broken promises hurt deep down inside
