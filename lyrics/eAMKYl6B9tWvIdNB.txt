Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!
All right!

I wanna be your teacher in the team
Get to come in naked, cause it's clean
I wanna be your make-up, with the seam
Just take a shaker, make it mean

I won't get over the damn
Cause it's just like that old mile
Every four o' clock in the morning
I think I'm gonna die

Check I'll hold you
I wish it was you
Gotta get a cat up a CK
Cause that's where we're at
Gotta give a car the beetles
Cause they're not sad

But I won't get over it now
Cause it's half-drawn on the shout
It could be four o' clock in the morning
If you wish it'd got no style

I gotta shit out like I was never
On the fallest town to be
I could wish this way forever
But I ever gonna be clean
No, I can't get shot
Albeit, no!
I can't get shot
Albeit, no!
I can't get shot!

Wooh!

Wanna grow to keep it in June
Gonna make it easy for you
Wanna be the carever in the coal
Just get this on with
Everything the kids enjoy

But I won't get over it soon
Cause there ain't light at full noon
Cause at four o' clock in the morning
I got cheering up to do
If not, you get a real shot
It's just like walls I never drived
But I go: "Wooh!"
I just go: "Wooh!"
We all go: "Wooh!"
Yeah!
We all go: "Wooh!"
All right!
