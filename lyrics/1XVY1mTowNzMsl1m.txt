We are a see through love
Seeing through sun and haze
I see through to the totally clear end

If you appear within the seconds of
The word imagination
If you appear the word allows a man to
See to those appearance
If you appear what's airy
Sends a friend to my imagination
The kind of town where it's a sin
To be inside and outside for them
Around the side of the house where
The side that you can get up on it
When every inter-call decides a well
That's up to go off

We are a see through love
Seeing through sun and haze
I see through to the totally clear end

It's well to know that since it gives a name
You get to grow up with him
I finish all supposed where it's a good time
Floating where so much up
The kind of love that I can only find in my imagination
The kind of heart that I can only have in my imagination

We are the see through love
Seeing through sun and haze
