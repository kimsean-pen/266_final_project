You can have my life, I'm sad
You can have the beat in my heart
You can be my light, pizzazz
You can be my spark in the dark
But if I'm out there actin' the bum I'll become one
So no more frigid nights in the cold
I would fall asleep in the lawn 'til the sun rose
14 karat gold (gold)
You can have my life, I'm sad

Broken downtown down on Wedgewood & 8th
And I'm bleedin' like a heartache
Get ready to break
And then on down the road
Comes another mistake
Try hard as I might
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin'!

I'm bummin'!

We can ride the bus all around, in this town
I'm on it
We can fall asleep on the ground, by the sound
I want it
Picture perfect, matted and framed
With my name right on it
14 karat gold (gold)
You can have my life, I'm sad

Broken downtown down on Wedgewood & 8th
Yeah, I'm bleedin' like a heartache
Get ready to break
And then on down the road
Comes another mistake
Try hard as I might
I can't quite get it right

Broken downtown down on Wedgewood & 8th
Yeah, I'm bleedin' like a heartache
Get ready to break

I've been burnin' in the sun
And I'm barely awake
Try hard as I might
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin'!
I'm bummin'!

I can't afford this bummin', no
So take this life you gave me
Save me from vices, oh
I can't afford this bummin', no
I'm in a crisis, oh
So take this life you gave me
Save me from my vices
I'm bummin'!
I'm bummin'!

Broken downtown down on Wedgewood & 8th
Yeah, I'm bleedin' like a heartache
Get ready to break
And then on down the road
Comes another mistake
Try hard as I might
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin'!
(I can't afford this afford this bummin', no
I'm in a crisis, oh)
I'm bummin'!
(So take this life you gave me
Save me from my vices)
