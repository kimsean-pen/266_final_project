Hi, hello, welcome in
Slow it down, why you bargin'?
Woah one at a time please
What a way to make me at ease
How the hell'd you know that?
Cause I didn't even know that
Am I an examinee?
Dot those Is and cross those Ts

Cause I might say some stupid things at times
But don't we all? Don't we all? Don't we all?
Cause I'm the one with my neck on the line
What for? What for? What for?

You wanna give me
A taste of celebrity
I can't help but find that funny
Cause that's not who I am
I'm from a small town
Down south with a bit of land
Well how do I refuse now?
When you won't back down

You better make yourself at home
My life and yours are not one
I gotta watch what I do
Cause you're watchin' it too
No I didn't say that
Oh god did I say that?
Well I... I didn't mean it
Why did I say that?

Cause I might say some stupid things at times
But don't we all? Don't we all? Don't we all?
It's me who's got their neck out on the line
What for? What for? What for?

You wanna give me
A taste of celebrity
I can't help but find that funny
Cause that's not who I am
I'm from a small town
Down south with a bit of land
Well how do I refuse now?
When you won't back down

You won't back down
No you won't back down
You won't back down
No you won't back down
You won't back down
Oh you won't back down, no
You won't back down
Well I'm just not listening

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh no, no, no, no

You wanna give me
A taste of celebrity
I can't help but find that funny
Cause that's not who I am
I'm from a small town
Down south with a bit of land
Well how do I refuse now?
When you won't back down

You won't back down
No you won't back down
You won't back down
No you won't back down
You won't back down
Oh you won't back down, no
You won't back down
No you won't back down
