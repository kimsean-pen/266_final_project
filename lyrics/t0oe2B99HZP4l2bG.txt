Here we are
In the best years of our lives.
With no way of knowing
When we'll stop spinning
Cause we don't know where we're going

And here we are
On the best day of our lives.
And it's a go
Lets make it last
So cheers you all to that
'Cause this moment's never comin' back

I used to know her brother
But I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumpin' up and down
She's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me

I've got your picture in my wallet
And your phone number to call it
And I miss you more
Whenever I think about you

I've got your mixed tape in my Walkman
Been so long since we've been talkin'
And in a few more days
We'll both up, forever and ever

And here I am
On the west coast of America
And I've been tryin' to think for weeks
Of all the ways to ask you

And now I've brought you to the place
Where I've poured my heart out
A million times, for a million reasons
To offer it to you

I used to know her brother
But I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumpin' up and down
She's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me

I've got your picture in my wallet
And your Phone number to call it
And I miss you more
Whenever I think about you

I've got your mixed tape in my Walkman
Been so long since we've been talkin'
And in a few more days
We'll both up, forever and ever

I used to know her brother
But I never knew I loved her
'Til the day she laid her eyes on me
Now I'm jumpin' up and down
She's the only one around
And she means every little thing to me
I've got your picture in my wallet
And your Phone number to call it
And I miss you more
Whenever I think about you
I've got your mixed tape in my Walkman
Been so long since we've been talkin'
And in a few more days
We'll both up, forever and ever
