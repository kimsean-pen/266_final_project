And this is how it feels when I
Ignore the words you spoke to me
And this is where I lose myself
When I keep running away from you

And this is who I am when
When I Don't know myself anymore
And this is what I choose when
It's all left up to me
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me

I still need you
I'm falling, falling
Breathe into me
Breathe into me

And this is how it looks when
I'm standing on the edge
And this how I break apart
When I finally hit the ground
And this is how it hurts when I
Pretend I don't feel any pain
And this is how I disappear
When I throw myself away
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you

I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
Breathe into me
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you

I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I still need you
I'm falling, falling
Breathe into me
Breathe your life into me
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me
I'm falling, falling
Falling
Breathe into me
BREATHE!
