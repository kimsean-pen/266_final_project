Fall into me, I got you now
I won't give up, never let you down
Let's get it straight, it's time to choose
I came to play, don't play to lose

You're the next to me
Now can get in the change
I've got the key, let you out the cage
But I want you all for my own

I don't need, no other love
There can be, no other love
You don't feel, no other love

What if I break into your heart?
Open the lock, take all that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step or run out of time?
Could I make up your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone
I want you all for my own
(Put your heart on me tonight)
I want you all for my own
(Turn your shadows into light)

Drop it off, take a trip
Leave the world, like a rocket ship
Just you and I, no passengers
We can take it off
If we go fast enough
You got all of me, no love to spare
To much to miss, not enough to share
I want you all for my own

I don't need, no other love
There can be, no other love
You don't feel, no other love

What if I break into your heart?
Open the lock, take all that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step or run out of time?
Could I make up your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone
I want you all for my own
(Put your heart on me tonight)
I want you all for my own
(Turn your shadows into light)
I want you all for my own
Gotta feel to (?)
I want you all for my own

I don't need, no other love
There can be, no other love
Never believe, no other love
'Cause you don't feel no other love
I don't need, no other love
There can be, no other love
You don't feel, no other love

What if I break into your heart?
Open the lock, talk all that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step, or run out of time?
Could I make up your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone

I want you all for my own
Put your heart on me tonight
I want you all for my own
Turn your shadows into light
I want you all for my own
Gotta feel to (?)
I want you all for my own, my own, my own

What if I break into your heart?
Open the lactic gone that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step around out of time?
Could I be got to your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love
I want you all for my own
