You called me out and taught me tough
With love, with love
You fought my flaws, my teeth, my claws
With love, with love
'Cause every time I'm slipping away from myself
You're the one that moves me like nobody else

'Cause when I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up

With love

Oh no no
Your tongue won't tie, you always find
The truth, yeah you do
But still you smile despite the lines

I drew for you
'Cause every time I'm slipping away from myself

You're the one that moves me like nobody else
Oh no
'Cause when I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged

When I'm ready to fall

You're the one always holding me up
With love
Love, love, love, love
When I'm down and I'm done

And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up
When I'm down and I'm done
And I'm coming unplugged
When I'm ready to fall
You're the one always holding me up
With love
