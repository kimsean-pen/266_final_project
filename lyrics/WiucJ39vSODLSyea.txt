People say they care, but when it come down to it
Do they have what I'm singing for

Let's sing it for
Sincerity
Sincerity

People, rushin' 'round in their lonely lives
They'd like to care for others, but frankly,
They don't have the time
'Cause they're always doin' the things
They have to do so they'll be alright
Their always lookin' out for their own side
People think they've got priorities right

Sincerity
The road we need to travel for a better way of life
Sincerity
An attitude we need to take if we want to survive
Come on give me (come on) sincerity
Come on give me (come on) sincerity

Heartaches, everybody now and then
They're cryin' out for others,
to listen to them like a friend
But we're always sayin' we don't have the time
But we really sympathize, maybe another time
Don't think about tomorrow
Do it while you've got the chance

Sincerity
The road we need to travel for a better way of life
Sincerity
An attitude we need to take if we want to survive
Come on give me (come on) sincerity
Come on give me (come on) sincerity

Come on give me (come on) sincerity
Come on give me (come on) sincerity

But we're always sayin' we don't have the time
We really sympathize, well, maybe another time
Don't think about tomorrow
Do it while you've got the chance

Sincerity
The road we need to travel for a better way of life
Sincerity
An attitude we need to take if we want to survive
Come on give me (come on) sincerity
Come on give me (come on) sincerity
