When we're young, we design a plan, we work, we build, we make it real
and in the moment it becomes complete,
The first cracks start to appear

A weak foundation, finally revealed
in the desperation, when the walls came tumbling down

Oh, In my prime - Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was - A broken man, Living half a life... (without you...)

On the path to recovery, As a sign of the times, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, On the steps of a modern life

In defeat we redesign the plan, and we give it just one more chance
As we take another deep breath, and prepare for the worst, again

A life in crisis, is always threatened by time
For the longer it takes to be restored...
the less likely it is to occur.

Oh, In my prime - Oh, never to return
Oh, as I once was- A broken man, Living all alone... (without you...)

On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned, On the steps of a modern life

On the path to recovery, with the empires crumbling
I left all dreams abandoned with you, On the steps of a modern life

There is always hope, of course, that one day, we will rise again
but this modern life architecture, Is crumbling, under the weight of the world
