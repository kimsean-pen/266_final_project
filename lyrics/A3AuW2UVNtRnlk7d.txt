Walking slowly
Distilled blood designed to never fail
Sedate and pure
Cold by choice
Stylized pain
I am feeling blue

Lacerated and swallowed down below
I was fearless but now I'm screaming scared
In nothingness
In this emptiness
So I let this void to fill up my heart

Of fire and endless resistance
Where shadows bite like flames
They sing of fire and endless resistance
Where echoes call your name

Medicated and ready
To accept life
As it comes and as it ends
Expectations
And the highest of hopes
You're supposed to be happy
When everything around us
Is alive and green

Of fire and endless resistance
Where shadows call your name
Of fire and endless resistance
Where echoes bite like flames
Forevermore

Hollow men on hollow ground
Crushed bones and bruising souls
Multiple substance abusers
