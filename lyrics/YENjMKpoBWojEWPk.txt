Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before... I
dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war... I dreamed
I saw a mighty room... the room was filled with men... and the papers
they were signing said they'd never fight again. And when the papers
were all signed, and a million copies made, they all shook hands and
bowed their heads and greatful prayers were prayed... and the people
in the streets below were dancing round and round... while swords and
guns and uniforms lay scattered on the ground... Last night I had the
strangest dream I've ever known before... I dreamed that all the world
agreed to put an end to war...
