It started out with a book that I was carrying with me
"Love is a Dog from Hell" I guess you didn't see the relevance back then
I was a sweaty, tattooed mess. You were like a bull at best
But I knew that we wouldn't be doing this again, oh

And I knew if I let you go to waste, I'd never forgive myself
So I sat back, enjoyed my time
Drinking till the morning, laughing with your Dad
I knew that his would be the hardest goodbye

And I want you to notice
And I wish you would care
I just wanted to feel like something's there
I just want a reaction
Yeah something to feel
Or a single emotion that seems real

I turn with it all in my head
As I stumbled 'round the city where your Grandfather died
And I got lost in all the alcohol, open skies and antidotes
Those good ol' boys could charm me all night

And I want you to notice
And I wish you would care
I just wanted to feel like something's there
I just want a reaction
Yeah something to feel
Or a single emotion that seems real

And I was thinking back to that bar in Pensacola
I wonder if my name is still written on the wall
And I was thinking back, oh, to Hugh and Chelsea
Wonder if they're married or still together at all
Still together at all

And I was thinking back to that bar in Pensacola
I wonder if my name is still written on the wall
