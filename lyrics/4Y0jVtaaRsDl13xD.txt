You say goodbye to the halls and the classes
Say hello to a job and the taxes
The weekends with old friends, spilling into 9-5 routines

Tell me how you feel over and done with
Like your life is a map with no compus to guide
At the bar drinking way too much
We sing along to forever young

So here we go again.
Wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy, don't you see what you do to me
I wanna be your lost boy, your last chance, a better reality, yeah
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you're with me say the word and we'll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your everything better plan
Oooh, somewhere in never land
(somewhere in never land)

We'll start a life of the plain and the simple
Of great times with far better people
And weekends with out friends
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth

We'll talk about how your parents separated
And how you dont wanna make the same mistakes as them.
I'll say its all about sticking it
out and trying to feel forever young.

So here we go again.
Wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy, don't you see what you do to me
I wanna be a lost boy, your last chance, a better reality, yeah.
Wendy, we can get away
I promise if you're with me say the word and we'll find a way
I can be your lost boy, your last chance
Your everything better plan
Oooh, somewhere in never land (somewhere in never land)

So here we go again.
Wishing we could start again

Wendy run away with me
I know I sound crazy don't you see what you do to me
I wanna be your lost boy, your last chance a better reality, yeah.
Wendy we can get away
I promise if you're with me say the word and we'll find a way
I can be your lost boy, the last chance
Your everything better plan

Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Oh, somewhere in Neverland
Somewhere in Neverland
