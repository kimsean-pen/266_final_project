Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
So you think I got an evil mind
I tell you honey
But I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singin's out of time
It makes me money
And I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
Oh no
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
So you think I got a funny face
I got no worries
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Oh I gotta sing with some disgrace
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
Oh no no
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
Let's get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
