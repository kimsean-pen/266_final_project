Swallow me
Swallow me
And open up
Let me inside of your mind
I'll live inside of you
To find what you looking for
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
Ohhhhh
Needy Bees
Whispers softly
Tell me what you need
I'll come inside of you
I'll live inside of you
To find what you looking for
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
