Paint me a picture and hang it on the wall
Colour it darkly, the lines must start to crawl
Down, down, down
Spin me around and around
Draw me away to the night from the day
Leave not a trace to be found
Down, down

Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

Paint me a picture of eyes that never see
With flashes of lightning that burn for only me
Hey, hey, hey
There's only the devil to pay
I'm ready to go, pull me down from below
Give me a place I can lay
Hey, hey

Nothing is real but the way that I feel
I feel like going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going
Down, down, down
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down
