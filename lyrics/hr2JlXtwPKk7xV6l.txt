love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right back down to size
sleep the day let it fade
who was there to take your place

no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down

cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this time to find out what I need yeah
I don't want to come back down from this cloud
taken me all this (all this) time

there's no blame only shame
when you beg you just complain
the more I come the more I try
all police are paranoid

so am I so's the future
so are you be a creature
what do you say do you do when it all comes down
'Cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud

it's taken me all this time to find out what I need (yea, yea, yea)
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this (all this)time
Shoot up
Shoot up

Shoot up
You're high
