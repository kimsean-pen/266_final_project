Save me
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Sold my soul to television
Different kind of art

We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

We've got the time
Gonna work. It's worth it. Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions

Lately
Think I've had enough
Of generation information every station
And I can't turn it off
So baby
Why you look so sad?
You've been trying too hard, too hard to be happy
Where's the sense in that?

We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

We've got the time
Gonna work. It's worth it. Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions

Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation

We've got the time
Gonna work. It's worth it. Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions
