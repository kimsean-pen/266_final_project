We go walking in the dark.
We go walking out at night.

And it's not as lovers go,
two by two, to and fro;
but it's one by one -

One by one in the dark.
We go walking out at night.

As we wander through the grass
we can hear each other pass,
but we're far apart -

Far apart in the dark.
We go walking out at night.

With the grass so dark and tall
we are lost past recall
if the moon is down -

And the moon is down.
We are walking in the dark.

If I had your hand in mine
I could shine, I could shine
like the morning sun -
like the sun.
