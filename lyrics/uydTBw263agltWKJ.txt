I've got twelve disciples and a Buddha smile
Garden of Allah, Viking Valhalla
A miracle once in a while

I've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul
Vishnu and Gaia, Aztec and Maya
Dance around my totem pole
Totem pole

I believe in what I see
I believe in what I hear
I believe that what I'm feeling
Changes how the world appears
(Ohh ohh)

(Ohh ohh)
Angeles and demons dancing in my head
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
Media messiahs preying on my fears
(Ohh ohh)
Pop culture prophets playing in my ears

(Ohh ohh)
I've got celestial mechanics
Synchronize my stars
Seasonal migrations, daily variations

World of the unlikely and bizarre
I've got idols and icons, unspoken holy vows
Thoughts to keep well hidden
Sacred and forbidden
Free to browse among the holy cows

That's why I believe
I believe in what I see
I believe in what I hear
I believe that what I'm feeling

Changes how the world appears
Angels and demons dancing in my head
(Ohh ohh)
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
Media messiahs preying on my fears
(Ohh ohh)

Pop culture prophets playing in my ears
Angels and demons dancing in my head
(Ohh ohh)
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
Media messiahs preying on my fears
(Ohh)

Pop culture prophets playing in my ears
Angels and demons inside of me
Saviors and satans all around me
Angels and demons inside of me
(And demons)

All around me
I believe in what I see
I believe in what I hear
I believe that what I'm feeling
Changes how the world appears
(Ohh ohh)
Angels and demons dancing in my head
(Ohh ohh)
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
Angels and demons dancing in my head
(Ohh ohh)
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed
(Ohh ohh)
Sweet chariot, swing low, coming for me
(Ohh ohh)
