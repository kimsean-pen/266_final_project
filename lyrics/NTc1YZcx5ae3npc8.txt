Paralyze the chains
Soft the shelled remains
Stun the strike brigade
They are played

Out with cheek and hair
Take the right to bear
Teeth to bite them down
In the ground

My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone

Introduce your pride
To the other side
Vaporize the trial
With denial

My kind of soldier
You can ride on my shoulders
When you've won
Fight for the moment
Of control, when it opens
Then it's gone
