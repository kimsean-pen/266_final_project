Three months in here
Can't catch the tears
Time never lands
Our love is all that stands now
Streets feel strange
And longer lives can never change

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I feel out of place
Just look at my face
Stuck in the mud
Knee-deep in blood, girl
Eyes blindfold
You never said I'm growing old

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

{My, my, my heart is very light
My, my, my my heart is very [Incomprehensible] very light}

Tell them I've gone
And nothing's wrong
In from the past
A sudden blast, bang
Spring has gone
And summer keeps on coming on

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I'm so glad to have you
And I'm getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I'm so glad to have you
And I'm getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I've a plan to save you
From my misery
I'm a man too brave
To follow history
