Every time this year
this dark fog will appear
up from the tombs it comes
to take one more life that
can be near.
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long
time ago gone, its thin and so
beautiful but also so dark and
mysterious.

Once again the priest is messing
may the god bless us all.
The fog is here again
that'll complete this funeral.
From a place empty of life.
Only dead trees are growing here
as it comes from a far

Only dead trees are growing here

...Funeral Fog
