Wanderers under different stars
Of coldhearted ways
Embers glow behind their eyes

Their fortune flies
Far across the great divide
Where the lonely creature cried
Bitter legend lie in hide

In the void, reaching out
Resonate the words
Of pain and doubt

For when hope is all you have
To keep the flame alive
For when pain is all you feel
For your sustained survival

For when days have turned so dark
That blood is all that's real
Think of those who came before
And let your sacred steel sing songs of war

They stir the blood
Of the battlebred
Of these lost and ironclad

When something bad
Risies, rotten to the core
Holy faith is but a whore
In this wasted endless war

In the void, reaching out
Resonate the words
Of pain and doubt

For when hope is all you have
To keep the flame alive
For when pain is all you feel
For your sustained survival

For when days have turned so dark
That blood is all that's real
Think of those who came before
And let your sacred
Steel sing songs of war

In the void, reaching out
Resonate the words
Of pain and doubt

For when hope is all you have
To keep the flame alive
For when pain is all you feel
For your sustained survival

For when days have turned so dark
That blood is all that's real
Think of those who came before
And let your sacred
Steel sing songs of war
