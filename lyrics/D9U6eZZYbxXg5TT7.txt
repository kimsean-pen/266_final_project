love's followed my memories
drawn out into infinity
tried to grasp them but I always miss
time goes by so fast as though it hardly wants to exist
let's make a mask of our face, of our hands
so that we can be still for a while
for a while
for a while

all the many ways that you can choose to be alive
all the countless steps you take before you have arrived
all the passing faces going quickly on their way
where are they going so quickly
and where are you going to the same
one moment you're awake and making a sound

a lover asleep in your ground
in your ground
in your ground

well shall we wrap it all up in bows
thank you i have all my thoughts to go
wrapped up in a bow to the rest of my song
to hide away
to hide it away
to hide it away
yeah hoping somebody might find it
yeah hoping somebody might find it
yeah hoping somebody might find it
yeah hoping somebody might find it
