Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide you're darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you.
As a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth.

Candles die down as you leave the room
In my heart you leave no gloom
As you lure me I know the truth
You're a leprechaun, I see you through.

Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide you're darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you.
As a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth.
