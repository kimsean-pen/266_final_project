Here we go, I'll smile for you now 'cause you're sad
But I'm not allowed to be sad
Here we go, I'll make a joke for you now, make you smile
But I'm not allowed to be sad

Turn away fallen on the inside from your sky
Felt no pain and didn't ever want to wonder why

Here we go, I'll burn for you now 'cause you're mine
And you're not allowed to feel nothing
Careful I may fall apart for you now, make you cry
But I'm not allowed to be sad

Turn away fallen on the inside from your sky
Felt no pain and didn't ever want to wonder why

Turn away fallen on the inside from your sky
Felt no pain and didn't ever want to wonder why
