There's an answer to my question but there isn't one
There's a moment to discover if you're willing to try
You can lead a horse to water but he may choose to die
Every color has a pigment that we can't figure out
We're all starving for the one thing don't already have
I'm in trouble and I'm breaking but I promise to keep

Breathing, breathing, breathing
I can't make you love you/x2
But I could change your feelings/x2
When our hearts are beating backwards we don't know where to go

All the ways have changed directions another difference to show
I keep trying to be silent but I can't help myself
I'm talking, talking, talking
Every color has a pigment that we can't figure out
We're all starving for the one thing don't already have
I'm in trouble and I'm breaking but I promise to keep

Breathing, breathing, breathing
I can't make you love you /x2
But I could change your feelings /x3
Yeah I could change your feelings
But I could change your feelings /x2
I can't make you love you /x2
