Citizens of science
Closed eyes
Just kill time
Hang up on phones
Stand alone in windows
Of empty rooms
They never wave
Never give you the time of day
They think in shifts
Dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Drinking hard stuff
Listen to the radio full blast
And without a fuss walk passed
Citizens of science
Closed their eyes
And breathe and breathe
Hang up on phones
Stand alone in windows
Of empty rooms
Stare from vacant bars
They never wave
Never give you the time of day
Citizens of science
Hink in shifts
Dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Kill time on faceless stations
Drinking hard stuff
Listening to the radio full blast
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them
They think in shifts
Dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Drinking hard stuff
Listen to the radio full blast
And without a fuss walk passed
Citizens of science
Are silent as walls for days
Then left on shelves breathe away
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science still smile
They know what is good for them
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them
