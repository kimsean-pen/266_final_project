Imma mark my territory
Shawty I'm an animal, slowly digging into you
Spread you like a bad story
Turn you to a criminal
Let me see you cock it back
Bang bang bang on it
Till the headboard break
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you
But first I'll make you sing for me
And all the ladies say

I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
(All aboard)
I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

I could be sweet, lady
Or eat it like a cannibal
Go places that you may can't go
In my back seat baby
You're smoking like some good good
Once I hit that good good
Make me beg beg for it
Mama taught you well
Cause it ain't about booty but the brain baby
Now let me hear you sing to me
And all them ladies say

I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
(All aboard)
I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

She like wearing my snapbacks
She got that snap-back
So if I ever wanna leave
I'll be right back
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me feening
You a go-girl
I never go girl
Cause when you surfing in my bed
I'll be like go girl
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me feening

I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
(All aboard)
I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

Up and down
Up and down
