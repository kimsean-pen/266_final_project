The leaves have changed and we're together again
I've waited so long, do you think we could be us again?
Let's go downtown and hide in some old lounge
And let it get loose and easy, let's be us again

Oh, let's be us again
Oh, let's be

We'll walk down Montague Street
And stop by every place so they can see
I'll buy you a new coat from Arlene's
I can't wait to be like I used to be

Oh, let's be us again
Oh, let's be us again
Come on, get out of bed
We'll start this all over and begin again
Oh, let's be us again
Oh, let's be us again
Come on, get out of bed
We'll start this all over and begin again

Oh, let's be us again
Oh, let's be
Let's be us again
Let's be us again
Oh, let's be us again
Let's be us again
Let's be us again
