I'm wasting my time
On nothing at all
I'm wasting my mind, now
You'd give me a dime for all that I own
You're wasting my time, now
You
Ask for more, ask for more
Who
Can ignore, can ignore
A penny for your thoughts
But a dollar for your sadness
You tell me sweet lies
For nothing at all
You'd think it's a crime, no
You'd leave me behind, for nothing at all
You'd leave me to die (yeah)
You
Ask for more, ask for more
Who
Can ignore, can ignore
A penny for your thoughts
But a dollar for your sadness
Waves are crashing around me
Drag me out to sea
Cast away
Thrown away
