Gotta be above it

And I know that I gotta be above it, now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta buy my time as I'm facing my crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it, now

I gotta be above it

And I know that I gotta be above it, now
And I gotta buy my time as I'm facing my crowd
I know that I gotta be above it, now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

I gotta be above it

This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All those little things don't affect me, now
Know that I gotta be above it, now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

I gotta be above it

This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All these little things don't affect me now
