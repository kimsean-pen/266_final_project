Laboring in the liquid light of Leviathan
Spectres swarm around the sunken cities of the saurians
Rising from the void through the blackness of eternal night
Colossus of the deep comes crashing down with cosmic might

And none may see again the shimmering of Avalon
Or know the fates of all the races man has cursed
Long gone are the ages of the alchemists
Now there are none who know the secrets of the earth

Harken to the howl of the Huntsman's hounds
Or the clarion of kingdoms doomed and drowned

Lament for the passing of the auroch
And the slaying of the ancient wyrm
Would you dare to meet the gaze of the basilisk
Or face the flames as the phoenix burns?

And none may see again the shimmering of Avalon
Or know the fates of all the races man has cursed
Long gone are the ages of the alchemists
Blessed are those who keep the secrets of the earth
Lament the passing of the auroch
and the slaying of the ancient wyrm
Would you dare to meet the gaze of the basilisk
Or face the flames as the phoenix burns?
