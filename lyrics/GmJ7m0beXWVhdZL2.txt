If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby

I wanna take a little time
To refresh your mind
Because the boys are back in town
With a different kinda funk
Who's gots da funk?
We gots da funk, right
Everybody wanna boogie down tonight
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Move 'em 'round from side to side
I got what it takes, the beats, that brace, the funky bass
I'll give your body crazy shakes, come on

I heard somebody say
(What?)
She's at the party so
(Who?)
I'm gonna get me some
(Aah)

If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby

Wiggy, wiggy, I'm gettin' jiggy
Open up the door, got the keys to your city
You're lookin' kinda pretty
Dance till you drop, and it never stop
'Til it goes pop
Dance how you wanna dance
Let's all get down while we got da chance
I've still got twelve seconds on the clock, that's mine
And I ain't gonna stop till the sun don't shine
Line after line, I flow like rhyme after rhyme
Just like time after time
Keep it up till you feel the heat
And get down once you hear the beat

I heard somebody say
(What?)
She's at the party so
(Who?)
I'm gonna get me some
(Aah)

If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby

{Hey you!
You takin' to me?
Show me your steel
I will show you my eye ball technique}

There ain't no problem that we can't fix
'Cos we can do it in the mix
Now if your man gives you trouble
We'll be there on the double
Guaranteed we'll be hittin' for six
Come on, yeah

I heard somebody say
(What?)
She's at the party so
(Who?)
I'm gonna get me some
(Aah)

If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby
