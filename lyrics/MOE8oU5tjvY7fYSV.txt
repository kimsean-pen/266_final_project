Down in the blinding light
It's getting cold
I've been worn out by the night
But I can't let go

The sounds in my ears explain
I've been here too long
A freedom - hard to maintain
I should be gone

Long have I waited here
For nothing to come
A sequence of twisted turns
That can't be undone

They're paying your rent,
They're feeding your kids

But it's taking much more
Than pleasing your needs

Saw the water rising,
On a beautiful day

A flood only washing the ones away
Who were lying in the sun

And you're still where you begun

Long have I waited here
For nothing to come
A sequence of twisted turns
The can't be undone

And you hurt yourself trying
