Take this from me
And keep it at bay
Keep yourself from fate
I want you to be that way
There's nothing to say
The sky feels strange
Words come out weak
I guess it looks real
But I'm running out of fake love

Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me

Set me up now
Make me your foe
I'm heartless I know
There's snakes in my soul
Why you smile, dear?
You were framed
And under the stage
I whispered
That I'm running out of fake love

Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me

Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
Cut out the lights, cut out the lights, cut out the lights
Then it's up to me
