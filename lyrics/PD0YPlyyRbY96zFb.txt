Listen up,
Turn it up and rock it out
Party on
I wanna hear you scream and shout
This is real
As real as it gets
I came to get down, to get some fucking respect

Taking it back to a hardcore level
You better be ready, put your pedal to the metal
Taking it back to a hardcore level
Better be ready, put your pedal to the metal

Go

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

I want domination
I want your submission
I see you're not resistin'
To this temptation
I got one confession
I love deprivation
I've got a jet black heart
That's all fucked up and it's fallin' apart

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

I've got another confession
I fell to temptation
And there is no question
There was some connection
I've got to follow my heart
No matter how far
I've gotta roll the dice
Never look back and never think twice

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved

Take the past
Burn it up and let it go
Carry on
I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal
You get no respect
You're gonna get yours
You better watch your fuckin' neck

Take the past
Burn it up and let it go
Carry on
I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal
You get no respect
You're gonna get yours
You better watch your fuckin' neck
Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Woah, I never give in
Woah, I'll never give up
Woah, I never give in
And I just wanna be, wanna be loved
