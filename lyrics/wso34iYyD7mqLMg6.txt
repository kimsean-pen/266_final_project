Tried to live without you, baby
I should know that by now
Every day's a bad day
And I've been so down

But I saw you walking
Saw her small as interlocking
I've been tethered to this town

Trouble's been following me
Trouble's been following me
Trouble's been following me
Are we forever bound?

Is it just the memories
That keep me planted here?
Did every sea and rode I saw
Shine brighter with you, dear?

But I saw us walking
Saw her small as interlocking
I've been running out of fear

Trouble's been following me
Trouble's been following me
Trouble's been following me
Are we forever bound?
