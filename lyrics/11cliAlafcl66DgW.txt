Let's go down, down to Jericho now
And dip our feet in the river
I'm sick of rolling around the silicon soul
Like throwing stones at a mirror

I see it lurking
Genuine American fear
Get your brother

God loves a million doe-eyed children to cower in his honour

Let's go down, down to Jericho now
And dip our feet in the river
Let's go down, down to Jericho now
And dip our feet in the river

And that's why you'll forgive us no pride
In taking means from an oppressed
If Heaven waits for the peace that we make with it
I'll burn in the protest

You'll see me rise from my perfect demise
And see my light through your shutters
You'll see me take it, squeeze it, break it on to another
Another

Let's go down, down to Jericho town
And dip our feet in the river
So sick of rolling around this silicon soul
Like throwing stones at a mirror
Stones at a mirror

Let's go down, down to Jericho town
And dip our feet in the river
So sick of rolling around this silicon soul
Like throwing stones at a mirror
Stones at a mirror
