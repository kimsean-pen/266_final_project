The world's on my back, again
And I've been a head case most days
And I know you hate all the repartee
But, I can't keep it contained
It keeps slipping off my tongue
and the taste is so addicting
I'm chasing the answer to the ringing in my head
I've been on the edge, again
I've been nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Fighting like hell to keep afloat
I heard everything they said
That I'm nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Doing more damage than good
I never told you this was easy
I never thought I'd settle down
until you slid yourself inside my
heart and I could use your smile, now
You know it picked me up when I've been down
and each mile marker pulls me down
You are the answer to the ringing in my head
I've been on the edge, again
I've been nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Fighting like hell to keep afloat
I heard everything they said
That I'm nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Doing more damage than good
And I just wanna say the things I know I should've
But, these days my confidence comes off as arrogant
that I'm a long shot, lost cause
Doing more damage than good
I'll press my stress into the palm of
my hands until my fingertips turn pale
Thought I'd be infatuated with the thrill
of the chase until the blood in me ran stale
See, I was never concerned with how much
money I earned and I just needed to pay my bills
So, I'm selling front row tickets to the end of my
wits cause I know how the world just loves to watch me fail
And it's so damn sickening
how this world gets off on misery
I've been on the edge, again
I've been nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Fighting like hell to keep afloat
I heard everything they said
That I'm nothing but a long shot, lost cause
Doing more damage than good
But, I'm pushing back just like I knew I always could
So, curb your ignorance, I'm fucking over it
I'm not a long shot, lost cause
I'm an underdog through and through
