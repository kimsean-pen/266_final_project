DIAMONDS
I was born a unicorn
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me

GINGER
I was born a unicorn
I could've sworn you believed in me
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead?

DIAMONDS
Put your crystals under my pillow
GINGER
Send your epistle to my better fellows

DIAMONDS
If I start believing in you
GINGER
If you start believing in me
DIAMONDS
If I start believing in you
GINGER
If you start believing in me

We're the unicorns,
We're more than horses,
We're the unicorns,
And we're people too!
