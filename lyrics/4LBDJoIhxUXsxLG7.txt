I won't go till the sun lights the night
And the moon is melting my skin
Water turns to fire
And flames are freezing to ice

I won't go till I've tasted dark wine
Made out of deepest sorrow
Absorbing winds of suffering
On fields of blood and tears

Pictures move fast...
The end in sight
But I will break...
The laws of time

I won't go till I've immersed myself
On the trail of mystery
Searching for the sacred two headed worm
Who crawls down my soul

Pictures move fast...
The end in sight
But I will break...
The laws of time

I won't go till the sun lights the night
And the moon is melting my skin
Water turns to fire
And flames are freezing to ice

I won't go till I've tasted dark wine
Made out of deepest sorrow
Absorbing winds of suffering
On fields of blood and tears

Pictures move fast...
The end in sight
But I will break...
The laws of time
