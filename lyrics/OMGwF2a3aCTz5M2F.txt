You wander through every charted street
Near where that flowing water goes
And down in every face you meet
You find a sadness, a story untold

You feel all the cries of all the men
You feel all of their fear
And in your voice and in your bend,
My mind sees thoughts I can't hear

Could you leave them all in London?
Could you leave them all there?
Could you run past your devils
And let your mind be clear?

Could you leave them all in London?
Could you leave them all there?
'Cause in you there's an angel
An angel trapped by fear
You're so trapped by fear

You live your life, on the line
While every blackening church appalls
And all their words run sapless and dry
And they run like blood down your apartment walls

You feel every cry of every man
You feel all of their fear
And in your voice and in your bend,
My mind sees thoughts I can't hear

Could you leave them all in London?
Could you leave them all there?
Could you run past your devils
And let your mind be clear?

Could you leave them all in London?
Could you leave them all there?
'Cause in you there's an angel
An angel plagued by fear

'Cause in you there's an angel
an angel trapped by fear

But I'll be here

But I'll be here
Oh I'll be here

oh I'll be here, I'll be here

I'll be here
