New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

When you're a boy
Some days are tough
Lying on your bad
Playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
You gotta escape
Wanna go and wander in the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy

Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware

At the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb
If you don't get the mix
It's got eighty-six
You feel the deal is real

You're in New York City
New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy

Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy

Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York City
New York City
New York City Boy

You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway (You'll never have a bored day)
New York City Boy (New York City)
This is your reward day (You'll never have a bored day)
'Cause you're a New York City Boy (New York City)
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
