Where'd you go
Forgive me for asking
No one knows
So tell me where you've been
Well I'm sorry for thinking
This isn't the end
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed
Swallow the words on the tip of your tongue
Cause we don't need them
You think you'll get the best of me
We'll see

I need the anger, I need the rage
I need the worst things you can say
If you wanted a war I guess you got what you came for
Give me an answer, another way
I can bend and never break
If I wanted your help I'd tell you to bite your tongue
But it's too late

I'm betting your next decision
Could be your biggest mistake
I guess you get what you pay for
I bet it's not what you think
So here we go
Another perfect disaster
Write this down
Another line in a song
I hope for your sake
You can hear me
Cause we both need this

I need the anger, I need the rage
I need the worst things you can say
If you wanted a war I guess you got what you came for
Give me an answer, another way
I can bend and never break
If I wanted your help I'd tell you to bite your tongue
But it's too late

You'll try and you'll fail
I'll be the one that prevails
You'll try and you'll fail
I'll be the one that prevails

I need the anger, I need the rage
I need the worst things you can say
If you wanted a war I guess you got what you came for
I need the anger, I need the rage
I need the worst things you can say
If you wanted a war I guess you got what you came for
Give me an answer, another way
I can bend and never break
If I wanted your help I'd tell you to bite your tongue
But it's too late
