I feel you
It's like you're in the next room
At any given moment, you could reappear
Thin air, you're out there in it somewhere
If I could only get there
I could breathe again

Tell me how to start
What comes after you
I am in the dark
Love what now?

No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go then there is
No such thing as over this
I've tried to get over you, over you, over you
But I think, there's no such thing

Broken, you roam by in the ruins
The stone I can't find you in
Is all that still remains

Little white lights
They perforate every night sky
I say it to them every time, come back in

No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go then there is
No such thing as over this
I've tried to get over you, over you, over you

You're on my mind, all the time
But I can't fix it by fixating on a rewind
(Tried to get over you, over you, over you)
When a good thing changes
When the change is staying
Only thing to find is
What to hold on till there's something else to
Hold on to
(Over you, over you, over you)
Hold on, till there's something else to
Hold on to

No such thing
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go then there is
No such thing as over this
I've tried to get over you, over you, over you
But I think, there's no such thing
