Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm, that he aint lonely

Mary counts walls, knows he tires easily

Johnny thinks the world would be right, if it would buy, truth from him
Mary says he changes his mind, more than a woman

But she made her bed, even when the chance was slim

Johnny says he's willing to learn, when he decides, he's a fool
Johnny say's he'll live any where, when he earns time to

Mary combs her hair, says she should be use to it

Mary always edges her bets, she never knows, what to think
She says that he still acts, like he's being discovered

Scared that he'll get caught, without a second thought

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath, trying to talk, sense to her
Mary says he's lacking a real, sense of proportion
So she combs her hair, knows he tires easily

Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm, that he aint lonely

Mary counts walls, says she should be use to it
