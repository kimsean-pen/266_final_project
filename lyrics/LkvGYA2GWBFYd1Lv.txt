Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night is the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated

Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
(We can watch it and stay, and we can listen)

Oh rainy day, come 'round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
And oh, but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
I spent the night with the queen of Spain
My lonely little heart well it broke again
Time so vicious
(Sing, sing)

The deeper that the knife goes in
The more you win
You end up with less than where you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in oh, oh, oh

Oh rainy day, come 'round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
And oh, but I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
