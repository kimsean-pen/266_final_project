Your government hates you
Hates you 'cause you're free
Can't be fooled, won't be ruled
By the total state machine

Control, control, homogenize
Going through great lengths
Fascist blight won't recognize
Diversity is human strength

Zeroed in on, hollowed out
Eroded and run down
The grand ideals and principles
By which we once were bound

Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you

Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you

Our government hates us
They hate us, you and me
Right by right being taken away
By the total state machine

Barren words, abject deeds
Paranoia to the Nth degree
Despotic rule by fire and sword
Lady Liberty's been raped and cored

Zeroed in on, hollowed out
Eroded and run down
The grand ideals and principles
By which we once were bound

Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you

Your government hates you (Hates you)
Your government hates you
(And you, and you, and you)
Your government hates you too

Our governments hate us
Because we're not afraid
Unimpressed, we won't be silenced
Never lose our faith

Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you

Your government hates you
Your government hates you
Your government hates you

Hate your government
You hate your government
Your government hates you
Hate your government
You hate your government
Your government hates you
