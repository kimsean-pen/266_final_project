I see you
Down on the front line
Such a sight
For sore eyes
You're a suicide

Makeover
Plastic eyes
Lookin' through a numbskull
Self-effaced

What's his face?
You erased yourself so

Shut up
You don't let up
You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck

You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified
'Cause you
Don't know

You don't say
And you got no reply

Hey, you
Where did you come from?

Got a head full of lead
You're an inbred bastard son

All dressed up
Red blooded, a mannequin

Do or die, no reply
Don't deny that you're synthetic
You're pathetic
You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified
'Cause you don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply
You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply
I see you
Down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes
You're a suicide
Makeover
You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply
You don't know
You don't say
And you got no reply
