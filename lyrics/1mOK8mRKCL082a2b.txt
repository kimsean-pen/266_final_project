I'm filled with your hope
Which used to die last
A soul so pure
Unknown area

Be ready for what you'll become In the body of mine

Life sustainment to continue mutilation
Daily I go with the extreme
Like they told me to

They are the most precious in my opinion
But the rest is lovely too
Like the brain, the main part It gives you heart

On and on and on and on
Repetitive is part of my love

And I know your worst, orphans too
Hold your breath, hold your words till
The end is what they call for, pretender
Embrace the life and my dawn, born and gone

Life sustain
