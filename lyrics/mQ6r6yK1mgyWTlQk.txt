I can see behind your eyes, tell the truth not to the lie
You were so mysterious taking them to be around

Goodbye, I'm floating in space, tonight I see look you near

I can see behind your eyes, tell the truth not to the lie
You were so mysterious taking them to be around

Goodbye, I'm floating in space, tonight I see look you near
Goodbye, I'm floating in space, tonight I see look you near

Telling stories from today what we did and what we said
You were happy and I just know we're scathing heather with every day
