Never thought I'd fall in love
Now I stand corrected
Never thought I'd feel what I feel
Never been so affected

Now I know what I know
But right now it seems so subjective
Oh, oh

You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness, then you creeped in, bam
Took my heart then, bam
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode

Bam, my life has changed
Bam, can't concentrate
Bam, I was okay
Until we met that day then

Bam, I am obsessed
Bam, can't get no rest
Bam, ever since we met
I think I know what love is, bam

I felt so secure with these walls around me
Boys would take me out
But bring me back where they found me
And there's no harm, no foul
'Cause they never got a chance to know me, yeah

You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness, then you creeped in, bam
Took my heart then bam
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode

Bam, my life has changed
Bam, can't concentrate
Bam, I was okay
Until we met that day then

Bam, I am obsessed
Bam, can't get no rest
Bam, ever since we met
I think I know what love is bam

And if I had to walk a million miles
To find your smile I would, you know I would, babe
And if you took a trip to Costa Rica
And told me I need ya I would, I would, I would
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Bam, my life has changed
Bam, can't concentrate
Bam, I was okay
Until we met that day then

Bam, I am obsessed
Bam, can't get no rest
Bam, ever since we met
I think I know what love is bam

You surprised me, hypnotized me
Found my weakness, then you creeped in, bam
Took my heart then bam
Oh, you started to make my whole world just explode

Bam
