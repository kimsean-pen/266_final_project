Some people are almost impossible to live with
Some people have faith in the craziest things
They follow outdated conventions that were recorded
But most of it to me all sounds insane

Maybe that's what you need to get you through the night
Maybe you've seen the light
But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right

Nothing can go on while forever increasing
The universe expanding is a different thing
But to turn a nasty habit into a virtue
Can't replace the need for charity

Maybe it's what you need to help you through the night
Maybe you've seen the light
But you know popular consensus doesn't make it right

Like the seed of all creation or a doomsday scheme
The future might be bright or bleak
But you know popular consensus doesn't mean much to me
