If I wait now, I'm over here now
Trying to fill the space
Sing your song up, so I can wake up
In that old familiar place

Tell me what you want gimme something, show me something nobody else can do, but you
I know what you like, I know what you say, I know every step you take, every little move you
but hey we do it anyway

White light, here comes the feeling
The cigarettes, dangerous
Blue waves, I keep believe in
Are strong enough, but then you're
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, can't look away, can't look away

I hit the pavement, I felt amazement
I built some castles made of sand
I tore some walls down, and played the underground
Broke some hearts that were made of glass

[Pre-Chorus -
Tell me what you want gimme something, show me something nobody else can do, but you
You know what I like, you know what I say, you know every step I take, every little move I make
but hey, you do it anyway

White light, here comes the feeling
The cigarettes, dangerous
Blue waves, I keep believe in
Are strong enough, but then you're
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, I can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, I can't look away, can't look away

Oh, your light is blinding
Oh, pretty colors
I can't turn away

(Dangerous, dangerous)
(Dangerous, dangerous)
Cause you're ultraviolet, can't turn away, I can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, I can't look away, can't look away
I can't look away, can't look away
You're ultraviolet, can't turn away, I can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, I can't turn away, I can't turn away
You're ultraviolet, can't turn away, I can't turn away

I can't turn away, can't turn away
I can't turn away, can't turn away
