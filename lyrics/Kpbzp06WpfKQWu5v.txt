Dearest love it's been too long
It's been dark since you've been gone
I see you in my dreams at night
Call your name a million times
Feel like we were dancing on the stars
Feel like I was really in your arms
You can be here with me
You and me forever in my dreams

Don't ever wake me
Don't ever wake me up
I'll stay here dreaming
Cause this is were you are, are, are
You are, are, are

Dearest love it's been too long
It's been dark since you've been gone
I see you in my dreams at night
Call your name a million times
Feel like we were dancing on the stars
Feel like I was really in your arms
You can be here with me
You and me forever in my dreams

I'd give, I'd give you love
These things you let me ride
I'd play the wild night
Behind my steal cold eyes, eyes, eyes
My eyes, eyes, eyes

Dearest love it's been too long
It's been dark since you've been gone
I see you in my dreams at night
Call your name a million times
Feel like we were dancing on the stars
Feel like I was really in your arms
You can be here with me
You and me forever in my dreams

Sleep, sleep, need your love
When the sun is up, I run to you
Sleep, sleep, need your love
Ah yeah (Oh oh oh oh)
Sleep, sleep, need your love
When the sun is up, I run to you
Sleep, sleep, need your love
You and me forever in my dreams
