Excuse me
Your heart is in my heart
Hello
You've taken this too far

Am I just a piece you push in just your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go

I beg your pardon
You're standing on my love
Hello
Have you not had enough?

Am I just a piece you push in just your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go go
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go go

It's my time to shine and my sword is true
You're back inside my mind, I can't stop rememberin'
I say I'm chasin' dream
Which you know I've been runnin' away from
Runnin' away from you
Some sort of comfort in your pain, I can't help but take it
No matter how I change, there'll be no escapin'
I say I'm chasin' time but you know I've been runnin' away from
Runnin' away from you

Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go go
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go go
