when the damage is done
and we lie here
what good am I now?
when the year is one
countdown all clear
sooner than now
if you name your price
tell me how much
good am I now?
and if you close your eyes
I think I might feel
sooner than now

will you see it begin
if we lie here
what good am I now?
don't know how to win
break down again
sooner than now

and nothing ever happens like you plan it
this world and your problems

how much am I good for you
if you won't believe?
how much can one heart do
as the second leaves?

and nothing ever happens like you plan it
this world and your problems
whoever dares to crawl between it
will fail to solve them

how much am I good for you
how much can one heart do
as the second leaves?
how much your smiles are cruel
when you play, deceit
how much can one heart do
as the second leaves?
