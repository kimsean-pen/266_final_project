Hey! Pay attention
Hey! Or pay the price
Hey! It's not pleasant

Hey! Not nice

I'm on a mission
To make things right

Hey! Be attentive
Hey! Stay prepared
Hey! Be relentless
Hey! Be scared

I'm on a mission
To make things right

This is the end of human wishes
This is the end of what we made
Hey! Stay informed

Hey! We were warned
Hey! I'm on a mission
Hey! Before the storm

I'm on a mission
To make things right

Hey! I'm in the matrix
Hey! I'm in the right

The facts will always have their way
It's not for us to be dismissive
The truth will always have its day

This is the end of human wishes
This is the end of what we made.
