I don't want to get to know you
Get too close to you,
Though you may want me to.

I've been watching you
They've been deceiving you,
It gives you an excuse
To taste some abuse.

No one likes to
Be lied to
Now you lie to me to protect yourself
Please remember the words we exchanged
How the truth changes shape under strain
And I'm stung every time

I don't love you
I don't like you
I dig what you do
And that's all
I don't know you
Don't respect you
Don't expect too much
From me or from you

And if I have to choose between me and you
I'd choose me though I know I'd lose
And be stung every time

Oh, it's a stinger
It's a bitch
We are lungs spitting welter
A heart with a schism
A bond with a stitch

I don't love you
I don't respect you
Don't expect too much
From me or you

I don't know you
I never did
I dig who you were
And that's it

And if I have to chose between me and you
It's the last thing that I'd want to do
I don't love you
I don't love you
Stinger
