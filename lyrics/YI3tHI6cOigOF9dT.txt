Pull my hair tell me I'm the best you've ever had
Will you leave your girl for me? and hit the road Jack
Cause you're so wrong but it's so right
I get drunk and you get high
It's alright
We'll car crash in a cadillac
I coming forwards and he only look back
We'll car crash in a cadillac I can only look back
All I see is what I had
Sirens screaming down the track
All that is hard and all that I wanted the wheel in hand
Cause I love the road and the paris motel with you again
Cause you're so wrong but it's so right
I get drunk and you get high
It's alright
We'll car crash in a cadillac
I coming forwards and he only look back
We'll car crash in a cadillac I can only look back
All I see is what I had
Sirens screaming down the track

We'll car crash in a cadillac
I coming forwards and he only look back
We'll car crash in a cadillac I can only look back
All I see is what I had
Sirens screaming down the track
