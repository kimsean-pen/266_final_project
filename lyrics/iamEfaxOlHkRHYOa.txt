(hey Michael come on a swing)
mmhhmm
(looks like you've got the world on a string)
I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh what a world, oh what a life
I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rainbow
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see
I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'de be a silly so and so
If i should ever let you go love

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
Oh what a world and what a life
I'm in love

(Solo)

Life is a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'de be a crazy so and so
If I should ever let her go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh what a world, oh what a life
Oh what a world, what a life
Oh what a world, oh what a life
Mmmh, I'm in love
(He's in love, he's in love)
Mmmh, I'm in love
(Got the world on a string)
And what a wonderful thing
(Oh hey)
I got the world
(Aha)
on a string
