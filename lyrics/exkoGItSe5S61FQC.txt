Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
You'd better come on in my kitchen
babe it going to be rainin outdoors
Ah the woman I love
took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky
stiole her back again
You'd better come on in my kitchen
babe it going to be rainin outdoors
Oh-ah she's gone
I know she won't come back again
I've taken the last nickel
out of her nation sack
You'd better come on in my kitchen
babe it going to be rainin outdoors
When a woman gets in trouble
everybody throws her down
Lookin for her good friend
none can be found
You'd better come on in my kitchen
babe it going to be rainin outdoors
Winter time's comin
its gonna be slow
You can't make the winter babe
thats dry long so
You'd better come on in my kitchen
babe it going to be rainin outdoors
