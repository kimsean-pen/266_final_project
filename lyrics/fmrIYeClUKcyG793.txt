Starless sky
We've got so good at pretending
There's a side
A side to you that isn't running
But I don't know where it is
That you've been hiding
But I need you tonight
But I need you tonight

Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade but I won't let them
Oh I'm holding onto heaven
When I breath and it's only you

All these years
I've been chasing down the answers
I was here
Always tracing out your shadows
But I need you tonight

Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade but I won't let them
Oh I'm holding onto heaven
When I breath and it's only you

I can't take it
Cause you think nobody sees what you doing to me
I'm telling you guilt is in your eyes
I hate what you've done
What you've made me become
No sleep, face the night

Oh I'm holding on

Lights fade but I won't let them
Cause I'm holding onto heaven
When I breath and it's only you
Cause I'm holding onto heaven
Lights fade but I won't let them
Yeeah
Cause I'm holding
Oh I'm holding onto heaven
