i have a recurring dream
every time i lose my voice
i swallow little glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me

during the night
they do a trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above my bed

while i'm asleep
my mother and son pour into me
warm glowing oil
into my wide open throat

i have a recurring dream
every time i feel a hoarseness
i swallow warm glowing lights
my mother and son baked for me

they make me feel so much better
they make me feel better

we have a recurring dream
everytime we lose our voices
we dream we swallow little lights
our mother and sons bake for us

during the night
they do a little trapeze walk
until they're in the sky
right above our heads
right above our heads

while we're asleep
my mother and son pour into us
warm glowing oil
into our wide open throats

i have a recurring dream...

they make me feel better
they make me feel better
