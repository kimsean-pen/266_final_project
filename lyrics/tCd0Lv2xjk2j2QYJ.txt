Consume by this circle of
Narrow minded fucking assholes.
Antipathy strikes me to build up the rage,
Obliteration at stake. Before you betary us,
We have already stabbed you dead.
Think before fuck with us,
We'll blast you in your fucking head
Trust, disappearing.
You are the occurence
Of a change for the very worse.
