I said I told you everything
But I left something out
Underneath the stairwell
And I'm under lock and key
But you can probably tell
A powder keg in a prison cell

I want to return
But all you would do is turn to leave
If I can't find my way home
Will you take hold of me

'Cause I've been gone so long
I can barely say
All I know is now I want to stay
Has it been too long
Since I went away
'Cause I'm trying to find the words
But I can barely say

I used to be the son
Waiting silently
But they barely noticed me
And I've been talking in my sleep
If anybody sees
They'll turn and they'll run from me

I want to return
But all you would do is turn to leave
If I can't find my way home
Will you take hold of me

'Cause I've been gone so long
I can barely say
All I know is now I want to stay
Has it been too long
Since I went away
'Cause I'm trying to find the words
But I can barely say

I wanted to run
I wanted to love and be loved in return
But will I ever get back
Do I know too much to return

'Cause I've been gone so long
I can barely say
AlI know is now I want to stay
Has it been too long
Since I went away
'Cause I'm trying to find the words
But I can barely say
