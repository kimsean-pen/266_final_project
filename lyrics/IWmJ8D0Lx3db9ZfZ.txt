While looking for the answers
Only questions come to mind
'Cause I have been lost in circles
Which seems now for quite some time
And I don't know how I came here, even how I got this far
All I can tell you is my fate is written in the black stars
Well, what am I supposed to do?

Bless myself this perfect hell of my own

Is the best I've ever known
Tell me something I don't want to know
'Cause I can't believe it's so
What am I supposed to do?
I've become

Sick of everyone now

And I don't feel remorse for all forgotten
And I don't care at all!
I've become
Sick of everyone now
And I don't pray to voice of all the problems
And I don't care at all!

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Take me away
I'm sick of everyone today
I'm not ok
But I'm fine this way
I need no change
So take me away

I'm coming down, I fell apart
It's hard to keep together

When you don't know where to start
I've become
Sick of everyone now
And I don't feel remorse for the forgotten
And I don't care of all!
I've become
Sick of everyone now
And I'm the patron voice of all the problems
I'm sick of everyone!
