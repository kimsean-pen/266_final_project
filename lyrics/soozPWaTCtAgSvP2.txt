They're not gonna keep me down

They're not gonna shut me out
They're gonna do what they do, I do me
I'm moving against the crowd
I'm drowning out, way down
They're gonna do what they do
I do something original
Be unforgettable
They're gonna know my name

(One day) I'll make you a believer
(One day) I got this all I need is
(One day) Don't try to tell me I can't (tell me I can't)
(And now) I'm a light in the future
(Watch out) Wont stop I'm a mover
(One day) You're gonna know who I am
I will fly high and free
It's my fate wait and see one day

I've been afraid before
To reach for something more
But now I see that it's mine, I'll take it
Just go ahead and try
You're not gonna change my mind
There's no such thing as too late
Yeaaaaaahhhh!

(One day) I'll make you a believer
(One day) I got this all I need is
(One day) Don't try to tell me I can't (tell me I can't)
(And now) I'm a light in the future
(Watch out) Wont stop I'm a mover
(One day) You're gonna know who I am
I will fly high and free
It's my fate wait and see

I'm on a mission, no longer listening
To anyone that says don't try
Sometimes you feel it, deep in your spirit
It's like a fire that won't die

(One day) Wait and see
(One day) Oooh
(One day) Just wait and see

(One day) I'll make you a believer
(One day) I got this all I need is
(One day) Don't try to tell me I can't (ooooh)
(And now) I'm a light in the future
(Watch out) Wont stop I'm a mover
(One day) You're gonna know who I am (know who I am)
I will fly high and free
It's my fate wait and see, one day
One day, one day
One day, one day, one day
