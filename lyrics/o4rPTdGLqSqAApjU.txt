Well I want to be with you
(when can I?)
I don't know, well I'm workin,
Babe, but I want you, too, there,
But I want to be around
And I want you around, deep down
Imbedded in my brain,
Inbedded in my-wow,
What pure pain

All of the roads that I travel down
Get lost and then found again
All bring me back to my baby
Yeah, that's what you are
Every time that I look out my window
All of my thoughts they go travelin
Out where the coldest of winds blow
Only to drift back to you, girl
Yeah, that's what you are...

And I want to be with you (when can I?)
I don't know, when I'm workin, babe, I want/wish you were here
Cuz I want to be around,
And I want you around
Deep down I'm breakin d-down...
Wow, it's the purest of pure pain

Every time that I look out my window
All my emotions they are spreading
Zip thru winding highways in my head
Pick up momentum then I'm coastin
Only to turn around abrupt
Come back for my love
Yeah, that's what you are
Yeah, that's what you are
