Whats up, Fresh, it's our turn, baby

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But thats okay, 'cause I'm still fly

Gotcha car, play gems on shine, said it's mine
Get a mink, baby girl, let's ride
You da numba 1 stunna, and we gonna glide
And go straight to the mall and turn out the inside

Prowler Gucci full length leather
Burbons cooler, Coogi sweater
Twenty inches pop my feather
The Birdman daddy I fly in any weather

Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-Wagon so fly
Numba 1, don't tangle and twisle
When it come to these cars I am that nigga

The Gucci with the matching interior
3 wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and stunna and we like brothers
We shine like paint daddy this our summer

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But thats okay, 'cause I'm still fly

Got a quarter tank gas in my new E-class
But that's alright 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my moma's name
But I'm hood rich da, dada, dada, da

Have you ever seen the crocodile seats in the truck?
Turn around and sit it down and let em' bite ya butt
See, the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma playa is where u can find me

Pushing through the parking lot on 24's
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With the navigation arrow headed straight to your spot
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot

Put the Caddy up, Start the 3 wheel Benz
Hyper white lights, ultra violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, boy can you top that?

I'ma show you some shit rookie press that button
The trunk went eh, eh and all of a sudden
4 15's didn't see no wire's
And then I heard boom from the amplifiers

Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala Loud pipes, drinking that hen
It's the birdy, birdy man, I'll do it again
In the Cadillac truck 24's with 10's

Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
6 bad broads flying in at 9
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they go and

Bodies on the Roadster Lexus
You know with that hard top beamer, mommy that's your truck
I'm coming up the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up the bubbley

430 lex with convertible top
The rims keep spinning every time I stop
I got a superman Benz that I scored from shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But thats okay, 'cause I'm still fly

Got a quarter tank gas in my new E-class
But that's alright 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my moma's name
But I'm hood rich, da, dada, dada, da
