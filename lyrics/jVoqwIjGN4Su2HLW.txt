Beautiful child you'll never be lonely
Just like a tree you raise to the sky
So light moving so slowly
Making your way to no one's land

Shine and lift your head high
Hold you'll never be lonely
Cause life is all that you need

Forgive the unkind so bitter and envy
No light in their day blackening lies
Shine bright see all your glory
No need to cry stay strong and you'll fly

So shine and lift your head high
Hold you'll never be lonely
Cause life is all that you need

So shine and lift your head high
(It's all you need, it's all you need)
Hold you'll never be lonely

So shine and lift your head high
(It's all you need, it's all you need)
Hold you'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely
(Stay strong and you'll fly)
You'll never be lonely
(You beautiful child)
You'll never be lonely
