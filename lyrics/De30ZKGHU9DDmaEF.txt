Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railing's froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere

Ooee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh ho, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

I don't care how many letters they sent
The morning came
The morning went
Pack up your money
Pick up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere

Ooee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh ho, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to a tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere

Ooee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh ho, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Now Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill
No matter how steep
When we get up to it

Ooee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh ho, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Ooee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh ho, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?
