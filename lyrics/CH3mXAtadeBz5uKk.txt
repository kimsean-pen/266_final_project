Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all away to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sung up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
...
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through every thing I done
Every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home, I hope she'll find
And I've trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', oh, but it's free
Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
But that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
