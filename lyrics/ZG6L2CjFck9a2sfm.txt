Feel me
Cuz' I'm all you need
So fill me up
Cuz' I'm all you need

Light me or fill me up
Wanna get lost
So leave me
When I'm down
Then turn around

Promise me that you'll leave me one day
So I can watch a better way
They usually come and go
You usually come and go

They usually come and go
Promise me that you'll leave me one day
You usually come and go

[?] Gonna fill me up
[?] Gonna fill me up

Light me or fill me up
Bring around the things you used to do
Embarrass me
Then turn it around
And say "It's not me, it's you"

[?] Gonna fill me up
[?] Gonna fill me up
Not me, It's not me

Promise me that you'll leave me one day
So I can watch a better way
They usually come and go
You usually come and go

You usually come and go
You usually come and go
You usually come and go
I was without you [?]

[?] Gonna fill me, up
Not me, It's not me
