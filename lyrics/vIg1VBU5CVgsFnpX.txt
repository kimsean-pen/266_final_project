Long, long, long time
Long, long, long time
Lil TJay
Diamonds, they dancin' all over my body
You try to take them it turn to a homi'
Thotties be on me, I just catch the Mosi'
Sippin' on lean, now I feel like a zombie
I'm wit' the gang, it be dumb if you try me
I tell my hoes, "Rake it up," like Yo Gotti
I do my thing and I fuck up a party
Niggas that hate, they gonna wanna say "Sorry"
Free my guys, I ain't seen 'em in a long, long, long time
We gon' shine, that's the reason why I stay on my grind
Niggas dyin', that's the reason why I stay near my 9
Can't be mine, made a promise that we all gon' be fine
Yeah, whoa
Nigga, I switch up my flow
Yeah, bro, all of my niggas on go
Pesos, niggas ain't gettin' to those
I put my necklace on froze
I put a band on my toes
This was a dream, now my goals gettin' bigger
Bringin' all my niggas
Ooh, we don't care 'bout the opps, they don't bust no triggers
Yeah, yeah
I had to get on my Birkin, just so they see that I'm workin'
Spinnin' the Warith, we ain't duckin' from the jakes
Legal money in the safe
I remember them days locked down in the cage
Calender full of days
Camera see my whole face
Got sentenced on the case
Maxed out to the day
They ain't cut me no break
They ain't cut me no break
Diamonds, they dancin' all over my body
You try to take them it turn to a homi'
Thotties be on me, I just catch the Mosi'
Sippin' on lean, now I feel like a zombie
I'm wit' the gang, it be dumb if you try me
I tell my hoes, "Rake it up," like Yo Gotti
I do my thing and I fuck up a party
Niggas that hate, they gonna wanna say "Sorry"
Free my guys, I ain't seen 'em in a long, long, long time
We gon' shine, that's the reason why I stay on my grind
Niggas dyin', that's the reason why I stay near my 9
Can't be mine, made a promise that we all gon' be fine
Niggas hate, they so fake, tryna stand up in my face
Skipping states, on probabtion so I swear this shit ain't safe
They be lyin', lyin', lyin', lyin', lyin' on my name
I was cryin', cryin', cryin', broski died up in my face
So much pain, no gain, feel like music all I got
Feel like I let broski down if we don't make it to the top
Nigga run up, I don't know him, swear to God I'm sendin' shots
I was posted on the corner tryna sell shit like the Ocks
Bodies drop, bodies drop
Swear to God this shit won't stop
Bodies drop, bodies drop
Swear to God this shit won't stop
They be lyin', lyin', lyin', lyin', lyin' on my name
I was cryin', cryin', cryin', broski died up in my face
Diamonds, they dancin' all over my body
You try to take them it turn to a homi'
Thotties be on me, I just catch the Mosi'
Sippin' on lean, now I feel like a zombie

Long, long, long time

Long, long, long time
Long, long, long time
