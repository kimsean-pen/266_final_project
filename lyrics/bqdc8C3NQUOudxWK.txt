Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea
Maybe it's just
That I have never been the kind to pass a lucky penny by

Maybe it's wise
Maybe it's not
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I forgot
Isn't it nice
To talk about the special way that you smile whenever I'm around

Rising on the shore the oceans came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me

Couldn't we stay
Or must we go
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool
Would want to leave the paradise that I find whenever you're around
Only a fool

Isn't it nice
To talk about the special way that you smile whenever I'm around
Rising on the shore the oceans came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me
Love for me

Couldn't we stay
Or must we go
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool
Would want to leave the paradise that I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Only a fool
