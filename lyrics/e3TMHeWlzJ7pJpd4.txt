We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You led us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth
Don't you know it's true, oh

Norway, a-a-ay, a-a-a-a-a-ay
Norway, a-a-ay, a-a-a-a-a-ay

Seven figures lead the hungry mob
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun
Don't you know it's true, oh

Norway, a-a-ay, a-a-a-a-a-ay
Norway, a-a-ay, a-a-a-a-a-ay

Where you thinking that you're gonna run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
Hang onto the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they open to your breath

Norway, a-a-ay, ay
Norway, a-a-ay, ay
Norway, a-a-ay, ay
Norway, a-a-ay, ay
