It's ok
To go and make mistakes
It's ok
To break your promises
You're moving on anyway

I hate the way
It makes me feel inside
You promised me
You'd be all that I need
I wonder why you lied.

(Chorus)
Promises you made are comin' back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

It gave me time
To think about you and me
I hate the way
You make me feel inside
I wonder why you lied

(Chorus)

(Duh-duh)
I was breathing cos that's that the gauge was indicating
While was blaming I was soon to be so implicated
Now I'm through with all the lies and pictures are back-dated
Almost lost my friendly feet
Cos boy I'm operating

(Uh uh uh uh uh uh...)

(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Promises you made are comin' back to haunt you
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
I was in the wrong
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye

(Promises you made...)
Promises you made are
(Comin' back to haunt you...)
Comin' back to haunt you
(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(I was in the wrong...)
I was in the wrong
(But it doesn't really matter...)
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear (Learn to say goodbye...)
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(Promises you made...)
Promises you made are
(Comin' back to haunt you...)
Comin' back to haunt you
(Yey-ee yey-ee...)
Don't whisper in my ear
You gotta learn to say goodbye
(I was in the wrong...)
I was in the wrong
(But it doesn't really matter...)
But it doesn't really matter
Don't whisper in my ear (Learn to say goodbye...)
You gotta learn to say goodbye

You gotta learn to say goodbye
