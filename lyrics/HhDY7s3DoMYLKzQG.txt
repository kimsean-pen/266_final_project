When you're lost
Waiting for months and
Waiting for nothing as you crawl from the sun
I'm with you, I'm ready
I'm with you, you'll be all right

Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
I'm with you somehow tonight

Spent too long living forevers
Waiting for lovers
And coming undone
I'm with you, you'll be all right
You're with me into the light

Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
I'm with you somehow tonight

Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
I'm with you somehow tonight

Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
Dream, dream, dream big in the sky
I'm with you somehow tonight.
