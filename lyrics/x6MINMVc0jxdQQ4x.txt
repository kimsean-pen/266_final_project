packing her bags, they left the sailor girl
when she returned to find that she could love no one
meeting her way through cheap bar and cafe
expecting to see the same sour faces there, why not

oh yes, they'll do
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out and it might be true
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out, I'll be nice
school's out for me, school's out for you
swallow all our bad advice
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out

packing his bags, they loved the Tesco boy
when he returned to find that he could love no one
he stayed away through salons and musics
there's still a ground in her up (?) to the years, why not

oh yes, they'll do
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out and it might be true
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out, I'll be nice
school's out for me, school's out for you
listen to our bad advice

school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out, please behave
school's out for me, school's out for you
you don't want a english name
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out, I'll be nice
school's out for me, school's out for you
swallow all our bad advice
school's out for me, school's out for you
school's out
