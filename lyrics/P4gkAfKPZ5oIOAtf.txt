Doubt, doubt, doubt
It kills everything that you love
Ooh, now, now, now
I'm losing myself on the run

And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah, I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear

How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

Paint-chipped skies
Nothing is ever as it seems
Behind these codeine eyes
Blind to the world in between

And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah, I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear

How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway

But I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
