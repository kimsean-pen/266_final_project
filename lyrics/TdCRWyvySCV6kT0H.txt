I can only hurt your case
It's written on your face
You always come to me
I won't be used, but
I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up the door, oh

No
I won't
I can't
Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fuckin' die
Why?
Do I always have to suffer the consequences?

Stay Away from who I am
'Cause I know what you are
I can't believe you're here
Then again, you know that

I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul, oh

No
I won't
I can't
Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fuckin' die
Why?
Do I always have to suffer the consequences?

Stop I know your goddamn game
It's always been the same
The story hasn't changed
Neither will you, but

I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul

No
I won't
I can't
Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fuckin' die
Why?
Do I always have to suffer the consequences?

No
I won't
I can't
Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fuckin' die
Why?
Do I always have to suffer the consequences?
No
I won't
I can't
Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fuckin' die
Why?
Do I always have to suffer the consequences?
