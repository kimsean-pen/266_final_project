A time to live
A place to go
Oh, my army of lovers...

Be be ay, be be ay
Around the world, around the world
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay

A time to go, a time to live
A place to be, a love to give
When travelling around the world
My army of lovers

Disney world to Yellowknife
America my way of life
Riding on a wave of love
My army of lovers

A cherry moon a night of fun
We dance into the rising sun
I lost my soul in Tokyo
My army of lovers

Around the world, around the world
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay

Saint-Tropez to la Défense
A perfumed Latin lover's scent
A pleasure sweet my body heat
My army of lovers

My gentlemen polite and proud
From London town I wave goodbye
The scorpio is rising high
My army of lovers

Around the world, around the world
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay

Pour l'univers on quitte la Terre
Heureux joyeux
L'amour de Dieu n'a pas de frontière
Pour l'armée qui voyage sous la lumière

In crystal snow my palace guard
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
Come shoot me with your laser beam
My army of lovers

Taj-Mahal I've come to rest
A royal bed a lovers nest
Classic art we here explore
My army of lovers

Around the world, around the world
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay

Around the world
My army of lovers
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay
Around the world
My army of lovers
Around the world
be be ay, be be ay
Around the world...
