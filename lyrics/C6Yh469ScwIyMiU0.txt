New life
First breath
Clean water
Stressless
Bright lights
Notice
So you oughtta
Get dressed

Just so you know your bliss
Move on, forget the rest
Put away your cloud
It's a brand new day

It's time to clean your air
Get out up and instead
Let the sunshine in
Don't waste your day

Today is the day you find your love is in you
And it's been right there the whole time
Today is the day you realize you can do
Whatever is on your mind

New life, first breath
Clean water, stressless
Bright light, notice
So you oughtta get dressed

Feel right, just soulless
Check your order manifest
In sight, no regrets
Love your life, regardless

Know that you are blessed
Move on, forget the rest
Put away your clouds
It's a brand new day

It's time to clean your air
Get out up and instead
Let the sunshine in
Don't waste your day

Today is the day you find your love is in you
And it's been right there the whole time
Today is the day you realize you can do, hmm
Whatever is on your mind

Today is the day you find your love is in you, ooh
And it's been right there the whole time
Today is the day you realize you can do, ooh
Whatever is on your mind

Now let's get carried away with the love you make
Hold up your head, be strong
Get out of your bed, do what you said
You can get through the storm

Now let's get carried away with the love you make
Hold up your head, be strong, be strong
Now lets carried away with the love you make
Hold up your head, be strong
Get out of your bed, do what you said
You can get through the storm

Carried away

Hold up your head

Be strong, be strong
La da da da da da
