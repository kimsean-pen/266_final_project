You are infatuated, with what consumes you.
Put the victim on the front lines and left for dead.
Stop acting like there's no, no other option.
But to let the waves, carry you away.
Can you hold the water, responsible, for your wayward, behavior?
Anymore then it blames you, for its gripping, currents.
Erase the proof, erase the proof.
But, your shame will remain.
Your shame will remain.
Will remain!
Your shame will remain.
Your shame will remain.
Your mind is the mountain before you.

Will you (always need) someone to hold your hand,
And talk (talk you through) you through the night's shadows.
It's so much easier, to fight this war, when you're the last in line,
When you're the last in line!

Can you hold the water?
Can you hold the water, responsible, for your wayward behavior?
Anymore then it blames you, for its, gripping currents?
(What will come of you), what will become of you?
(What will you become), what will become of you?

Your mind is the mountain before you.

You've reached the summit now transcend the skies.
You've reached the summit now transcend the skies.
