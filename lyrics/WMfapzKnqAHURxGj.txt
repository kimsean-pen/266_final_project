On the walls of Tokyo
Down in London town's a go-go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'm dancing with myself

And when there's no one else in sight
In a crowded lonely night
Well, I waited so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
When there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
Well, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
When there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
Well, I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

Well, if I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, o, h dancing with myself
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

Oh, well, it's all wet
And I sweat, and I sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat

Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself

Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, dancing with myself
