and if you see
old nitrous man
selling laughter from a can
gotta tell'em that the dream still fits the plan
and that's why we're waiting at the table
yeah, he's welcome at the stand
and I won't mind
the moment you can say
that you saw in a dream
how you can let me know anyway
you've seen the day
no more to pay
trouble came and drove
but we drove it away
we get
we get mad but no words to say
we get mad waiting
always waiting to get paid
Darling, we get mad giving too much away
and baby I won't lie
I didn't want to say
untill I heard in a dream
how I can let you know anyway
and I've seen the day
no more to pay
where trouble came and drove
but trouble drove away
Oh, I can see you get mad with no words to say
you see me waiting
always waiting to get paid
and darling we get mad giving too much away
mhmhmm
oh, we get mad giving too much away
we get mad with the load
and the leverage of each day
but surely there's time for you and me
open your mind
surely there's plain to see
you're not alone
surely there's time for you and me
open your mind
surely there's plain to see
you're not alone
I'll wait 'till the end of time for you
open your mind
surely there's plain to see
and baby I won't lie
I didn't want to say
untill I heard in a dream
how I can let you know anyway
I've seen the day
no more to pay
where trouble came and drove
but trouble drove away
we get mad giving too much
we get mad giving too much
we get mad with the load
and the leverage of each day
so if you see,
old nitrous man
selling laughter from a can
tell'em that the dream still fits the plan
