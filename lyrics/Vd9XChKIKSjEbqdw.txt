Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Felt like I was having one of them days
When nothing goes right, so I drift away
Stuck with my back up against the wall
Didn't know it was you I was waiting for
Close to tears I was stressing out
With you I forgot what I worry about
Took your time but at least you here
And all the drama's disappear
Oh, you saved my life you saved my life

It started out as the worst day

But now you got me feeling like its my birthday

You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Don't need to party or bicardi and coke or cake
I get exited when I know that I'll see your face

We can stay home cause its just as fun

An invitation you can be my plus one
Now I know there's nothing that I can't do
I'm pretty sure that its something to do with you
Took your time but at least you here
And all the drama's disappear
Oh, you saved my life you saved my life
It started out as the worst day
But now you got me feeling like its my birthday

You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)

You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)

Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You pick me up when I'm down and you turn it all around
I just cant get enough
My feet don't touch the ground
I just cant get enough

When you holding me tight it'll all be alright

Its like it's my fing birthday
It started out as the worst day
But now you got me feeling like its my birthday
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
Caught in rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh(it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh(it's my birthday)
Instumental
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh(it's my birthday) Caught in the rain with no lifeline
Till you came along and brought a piece of sunshine
You got me singing like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
You got me like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (it's my birthday)
