Steps ascend to a loaded gun
the scent of mathces hangs in the air
a lit on flickers out in a heart beat
we don't want to see this:
a flash of light that's letting go of an empty bullet case
by the time it hits the ground he's out of reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
(out of reach)
the wolves are closing in
there's no room left to make amends
do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
all the time we've wasted
(wasted)
spent fighting
(fighting)
it's blood full of our regret
all the time we've wasted
(wasted)
spent fighting
(fighting)
it's blood and it's running down the stairs
freeze the frame
to the gun shot and the hole it makes
(a spinning bullet waits in the middle
there's no way to stop it
it will surely hit the mark)
you can try to understand but i'm giving up
giving up
giving up
they synapse fires, it's right on time, but i'm giving up
giving up
(giving up)
giving up
giving up
giving up
this should always stay out of reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go, let go)
out reach
(let go let go)
the wolves are closing in
there's no room left to make amends
do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
all the time we've wasted
(wasted)
spent fighting
(fighting)
it's blood full of our regret
all the time we've wasted
(wasted)
spent fighting
(fighting)
it's blood and it's running down the stairs
i ran down the stairs and into the garden
put both my hands into the soil
in the spring you will bloom
like her heart through the blouse in the back of teh ambulance
as it turned and turned in the streets
(out of reach, out of reach)
just one more turn, won't you come back to me?
(out of reach, out of reach)
as it turned on its red lights
(out of reach, out of reach)
you were turning into red roses
red roses
red roses
red roses
but i'm not giving up
