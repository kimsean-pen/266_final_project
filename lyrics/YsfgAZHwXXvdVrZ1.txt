(Anneke van Giersbergen:)
No need... No need to feel the pain
No need to feel betrayed
No need to feel inane
No need to feel afraid

(Jørn Lande:)
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die

(Anneke van Giersbergen:) No need to feel desire
(Jørn Lande:) But I need you with me
(Anneke van Giersbergen:) No need to feel so small
(Jørn Lande:) But I need to feel secure
(Anneke van Giersbergen:) No need to feel the fire
(Jørn Lande:) But I need to feel free
(Anneke van Giersbergen:) No need to feel at all
(Jørn Lande:) But I need to know for sure

(Jørn Lande:)
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die
