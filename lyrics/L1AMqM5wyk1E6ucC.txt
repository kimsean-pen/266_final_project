Finally i see your plan and now i've come to understand
you should have told me all the lies were true
But that was all so long ago, maybe bout a week or so
if the one you're holding only knew

fall back start over
and all the negativity subside
bad night, hung over
and everything you said hanging on me

i can't replace the thought of you
sitting there just like you do
and now you're sitting close with someone else
i figured out sometime ago,
regardless of the things i know
i'm over it as far as i can tell

fall back start over
let all the negativity subside
bad night, hung over
and everything you said hanging on me

had your chance, your time has passed
this time i'm not so blinded
