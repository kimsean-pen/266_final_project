I'm not the girl I was
I know you think i'm dumb
Your hair looks good undone
Your clothes look good messed up

You said you liked her dress
You can't hear what I said
When I said

I will figure it out
One day you'll go and I'll know
You'll go and I'll know

I like falling asleep, with you next to me
I can't look at you when you seem confused
Think of this as a painting of blue
Think of me as a painting of blue

I'm just a painting of blue
I'm just a painting to you
You're gonna paint me through
