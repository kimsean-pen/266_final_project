... he looked upon the world
and saw that it was still depraved

as him
though not like him
for him, as all

but closed
like them
not him

unaware
he was
already caught within
their cycle
with them
outside
depraved

instinctive
rebellion
possessed
by bestial despair
he fought
this law
and broke
the spell

"So, this is why I built my empire
fled from the truths unto which they conspire"

in spirit born a stranger
a counterpart in mind
the seeker raised to bury
a freak among the blind

encountered with mysteries
on his mission to reverse their ways
he sought a life among the dead
with refuge in an endless maze

...before the silence...

"This can not be the purpose of my presence.
What then is the call of my return?"
