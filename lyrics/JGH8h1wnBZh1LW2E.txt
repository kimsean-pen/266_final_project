Stuck in the middle with you
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
We can solve any riddle we choose
But we choose to stay away from the games
We move to the suburbs where grass grows
Away from the stubborn city arseholes
Out to a world no one else knows
Out to the meadows, out to the sea
I don't really care what we do
But let's head to the wild, me and you
No stress, all bless, no blues
Let's take in the view

I said think about your heart, forget about your head
'Cause if the rapture starts tomorrow, we'll be dead
And if the world burns, I wanna burn with it
I wanna go with you exactly how we living
But until that day I wanna love the minute
The hours, the seconds and live without limits
Love every day no matter what it takes
Store everything in you until my heart breaks
If we get into a sticky situation, I wanna run away, I don't wanna be patient
No matter what the adversity we're facing
Time and space is the only thing we're racing

Maybe we could find a haven, get lost, go ape, it would be so amazing
We can do what we wanted to do
Kick up a fuss and never trust what we knew
Trying new things, new life, no strings
Even if our fights get raw, we'll brush it away, no strife, what for?
Kick off the door and leave, I want more
More, more
