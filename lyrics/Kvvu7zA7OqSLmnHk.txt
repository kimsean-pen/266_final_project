There are things that I regret
Like being called a nervous wreck
And working up another sweat for you
There's nothing that I can do
For counterparts and bleeding hearts
And all the things that fall apart for you
I don't keep my secrets there
I hide them everywhere
I could deny
But I'll never realise
I'm just chasing rainbows
All the time

I could deny
But I'll never realise
I've been chasing rainbows
All my life

And then I missed my cue
Everybody had a laugh
And then went for an early bath
Did you
I don't keep my secrets there
I hide them everywhere
