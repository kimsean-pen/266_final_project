Fear is never gone from your soul
That saw humiliation
Being prey to the blackest of demons
Paralyzed, you fail

Fallen beneath
The mark of dignity
You fail

(A) demon passed on
From one to the next
Infiltrates a mind innocent and pure
Planting the seed to possess
Another soul that is doomed to fail

Only ash remains

(A) demon passed on
From one to the next
Infiltrates a mind innocent and pure
Being prey to the blackest of demons
Paralyzed, they fail

Fallen beneath
The mark of dignity
They fail

Only ash remains
