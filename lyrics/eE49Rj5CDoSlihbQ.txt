We had that first love, heartbreak, romance way back
When our hearts ruled, we knew it all
Forever's now in the past

I remember just you and me
When each other was all we needed
I remember what could have been
We were just too young to see

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love
There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love
You used to love

Questions with answers
Who knows if we missed our chance
Our chances, our chances
If we had waited
Wouldn't change our circumstance
In the right place, at the right time, wouldn't be right

I remember just you and me
When each other was all we needed
I remember what could have been
We were just too young to see

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love

There was something about the way
There was something about the way
You used to love

All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all
All the reasons why we said it's over
Doesn't seem to matter after all
