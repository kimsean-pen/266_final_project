I ve been starting over for a long time
I m not ready for another day
I feel, I feel renewed
Time is right, I m only getting older
I m not ready for the second wave
The way you ve seen it through
Don t be bolder, golden life of mine
Sing for love, full force in my life
I m not ready for the way you dance
Tie the money hold on for a long time
There s an answer for another man
I m yet to find the way
Wasting years or waiting for a savior

Don t take it day by day
Don t be bolder, golden life of mine
Sing for love, full force in my life
I m not ready for the boulder
I m not ready for the dry cut jeans
I m not ready for the sirens
I m not ready for the fear and shame
I m not ready for the waking
Take me from myself
From myself
Holding on to something I don t know
I ve been starting over for a long time
I m not ready for the second wave
The way you ve seen me cry.
