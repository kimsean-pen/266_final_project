I know you've been hiding lately
But you were doing so well
You've been acting a little shady
Did you think I couldn't tell?
I see past your baby blues
Everyone's at it, check the news
Man, are you dumb or just confused
To do these things you do?

Lying to yourself
Lying to yourself
You keep lying, lying to yourself
But don't lie to me

Maybe in a different time, we'd be friends
Learn to cut the ties and mend
But when all your promises are pretend
Makes it hard to love again

Lying to yourself
Lying to yourself
You keep lying, lying to yourself
But don't lie to me

'Cause when you talk, you don't look me in the eye
When you walk, you ain't walking by my side
When you speak, you're not speaking to me
Just somebody else, who you try'na please?
'Cause when you talk, you don't look me in the eye
When you walk, you ain't walking by my side
And I know what you're doing, I ain't stupid
Who you fooling when you keep on...

Lying to yourself
Lying to yourself
You keep lying, lying to yourself
Well don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
You keep lying, lying to yourself
But don't lie to me
