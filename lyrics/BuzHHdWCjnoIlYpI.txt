I'm going to tell you straight
Between the struggle and the heartache
There's a bitter taste, the bitter taste of a better place

We burn, we bleed, we won't give up on our dreams
This suffering means more to me
We burn, we bleed, we won't give up on our dreams
I... I will put my strength in numbers
Strength in numbers

I'm going to tell you straight
Between the struggle and the heartache
There's a bitter taste, the bitter taste of a better place

Convincing ourselves we can see through the pain
But still I find hate; it heals me
We convinced our loved ones they were never to blame
For the promise we made
We can sleep in our own grave, we're alive in our own way
For every time I live my life in regret
I find my pride in having nothing left

We're all better off respecting those in the cemetery
If you're one of us; turn your fist to the monarchy
I will put my strength in numbers; this is the six
Ah... This is the six
We'll put our strength in numbers; this is the six
Ah... This is the six

I'm holding out for what I believe (for what I believe)
Have we given up or just gave it away?(just gave it away?)
I will take forever to love the part of this I hate (this I hate)
I will get the best of us, to make the better me

Convincing ourselves we can see through the pain
But still I find hate; it heals me
We convinced our loved ones they were never to blame
For the promise we made

We can sleep in our own grave, we're alive in our own way
For every time I live my life in regret
I find my pride in having nothing...

We can sleep in our own grave, we're alive in our own way
For every time I live my life in regret
I find my pride in having nothing left
