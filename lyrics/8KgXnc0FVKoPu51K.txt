I'm gonna swing tonight, have the time of my life
Get fucked up, start a fight (come on)
Lets go out, leave all doubt, drink until morning light
Just get high like a satellite (come on)

Whatever I run to, it's just cause I want to
Wherever I will go I'll steal the show

Tonight I'm riding a phoenix, I'll be my remix, fuck it yolo (come on)
This is me with no limits out on a bad trip, I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, yolo)

Bottle up, never stop, I'm burning bridges tonight
And it feels so damn right (come on)
Steal a car on the throne, I just need to get stoned
I will rise, I will shine (come on)

Whatever I run to, it's just cause I want to
This night may be my last, lets die young and fast

Tonight I'm riding a phoenix, I'll be my remix, fuck it yolo (come on)
This is me with no limits out on a bad trip, I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, yolo)

I'm living up my wildest dreams, I go like a machine
Fire made gasoline, I'm careless, I'm free, this is me
I'm living up my wildest dreams, I go like a machine
Fire made gasoline, I'm careless, I'm free, this is me

I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
Tonight I'm riding a phoenix, I'll be my remix, fuck it yolo (come on)
This is me with no limits out on a bad trip, I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, yolo)

I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
(Come on now fuck it yolo, come on)
I just want to get burned tonight
