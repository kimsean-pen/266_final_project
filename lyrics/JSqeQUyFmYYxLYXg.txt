Portray sincerity act out of loyalty
Defend your free country wish away pain
Hand out lobotomies to save little familys
Surrealistic fantasy bland boring plain

Holy now in restitution
Livin' out our date with fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard
Don't feel guilty master writing
Somebody says that their not much like I am I know I can
Make enough up the words you go along I sing then some

Sickening pesimist hypocrite master
conservative communist apocalyptic Bastard
Thank you Dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very priveleged in debt for my thirst
Two and three
