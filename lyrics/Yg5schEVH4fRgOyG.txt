Yo, heres another song for the kids to sing to
The same four chords, its another hit single
The radio station plays the same three tracks
Thats nine whole minutes that well never get back

So get up, get out
Come on, come on
We don't wanna hear the same old song
So delete your playlist, if it aint the greatest
Start something contageous

La la la la la la la
I guess we're desperate
Na na na na na na na
For a radio hit

Paparazzi, please snapshot me
'Cause I'm just a bad boy, made for the tabloids
I need my big break before its too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless
Just wanna be famous

Now we're steady making progress and its hard to stop it
We got our tee shirts in the mall's Hot Topic
Warped Tour famous and the band's devotion
Walking toward's like we're in slow motion

So get up, get out
Come on, come on
We finally got what we fucking want
So delete your playlist, if it aint the greatest
Start something contageous

La la la la la la la
I guess we're desperate
Na na na na na na na
For a radio hit

Paparazzi, please snapshot me
'Cause I'm just a bad boy, made for the tabloids
I need my big break before its too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless
Just wanna be famous

The future sucks as we know
We watch reality shows
We never leave our homes
We're glued to our phones
The future's making me sick
We post the same damn pics
What the fuck's a selfie stick?
We're always talking shit
Hahahaha
Fuck you!

I wish the best for you
I want to be famous

I wish the best for you
I want to be famous

I wish the best for you
I want to be famous

Paparazzi, please snapshot me
'Cause I'm just a bad boy, made for the tabloids
I need my big break before its too late
'Cause I'm a little bit shameless
Just wanna be famous

La la la la la la la

Thank you, thank you very much
