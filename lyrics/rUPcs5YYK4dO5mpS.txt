Oh my god, I fear I can't be saved
These idle hands have slowly dug my grave
Every day is the same
Feels like I'm disintegrating
Back into the dust from which I came

So I got in my car and I drove and I drove
All night 'til I couldn't stay awake
Went through Louisiana
As far as I went wouldn't ever be quite far enough away

And I never wanna feel like I'm dying
'Cause the time that you waste won't come back
So I took a part of me that I hated
And I tried to leave it in the past

You wake up, nothing again
Old and broken and tired
Go to sleep all alone
Wake up all alone
If I said that I cared I'd be lying

You wake up, nothing again
Old and broken and tired
Go to sleep all alone
Wake up all alone
If I said that I cared I'd be lying

You wake up
You're nothing
You're tired
You're struggling

I just wanna try to be a better man before I fall apart

You wake up
You're nothing
You're tired
You're struggling

Trouble always finds me even when I'm hidden way down in the dust

You wake up
You're nothing
You're tired
You're struggling

They say that we came from dust and to dust we will all return

You wake up
You're nothing
You're tired
You're struggling

My days are numbered fewer than the lessons that I've never learned
I'm waiting on all of my demons
To come and take me home
