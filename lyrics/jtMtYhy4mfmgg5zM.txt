A lonely red balloon
Tied down to his worries
Dreams of taking flight
Slowly moving out of sight

To a sky curious blue
Infinite, inviting
A prisoner of self doubt
He whispers to himself:

"Why can't I cut the ribbon tied
around my neck?
Then maybe I could finally breathe
Then maybe I could finally see
The bigger picture staring back at me"

Monday's my weekend
Tuesday's alright
Hey! Hey! I'm ready!
It's go time! Go time!
Green is my color
Sunshine's my sky
Hey! Hey! It's go time!
It's go time! Go time!
Hey! Hey! I'm ready!
It's go time! Go time!

A storm goes to the sea
Towards the lonely red balloon
Ratter tattered ribbon
Lost it's grip and off he flew

Towards the sky of lightning
He thundered through and through
Fireworks like Independence Day
Woo de doo

Up so high without the noose
That used to choke my neck
Now that I can finally breathe
Now that I can finally see
The bigger picture staring me at back

Monday's my weekend
Tuesday's alright
Hey! Hey! I'm ready!
It's go time! Go time!
Green is my color
Sunshine's my sky
Hey! hey! It's go time!
It's go time! Go time!
Hey! hey! I'm ready!
It's go time!

Go above the atmosphere
There's no separation here
To vision it's illusion
It's all one big balloon
A round goodbye!

Monday's my weekend
Tuesday's alright
Hey! Hey! I'm ready!
It's go time! Go time!
Green is my color
Sunshine's my sky
Hey! hey! It's go time!
It's go time! Go time!
Hey! hey! I'm ready!
It's go time! Go time!

The bigger picture
Everything is staring back at me
The bigger picture
Everything is
Everything is
The bigger picture
Everything is staring back at me
The bigger picture
Everything is
Everything is
Everything is
Everything
