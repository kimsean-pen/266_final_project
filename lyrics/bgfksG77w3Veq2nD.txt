Vital sign a soul to feed
Hesitation in your reach
Left in the grey
You've been too afraid to say
It goes away

All the places you could land
Behind the line drawn in the sand
It never shows
All the bastards that you know
It goes away

The space between you'll never see
A crooked line from a to z
Left in the grey
All the reason you betray
It goes away
