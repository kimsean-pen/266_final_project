No one on earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an Angel
Playing with my heart
I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of Angels
And they're playing with my heart
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
No one on earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an Angel
Playing with my heart
And when I think that I'm alone
It seems there's more of us at home
It's a multitude of Angels
And they're playing with my heart
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
I must be hallucinating
Watching Angels celebrating
Could this be activating
All my senses dislocating?
This must be a strange deception
By celestial intervention
Leaving me the recollection
Of your Heavenly connection
I walk into an empty room
Suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of angels
They're playing with my heart
