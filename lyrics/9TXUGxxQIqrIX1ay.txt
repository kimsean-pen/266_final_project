Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing
Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing

Hands up in the suburbs if you want to be alone
Need seconds to check it out
But your temperamental feelings
Can often leave you feeling like
You need a dancing song

Shout

Wah-woh
Wah-woh
You're socially outrageous with your lack of self control
So take your 37 digits and put them in her mobile phone,
With all your quintessential skint potential leaking from your pores
Let your tiptoes tell your finger that this is a DANCING SONG

Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing
Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing
Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing
Wah-woh wah-woh wah-woh this one's for dancing...

This one's for dancing
