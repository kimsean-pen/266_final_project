Don't know anything about you
So close, just a touch away
Your love hits me like no other

They say I'm a true believer
I know something's taking over no
I wanna run but I don't know how
You just crossed my border now
Just a kiss away

Gimme a break, I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late
Gotta know what's on your mind

I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all

You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your light
(Dangerous)

Don't you push to the limit
'Cause you know I'm hungry for your touch
No doubt, I wanna be your lover
(Wanna be your lover)
They say just a pretender
I know something's taking over no
I wanna run but I don't know how
You've just crossed my border now
We're standing face to face
Gimme a break, I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late
Gotta know what's on your mind
I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your light
(Dangerous)
I'm out of control
'Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your light
(Dangerous)
