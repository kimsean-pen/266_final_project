I'm still stuck here
I'm still tethered to your soul.
I still feel it
Like I never had control
Of myself
Like I never had control
Of anything
How long will I yearn
For the warmth of your center
While I spin in your perimeter?
And I get lost
And I get lost
And I get lost

Every time you see her
Now you drift off (drift off)
You drift (you drift off)
You drift off
All at once you're overcome.
You get lost (You get lost)
You get (You get lost)
You get lost
In an endless spin you're
Only looking for her
At once you're overcome.
You get lost (You get lost)
You get lost (You get lost)
You get

I get lost when you
Look my way
It's genuine
I can tell when your lips turn
Up like some strange flower
Reaching for the sun
Do your eyes close just enough,
Just enough
Cause I'm the only one
You'll let inside? Inside

Every time you see her
Now you drift off (drift off)
You drift (you drift off)
You drift off
All at once you're overcome.
You get lost (You get lost)
You get (You get lost)
You get lost
In an endless spin you're
Only looking for her
At once you're overcome.
You get (You get lost)
You get (You get lost)
You get lost

Call me crazy.
Some nights I think it's true
Call me desperate.
At times I am for you
Call me fuck up.
At least I pull myself up
At least I pull myself up

Call me crazy.
Some nights I think it's true
Call me desperate.
At times I am for you
Call me a fuck up.
At least I pull myself up
At least I pull myself up
At least I pull myself
At least I pull myself up
