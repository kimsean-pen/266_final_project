Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece on holiday

Love in the 90's
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances looking for

Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls but they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work
Because there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fingers

Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schon
But we haven't been introduced

Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Looking for
Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Girls who want boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
