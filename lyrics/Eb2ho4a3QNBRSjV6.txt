I stayed in the shower
To avoid doing some useful shit
My fingers went wrinkly
And my hair had had enough of it

Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

I slept in this morning
'Cause your bed is so much better than mine
You had left for uni
So I changed my phone's alarm time

Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

You're on my mind
And you're all mine
You're the best night's sleep I've ever had

I think you'll find
If we rewind
That trouble never finds
A place to land

Every day with
You's my lucky day...

We went to the movies
Because I know you like Wes Anderson
You held my hand the whole time
And, no joke, you have the softest skin

Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

You're on my mind
And you're all mine
You're the best night's sleep I've ever had

I think you'll find
If we rewind
That trouble never finds
A place to land

Every day with
You's my lucky day...

Take it day by day
You could be the one to drive me home
Sitting in your car
We're telling stories in a no-standing zone

Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh...

You're on my mind
And you're all mine
You're the best night's sleep
I've ever had

I think you'll find
If we rewind
That trouble never finds
A place to land

Every day with
You's my lucky day...
