Darkness was my light
Muteness was my tongue
Death was my life
Matter was my spirit

I am a brother to the fire
To fire a brother I am
From breasts of maidens three
I drank the black milk
Devoured the white milk
I swallowed the red milk

Brother to the fire I am
Brother to the fire

I've lain in the dark bowels
Bowels of this marshland
Dead beneath the soil
Under the waters
Oblivious to all
Devoid of all knowing
