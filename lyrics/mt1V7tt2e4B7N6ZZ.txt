It was down in Chinatown that I met the opium Queen
babyface girl from Shanghai never smile and never cry.

She now rules the underworld down in Chinatown
she runs all the opium den down in Chinatown.

Bring her your gold bring her your worries
and when life gets a bit too dreary to stand

give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown.

Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
she'll pick you up when you're feeling down.
Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
and she'll soon blow your blues away.

It was down in Chinatown
when I met the opium Queen
babyface girl from Shanghai never smiled and never cried.

When love isn't what it sounds go to Chinatown
when your frineds have let you down got to Chinatown.

When life is pain
when love is sorrow
and it gets more than you can possibly stand
give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown.

Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
she'll pick you up when you're feeling down.
Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
and she will blow your blues away.

It was down in Chinatown
when I met the opium Queen
babyface girl from Shanghai never smiled and never cried.

Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown...

When your life gets a bit dreary
when you're down
when you're feeling low
give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown.

She'll help you out
she'll pick you up
she'll sniff your blues away.

Go down
go down to the Queen of China town...
go down...
