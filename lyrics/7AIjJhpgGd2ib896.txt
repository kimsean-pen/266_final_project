I was just a poor young little ugly thing
Momma kicked me out, just shy of 17
I was lookin' for love, in the fire, in the flames
But the only way to love, is to get yourself burned
That's how I became the runaway

I gave my hand to a man, he put the ring on me
He couldn't understand why he wasn't just like me
I should've known by the look in his eyes
We looked at the same guys
That's when I realized

No hands will hold me
I'll always be lonely
Is there someone out there who can break
This habit of going
There's no way of knowing
I promise I'll always be a little runaway
Your little runaway

If you're not careful, you'll get your heart broken
Take me as an example, I'll be a token
I used to fall head over feet
But everyone I loved deceived me
So, what choice does that leave?
A runaway

You could say my shadow is the only friend of mine
But it gets pretty lonely in the nighttime
My shadow is almost as hard to see, oh
Almost as hard as it is to love me
A runaway

No hands will hold me
I'll always be lonely
Is there someone out there who can break
This habit of going
There's no way of knowing
I promise I'll always be a little runaway
I'll be a runaway
