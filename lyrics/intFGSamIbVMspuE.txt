We boys don't act deaf
Just play your part like an actress
This on repeat a rewind won't mean remember
take it now like a math test
Ya don't understand English
so don't act fresh
Man better hear me out like my CD
by the way it's a madness
You don't wanna get accompanied
but I guess I'll hold these shoes
so dumb till there ain't no loafers
as you can't add to the job
Numb is my hand to the lotus
or get used to the roters
I get rolled outside like
Zeus on posters
or pay me a chase of soldiers

Man a bad man
Bad man no care
Bad man from here to here
We tell ya man a bad man
Bad man no care
Bad man from here to here
We tell ya man a bad man
bad man
man
Real bad man we will kill all ya swag
