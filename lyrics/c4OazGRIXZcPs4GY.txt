Don't wanna ride on the carousel
Don't wanna be part of your cartel
So whatever you've got to sell
Be sure I won't be payin'
And I don't care about the president
It doesn't mean that I'm ignorant
I just think that it's dissonant
Everything they're sayin'

It goes round and round, but it's not for me
If it brings me down, I'll let it be

Life is strange, got the time to lose
Ain't got the time for the tragic news
'Cause all it does is givin' me the bruise
Don't want it in my system
'Cause I'm lookin' for a brighter day
And I'm strong, gotta find a way
I don't care what the people say
I'm much too old to listen

Goes round and round, but it's not for me
If it brings me down, I let it be

I let it be
I let it be
I let it be

Yeah, I gotta do what I gotta do
And I presume you gotta do so too
I'm really sorry, I can't wait for you
Didn't mean to burst your bubble
I stay away from negativity
You know I push for positivity
You know it's good for creativity
To stay away from trouble

It goes round and round, but it's not for me
If it brings me down and it's killin' me
It's the same old song and it's lame to see
Can't stick around, so let it be

I let it be
I let it be
I let it be
Go!
