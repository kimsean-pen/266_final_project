Say, Mr.Angel, I'm lost
Would you guide my way, if you knew what it cost?
Folk sound running alive
Holding me at bay but I still feel cross

Say, Mr.Angel, I'm sad
Would you help me sail straight, don't wanna crash
And my thoughts are all getting bad
Holding me at bay, but I still feel last

Oh you know I love it, love it, tonight
Taking me for granted, granted, my line
Oh you know I need it, need it, tonight
Loving single-handed, handed for life

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ah

Say, Mr.Angel, I say Mr.Angel, I'm sad, I'm sad
Say, Mr. Angel, oh, say Mr. Angel oh say,
oh say, I'm sad
Say, Mr. Angel, say, Mr. Angel I'm lost
Yeah-eah-eah

Oh you know I love it, love it, tonight
Taking me for granted, granted, my line
Oh you know I need it, need it, tonight
Loving single-handed, handed for life

Oh you know I love it, love it, tonight
Taking me for granted, granted, my line
Oh you know I need it, need it, tonight
Loving single-handed, handed for life

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
