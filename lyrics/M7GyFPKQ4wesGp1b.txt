I've got the best to get you high
High as a vulture raiding the sky

I am the hit you need
Starving for attention, you will say anything

I see the users looking for their fixes
Willing to die to feed the addiction

Well, if I take the pain away, you'll come back for more someday

I'm here to sell, I'm not here to buy, here to buy
I'm here to sell, my little white lies
Just do it, do it, do it, one more line
Just do it, do it, do it, god for the weak
What else do you need?

I found a way to feed the rich and the poor
I feed 'em all and watch 'em die on the floor

Where is the truth you seek?
Starving for attention, you'll believe anything

Well, if I take the pain away, you'll come back for more someday

I'm here to sell, I'm not here to buy, here to buy
I'm here to sell, my little white lies (little white lies)

I'm here to sell, I'm not here to buy, here to buy
I'm here to sell, my little white lies
I'm here to sell, I'm not here to buy, here to buy
I'm here to sell, my little white lies
Just do it, do it, do it, one more line
Just do it, do it, do it, god for the weak
What else do you need?
