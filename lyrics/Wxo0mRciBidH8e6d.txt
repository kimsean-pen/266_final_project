come on girl!
let's sneak out of this party
it's getting boring
there's more to life than this!

it's still early morning
we could go down to the harbour
and jump between the boats
and see the sun come up

we could nick a boat
and sneak off to this island
i could bring my little ghettoblaster
there's more to life than this!

but then we'd have to rush back
to the town's best baker
to get the first bread of the morning
there's more to life than this!
