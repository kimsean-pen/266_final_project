Well you're drowning in your sucker life
You're afraid to die
Always trying to considerate
Other people's lives
Then you find yourself in darkness
You can see no more
Need to light a spark and carry on
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul...

You're afraid to die
Always trying to considerate
Other people's lives
Then you find yourself in darkness
You can see no more
Need to light a spark and carry on
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul
Reconnect your soul...

Kicking down the road won't mean a thing
Smash that on the floor
Don't try to make amends with your memories
Smash it, crash it, trash it

Kicking up the dust won't mean a thing
Smash that on the floor
Don't try to make amends with your memories
Smash it, crash it, trash it

You're about to get real high 'cause there's a giant inside
And you can hide but soon they'll see that you'll be touching the sky

Kicking down the road won't mean a thing
Smash that on the floor
Don't try to make amends with your memories
Smash it, crash it, trash it

Kicking up the dust won't mean a thing
Smash that on the floor
Don't try to make amends with your memories
Smash it, crash it, trash it
