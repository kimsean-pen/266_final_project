Get out tonight
From the deafening sound inside
That I'll deny
But it feels like I'm right
I'm feeling alright
Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
Decompose

Cut down to size
Paralyzed
Low tide
Wait to rise

Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
Decompose

You lye, you lye, you lye
Until you decompose
You decompose
You decompose
You decompose
Until you...

Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
Decompose
