One day, we'll meet trouble halfway
And we'll say; "Oh why'd you gotta be that way?"
Trouble look around you, everything is beautiful
Yeah, look around you. What'd you go and do that for?

One day, we'll meet trouble halfway
And she'll say; "Just a taste and I'll be on my way."
Oh you think I want to hang around here?
No I'll never again darken your door
Said; "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

'Cus baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing

Even without trying to, you got me on the upswing

One day, we'll meet trouble half way
And we'll take the window in a diner off the highway
Saying; "Trouble, let's this thing out."
On the table I'm squeezing your hand
And give me the steel to say; "Now this is how it's gonna be"

'Cus baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing

Even without trying to, you got me on the upswing

Yeah you got me on the upswing
Yeah you got me on the upswing
Yeah you got me on the upswing

Baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing

Baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing

Even without trying to, you got me on the upswing

Just when I thought I was through, you got me on the upswing

Baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing
Baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing
Baby one little push from you, got me on the upswing
