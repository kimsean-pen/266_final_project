We will bury the night
And the tremors come on
But as you would survive, just like nobody thought
Nails turn red, lying cold on the bed
And now it turns out, this is not the end

You on the phone, we shall be renonwned teeth
For magnificent drum, ... feet

Immaculate scum, he's here to stay

Alienation makes you weak, a dark ... ... the speech
The walls now ... ... ..., ... ... ... ... ...

Oh Henrietta,
We can live on forever
Oh Henrietta
We can live on forever
