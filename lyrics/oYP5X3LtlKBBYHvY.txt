Surround me with your wind and sand
Come closer and sing your songs
Show me your strength
I want to see the storm

Sit near I need to hear your breath
The one I know from birth
I love your sky
It changes from white to black

All over Baltic Sea

Speak to me i want to know the truth
How ships sail and who lives in your woods
Take me back to the start
I want to picture all this in my heart

Sit near I need to hear your breath
The one I know from birth
I love your sky
It changes from white to black
