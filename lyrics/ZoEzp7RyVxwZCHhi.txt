So when you're sixty or old and you're dizzy
They'll tell you who you are

'Cause you've got something that everybody wants,
I having trouble with my do's and my dont's
All my secrets why does everybody know, know, know
Well you've got something, you've got something

I'll be taking the hearts that you're breaking and putting them in a jar,

I having trouble with my do's and my dont's,
All my secrets why does everybody know, know, know
Well you've got something, you've got something

So when you're sixty or old and you're dizzy
