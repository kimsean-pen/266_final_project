The way... with me...
The way... with me...

I gotta get to you... how far...
I gotta get to you... you are...
I gotta get to you...

It's not like me to fall at first sight
I'm only telling the truth.
It took a little while to realise
I was falling for you!

Cause all I see is your face
You really blow me away
With all that you do
And if I see u again,
I'll take u into my hands
I'm calling out say:

Take my heart, I'll let u lead the way
Stars are lost without u here with me
I gotta get to you...

No matter how far...
Wherever you are...

I wake up to the break of sunlight
You're all in my head
It's like u put a hole in my mind
But we haven't met

Now all I see is your face
You really blow me away
I got to have you
And if I see u again,
I'll take u into my hands
I'm calling out say...

Take my heart, I'll let u lead the way

Stars are lost without u here with me
I gotta get to you...

No matter how far...
Wherever you are...

Take me now, now I'm waiting
Look at me anticipating
Look at me I'm falling for you...

Now or never, forever,
Take you to another level,
I wanna be with you
Now or never, forever,
Take you to another level
Come on, I'm waiting for you!

Take my heart, I'll let u lead the way
Stars are lost without u here with me
I gotta get to you...

No matter how far...
Wherever you are...

Take my heart, I'll let u lead the way
Stars are lost without u here with me
I gotta get to you...

No matter how far...
Wherever you are...
I gotta get to you!
