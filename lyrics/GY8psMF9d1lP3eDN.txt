Synthetic systems, merging hybrids
New technologies
Rhythms of violence, cutting through
Your core like a disease
Inserting implants, neural stimulants
Deep in your mind
Synapses burning
As we're living by the bassline

Harsh generation, we'll tear
Your world apart
Sign of the times, this is
The coming of a new kind
Harsh generation, we'll tear
Your world apart
This is the rise, this is
The coming of a new kind

The bodies working to that driving
Beat those driving thoughts
The hearts are fueled by rage
Without defeat, without conform
Drums pounding forth in heat
To scorch your skin, to rip your mind
There is no rest
As we're living by the bassline
