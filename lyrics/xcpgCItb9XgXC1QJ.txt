my body stopped moving, it quickly got cold.
i made my escape thru exhaling lungs and watched my body run away.

nobody noticed my misty escape.
and i ended up floating like water in the air.
to the blowy ocean side, above the pounding of waves.
thats where you showed up on the foggiest day.

from high above you, i saw your earth framed body wrapped in wool.
the glow surrounds you.
and when you breathed in... i felt the pull.
