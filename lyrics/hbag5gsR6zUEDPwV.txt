This is the voice of God
You've got it, you've got it
Stay in and lock your doors

I don't care what you've achieved
There's only one location if you don't follow me
(You always get what you wanted)
You're gonna burn in a blistering furnace
From now until forever, no matter how it ends
(You always get what you wanted)

Halt, freeze
Who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait
This ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit
You are a hoodwinker, sir

This is the voice of God
Shrink wrapper of minds
Stay in, lock your doors

Halt, freeze
Who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?

Halt, freeze
Who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait
This ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit
You are a hoodwinker, sir

I don't care if you're devout
To the three thousand
Other gods
I start to levitate
But it works

It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
(You always get what you wanted)
For your soul

It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
It's a swindle for your soul
(You always get what you wanted)
For your soul

Halt, freeze
Who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?

Stop, wait
This ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit
You are a hoodwinker, sir

You are a hoodwinker, sir
What do you take me for, a fool?
Cheeky fucker
