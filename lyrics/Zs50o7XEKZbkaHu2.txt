One, two

I can keep a secret from my mama
I can keep a secret from my pa
I keep myself out of trouble
Stay one step ahead of the law
And I can keep it from my neighbors
It ain't like they even care
But I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs

It's the patronage of strangers
That's keeping me from being broke
But when they hand over the paycheck to me
They have to wonder where it goes
Because I never seem to save it
I sure ain't wasting it on clothes, nor soap
It's a mystery to you but there's a guy at the store that knows

Because by eleven in the morning (eleven in the morning)
I'll find him selling smokes (find him selling smokes)
Laughing in another language (in another language)
But we all know a joke's a joke (a joke's a joke)
Then by seven in the evening (a joke's a joke)
I'm darkening the door (darkening the door)
Yes, darkening the door
Lord, it's so hard trying to keep a secret in that god damn store

He's there to see me buying cigarettes
He's there to see me buying beer
He's never seen me on the internet
And five o'clock is nowhere near
But every day can be the weekend
If you can walk a couple floors
Take that three story tour and make sure your talking money
When your rocking with the boss at the store
I'm rocking with the boss

I can't keep a secret (can't keep a secret)
From the guy at the store (guy at the store)
I can't keep a secret (can't keep a secret)
I couldn't lie anymore (lie anymore)
I can't keep a secret (can't keep a secret)
From the guy at the store (guy at the store)
Why try like before?

Because you can lie with your expression
Or lie with the things you say
But you can't lie with your dollars
Nah, babe, your dollars, they give you away
And the faces on the paper
The faces from the paper glare
That's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs

The money in the pocket
There's a fire burning there
That's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs

It's glaringly apparent
Why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs
So why should I attempt it
When I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs?
