Are you at move?
Or have you stopped?
Feels like a dream
In a piece of art

Everything builds
And then falls apart
Oh where to start?

Turning around
To see the light
Taking a cause
But oh what a fight

When lost in the woods
The forest of mind
Nowhere to hide

Well look at you now
When you've got yourself
Washed out in trouble
Yeah
You were trying so hard
But you doubted
Let's do this again

So we go on
We set about
To know who we are
To know what we're about
Equally dark
And equally light
Nothing to hide

Well look at you now
When you've got yourself
Washed out in trouble
Hey
You were trying so hard
But you doubted
Let's do this again

It's not really dying or stopping
We go in circles around
Until we know
What is this time
How we must be
Simplicity

Well look at you now
When you've got yourself
Washed out in trouble
But it isn't so bad
When you're learning
Let's do this again

So go on
So go on
If you think of a where
To put your head
Take a step
Take you there
