Can you feel this, the walls are closing,
Slipping further from the hand we're holding
Feel the footsteps inching closer,
Still so far away

It's 2 AM but I can't sleep,
I'm running circles in my head around a restless dream
I know, I'm not the person that I used to be,
But I still can't shake this, no I can't take this

You said, you said
Are you finding me right where you're supposed to be
But I said, I said
I'm so scared to want this, knowing all that I want is

Home,
Why am I everywhere but home?
Why do I feel so alone,
When everybody's screamin' out my name?
I just wanna go home,
Pack my bags and hit the road,
Knowing all I need to find is the life I left behind
I just wanna go

Home is where they say the heart is,
I can't figure out just where we started,
So caught between, chasing this dream
Watching what I left fall apart
And my mom, I swear she's every face I see
And my dad, when I'm gone oh he can't sleep
They tell me that the world is waiting for me,
But I hate watching my brothers growing up without me.

You said, you said
Are you finding me right where you're supposed to be
But I said, I said
I'm begging on my knees, please God just take me

Home,
Why am I everywhere but home?
Why do I feel so alone,
When everybody's screamin' out my name?
I just wanna go home,
Pack my bags and hit the road,
Knowing all I need to find is the life I left behind
I just wanna go

When the miles are getting longer,
The streets are getting darker,
You've got no where to turn,
And the walls are closing,
In on you and everyone you love,
Feels like there's no one left to trust,
I just need something to believe

Please God just take me
Home,
Why am I everywhere but home?
Why do I feel so alone,
When everybody's screamin' out my name?
I just wanna go home,
Pack my bags and hit the road,
Knowing all I need to find is the life I left behind
I just wanna go home.
