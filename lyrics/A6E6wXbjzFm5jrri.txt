Held your standards close to heart
but late one night you threw them down
Simple promises you said you'd never break
but now you have
All throughout the morning, though I'm begging
no your lips they stay perfectly still

Did he fill the empty the spaces
was he everything I'm not
There's no force behind my mouth
but in just three words he brings you down
There's a movement out the door I swear but no
your lips they stay perfectly still
