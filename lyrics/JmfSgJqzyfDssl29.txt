You're so heavy I'm without
to talk about the way you open mouths
I pass often by your house,
but you look around like
I'm something now
It's a come down
see you later
miss it more than
the way you open up my space
In cold you're like my breath, & I
will sink around you like you're in my life
& you & I would walk like the burden hadn't met
It's a come down
see you later
miss it more than
the way you open up my space
