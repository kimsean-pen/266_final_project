Yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I was sitting at home
Watching tv all alone
So excited of re-runs
I've memorised this show

So I pick up the phone
Call everyone I know
Said there's gonna be a party
Hit the music here we go.
Yeah!

You gotta live to party
Bust your moves
Everybodys in the groove.
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock n' roll?

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

We were out on the floor
Yeah we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch
And said that it was late
And she pulled me aside
And said she couldn't stay
(I really gotta go!)
But I begged her for one more song
Let the music play!

Yeah!
You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybodys in the groove
Tell the DJ to play my song

Are you ready to rock n' roll?
Hey!
Hey!

Hey!
I drove her home
And then she whispered in my ear
The party doesn't have to end.

We can dance here.
Live to party
Bust your move
Everybodys in the groove.
Tell the DJ to play our song

Are you ready to rock n' roll?
You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybodys in the groove.
Tell the DJ to play my song

Are you ready to rock n' roll?
Live to party
Bust your move
Everybody's in the groove.
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock n' roll?
You gotta live to party
Bust your move
Everybodys in the groove.
Tell the DJ to play my song
Are you ready to rock n' roll?
LIVE!
TO!
PARTY!
