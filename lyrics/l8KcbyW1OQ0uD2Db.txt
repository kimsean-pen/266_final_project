Get up off your knees my friend, promise never to pretend
You're the apple of my eye, spread your wings and learn to fly
All I know is you can be, everything you want to be
Life is short so don't be shy, tears of joy is all you find

Soul love, soul love, come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do
It's all for you

You can never be too sure, what or who's behind your door
Watch the people gather round, the circus has just come to town
All I know is I can be, everything I want to be
Life is short so don't be shy, spread your wings and learn to fly

Soul love, soul love, come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do, it's all for you
Soul love, soul love, come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do, it's all for you
Soul love, soul love, come into my world
It's all for you, everything I do, it's all for you

It's all for you, all for you, it's all for you
