Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round lookin' for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round lookin' for you, baby

Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love

Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round lookin' for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And down and down and down and down and down

Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round lookin' for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em runnin' 'round lookin' for you, baby

Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love
Lookin' for love

'Cause there's something that I get for myself
And there's something that you give to me
Well, I got one without the other
Well, it's not enough to be - I need your love

Come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
My love
Come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
Oh, come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
Come in to my heart
My love
