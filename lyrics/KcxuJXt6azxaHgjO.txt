One, two, one, two, three
He lives on the other side
His flag isn't blue and white
And instead he drinks wine not beer
It would appear, appear woah-oh
That he's now mine

And he sings and plays guitar
He's not a lawyer or a doctor
He doesn't know the football score
But he loves me right, he loves me woah-oh

It's not what your dad wants to know
Whilst he's waiting back at home
Not what your dad wants to see
Not what your dad wants to think
Knowing one day you'll get a ring
And he'll be family

And I see him smile at you
And you're trying your best too
But you know all too well
That his intentions lie somewhere else
From being your friend

It's not what your dad wants to know
Whilst he's waiting back at home
Not what your dad wants to see
Not what your dad wants to think
Knowing one day you'll get a ring
And he'll be family

It's not what your dad wants to know
Whilst he's waiting back at home
Not what your dad wants to see
It's not what your dad wants to know
Whilst he's waiting back at home
Not what your dad wants to see
Not what your dad wants to think
Knowing one day you'll get a ring
And he'll be family

It's not what your dad wants to know
(Hide your bags, hide your clothes, hide yourself before he gets home)
It's not what your dad wants to know
(Hide your bags, hide your clothes, hide yourself before he gets home)
It's not what your dad wants to know
(Hide your bags, hide your clothes, hide yourself before he gets home)
It's not what your dad wants to know
(Hide your bags, hide your clothes, hide yourself before he gets home)
