Every butterfly I get belongs to you
You don't believe me, but it's true
Sure, the freckles on my arm spell out your name
Real feelings coming through

'Cause all I know and all I am is you
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it
That all I know and all I am is you

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too
'Cause all I am is you

Every daydream I have starts and ends with you
I wanna play it one more time
When I need an alibi, you're my perfect excuse
You are always on my side

'Cause all I know and all I am is you
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it
That all I know and all I am is you

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too
All I am is you

It feels like I'm miles away
You bring me back home again
You hold me through my mistakes
Let go as we start again
You're a habit I'll never break
No no, no no, no

I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it (oh, no)
That all I know and all I am is you

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too
All I am, oh
'Cause all I know and all I am is you
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you
'Cause all I know and all I am is you
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you
