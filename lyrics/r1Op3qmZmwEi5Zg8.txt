Row, row, row your boat
These waters deepen and darken up
But right now you and me honey we just gotta row, row, row
Through mud, dirt, dust and bones
Raging rivers, highs and lows
Keep your head up high and eyes on the shore, shore, shore

We gotta make the most out of this short life
So I row the boat through swamp and tide
And if I reach the coast, where the tide goes high
I'll grab those oars, again

Mama, I'm gonna row my boat
Far from the mess that you left
Oh mama, I'm gonna row no matter what
With shackles and chains round my wrists
You better row
You better row
You better row
You better row
I told myself you better row
You better row
You better row
You better row

Eenie meenie miney mo
There's monsters behind every door
But I'm not scared this time
I'm ready for war, war, war
Even though my hands are tied
I'm gonna row dead or alive
Row dead or alive

We gotta make the most out of this short life
So I row the boat through swamp and tide
And if I reach the coast, where the tide goes high
I'll grab those oars, again

Mama, I'm gonna row my boat
Far from the mess that you left
Oh mama, I'm gonna row no matter what
With shackles and chains round my wrists
You better row
You better row
You better row
You better row
I told myself you better row
You better row
You better row
You better row

Mama, I'm gonna row my boat
Far from the mess that you left
Oh mama, I'm gonna row no matter what
With shackles and chains round my wrists
You better row
You better row
You better row
You better row
I told myself you better row
You better row
You better row
You better row
