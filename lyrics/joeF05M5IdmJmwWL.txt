Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
Blank tapes and posters on the door.

Listen to my Pink Floyd cover
Take a seat like a backbeat lover
Mixed tapes and cushions on the floor.

I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo

Paper bags and escalators
Pushing up those broken faders
Only way to find out who you are

In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero
Little things will always get you far

I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo

Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero

I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
I Sold My Bed
But Not My Stereo
