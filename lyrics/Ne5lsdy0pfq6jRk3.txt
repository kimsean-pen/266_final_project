Dry my soul, all together
Dry my soul, all together now
Dry my soul, all together
Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone

Dry my soul, all together
Dry my soul, all together now
Dry my soul, all together
Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone

My baby, my baby
Can't see how blind you make me
My baby, you paint me blue

My baby, my baby
Can't see how blind you make me
My baby, you paint me blue

Oh I've been workin', diggin' a hole
To put my blues in, each time you call
Governor of my head, you're in denial
It's a big flooded, common sense stole my fire

Gonna dry my soul, all together
Dry my soul, all together now
Dry my soul, all together
Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone

My baby, my baby
Can't see how blind you make me
My baby, you paint me blue

My baby, my baby
Can't see how blind you make me
My baby, you paint me blue

Your wind is vicious, travellin' frown
Can breeze your whispers all over town
Can't tell the difference â€“ is it fire or Greek?
Might be your defense, either way you make me bleed

Gonna dry my soul, all together
Dry my soul, all together now
Dry my soul, all together
Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone

Dry my soul, all together
Dry my soul, all together now
Dry my soul, all together
Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone

My baby, my baby
Can't see how blind you make me
My baby, you paint me blue

Gonna dry my soul cause I'm all alone
