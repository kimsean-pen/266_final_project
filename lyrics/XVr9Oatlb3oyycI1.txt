Hold on, people hold on
Hold on, people hold on

I'm in there superstitious
And life can be so vicious
Learning on your own
Can turn your heart to stone

Apocalyptic mind
My head was full of sorrow
Whispered words of logic
Things I need to learn

I feel like we are the only ones alive
I feel like we are the only ones alive

So hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, you know there ain't no lot of time
But I know that we can make it
You better hold on
You better hold on

Until you get some pepper spray
The water canons on the way
Fighting on your own
Can turn your heart to stone

And truth is on the march again
Wipe those tears away
Apocalyptic mind
She soothe me with my soul

I feel like we are the only ones alive
I feel like we are the only ones alive

So hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, you know there ain't no lot of time
But I know that we can make it
You better hold on

So hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on, you know there ain't no lot of time
But I know that we can make it
You better hold on
You better hold on
You better hold on
You better hold on

I feel like we are the only ones alive
I feel like we are the only ones alive
I feel like we are the only ones alive
I feel like we are the only ones alive

Well you better hold on
You better hold on, hold on
You better hold on, you know there ain't no lot of time
But I know that we can make it

You better hold on, so hold on
You better hold on, hold on
You better hold on, you know there ain't no lot of time
But I know that we can make it

Until you get some pepper spray
The water canons on the way
Apocalyptic mind
She soothe me with my soul

I feel like we are the only ones alive
Apocalyptic mind
I feel like we are the only ones alive
