you call for reasons
it turns me inside out
there's no direction
no ebb and flow
you call them rejects
they're all i have
the mills of life
they will grind you down

see the red
all i know is
see the red
watch it flowing

i see a vision
chew it with my teeth
believe the dying
and minds that read
a change in season
your mind crawls black
turning neurotic
a self attack

see the red
all i know is
see the red
watch it flow

the beast is vicious
turns your pale face green
and keep the search on for mystery
you told a secret
confide into the trees
thinking you know a man's history

see the red
all i know is
see the red
watch it flowing

fall into pieces i swear we're done
you stick with me and prevail as one
fall into pieces i swear we're done
you stick with me and prevail as one
