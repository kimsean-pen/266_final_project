I Dream of Breath
I Dream of Breathing
Breathe and Levitation

Inhale
Death
Exhale
Life

I am master of All
Lifeless
Deathless

I am the darkness now
I am it's light
I am the dreamer
I am the dream

I soar above celebrants
A revelry in Fires Below
To Them I am Unknown
Abode of living shadows
Place of Abstractions
And old woman is seeking
Beyond A Window Pane
Out Beyond the Glass
With Malice Upon my Tongue
She Hears my Words
Spoken in threes
Beyond the a window pane
Out Beyond the Glass

"Go now into death
And be Cursed by Death
Go now into death
And be Cursed by Death
Go now into death
And be Cursed by Death"

Countenance of Terror
Aligned with my Reflection
