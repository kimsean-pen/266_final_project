you're just an object to me
I'd like to get to know you better
paste you across my body
you're just an object to me

you're just a piece of meat
and I am the butcher
I love you better, love you forever
you're just an object to me

why sit in the shade
drink what we made from our lovers cup

dreams don't always come when you fall asleep
you're just an object to me

I'm gonna do something wrong
nobody's gonna like it
but I've got my pride and my time isn't free
you're just an object to me

you're just an object to me
I feel a little better
they found your sweater
you're just an object to me
