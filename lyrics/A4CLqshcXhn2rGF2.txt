I live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you

I got love on my mind
And no using the rest of time
I got love on my mind
And no usin' the rest of time
I got love...
I can live without you

I got love on my mind

When the heartache is over
I know I will be missin' you
Won't look over my shoulder
I know I can live without you

I live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you

I got love on my mind
And no usin' the rest of time
I got love on my mind
And no usin' the rest of time
I got love...
I can live without you

I got love on my mind
I live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you
I can live without you
I got love on my mind
