She can't see the landscape anymore
It's all painted in her grief
All of her history etched out at her feet

Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
Acres of longing, mountains of tenderness

'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
'Cause it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

She wants the silence but fears the solitude
She wants to be alone and together with you
So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
But she saw that the lighthouse have been washed out to sea

'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
'Cause it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

I wanna give you back the open sky
Give you back the open sea
Open up the ages, darling, for you to see

You put the gun into your mouth to bite the lid and spit it out
'Cause it's running in the family
All the rituals in between you and me
'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
'Cause it's burning in bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
