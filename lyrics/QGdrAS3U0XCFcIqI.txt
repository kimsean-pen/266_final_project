I will learn to live before I die
Will learn to love and learn to try
Not to give it all away

She may be the one that's meant for me
Or for the man that I used to be
'Til I gave it all away

Why I lay my heart down on the floor?
I showed you love, you wanted more
But I gave it all away
(Cry, cry)

You taught me to see the bitter truth
About yourself but about me too
I was stupid over you, what could I do?

Why I lay my heart down on the floor?
I showed you love, you wanted more
But I gave it all away
(Cry, cry)

Why I lay my heart down on the floor?
I showed you love, you wanted more
But I gave it all away
(Cry, cry)

Some people wait a lifetime for a chance like this
I've waited enough
Baby, no, I won't let you go
I'm sick of tears and bitter fears

Why I lay my heart down on the floor?
I showed you love, you wanted more
But I gave it all away
(Cry, cry)
Why I, I lay my heart down on the floor?
I showed you love, you wanted more
But I gave it all away
(Cry, cry)
There's nothing left to take
(Cry, cry)
I gave it all away
