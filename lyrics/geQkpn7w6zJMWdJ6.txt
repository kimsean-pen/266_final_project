How many times have you woken up
And prayed for the rain?
How many times have you seen
The papers apportion the blame?

Who gets to say?
Who gets the work and who gets to play?
I was always told at school
Everybody should get the same

How many times have you been told
If you don't ask you don't get?
How many liars have taken your money
Your mother said you shouldn't bet?

Who has the fun?
Is it always the man with the gun?
Someone must have told him
If you work too hard you can sweat

There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun

How many times have the weathermen told you
Stories that made you laugh?
You know it's not unlike the politician
And the leaders when they do things by half

But who gets the job
Of pushing the knob?
That sort of responsibility
You draw straws for if you're mad enough

There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun

There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun

There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun
Always the sun
Always the sun
There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun
There's always the sun
There's always the sun
Always, always, always the sun
