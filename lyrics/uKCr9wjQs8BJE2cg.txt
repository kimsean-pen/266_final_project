I try to picture the girl
Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe

Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously

I try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter fact he's not a beast
Oh no not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all

The call of the wild is still an ordination why
And the order of the primates
All our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is this assembly singing of gratitude
Practicing their lovin' for you

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Oo. live righteously

And sing it out
And just take it easy
And celebrate the malleable reality
You see nothing is ever as it seems
Yeah, this life is but a dream

Live high, live high, live mighty mighty mighty, oo.
Live righteously
And takin' it easy

Live high, live mighty
Ooh. live righteously
Just take, just just, take it easy

Live high, live mighty mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy

Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Let's take it easy
