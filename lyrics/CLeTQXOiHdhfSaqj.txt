So many nights that I wanted
Time after time and I got it
I never want anybody
Just wanna be with a body
Took everything that I needed
Fed on the feeling then beat it
I never want anybody
Just want to be with a body

You make me wonder if there's more
With you I feel like there's something more

You got me feeling some kind
You got me feeling some kind
Of way, kind of way
I've never been so high
I don't want this feeling
To fade, fade away

Like I wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)
I wanna feel love
Wanna feel love
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)

Coming in, coming in closer
Like it but I'm not supposed to
I never want anybody
Just want to be with a body
Going a little bit further
Falling a little bit harder
I never want anybody
Just want to be with a body

You make me wonder if there's more
With you I feel like there's something more

You got me feeling some kind
You got me feeling some kind
Of way, kind of way
I've never been so high
I don't want this feeling
To fade, fade away

Like I wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)
I wanna feel love
Wanna feel love
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)

You got me feeling some kind
You got me feeling some kind
Of way, kind of way

Like I wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)
I wanna feel love
Wanna feel love
Love (Hold me tight just a little bit)
Love (Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)

Be loved, love
Feel love, love
(Hold me tight just a little bit
Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)
Be loved, love
Feel love, love
(Hold me tight just a little bit
Hold me tight 'cause I'm feeling it)
