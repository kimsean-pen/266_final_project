It's the most important game of chance
Judging judgments with a glance
But a spade's a spade, so they're all the same
A different shade with a different name
I've got my eye on the queen of hearts
I'm just tired of searching through this house of cards
Because I'm playing for keeps
With nothing to lose, you can't lose at all.
