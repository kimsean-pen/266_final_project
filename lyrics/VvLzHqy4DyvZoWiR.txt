I'm just so tired of these troubles that I try to hide
Makes me wanna wash away my whole world inside
Think it's time that I make changes in the things I do
This weight on my chest, I am ready to lose

All this time I've been getting in my own way
I have to tell myself
Only I can be the one to make a change

Don't hold me down
Oh, I was getting so far
Don't hold me down
'Cause I don't wanna fall apart

Don't hold me down
You see I'm waking up, I feel it now
I'm breaking out
And nothing's gonna stop me now
No, no

I've been rocking back and forth, leaning across the line
Hanging over for a moment on the wrong side
Now I'm standing up, I think I'll be here for a while
Hope I remember how to keep on this steady smile

And all that time I was getting in my own way
I had to tell myself
If only I can be the one to make a change

Don't hold me down
Oh, I was getting so far
Don't hold me down
'Cause I don't wanna fall apart

Don't hold me down
You see I'm waking up, I feel it now
I'm breaking out
And nothing's gonna stop me now

You know I'm gonna fight it
I'm tired of being blinded

So, I won't hold me down
I wanna go so far
I won't hold me down
No, I don't wanna fall apart

Don't hold me down
You see I'm waking up, I feel it now
I'm breaking out
And nothing's gonna stop me now
No, no

Nothing's gonna stop me now
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
