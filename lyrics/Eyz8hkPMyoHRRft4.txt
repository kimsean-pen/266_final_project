What's left to say that hasn't been already said before?
Did I ever have a purpose? I can't feel it anymore
If ignorance is happiness, please, steal me from my head
'Cause the voices once so soothing make me feel so fucking, so fucking dead

I'd give anything for something to feel anything at all
It just seems so goddamn meaningless, it all seems so devolved
We're drowning in irrelevance, we're hiding from the truth
We are the numb complacent, we are the broken youth

What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?

We are the numb, we are the broken youth
We come undone, we are the ugly truth
We are the numb, we are the broken youth
We come undone, we are the ugly truth

I can't stop, I can't stop
Medicated, sedated in the back seat of our lives
It's so fucking hard to swallow, will we make it out alive?
I can't stop, I can't stop

What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?
What's left to say that hasn't been?

We are the numb, we are the broken youth
We come undone, we are the ugly truth
We are the numb, we are the broken youth
We come undone, we are the ugly truth
