VERSE
Everydays the same, I feel them merge
I try to separate, resist the urge
But they tell me Ill be fine
That it will all get better
Just try to write it down
Or put it in a letter

CHORUS
But the words wont play
And theres no easy way to say
Goodbye, Goodbye

VERSE
Keep my head on straight and dont-
look down
With all Ive pushed away Im losing
ground
But they tell me Ill be fine
That it will all get better
Just try to write it down
Or put it in a letter

CHORUS
But the words wont play
And theres no easy way to say
Goodbye, Goodbye

MIDDLE
And from the sidelines
Watch me fall down

VERSE
And I dont understand the things I do
But Ill probably be fine
As long as I keep moving
Ill try to write it down
So things just keep improving

Still the words wont play
Cause theres no easy way to say
Goodbye, Goodbye
