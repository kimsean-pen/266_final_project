Hello my dear old friends
I'm truly begging, sorry
For their sorrow
With my sorrow

Have you seen my old friends?
They told me "We're heading somewhere"
In their white robes
Over the fake iron wall

Hello my dear old friends
Is there any fine ending?
Every road leads to an end
Yes, we all know this will end

Through these years
Some rush off to the golden palace
In their white robes
Time and tide, through the wall

So sad I can't say that I'm sad
Talk cheap, smoking bitter
정말 미안합니다

Wind flows from the left remains in right
Just finished to build my wings
See you I'll be there

Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN

Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN

Dear my old friends
Who believe in their pray helps the sunrise
It embraces from coast to coast
Pours south to the north

Both ears are covered
"Oh, now you can hear yourself"
You are like that so am I
Stay beautiful through the wall

So sad I can't say that I'm sad
Talk cheap, smoking bitter
정말 미안합니다

Wind flows from the left remains in right
Just finished to build my wings
See you I'll be there

Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN
Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN
Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN
Just a day
Perhaps it's a hard day
Somehow it's one day
And I would say ME-AN
