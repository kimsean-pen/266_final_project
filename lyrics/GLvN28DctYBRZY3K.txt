Divide and conquer
Show no mercy
Defile the honor
Sow discord amongst them all

Crucify my faith
We'll set the stage for the last play
You will not hurt our pride nor break its strength
Stirring up to hate
You'll fail to practice what you preach
Wake the force as we
Won't let you crucify our ways

Abomination
Will enrage them
Manipulation is effective after all

Justify yourself
We cannot speak above our breath
I read between these vast adorned lines
Justify your acts
The credulous will be our guests
Wake the force as we
Won't let you crush our self-respect

High-falutin weaponry
You dictate your recipe of life

Seek the mastermind
The one who's always right
We're searching now and endlessly to set us free
Seek the mastermind
There's no one you will find
We have to find a way to change our destiny
Hate and fear corroded all our hopes and dreams
That's all we have achieved

Divide and conquer
Spread disease amongst them all

Desecrate yourself
Yet our duty will prevail
You will not penetrate through massive shields
Desecrate yourself
We will harvest all we've sowed
Wake the force as we
Won't let you steal our own integrity

High-falutin weaponry
You dictate your recipe with lies

Seek the mastermind
The one who's always right
We're searching now and endlessly to set us free
Seek the mastermind
There's no one you will find
We have to find a way to change our destiny
Hate and fear corroded all our hopes and dreams
That's all we have achieved

Bleed from greed

We'll succeed in our aim
Force the spirit to its knees
Dominate humanity

Hold yourself
Accountable
For the mess around us all
Running blindly for the fall
We are all responsible

Seek the mastermind
The one who's always right
We have to search him endlessly to set us free
Seek the mastermind
There's no one you will find
On this quest without an end eternally
Hate and fear prevented us to reach what we truly are
Nothing really is as it appears that's all we need to be

Abomination
Will enrage them
Manipulation
Is effective
Don't be merciful, seize them all
