Just like the girlies back at corner stone,
wash my bugle boy a watching my throne

sweet mutilations of a sold to nothing man,
lord have mercy shake is falling through your hand

razz the kid

because you love me im the chosen one,
these are the days to not be having no fun

i listen back to what you told me before,
just tell me where to come, ill knock down the door.

razz the kid
