Open up those eyes of yours
To show me what's been hiding underneath
Oh, if it's games you want, you'll get the best of me
With you looking the way you do
So I'll watch you on that stage with that pretty little frame
Oh god I swear,
what I'd give to run my fingers through that hair one last time
And I'm not here to get caught up in friends
So I'll keep what I can, do you expect this to end again?
Oh, she knows it too
The way she dances, the way she moves
Oh it's too much to take
I refuse to take just maybe
I'm nothing but a day in the life
You know you're not the best thing for me
But I can handle my own piece of mind
So is it better if I'm left inside
Or am I good enough to be your type?
Oh, I hope you're opening up those eyes
Just to see this heart on my sleeve
Oh, she knows it's true
I'd give myself up, but would she too?
Oh it's too much to take
And I'm bound to break through
I refuse to take just maybe
I'm nothing but a day in the life
You know you're not the best thing for me
But I can handle my own piece of mind
I am lost for words to describe
That look she gave me, what she said with her eyes
I could've sworn you were all mine
But who am I to say hello or goodbye?
Goodbye
And here I've never wished I was someone else
But I can't fucking handle myself
When time comes to move
Oh, and you look the way you do
I refuse to take just maybe
I'm nothing but a day in the life
You know you're not the best thing for me
But I've become a slave to those open eyes
I refuse to take just maybe
I'm nothing but a day in the life
You know you're not the best thing for me
But I've become a slave to those open eyes
I am lost for words to describe
That look she gave me, what she said with her eyes
I could've sworn you were all mine
But who am I to say hello or goodbye?
Oh, you believe me too
So come in closer, and show me why I've been missing you
