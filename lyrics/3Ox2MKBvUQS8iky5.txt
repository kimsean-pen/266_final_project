On the other side of town lives a sabertooth tiger
Paint's a real good picture, he's an excellent liar
His mouth is full of sand and he's dying to meet you
His mouth is full of sand he's just dying to meet you
On the other side of town lives a sabertooth tiger

Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, runaway from the beast

Colder than an ice cube and faster than the fastest cheetah
He's hiding in the kitchen he's a right brain eater
His mouth is full of sand and he's dying to meet you
His mouth is full of sand he's just dying to meet you
On the other side of town lives a sabertooth tiger

Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, runaway from the beast

He's a sabertooth tiger

Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back and you're shaking at the knees
Runaway runaway runaway from the beast
Got a bullet in your back, runaway from the beast
