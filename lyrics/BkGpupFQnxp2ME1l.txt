I wanna go down by the water
To the uncluttered beach
Away from you and your shady friends
Towards the whistling weathered screams
Well I just came from where you're calling from
And I still feel like me
Tell me I can't get away with it
And I'll pack up and leave

Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist

Well every corner here looks the same
Now I'm dying in your arms
Feathers falling for a simple game
The silhouettes go on and on

Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist
Voices carry through the mist
