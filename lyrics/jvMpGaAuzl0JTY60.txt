Advertise the product you make,
never give, but always take.
Kill and lie for security.
On supermarket shelves death to see.

Instinct of survival

Advertise the product you make,
never give and always take,
clingfilmed flesh and genocide,
contented life, while millions die.

Instinct of survival

The multinational corporation
takes its profits from the Starving Nations.
Indigenous people become their slaves
from their births into their graves.

The multinational corporation
takes its profits from the starving nations.
Another product for you to buy,
you'll keep paying, until you die.
