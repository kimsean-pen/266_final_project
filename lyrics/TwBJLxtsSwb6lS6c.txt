And oh my dear*
I had a good idea
Let's lay these bones to rest
Build it all over and start again
'Cause I know
That if you dare to hope
That if you dare to try
To rebuild the pieces of your life
Then you'll find
The things you held so dear
The things you held so close
Were never ever really yours
And what's left
That vacuous empty shell
Is ready to be refilled
With all the love you should have had
And rip it up
Rip it all apart
This place that our parents built
We'll let it all burn down to the ground
'Cause I'm tired
Of these suited lies
Of policies laid to break
And words that you'll never ever shake
We are nearly home
And we're nearly home
And we're nearly home
And we're nearly home
[2x:]
And oh my dear
I had a good idea
Let's lay these bones to rest
Build it all over and start again
