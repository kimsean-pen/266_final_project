We're both in the gutter, that's no surprise
What does it matter when I look in your eyes?
We've lost all our money, we're thrown out of bars
We're lying in the gutter but we're looking at the stars

I get excited, you get excited too
I get excited, you get excited too

I hear the sound of the subway, the sigh of the heat
the click of the visitors' heels on the street
the rattle of the taxi, the scream of the cars
the clatter of the dustbin and the beat of my heart

I get excited, you get excited too
I get excited, you get excited too
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why

You're in my soul
My body moves to your control
Baby, I've been thinking about you
all night long and the neighbours are talking

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why

We're both in the gutter, that's no surprise
What does it matter when I look in your eyes?
We've lost all our money, we're thrown out of bars
We're lying in the gutter but we're looking at the stars

I get excited, you get excited too
I get excited, you get excited too
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
