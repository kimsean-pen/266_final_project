We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
Is this our world
Send us a sign
Give us a reason to believe.
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
Is this our world?
We don't believe it
We don't know where we are
Up in the mountains
We see the towers in the skies
Send us a sign
Give us a reason to believe.
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
Is this our world?
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true
Is this our world?
We don't believe it
No matter what we say it's true.
Will we ever get off this island?
