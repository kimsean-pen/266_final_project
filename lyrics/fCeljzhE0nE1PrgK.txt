lights and the fashion walk
so look at that walk
deals, deals fucking hard
cynical blinding puffs
a&r's, bullshit stars
click, switch, forget about that bitch
'cause the game is hard like a bitch
better be tough for you own good
run your?

this is how I boss, think hard, no fear
run fast, one hundred meters
work, work, be a believer
don't take no for an awnser
go get your shit, fight for it
go get your shit, fight for it

they said I would fail
they said I would crash
they said I would bail
they said I wouldn't last
I'm still here

drone, drive, hair, fur
you knew from the
fight, smash, break down
dreams are dry
every time we gain, sweat
pain start all over again
twelve years underdog
trusting on your instinct
