I'm still sick with my depression
Trapped inside my fragile shell
Is your God holier than heaven?
My heart's heavier than hell

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and he is lying

Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me to hell

My hands are chained, and I am sinking
To the bottom of the well
I can feel the water rising
My soul is too worthless to sell

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and he is lying

Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me to hell

Dragging me to hell
Hell
I'm sick of chasing heaven, I'm going straight to hell
I'm chained down to my past, so I give up
I don't believe in God, no, I've got no time for that
Chained down to my convictions, I give up

The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and God's a lie
The Devil's God, and God's a liar
The Devil's God, and he is lying

Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil at the bottom of the well
Holier than heaven, heavier than hell
I've seen the Devil, and he's dragging me, dragging me, dragging me, dragging me to hell
