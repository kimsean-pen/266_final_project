There's a hair on the bed
The clock has stopped ticking
And nothing remotely romantic has been said

Let's not pass on the steps
Let's take the season very easy
Let's take pills, salt water, let's keep looking ahead

Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down
Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down

There is a history in pictures
There is evidence in boxes
There is proof of your love for him, long after it's dead

And every creak, a trigger
I will think of you with others
I could not smother out that fire in my head

And I saw your levitating chair
I found your long blond hairs
I felt your poltergeist presence in the frame of the bed

Every creak is a trigger
I will think of you with others
I found depravity convinced me I may no longer care

Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down
Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down

Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down
Oh, it's a bad, bad ritual
Oh, but it calms me down
