I got out of my car
I could have fallen down in the yard
And looked up at the stars
But I don't like stars
And I don't know where you are

And all I ever knew about falling in love
Was wrong

I went inside
And fell down on my bed
I could have hit my head
On a million different things
But it's not my time to die

And all I ever knew about falling in love
Was wrong
