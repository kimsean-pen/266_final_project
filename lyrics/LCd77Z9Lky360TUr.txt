I try to sleep but my eyes are open
I can't think 'cause my heart is broken
And there's a bottle right next to me
I'll down a few drinks just to take the pain away
I wanna say all the things I need to say
I won't lie, I'll just tell them honestly
If God can take a friend away from me
Then I can say all I want and he won't do anything
My tongue is weak and every time I
try to speak I can't say nothing at all

Sleep well, my friend
There will be another moment we'll meet again
Just let it go
Sleep well, goodnight
You're something to remember
I wish that you were here by my side

I spend hours tryna make it through the day
I don't know if I'll ever be the same
It's hard enough when you're all alone
In the city that you love, now Atlanta's just a burial ground
My tongue is weak and every time I try to speak I can't say nothing

Nothing at all
It's hard to think when losing someone only makes you wanna scream

And now that you're gone
Sleep well, my friend
There will be another moment we'll meet again
Just let it go
Sleep well, goodnight
You're something to remember

I wish that you were here by my side
All the stained pieces, I can't believe this
A mother shouldn't witness her son die at twenty-four
I will hold my tongue for the rest of my life
I can't keep this up anymore
Sleep well, my friend

There will be another moment we'll meet again
Just let it go
Sleep well, goodnight
You're something to remember
I wish that you were here by my side
By my side
By my side
By my side
Sleep well, goodnight
You're something I'll remember
I wish that you were here by my side
