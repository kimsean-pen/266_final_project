I used to wonder how it all would be
with thousand strangers all surrounding me
(they're watching)
could this be real and not some crazy dream
cause i was reaching out for someone to love me

everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone
before my life is over
won't let it slip away

trying hard to make a stand with everything i am
to make a lasting memory
(remember me)
to be one with time and space forever
(forever)
and so i'm reaching out for someone to love me

(everybody wants to be someone)
everybody needs to find their way
(everybody wants to be someone)
dont let it slip away
(everybody wants to be someone)
before my life is over, won't let it slip away

cause all i'm looking for is someone to love me

everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone
everybody wants to be someone

before my life is over

(everybody wants to be someone)
everybody needs to find their way
(everybody wants to be someone)
don't let it slip away
(everybody wants to be someone)
everybody wants to be someone

yeah
