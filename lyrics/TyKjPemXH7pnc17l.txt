Love took me by the hand
Love took me by surprise
Love led me to you
And love opened up my eyes

And I was drifting away
Like a drop in the ocean
Now I realize
That nothing has been as beautiful
As when I saw Heaven's skies
In your eyes
In your eyes

And everytime I drift away
I lose myself in you
And now I see that I can be me
In everything I do

'Cause I was feeling as small
As a drop in the ocean
And now I realize
That nothing has been as beautiful
As when I saw Heaven's skies
In your eyes
In your eyes

Love took me by the hand
Love took me by surprise

And I was drifting away
Like a drop in the ocean
And now I realize
That nothing has been as beautiful
As when I saw Heaven's skies
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
