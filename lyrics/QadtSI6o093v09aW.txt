I've tried to find reconciliation
Behind the walls of those whose hatred burns
For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels
Than to make amends with passionless apathy
Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made

I need to burn inside
I need to know that you are alive
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

Like a colorless sky
Over a sea of nothingness
Hatred faces its enemies while apathy strikes furtively

I need to burn inside
I need to know that you are alive
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

Until our anger burns against injustice
We will create the faceless
By dismissing those forced to concede

(Many of us have turned off the light outside)
(Erasing what exists beyond our front door)
(And for you I find it harder to reach common ground)
(Than my most glaring opposition)
(But what about those who've lost the luxury of choice?)
(Striving for identity)
(Buried by our lack of interest)
(Souls marked as mere history)
(How much grievance will it take to awaken us?)

I need to know that
Feelings of discontent are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

How much grievance will it take
To awaken us from the comfort of our homes?
The comfort of our oversized graves
