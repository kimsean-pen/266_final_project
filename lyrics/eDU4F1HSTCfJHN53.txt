Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

You don't have to read my mind, to know what I have in mind
Honey you oughta know
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show

Now it's up to you, we can make a secret rendezvous
Just me and you, I'll show you lovin' like you never knew

That's why, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded (I'm hot)

If it feels alright
Maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?
But you gotta give me a sign
Come on, girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are ya hot mama?
You sure look that way to me

Are you old enough?
Will you be ready when I call your bluff?
Is my timing right
If you save your love for me tonight?

Yeah, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I feel the fever burning inside of me
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

Now it's up to you, can we make a secret rendezvous? oh
Before we do, you have to get away from you know who

Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

Hot blooded, every night
Hot blooded, you looking so tight
Hot blooded, now you're driving me wild
Hot blooded, I'm so hot for you child
Hot blooded, I'm a little bit high
Hot blooded, you're a little bit shy
Hot blooded, you're making me sing
Hot blooded, for your sweet sweet thing.
