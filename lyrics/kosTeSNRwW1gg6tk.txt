We're different colors
And different creeds
And different people
Have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you
What could I have done

La la la la la la, la la la la la la

People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me
People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me

You're punching, kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
Just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fist

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

La la la...

People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me
People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
