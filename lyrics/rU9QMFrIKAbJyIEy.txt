I can't afford to want you
Still I can't avoid your blame
You creep into my organisation
A whistle to the wolves at bay
At this point darlin'
I must say
That the seeds unsown gonna grow anyway
Rent a room, get it over with
In a race
To the inside of your face
you're afraid of me
Shufflin' for Xanadu
The jewel's a magnet
The solitary dragnet
Lookin' for all I know
Well I see
You're afraid of me
Doin' the juxtapose
Speak arrangements baby but you haven't got a clue
For all that I do I know
End of the seasaw
