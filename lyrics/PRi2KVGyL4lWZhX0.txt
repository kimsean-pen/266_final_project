She crawled into my ear
like a tapeworm telling me
things I want to hear
the words escaped her mouth
with everything I should've been
"Are you all alone?"
I could be a scar
hold me at your heart
eat it all apart
I could be your own desire
And even when you're done
tell me I'm the sun
baby let me take you higher
her lips were close to mine
