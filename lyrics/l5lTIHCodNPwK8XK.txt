Yuh, it's Bobby and Fendi, okaay
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat

Run it up, all I see is blue
Count it up, diamonds Pikachu
Run it up, sauce it needs a Theraflu
She said, "Wherever we go, they all stare at you"
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)

I'm up now, won't break my neck looking back at you
When you dickride, y'all wanna be me but the shit ain't natural
Stay inside, 'cause I need to count my money till it's total, let's dash it
I can't lie, I got bitches on my dick, I'm the goth Dave Matthews
Why you watching?
Please, stop pocket watching
I think these boys is impostors, they ain't need to copy-paste
Why they wanna be Lil Fendi?
'Cause Lil Fendi friends with benjis
I don't know you, don't act like we was friends in high school
I don't know you, polar cap look like my ice do
I don't know you, why my neck looks just like Raichu
I don't know you, I just bought that new coupe

Run it up, all I see is blue
Count it up, diamonds Pikachu
Run it up, sauce it needs a Theraflu
She said, "Wherever we go, they all stare at you"
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
