My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Well no one told me about her
The way she lies
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Well no one told me about her
The way she lies
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

But its too late to say you're sorry
How would I know?
Why should I care?
Please don't bother to find her
She's not there

Well no one told me about her
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

But its too late to say you're sorry
How would I know?
Why should I care?
Please dont bother trying to find her
She's not there
She's not there...
