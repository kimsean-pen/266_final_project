Go slow, I wanna hear the phone booth scream
In the cold soul
I wanna be a space man true
If you giving what you giving to me
Feeling I can know myself
And if you're living how you living for me
I wanna hear the phone booth scream
Go slow, I wanna hear the phone booth scream
In the cold soul
If you giving what you giving to me
Feeling I can know my shame
And if you're living how you living for me
I wanna hear the phone booth scream

And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?
Go slow, I wanna hear the phone booth scream
In the cold soul
I wanna be a space man true
If you giving what you giving to me
Feeling I can know my shame
And if you're living how you living for me
I wanna hear the phone booth scream
And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?

And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?
Go slow, I wanna hear the phone booth scream
In the cold soul
I wanna be a space man true
If you giving what you giving to me
Feeling I can know my shame
And if you're living how you living for me
I wanna hear the phone booth scream
And baby won't you reach out to me?
Baby won't you reach out to me?

Baby I got it, baby, baby, I got it
Baby I got it, baby, baby, I got it
I anyway got it
Baby I got it, baby, baby, I got it
Baby I got it, baby, baby, I got it
I anyway got it
