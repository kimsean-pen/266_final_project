Hey

There's no rules today
You steal instead of borrow
You take all the shapes that I make
And you think
That you thought

All the thoughts
That I thought you
Don't you?
Mutilation's the most

Sincere form of flattery
If you want to be me
Then stand in line like the rest
Now, do you know what I mean?

The young get less bolder
The legends get older
But I stay the same
As long as you have less to say

Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you

And
Fuck you too
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you

Rebels without applause

I sell my shadow to those
Who are standing in it
They think I would
Bitch about them
Thinking they are

The shit

When they can't
Even step
In it

The young get less bolder

The legends get older
But I stay the same

As long as you have less to say
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
And
Fuck you too

The young get less bolder
The legends get older
But I stay the same
As long as you have less to say
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
And
Fuck you too
Do you think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you
