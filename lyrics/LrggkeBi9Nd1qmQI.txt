I could lay me down forever
In this smokey afternoon
'Cause babe these questions march forever
And I can see no answers coming soon
The days stop stealing so have we now
Our hungry words left hanging in the air
Give up these needs, forget the hours now
'Cause where we're heading time no longer cares

Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And the sun grows sharp above the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)

So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause Paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)

The sky's blazed with colors bursting
The tears collect and tumble down that tease
With such perfection we were taken
By the throats it has us on our knees

Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And the sun grows sharp above the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)
So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)

'Cause Paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)
I've tasted the world, all its flavors
I've tried some lash snatched moonlight savor
I've had sweet success and sweet failure
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you nothing quite tastes like Paradise
Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And the sun grows sharp above the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)
So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause Paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause Paradise is somewhere where...
Paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
