Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me?

I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'till I ache in my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own

I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray
'Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (somebody), oh, somebody (somebody)
(Please) Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday (Everyday) I try, and I try, and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in

Ooh, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love?)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat

I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (Someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord
