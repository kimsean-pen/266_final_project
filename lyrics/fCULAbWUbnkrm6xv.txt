someone crashed the party
and i thought the worst part was over
'til she took aim and struck me dead
so now i guess it's what's in fashion
taking part in new direction
i thought i'd covered everything
but it's not what they say now

this distance won't kill me or bring you back

someone crashed the party
and i thought the worst part was over
'til she took aim and struck me dead
so now
pressed against the window
scattered across the bedroom floor
whisper 'cause the walls are thin
with secrets how can you be sure?

this distance won't kill me or bring you back
