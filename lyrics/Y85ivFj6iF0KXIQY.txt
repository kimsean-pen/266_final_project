I didn't know the day was
I didn't know what the time it was
I didn't know what my heart would do
I was afraid of nothing when you called me on the telephone

I was a creature of appetites
And we played a game that you didn't like
There wasn't nothing that I could do
I can be so bad
I can be so bad
They just took it away and they broke it in two

Colour my heart
Colour my heart
Make it restart
Make it restart
Colour my heart
I want it more than I ever knew

The blackest lily
The blackest pomy
Won't protect my heart from you

You were unnercingly delicate
And I had a weekness for etiquette
You laid a trail that led straight to your door
And I could resist but it was hard to ignore

Colour my heart
