You took me up to heaven, when you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses, blinded by your charms
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise
When you told me that you loved me, I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be any truth in love so new
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise
The whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down
Well you treat me kinda coolish and may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish because I love you so
I'll still get lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise
Well you treat me kinda coolish and may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish because I love you so
I'll still get lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise
