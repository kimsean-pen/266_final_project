Time, lonely dreams
I have lost everything
Seasons change, colors fade
Lifeless flowers on the floor
Blooming on my grave

No way out
Of what you're going to be

You float down stream
Your body lies next to me
I'm trapped inside your heart
I don't mind the broken parts
But I want to see the lying thieves
Underneath my stars

No way out
Of what you're going to be

I feel I don't know where I'm going now
I feel like I am six feet under ground
I can't make you loose your mind
I can't get closer tonight

Light bulbs break down your wicker stairs
You can't see me behind your black hair
But I want you
I want to take you home

I feel I don't know where I'm going now
I feel like I am six feet under ground
I can't make you loose your mind
I can't get closer tonight

Oh I want you
I want to take you home
Ohhh I want you

I feel I don't know where I'm going now
I feel like I am six feet under ground
I can't make you loose your mind
I can't get closer this time
