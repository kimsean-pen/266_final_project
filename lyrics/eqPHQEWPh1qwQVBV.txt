with every test i've taken
i want toknow what's in my mind, my mind, my mind

eyes closes and mouth wide open
i see the things that i can't find, can't find in my mind

this world is only broken
which world is your's and which is mine
is mine, is mine

who cares what real is real or
when you come around inside your mind
your mind, your mind,
in your mind
take me to the river, won't you let me see your soul
i know you
all along the way we can't top where we wanna go
a forest
