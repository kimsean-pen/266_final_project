This is my good eye
Do you hear a cow?
A rooster says
Here is a pig
The devil says

Painted blue across my eyes,
and tie the linen on
And I'm on my way,
on my way

Looking for the paradigm,
so I can pass it off
Is it on my side,
on my side

Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky, now

Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed

If I took you for a ride,
would you take it wrong,
or would you make it right,
make it right
Looking for a pedestal,
that I can put you on,
and be on my way,
on my way

Is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky, now

Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed

With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed

Stop you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time
If I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way, on my way

Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,

And i'm on my way,
on my way,
on my way,
I'm on my way, yeah
I'm on my way, yeah
on my way, yeah

Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky

On my way,
on my way

Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky
