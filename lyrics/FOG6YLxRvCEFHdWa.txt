Only in the middle of the night
She drops me this line
We're camping in and out of hotels
That suits me just fine
And we can even talk about him
Tell me this is not right
Honey I don't mind
Drive up to a dim cafe
You know the drill
Two bottles of white wine
Hide out while the jukebox plays
Oh what a gloom now
Show me a good time
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Never in the middle of the day
She treats me this way
High heels trample
On my coattails
That suits me O.K.
They don't know the places I've been
Tangled in her long hair
Honey I don't care
Drive up to a dim cafe
You know the drill
Two bottles of white wine
Hide out while the jukebox plays
Oh what a thrill now
Show me a good time
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
You can
Hit me on my cell phone anytime
I'm ready for you late night
You can
Climb in through my window anytime
I'm ready for you late night
You can
Call me any old time
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter
Of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
Face down in the gutter of your love
