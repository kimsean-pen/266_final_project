Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

Trust is such a tricky little thing
True colors always show
You think just cuz ya see me on the Internet
But baby you dont know

You wanna see me
Cry

Love me! Love me!
When Im up you love me
Trash me! Trash me!
When Im down you trash me
Leave me! Leave me! (ooooo)
Save all the drama for some other mama cuz Im just a baby, I really dont wanna
Trash you

My list of what I need to be chill
It dont include your name
Step inside my mind and have a look around
Youre not in the frame

You waste my breathe
Why?

Love me! Love me!
When Im up you love me
Trash me! Trash me!
When Im down you trash me
Leave me! Leave me! (ooooo)
Save all the drama for some other mama cuz Im just a baby, I really dont wanna
Trash you (trash you)

People telling lies, can you hear the sound?
Clicking day and night, try to turn it down
Popping out at me- getting louder now
(up up up up)
Like a pendulum swinging on and on
Playing in my head, like a hooky song
Will it ever end, am I right or wrong?
(stop stop stop stop)

Love me! Love me!
When Im up you love me
Trash me! Trash me!
When Im down you trash me
Leave me! Leave me! (ooooo)
Save all the drama for some other mama cuz Im just a baby, I really dont wanna
Trash you
Love me! Love me!
When Im up you love me
Trash me! Trash me!
When Im down you trash me
Leave me! Leave me! (ooooo)
Save all the drama for some other mama cuz Im just a baby, I really dont wanna
Trash you

Trash you
Trash you (ohhh trash me)
Trash you
Trash you
Save all the drama for some other mama cuz Im just a baby, I really dont wanna
Trash you
