It's been so long out here sitting and drifting all alone
Lost in a wild place, no sign of home
So I write you with love from the wide ocean
And I know we haven't spoken at all for so long
But there's something I need to tell you
and there's something I've thought about for so long In the wide ocean
If the sun don't shine on me
I'll look to the stars ahead
And send a message from the sea
If the moon don't rise again I watch the water beneath my feet
And the world to bring you to me
The clouds are all around me
The water's still below me
And the ground may never be found
If only I could build a bridge of bones
With every bone in my body
So many bones in my body

So I will float to find my love
So shine your light
Show me a way, show me a way to forever
repeat

And the colors of home I'm remembering so strong
Beautiful colors I ain't seen in so long
Will I find you again before I die? I don't know
And I guess I must have done something really wrong
And so I've been drifting out here pretty long
So I write you with love from the wide ocean
If the sun don't shine on me
I'll look for the stars ahead
And send a message from the sea
If the moon don't rise again I watch the water beneath my feet
And the world to bring you to me

So I will float to find my love
So shine your light
Show me a way, show me a way to forever
repeat

I've been good, I've been wrong
I've been gone too long
I've been right, I've been told
I've been lost too long
I've lived my life, sung my song out here all alone
I need to build a bridge of bones to get home
If the sun don't shine on me
I'll look to the stars ahead
And send a message from the sea

So I will float to find my love
So shine your light
Show me a way, show me a way to forever
repeat
