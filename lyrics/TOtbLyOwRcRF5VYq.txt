British sugar bureau...
When I told you what I...
And I...
And I wouldn't ask you to pretend
That we were one
And still another time...

Forget all the lies
Forgive me the wounds
And all the world was used to love...
And yes!
We'd still be happy in another time...
But so what?

So please send me icing and decorating sets
I enclose a cheque and postal order number...

So what?
So what?
