Once apart, we're bound
All of our bones closing ranks
Never be lost, never fade

My eyes are filled with your space
And I won't feel until we bleed again
My eyes are filled with your space
And I will wait for awakening

Blossoms in vain
Out of this lonely place
You've worn yourself out
Come, come blossom in return

Once apart, we're bound
All of my bones crushing

My eyes are filled with your space
And I won't feel until we bleed again
My eyes are filled with your space
And I will look for awakening

Way apart, way apart, way apart
Out of this lonely place you've worn yourself out
Blossom in vain
Out of this lonely place you've worn yourself out
Blossom in return
Way apart, way apart
