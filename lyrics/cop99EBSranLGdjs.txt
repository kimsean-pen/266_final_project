Bloodhounds shall cruise rendezvous
Break curfew new trip ensues
You never know
Bloodhounds just go
Pack backpack up for down the road
No change of clothes but change for tolls
Pack of No-Doz Rolos and Skoal
Old Milwaukee Jolt black coffee
Sugar Daddy Rand McNally
A pack of Jacks those orange Tic-Tacs
Glen Miller tracks roll of Kodak
The phantom black stacked Pontiac
Hot rod dual quads and in the back
Is the beat keeper big ass speaker
Jumbo woofer rumble tweeter
Dial is turned and there it's stayin'
The next day where Stern is playin'

You got your Jesus on the dashboard but the Devil's under my hood
You're takin' it down to legal I'm pullin' it up to no good
God is your co-pilot I let Satan ride shotgun
You pay a toll to get to heaven but on the road to hell there's none

You got your Jesus on the dashboard but the Devil's under my hood
You're takin' it down to legal I'm pullin' it up to no good
God is your co-pilot I let Satan ride shotgun
You pay a toll to get to heaven but on the road to hell there's none

Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel

I-95 eight lanes wide
Midnight drive take a ride
Alongside east coast tide
Getting high so am I
Bloodshot red eyes from the fumes
I consume engine zoom then engine boom
Then engine glow erupt and blow
And overflow like volcano
So far to go but can't turn back though
Cheap tobacco cup of black Joe
Fuelin' my body jumpstartin' my soul
Set my mind on cruise control

You got your Jesus on the dashboard but the Devil's under my hood
You're takin' it down to legal I'm pullin' it up to no good
God is your co-pilot I let Satan ride shotgun
You pay a toll to get to heaven but on the road to hell there's none

You got your Jesus on the dashboard but the Devil's under my hood
You're takin' it down to legal I'm pullin' it up to no good
God is your co-pilot I let Satan ride shotgun
You pay a toll to get to heaven but on the road to hell there's none

Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel

Two four seven truck stop plaza
Turn off headlights turn on hazards
3: 00 A.M. is when I gazed
Eyes glazed I'm dazed and then I fade
To black now we're back
On The Road like Kerouac
Down the turnpike high rate of speed
Up All Night like Gilbert Gottfried

You got your Jesus on the dashboard but the Devil's under my hood
You're takin' it down to legal I'm pullin' it up to no good
God is your co-pilot I let Satan ride shotgun
You pay a toll to get to heaven but on the road to hell there's none

Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
Get up you're asleep at the wheel
