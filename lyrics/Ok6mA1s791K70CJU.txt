Nobody ever told me
The final chapter to the story
And if I win or lose
Don't know exactly where I'm going
I just keep on rollin'
You never know when your time is through, ooh
When you fall, you're gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
Remember the hard times make ya you
That's when we'll show the world
They're not gonna break us
Hey, we'll burn so bright
Makin' all the people come to life
Hey, the darkest sky
Can't stop me and you tonight
Said hey, we'll burn so bright
Dancin' underneath the city lights
Hey, from way up high
Shinin' down like stars tonight
When it's too far for me to reach it
I close my eyes and believe it
Ain't no other way to do, ooh
When you fall, you're gonna hit hard
When you love with your whole heart
Remember the hard times make ya you
That's when we'll show the world
They're not gonna break us
Hey, we'll burn so bright
Makin' all the people come to life
Hey, the darkest sky
Can't stop me and you tonight
Said hey, we'll burn so bright
Dancin' underneath the city lights
Hey, from way up high
Shinin' down like stars tonight
When you fall, you're gonna hit hard
When you're lovin' with your whole heart
The hard times make ya you
When you fall, you're gonna hit hard
When you're lovin' with your whole heart
The hard times make ya you
They're not gonna break us
Hey, we'll burn so bright
Makin' all the people come to life
Hey, the darkest sky
Can't stop me and you tonight
Said hey, we'll burn so bright
Dancin' underneath the city lights
Hey, from way up high
Shinin' down like stars tonight
