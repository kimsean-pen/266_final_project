One, one, two

I came into this world as a reject
Look into his eyes
Then you'll see the size of the flames
(Size of the)
Dwelling on my past
(Past)
It's burnin' on my brain
(Hot)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day
(Days)
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas came to play
(Play)
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
(Oh)

And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat

(Hey)
Like a chump

Should I be feelin' bad?
(No)
Should I be feelin' good?
(No)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on
(Movin')
But I'm a sucker like I said
"Fucked up in the head"
(Not)
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break

My heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny

I did it all for the nookie
(C'mon)

Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one
Underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived

(But you were)
By my so called girl
(But in reality)
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender, heart in a blender
And still I surrendered

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends
To give you their advice
They'll tell you
Just let it go
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone

Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

And nothings gonna change
(Alone)
You can go away
(Alone)

I'm just gonna stay here
(Alone)
And always be the same
(Alone)

And nothings gonna change
(Alone)

'Cos you can go away

And I'm just gonna stay here
