Oh if you're losing sleep...
Oh if you're losing sleep, scared of shadows.
See it's just a chair, see the clothes hang there.
Oh don't go losing sleep, scared of shadows.

Oh don't feel bad.
Well I never have, since I got you, my Emmylou.
You wear those socks to bed, wear those socks to bed.
That's what I do.
Oh c'mon sleepyhead, get yourself to bed.
Don't go losin, oh, the nighttime.
Oh, don't feel bad.
Well, I never have, since I got you, my Emmylou.

You are loved, you are loved, you are loved.
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved.
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved.
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved.
Oh now, don't feel bad.
Well I never have.
Now that I've got you, my Emmylou.
No don't feel bad.
Well I never have, now that I've got you, my Emmylou.
