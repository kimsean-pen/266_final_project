I've been up at this all night long
I've been drowning in my sleep
I've prayed for your safe place
And it's time for us to leave

Time is running
It's running on empty and the
Gas is running out
I've decided
Tonight is the night that I
Let love aside

Full speed ahead
This seems to be the place
I've seen this once before
Planned perfection
Sought in my dreams
Hoping this would take
You
Home

My
Knuckles have turned to white
There's no turning back tonight
Kiss me one last time

Around this turn where
The cross will cast your shadow
The people will all gather
Remember such a day
Where the flames grew as high as trees
And the world
Is stopped
Is stopped
For you
And
Me

My knuckles have turned to white
There's no turning back tonight
Kiss me one last time (shut your eyes)

My knuckles have turned to white
There's no turning back tonight (so hold on tight)
Kiss me one last time (shut your...)

I will now bring
New meaning
To the word alone
Endless nights of dreaming of life and the days
We should have spent
Here

Drowning in my sleep, I'm drowning in my sleep - x2

(Drowning in my sleep) Glass shatters and comes to a halt
(I'm drowning in my sleep) I thought we'd be there by now
(Drowning in my sleep) I thought it would be
(I'm drowning in my sleep) So much quicker than this

(Drowning in my sleep) Pain has never been so brilliant
(I'm drowning in my sleep) I made sure you were buckled in
(Drowning in my sleep) Now you can walk
Hand in hand (I'm drowning in my sleep)
Hand in hand with him

My knuckles have turned to white
There's no turning back tonight
Kiss me one last time (shut your eyes)

My knuckles have turned to white
There's no turning back tonight (so hold on tight, so hold on tight)
Kiss me one last time (shut your...)
