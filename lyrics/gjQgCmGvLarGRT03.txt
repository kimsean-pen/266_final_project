In the silent cries
In the stirring trees
Wild winters breathe
For the suffering

I will hunger for eternity
For tides they are beckoning
My heart forever bleeds
In this hollov veil
This hollow veil

As the fallen skies
Rest upon my bones
And the fallen speak
To my love, behold!

I will hunger for eternity
For tides they are beckoning
My heart forever bleeds
In this hollow veil
This hollow veil
