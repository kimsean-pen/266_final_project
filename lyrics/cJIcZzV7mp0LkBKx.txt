I'm so hot when I walk, I leave smoke in my tracks
Don't leave your man with me 'cause he won't come back
I'm dangerous
It's when the lights go out

I'm a girl that's not afraid of the dark
When the lights go out I get what I want
I'm so easy
When the lights go out

I don't know what you want to do
But I want to get you up in my room
I like your swagger, gotta have it, gotta have ya
So won't you come along?
Turn out the lights, into the dark, dark

Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never ever had nothing better when the lights go out

I? ma dig in my bag and see what I pull out
I got a lot of tricks so let me start out
With my number
When the lights go out

I? ma change your good boy status
Break all your good habits
Momma gon' to make you an addict
When the lights go out

I'm gonna make you a new man
Have you talking to all your friends
Baby, you ain't seen nothing
When the lights go out

I'm the type of girl that always get what I want
So be sure before you come walk in the dark
'Cause you about to see
When the lights go out

I don't know what you want to do
I want to get you up in my room
I like your swagger, gotta have it, gotta have ya
So won't you come along?
You ain't gotta be afraid of the dark

Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never ever had nothing better when the lights go out

You ain't never ever, never ever seen a girl like me
D-A-N-I-T-Y K-A-N-E
You ain't never had nothing, boy
You ain't never had nothing, boy
So won't you come on and turn the lights out?

I don't know what you want to do
But I want to get you up in my room
I like your swagger, gotta have it, gotta have ya
So won't you come along?
You never gotta be afraid of the dark

Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never ever had nothing better when the lights go out

Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights and see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never ever had nothing better when the lights go out
