You've got a lot to learn
Before I let you go
There's things you need to see
And things you need to know

They say, we won't, make it
What do they know?
They say, we can't do it
But I've got to know

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better now?
And is it getting better now?

You've got a lot to do
Before I let you stay
There's things you need to see
And things you need to say

They say, we won't, make it
What do they know?
They say, we can't, do it
But I've got to know

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better now?
And is it getting better now?

You always talk too much
Too little, too late, too much
Too little, too late for me to figure out

You always talk too much
Too little, too late, too much
Too little, too late for me to figure out
I still can't figure out

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?

And is it getting better?
Is it getting worse?
Was it ever worth it?
Was it just a curse?
And is it getting better now?
And is it getting better now?

And is it getting better now?
And is it getting better now?
