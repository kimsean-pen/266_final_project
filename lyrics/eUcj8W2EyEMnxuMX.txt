Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Yesterday holds memories in time
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to think back upon younger days
Yesterday holds memories in time
And seek yonder crossroads where we parted ways
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to follow the path to the shire
Yesterday holds memories in time
For there she'll find her heart's true desire
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to come to the old willow tree
Yesterday holds memories in time
Where spirits of lost love yet whisper to thee
Thou art still a true love of mine

Tell her to gather three lilies of white
Yesterday holds memories in time
To place at my headstone, beneath the moon's light
Then she'll be a true love of mine
For ever she'll be a true love of mine
