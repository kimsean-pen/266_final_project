Wasting so much time
Only knowing doubt
Falling in a line
Only facing out
What do they even know?
Gotta let it go

Feeling so other
Like too many sunsets
Try not to bother
The world is offensive
What can they even say
Do it your own way

Whose anxiety is this you've been trying on
Everything's a risk
Better get along
What do they even want?
Who you livin' for?

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

That's just grains of salt
That's just tears in the oven

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

The mansion in your mind
Gotta draw it out
How is it designed?
Floatin' on a cloud
What do they even say?
Do it anyway

Feeling so other
Like too many sunsets
Pleased to discover
You're on the ascendant
What do they even want?
Who you livin' for?

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

That's just grains of salt
That's just tears in the oven

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

Feeling counterfeit
'Cause they told you so
Thinkin' this is it
Everyone will know
Leave the party on time
And don't say good bye

Feeling so other
Like too many sunsets
Pleased to discover
You're on the ascendant
Don't forget to remember who the fuck you are

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

That's just grains of salt
That's just tears in the oven

Everyone else's
Everyone else's
Everyone else's, yeah

Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget to remember
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget to remember
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget to remember
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget to remember

Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget to remember
