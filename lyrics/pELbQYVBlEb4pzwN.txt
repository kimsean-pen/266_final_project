I lit a match in Vienna tonight
It caused a fire in New York
Where is my self-control

You gotta learn to be thankful
For the things that you have
Now bathe my idle soul in

Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire

Taken by force
Twist of fate
Well what weighs more
Down on your plate

A ton of love
A ton of hate
We're waiting for
A chance of, chance of, chance of

Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire

I don't trust the government
I don't trust myself
What is a boy gonna do

Build a church in the city
A place to crawl with our own
We'll give our God away

Taken by force
Twist of fate
Well what weighs more
Down on your plate

A ton of love
A ton of hate
We're waiting for
A chance of, chance of, chance of

Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire, desire

Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire

Taken by force
Twist of fate
Well what weighs more
Down on your plate

A ton of love
A ton of hate
We're waiting for
A chance of, chance of, chance of
