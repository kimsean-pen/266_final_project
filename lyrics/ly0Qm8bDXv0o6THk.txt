I am not afraid
Of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and

I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and make me feel it

I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
