I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've got to work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em running 'round the block now

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're running from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You think you danced with the devil and you love him now

The water's getting colder
Let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders
Keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', keep your body open, swim

Pop a couple pills in the daytime
How'd you get a phone with a headlight
Probably should've fucked on the first night
Now I gotta wait for the green light
I don't wanna wait for no green light
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright
Luckily I've flown at insane heights
Luckily, luckily, luckily, ya

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're running from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You think you danced with the devil and you love him now

The water's getting colder
Let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders
Keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', keep your body open, swim

Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip
I know I said I'd call, I never did, no
Swim, swim now
I can take you even though I've never been there
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again
I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in

The water's getting colder
Let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders
Keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya', keep your body open, swim
