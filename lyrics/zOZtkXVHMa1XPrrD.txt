Until the fire, turns to desire
Until the fight, becomes daylight

Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them

Until the fire, turns to desire
Until the fight, becomes daylight
Phantom soldier, no surrender
Of your splendour

Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them

Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
Oh we hang on the wire and the walls get higher
Just until the fire catches them
