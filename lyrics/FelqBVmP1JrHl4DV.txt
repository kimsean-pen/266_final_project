I know I could be
I could be
I know I could be
Anything, everything

Why can't you be what the mirror sees
Time does not have faith in our pride
How could you turn your back on us
You were not there for us
With all these paths we're supposed to trust

I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
Why can't you see
Anything, everything that you wanted
Cause I can't move on, it's just not worth it
The dream we had was just so perfect
I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be

We started off so shallow
But now I feel like I'm falling off the deep end
This is hard to swallow
Now it's time to face the fact that
You are the disease of our dreams
How do you plea? How do you plea?

How could you turn your back on us, you turn your back on us
(How could you turn your back on us)

I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
Why can't you see
Anything, everything that you wanted
Cause I can't move on, it's just not worth it
The dream we had was just so perfect
I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be

I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
Why can't you see
Anything, everything you wanted

Why can't you see
I am not giving up
Why can't you see
I am not giving up

I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
Why can't you see
Anything, everything that you wanted

I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
Why can't you see
Anything, everything that you wanted
Cause I can't move on, it's just not worth it
The dream we had was just so perfect
I know I could be
Anything, everything that you wanted me to be
