SORROW
Undead undead
There's evil in my veins
Undead undead

The consummate revenge
How do you forgive the unforgivable?
How could you kill that which has no life?
You once were my sanctuary, and now you are my prison
(Loveless)
She says she wants to bleed

(Heartless)
She says she wants to bleed
I won't let go, I will not hurt
I've had all that I could take so I can just shut you out

You could never understand me
Just walk away and don't say goodbye
How can I shake this disease?
The marks on your neck would never lie

The quickest way to the heart is to cut right through the chest.
You must realize that someday you will die and until then you are worthless

The best way to get over someone is to get on top of someone else and move on
The best way to get over someone is to get on top of someone else and move on
You could never understand me
Just walk away and don't say goodbye
How can I shake this disease?
The marks on your neck would never lie
Why do I feel guilty for what you have done?
The worst part is showing you all the damage that you've caused
You could never understand me
The marks on your neck would never lie
