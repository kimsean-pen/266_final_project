I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out boy!
So stuck up
I wish you'd stick it to me
Flesh ripped off
Raaawr!

Turnin' it
Beatin' no beat
The walls are always speakin'
No want no want no want no speakin' at all

Well she slipped
Down a rot drink
Unzipped
She doesn't exist!
So unloved
I took 'em standin' up
So stuck up
Raaawr!

I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out boy!
I'll take you out boy!

Turnin' it!
Beatin' no beat
The walls are always speakin'
No want no want no want no speakin' at all

Turnin' it!
Beatin' no beat
The walls are always speakin'
No want no want no want no speakin' at all

Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich
Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich
Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich Rich
