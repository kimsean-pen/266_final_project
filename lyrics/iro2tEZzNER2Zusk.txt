Sometimes when I'm really not so happy
It seems no matter what I do
Or no matter how hard I try
I really can't get high
I think about the lessons life has given me
Now I know exactly what to do

I'm gonna push it back and turn around the feelin'
And that is when the sun comes shinin' through
Yes, it's true that it's all up to you

It's feelin' that your feelin' right
It's feelin' that your feelin's right
It's feelin' that your feelin' right
It's feelin' that your feelin's right

All at once I found the perfect feelin'
I can't believe what seemed so hard comes so easily
It came all over me

Now I've got to find a way to show you
'Cause it's too good to lock inside myself
So just push it back and turn around the feelin'
Its best when you can share with someone else
Yes, it's true, yes, it's true
That it's all up to you
