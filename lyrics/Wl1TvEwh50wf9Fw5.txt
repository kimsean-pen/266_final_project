Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
Well, I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm Eighteen
And I don't know what I want
Eighteen
I just don't know what I want
Eighteen
I gotta get away
I'll gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, yeah

Well, I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm Eighteen
I get confused every day
Eighteen
I just don't know what to say
Eighteen
I gotta get away

Ooh oh
Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form from the left and right
I'm in the middle

The middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Oh, I like it
Love it
Like it
Love it
Eighteen
Eighteen
I'm eighteen and I like it
