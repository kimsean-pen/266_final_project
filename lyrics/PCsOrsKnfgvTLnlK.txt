I found reasons
That I should try to seek him
And through the pieces
I saw somebody to blame
But I felt nothing
When I fell to my knees
We all need somewhere to be
We all need someone to please
We all need somewhere to be
Someone to please

Who am I to try to say words
Haven't felt too close in ages
It's easier to scream and shout all the things that you want to hear
Do you need me to explain this
Sounds really is this painless
I've woken up and seen that I have made the same mis-steps again
Another night of feeling lonely
Want to know if you're feeling lonely
I can't forget the way you taste and all the little things you said
???????

Every time you leave this moment
It's just the chance I'll take to tell you all the things I never said

I felt you waiting
And made a point of a change
And through my absence
You started to rearrange
All of the places
That you had touched on my face
We all need somewhere to be
We all need someone to please

We all need somewhere to be
Someone to please

Who am I to try to say words
Haven't felt too close in ages
It's easier to scream and shout all the things that you want to hear
Do you need me to explain this
Sounds really is this painless
I've woken up and seen that I have made the same mis-steps again
Another night of feeling lonely
Want to know if you're feeling lonely

I can't forget the way you taste and all the little things you said
