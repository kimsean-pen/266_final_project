Something I just might regret
Something you will not forget
Maybe I should throw away
Everything I've learned today

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me

Pushing forward from the truth
Maybe it's me and maybe it's you
Sometimes I don't know myself
Twenty-eight years straight to hell

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me

There's something changing in me
There's something growing in me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing inside of me
(Changing, growing, changing, growing, changing)

Go away
Don't want this
Don't want this
Don't want this

Don't want this
Don't want this
Don't want this
Don't want this

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me

There's something changing in me
There's something growing in me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
