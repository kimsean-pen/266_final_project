I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock
Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

"spoken:"
"Al√¥, galera do rock, Raul Seixas acabou de cantar
"Good Rockin' Tonight""
