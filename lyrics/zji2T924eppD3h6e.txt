Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your reverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
'Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh, there's trouble on the way
Oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day

Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's making me high (I wanna get me free)
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Now can these broken wings free me
About a light-year from reality
If you wanna fall in a dream
You can put the weight right onto me

Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's making me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Ah, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ah, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ah

Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams (dreams dreams)
D-d-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
All day and all night, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world

(Oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)

I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
