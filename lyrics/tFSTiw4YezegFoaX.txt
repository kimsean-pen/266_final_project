Some faces

Some faces

Some faces
Nothing's going places too long to take sight
Walking in those alleys
Some faces
Through the dark and through the light
Through that light
Some faces
Those chicks get smaller almost every day
Lightning faces small time places
Some faces
Checking faces places every night
In a lonely night

I hate it

Some faces
Most kids can't find any current ties
Will they live it up?
Some faces
So they might find that they can climb
And give it up?
Some faces
They spin and spin, and hit and hit
To get in tight
Some faces
Maybe too tight?
Oh, I don't know
Will I give it up?

I hate it

Some faces
All by myself, living up to me
For encouragement
Some faces
Will it go as planned, will he lift up his hand?
Shaking all his arms
Some faces
He takes a drive, a long, long drive
Up to that smoke
Some faces
Smoking that hash, in someone's stash
He can't give it up

He hates it

I hate it
