Too many feet on the dance floor
Let's go somewhere so we can be alone
Just like a shell on the seashore
Baby, I wanna take you home
I play by a different set of rules, dealing with someone like you
Keep you around like you're in my crew
Hold me down like I depend on you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messing around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinking
That you got that type of love that I be missing
Yeah yeah, ay ay, yeah yeah, ay ay
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missing you someday

I felt eyes and it hit me
Had my heart skipping a beat
Wanna feel you breathing on my body
I play a different set of rules
So you better be ready for what I might do
When it's me and you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messing around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinking
That you got that type of love that I be missing
Yeah yeah, ay ay, yeah yeah, ay ay
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you someday

Like an hour, I'll be still
Until you come back to me
I'll use my will
And miss you for real
Oh, missin' you, yeah
(I'm missin', I'm missin', I'm missin', I'm missin')
Missin' you, darling
Missin' you, missin' you
Miss you, yeah

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messin' around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinkin'
That you got that type of love that I be missin'
Yeah yeah, ay ay, yeah yeah, ay ay
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you someday

Missin' you, missin' you, hey... hey...
