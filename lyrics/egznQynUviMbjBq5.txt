Just an old fashioned love song
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music is a sound
Of someone promisin' they'll never go

You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old fashioned love song
Comin' down in three part harmony

To weave our dreams upon and listen
To each evenin' when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness
And feelin' that we've come to know

You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on and
No need in bringin' 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old fashioned love song
Comin' down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

Just an old fashioned love song
Comin' down in three part harmony
Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song

Just (Just) an old song comin' down
Just (Just) an old song
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)

Just (Just) an old song comin' down
Just (Just) an old song (an old fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)

(Just) Just (Just) an old song (an old fashioned love song)
Comin' down (Comin' down in three part harmony)
(Just) Just (Just) an old song (an old fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)

(Just) Just (Just) an old song (an old fashioned love song)
Comin' down (Comin' down in three part harmony)
(Just) Just (Just) an old song (an old fashioned love song)
(One I'm sure they wrote for you and me)
