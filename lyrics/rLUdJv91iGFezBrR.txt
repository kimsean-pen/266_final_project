Midnight says: get up, lets go
Can you believe? Can you believe? Two nights in a row
Sun light says: calm down and go home

Midnight says: I'm coming undone
Can you believe? Can you believe? The night's still young
Sun light says: calm down and go home

Midnight says: don't fall on the floor
Shouldn't we leave? Shouldn't we leave? Crawling to the door
Sun light says: calm down and go home

Who said I wanna finish it off??!!

Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?

Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?
Who said I wanna finish it off?

Every night we raise the bar and when I'm done
They say: at least you're going out

We're going down-downtown, ain't no matter if it's already dawn
Come on...
Bottoms up, forever twenty-something!

Midnight says: get up, lets go
