There will never be a time
When I'm untrue to you, yeah
You, you're always on my mind
Tell me what can I do?

I've been through a string of affairs
'Til I met you
You, you're always on my mind
Tell me what can I do?

Is it a dream come true
About a love I once knew?
Was it all in my mind
Or did I dream it all the time?

You don't have to prove your love
'Cause it's plain to see
And life, life is a mystery
Until you came to me

And we'll have high hopes
But if it don't work out
We won't be dismayed
'Cause love, love is our guiding force
And it will remain

Is it a dream come true
About a love I once new?
Was it all in my mind
Or did I dream it all the time?

If this love I feel
In this heart so real
In my dreams each and every night
Oh, it's you that treats me so right

A dream come true
About a love I once new
Was it all in my mind
Or did I dream it all the time?

A dream come true
About a love I once new
Was it all in my mind
Or did I dream it all the time?
