Hey there, Mr Nightmare
Now you're lost
(Basics only)
The gutter and the martyr
Have left you alone
(Basics only)
The learned and the sparrow
Are all eaten by hawks
(Basics only)

Now you're in the nightmare
It's not your fault
(Basics only)
The wings of holy nightmare
Come drifting in
(Basics only)
Where is all your cold wind
Where is what you knew?
(Basics only)

Now the gutter martyr, now alive and well yeah
Now the morning after is just you and yours.
