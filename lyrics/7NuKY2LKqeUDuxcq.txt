Oh, darling
I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night
Always thinking about you

But if I had the chance to start all over
I would be wishing today
On a four leaf clover

And leaving would be the last thing on my ind
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time)
Oh, baby (if I could turn back the hands of time)

Oh, darling
I can't hold out much longer
For the pain is getting deep
Oh, the hurt keep getting stronger

But if I had just one more try
I would be yours alone
Until the day I die

And we would have a love so divine
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time)
Oh, baby (if I could turn back the hands of time)

Remember, girl
That I love you

Oh, darling
Please, please let me come back home
Your love has been so good to me, baby
And I just realised without it I can't go on

'Cause while you're the other half
That makes my life complete
If I had one more chance
We'd have a love so sweet

And leaving would be the last thing on my mind
If I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time)
Oh, baby (if I could turn back the hands of time)
I love you (if I could turn back the hands of time)

Girl, I need you (if I could turn back the hands of time)
Mmm (if I could turn back the hands of time)
Ooh, baby (if I could turn back the hands of time)
