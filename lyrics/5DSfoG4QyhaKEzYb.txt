When did we get so skinny?
Start doing ketamine on weekends
Getting wasted at the station
And trying to keep our friends from death
We're trying to keep our friends from death

And yesterday I heard you say
'everything will sort itself if I get to L.A.'

We're a super sad generation
Killing time and losing our paychecks
We're a super sad generation
Killing time and losing our paychecks

We're barking out it's not hard to see
Drop three tabs quick in the back of the prius
Rainbow crop top billy jean
Might kill myself if you don't pick me
Prom queens brushing blood out their teeth, it's clean
Don't call me grieving for what we used to be
We're 17 just let it be
Drink some coffee, pretend it's the 60s

Yesterday I heard you say
'everything will sort itself out if I get to L.A.'

We're a super sad generation
Killing time and losing our paychecks
We're a super sad generation
Killing time and losing our paychecks
