Wandering, weightless
I'm empty, I'm faded
Stumbling, nameless
I'm falling, failing, faithless...

If I say a prayer for someone
Who'll say a prayer for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?
If I gave away the ending
Who'd save the day for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?

Freezing, frameless
I'm tempting fate with
Saying nothing
I won't fade away to nothing

If I say a prayer for someone
Who'll say a prayer for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?
If I gave away the ending
Who'd save the day for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?

I'm wandering, I'm weightless
I'm failing, I'm faithless
Descending to madness...
I'm taken for granted
I'm wondering and worthless
Deserving, deserted
Defeated, defended...
Forgive me
Forget it

If I say a prayer for someone
Who'll say a prayer for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?
If I gave away the ending
Who'd save the day for me
When I ask myself, if the life I lead's the price I have to pay?
