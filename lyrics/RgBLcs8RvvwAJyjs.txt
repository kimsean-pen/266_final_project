Oh, could you wake up
From this dream inside you?
I'm feeling arrested from the beating of your heart

I'm feeling impatient somehow
And I just cannot revive you
But I know you'll always be the same

Let me get back, let me get back
Into this introspective thinking
Let me get lost, let me get lost
'Cause love is taking over

Now I'm runnin' away, runnin' away
From all of the problems that you made it
But you know that
I can't stay with you

It's my fault yeah
And I said I'm sorry
But you know that
I can't stay with you

There's nothing more that I want to do
Just be there for you
But I can't stay with you

I've been reminiscing on a gold mine
And my old ways
I had a premonition for a long time
That you won't stay

I'm taking it back to when I always looked out for you
Cause that's just what I do

It's my fault yeah
And I said I'm sorry
But you know that
I can't stay with you

There's nothing more that I want to do
Just be there for you
But I can't stay with you

I'll never be the one you want to love
But I will be there
And when I told you that our hearts were not divine
I didn't mean that

But I'll never be the one you want to love
But I will be there
And when I told you that our hearts were not divine
I didn't mean that

It's my fault yeah
And I said I'm sorry
But you know that
I can't stay with you

There's nothing more that I want to do
Just be there for you
But I can't stay with you

It's my fault yeah
And I said I'm sorry
But you know that
I can't stay with you

There's nothing more that I want to do
Just be there for you
But I can't stay with you
