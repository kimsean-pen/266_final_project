Tell me what you want it
How you turned my body into shapes
Let me to your madness
Keep blending my heart into deeper shapes
Paint me with your body
I wanna be the canvas that's underneath
Let me see you magic
I feel you're taking over me
Baby I can't never find the need
I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
I feel it's never leave
I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now

Taking my love, baby I'm so deep now
Can't get out
Baby I'm so deep now
Taking my love baby I'm so deep now
Can't get out
Baby I'm so deep now

Even in the darkness
You can make a wrath to look my pain
Somehow you go beneath it
And take my heart to a higher place
Break me into pieces
You can a choose of a colour of my fate
Long as we can keep it
You can have it all again

Baby I can't never find the need
I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
I feel it's never leave
I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now

Taking my love, baby I'm so deep now
Can't get out
Baby I'm so deep now
Taking my love baby I'm so deep now
Can't get out
Baby I'm so deep now

I just wanna let my time
Boy lose it with you yeah
So won't you give it up to me

Tell me what you want it
How you turned my body into shapes
Let me to your madness
Keep blending my heart into deeper shapes
Paint me with your body
I wanna be the canvas that's underneath
Let me see you magic
I feel you're taking over me
Baby I can't never find the need
I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
I feel it's never leave
I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now
