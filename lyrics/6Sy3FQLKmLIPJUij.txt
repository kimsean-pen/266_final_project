Come to me lady of a foreign shore
to pass on your knowledge to me,
interrupt these peacefull lands with your odem of pestilence
Your lifeform is living in the deepest twilight,
the depths of Avathar.

Your odem goes down the green rivers and
high up to the blue skies, to the wide open forests and
mountains so high, far away to the unknown and
at last to destroy the two trees of life on
the hills of Ezellohar...

So high my throne, so cold as ice
it makes my blue eyes turn red
and this red covers my stronghold Angband
as a shadow fog to keep it unseen...
The Silmaril now covers my crown

Keep away Ungolianth...
