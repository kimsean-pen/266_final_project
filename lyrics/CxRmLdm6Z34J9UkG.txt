A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing, with feel

I simply am not here
No way, I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining, please!

And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way, I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining, please!

The dust in my soul makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head's in the clouds, and I'm zoning out
I'm watching TV but I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored but I can't switch off

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall, shuffling through the stores like zombies
Well what is the point? What can money buy?
My hand's on a gun and I find the range, God tempts me
Well, what did you say? Think I'm passing out

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
Water so warm that day

I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
I counted out the waves

As they broke into shore (as they broke into shore)
As they broke into shore
I smiled into the Sun

The water, so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment
You were stolen
There's black across the Sun

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
Water so warm that day

I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
I counted out the waves

As they broke into shore (as they broke into shore)
As they broke into shore
I smiled into the Sun
