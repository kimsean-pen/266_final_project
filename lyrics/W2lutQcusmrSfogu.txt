And it's sore,
it's so Lost in your glorious violent streak
A seemingly peachy thing
Coming out from I don't where
So unwise,
as you are everytime
A dirty joke you played on yourself,
well played
When a magnetic glow
becomes all you know
You'll find yourself later on
covered in a guilt that lingers on
Calling a hotline
as if there's still time
They say it's closed,
but you stick around
One of the low lives,
one of the bad guys
Would die in your arms too
, as long as they could have you
I can't be that guy;
I rely on my own
You can't be that guy;
it's better if do this alone
As the months lull by
I can't help but think
The same motel sign
Is giving me everything
