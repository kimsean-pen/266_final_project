Someone clean to chew on a wife that no one likes
He called and they said all of new york
Is a tow-away zone
He paid sixty dollars on 12th street today
And now all my money's gone

You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phones off the hook,
But you're not

You hate my older sister and burglarize her home
Your dirty invitation waits run over on my street
I don't care who you don't like
You don't have to answer me

You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phones off the hook,
But you're not
