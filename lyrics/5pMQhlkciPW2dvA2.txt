The supermarket man
Doesn't sell a brand
New life
What if I need one?
New apartments on the Moon
Be the first to move there soon
With space to breathe
And lots of room
Maybe not
Maybe not
Maybe not
Maybe not

I need a moment of your time
I'm running out of mine
Mister Hora
Where's my time?

Do you have a second?
A second life maybe?
Maybe not
Then it's all we got
All we got
All we got
All we got
All we got

I'm gonna call you when
It feels like home again
I'm gonna call you then
Call you then
I'm gonna call you when
It feels like home again
Wanna call you then
For sure I'll call you then

We'll find a second earth
Our unreachable backup world
Oh, oh yeah
Maybe not
Maybe not
Maybe not
Maybe not
Maybe not
