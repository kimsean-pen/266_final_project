Once you had this promise
On the tip of your tongue
But it went without saying
It went on too long

All the straws you clutched at
Have burst into flames
And so you smile that way
Tantalizingly lame

The smart ones understood+
How your heart bursts
Like a bottle of champagne
You're just desserts

The smart ones understand
You shouldn't settle for less
You're gonna forget yourself
In my happiness

Keep your silence to yourself
You will forget yourself
Keep your silence to yourself
You will forget yourself

You will forget yourself
You will forget yourself
You will forget yourself
You will forget yourself

Keep your silence to yourself
You will forget yourself
Keep your silence to yourself
You will forget yourself

You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)
You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)

You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)
You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)

You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)
You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)

You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)
You will forget yourself
(In my happiness)
