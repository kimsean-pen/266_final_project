Her place was like an eyrie
The fall seems very scary
Down to the strand
Please, I wanna be in your band

I see her body swaying
I hear her fingers playing
Her parlor grand
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona I will await destruction,
Oona I will await destruction,
My owner, I'm Oona's

And automatic writing
I hear they have it nightly
And wild jams
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona I will await destruction
Oona I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

The fall seems very scary,
Down to the strand
Please, I wanna be in your band,
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona I will await destruction
Oona I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's
