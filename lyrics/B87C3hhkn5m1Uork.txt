Will you take me out tonight?
On the town
Spin me around
Will you take me out tonight?
Don't bring me home
Until the daylight

Will you take me out tonight?
Let's spend your money
In the moonlight
Will you take me out tonight?
Don't bring me home
Until the daylight

You don't have to be alone
I know you're sad
Sitting by your phone
Come on with me
I'll take you around
Come on with me
I'll show you the town

You don't have to be alone
I know you're sad
Sitting by your phone
Come on with me
Dont be afraid
Come on with me
I'll show you the way

Will you take me out tonight?
On the town
Spin me around
Will you take me out tonight?
Don't bring me home
Until the daylight

You don't have to be alone
I know you're sad
Sitting by your phone
Come on with me
I'll take you around
Come on with me
I'll show you the town

You don't have to be alone
I know you're sad, just sitting by your phone
Come on with me, dont be afraid
Come on with me, I'll show you the way

You don't have to be alone
I know you're sad
Sitting by your phone
Come on with me
I'll take you around
Come on with me
I'll show you the town

Will you take me out tonight?
On the town
Spin me around
Will you take me out tonight?
Don't bring me home
Until the daylight

Will you take me out tonight?
Let's spend your money
In the moonlight
Will you take me out tonight?
Don't bring me home
Until the daylight
