You're the voice of reason that I can't escape
Cut me down a thousand times a day
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I trusted you when there was no one else
All you did was make me doubt myself
Don't believe you anymore
Don't believe you anymore
You bled me out, you tore me down
Your time has come, you can go
'cause you're a lie
Lie!
All my faith's been wasted, wasted
'cause you're a lie
Lie!
I don't need you to save me anymore
I'm fragile but I'm not a fool
I won't hear another word from you
You won't hurt me anymore
You won't hurt me anymore
The hand I held just held me down
It took so long now I know

'cause you're a lie
Lie!
All my faith's been wasted, wasted
'cause you're a lie
Lie!
I won't sit here and take this anymore
You can say anything that you wanna say
But my intention's long gone and turned away
You're such a lie, you were only the enemy
Everything you are I will deny
(Solo)
'cause you're a lie
Lie!
I'll just come out and say it, say it
'cause you're a lie
Lie!
All my faith's been wasted, wasted
'cause you're a lie
Liar!
I don't need you to save me anymore
I don't need you to save me anymore
I don't need you to save me anymore
