it's hard to place my hands around it
light the candle, find the passion
take another, passing onward
i know what i like
legs and shoulders
and i wish i had a place in la
but i also want a place with you
there came a time when you were pushing me away
and another when you push me through
i collapse when i think about you
and everything i hid from you you knew
so call me out on that...
change the past around...

eyes closed
so cold
you put me in choke holds...
i cast a sigil and my eyes burn blood
i got scars on me
no love
