Listen to my head (?), hey, could I ever set now?
Shake up another place, dear, see if you can see, baby

Oh, don't you know I'm away of here
Oh, don't you know I'm away of here

You've got a lot of girls, (?) I'm too upset
Shake up another place, dear, see if you can see, baby

Oh, don't you know I'm away of here
Oh, don't you know I'm away of here
