Getting to the bottom of this fear inside of me
the bottom, the bottom
(fear inside of me)
Staring down the problem like the people on the street
the problem, the problem
(fear inside of me)

Fall, I'm gonna fall
come give me hope from this
(fear inside of me)
hope, come give me hope
dont wanna fall into this
(fear inside of me)

like a bird, I will fly into all my time
like a bird, I will fly into all my time

fear inside of me
fear inside of me
fear inside of me oh
fear inside of me

take away the struggle lift the pressure off of me
the pressure, the pressure
(fear inside of me)
save me with a promise and a moment of release
the moment, the moment
(fear inside of me)

Fall, I'm gonna fall

come give me hope from this
(fear inside of me)
hope, come give me hope
dont wanna fall into this
(fear inside of me)

like a bird, I will fly into all my time
like a bird, I will fly into all my time

fear inside of me
fear inside of me
fear inside of me oh
fear inside of me

what you give to me is my only is surgery
'cos when i want release you take the pressure off
what you give to me is my only is surgery
cos when i want relief you take the pressure off

like a bird, I will fly into all my time
like a bird, I will fly into all my time

fear inside of me
fear inside of me
fear inside of me oh
fear inside of me
