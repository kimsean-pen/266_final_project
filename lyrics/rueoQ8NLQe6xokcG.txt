Future lives in the minds
While we fall from behind
Missing light
From the trees
Missing you
Look at me
From a far to a sound
From a fear we expound
Give it life
Make it breathe
Spinning wheels
Into words we believe

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Hear the thunder and rain
Feel our heart fill with pain
Travel through time and space
Where did love lose its place?
Can we find who we are
If we stare at a star?
And the silence
It screams
There is nothing
That is as it seems

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Can we find who we are
If we stare at a star?
And the silence it screams
There is nothing
That is at it seems

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
Nobody listen

Everybody talk
Nobody listen
Nobody listen
