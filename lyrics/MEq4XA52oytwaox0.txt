Don't know what I'm doing
I can't make up my mind
Can't see where I'm going
It's too dark outside
Why should I keep moving
There's no end in sight

The future is scary
It's so terrifying
Will I be buried
Or will I die in a fire
Don't worry about your problems
You're just waisting time

The world is so big now
It's hard not to feel alone
Without no direction
I don't know where I'll go
Don't worry about tomorrow
We'll find our way home
