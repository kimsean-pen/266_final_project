He bends and he breaks
If he gives they will take away
His passion, his pain, his grace
He exhales
A thousand black flowers explode
Into butterflies as they're away

Rip them out, take them
Burn to coals as they crush him
Leave nothing that resembles a soul of a man
See him numb, see him crushed
See him numb, see him crushed
Rip them out, take them
Burn to coals as they crush him
Leave nothing that resembles a soul of a man
Leave him numb, leave him crushed
Leave him numb, leave him crushed

Took the fire inside one too many times
He's burning over and out as he flails
Up against the raging tides
No more sides
Everything you ever wanted to see
See it in his eyes
One more time
One more time

Climb down to test the waters
My hands feel like they're rusting away yeah
So I'll pace around like a lamb before the slaughter
I'll stay here as long as you let me
Decisions been made obvious
So I will return where I started, I'll stay there
Unfinished I'll wither away

Rip them out, take them
Burn to coals as they crush him
Leave nothing that resembles a soul of a man
See him numb, see him crushed
See him numb, see him crushed
Rip them out, take them
Burn to coals as they crush him
Leave nothing that resembles a soul of a man
Leave him numb, leave him crushed
Leave him numb, leave him crushed
