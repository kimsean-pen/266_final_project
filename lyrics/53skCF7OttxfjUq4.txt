Reformulation,
Rearrange the game you're in
Let us start from the begin
With confidence you'll win
That's the reason you were born

'cause jesus christ, man,
Won't be coming
Back no more
He set up his proper laws
And you know well that he did
Just what
He should have done

As i was growing
And my hair was getting longer
I was feeling so much stronger
I could carry my guitar,
And i knew that i could sing!

But hey, how could i know?
The wind would blow with the rain
Hey, how could i see
What would they make
Out of me?

When i was little, used to dream
I was a king
Now they taught me how to sing
Think i've got most everything
I could ever ask for

You've got your pencil, your guitar,
Your amplifier
Searching for the lousy liars
You will set this world on fire
Like nero did to rome! yeah!

But hey, how could i know
My eyes could see in the dark?
Hey, don't press on me
I'm not to blame can't you see?

It's been so long now
Since the latest "red" has gone
Who knows you'll be the next
To go down in history?
