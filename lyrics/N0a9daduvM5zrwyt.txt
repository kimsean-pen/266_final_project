What happened to humanity?
What happened to our sanity?
What happened to integrity?
Lost beauty to our vanity
Just a little at a time
When you boil me slow
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is cold
Your apathy: The enemy
The irony: A tragedy
What happened to humanity?
What happened to our sanity?
.And a little white lie
Isn't hurting a soul
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is gold
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is gold.
