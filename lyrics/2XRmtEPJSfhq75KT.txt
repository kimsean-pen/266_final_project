Holding out for the right time
What if the right time never arrives?
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

Holding out for the right time
My whole lifetime slowly goes by
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

What are you doing tonight?
You can't just scroll through pictures and hide
What do you wanna do right
Now, right now, right now

All the time, they're filling up my days
All that's coming, I'm so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
All the time, they're filling up my days
All that's coming, I'm so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?

Holding out for the right time
That second lifetime never arrives
Always waiting for perfection
Where affection cannot be won
Be won, be won

Holding out for the right time
That second lifetime never arrives
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

What are you doing tonight?
So what are you doing tonight?
You can't just scroll through pictures and hide
What do you wanna do right
Yeah, what do you wanna do right
Now, right now, right now, right now

All the time, they're filling up my days
All that's coming, I'm so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
Right now, right now, right now

All the time, they're filling up my days
All that's coming, I'm so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
