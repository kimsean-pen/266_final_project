And so there were no higher mountains
It's all in your hand
Nelly was the future sea
And out sails the plan
And in this travel with no journey
I'm loose till I'm lying
Letting go mine to hell
What I'm keeping now

And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no this is fun
Still a tower's in the valley
Still winds down the stream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within

And there are many ways of sorrow
For just stepping out
Everyday a growlin' storm
But they're kind somehow
Fall in love but keep on falling
I held you for life
But letting go rope in hand
Theres just leaving now

And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no this is fun
Still we're back in laughing memory
Still winds down the stream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within

And when there's no one on the bottom
You got there alone
Kicking up some dust to see
Where a wind could blow
And all the ways to ride a lightning
I've used up a few
And I just want you to be safe
As I thunder through

And suddenly the day gets you down
But this is not the end, no this is fun
There still are towers in the valley
Still winds down the stream
Still we're in the light of day
With our ghosts within

No this is not the end and no final tears
That will lead to show
I thought that this would last for a million years
But now I need to go, oh, fuck.
