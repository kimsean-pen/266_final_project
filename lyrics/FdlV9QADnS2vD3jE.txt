Come down to my house
Stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out
If you like it too much

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsessions
Now there'll be nothing but this thing
That you'll never doubt

A hit is hard to resist
And I never have missed
I can take you out
With just a flick of my wrist

Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsessions
There is nothing but this thing
That you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt

It'll feed your obsessions
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
