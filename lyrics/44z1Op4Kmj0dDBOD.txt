Like a ghost in the night without any light
They roam through the steppes and the wilds
A dangerous lot
We are the Golden Horde

A new day is finally breaking
The sun rises up from the east
A terrible lot is assembling
Ready
Go!

Our arrows they darken the skies
Raining down like on hellfire's eve
We scatter them into the wilds
Pursue
Kill!
Leave no one alive

Like a ghost in the night without any light
They roam through the steppes and the wilds
A dangerous lot
We are the Golden Horde

Fire or steel
We'll make them kneel
Torching their temples with ease
Unstoppable force
We are the Golden Horde

Faster than northwind we're moving
No tyrant can stand in our way
We ambush from chasms and ravines
Hit
Run!

A feast for the Gods will be waiting
Spoils will be shared equally
Honor for those who have fallen
Bottoms up!

Like a ghost in the night without any light
They roam through the steppes and the wilds
A dangerous lot
We are the Golden Horde

Fire or steel
We'll make them kneel
Torching their temples with ease
Unstoppable force
We are the Golden Horde, yeah

Burn it to the ground!

Like a ghost in the night without any light
They roam through the steppes and the wilds
A dangerous lot
We are the Golden Horde

Fire or steel
We'll make them kneel
Torching their temples with ease
Unstoppable force
We are the Golden Horde

We are the Golden Horde
