Lying all alone and restless
Unable to lose this image
Sleepless, unable to focus on
Anything but your surrender

Tugging a rhythm to the vision thats in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes
that unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating with a look on your face like

Sweet revelation
Sweet surrender
Surrender
Surrender
Surrender

Tugging a rhythm to the vision thats in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes
that unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakeable sound I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating with a look on your face like

Sweet revelation
Sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation
Sweet

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking...

Sweet revelation
Sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation
