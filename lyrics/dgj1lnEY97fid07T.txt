Here where the old echoes roam
Under a giant
So unconscious in sleep
What's hiding beneath the surface breathe

Here where nameless faces live
Wasted youths in hate and despair
They hammer the pipes for a warning
To chime

All my life I have sailed with the current along
Now I stand before this entrance to their realm
The pain in on my conscience
As my life is at the cost
The sun falls to kill the day
And the moon new born on the rise

Over big hill and deep seas
On visions from ancient times
While the wind tries to blow the fire
All humanity will be quelled

Living in a world underground
In a life with no friends and no trust
While the wind tries to blow the fire
All humanity will be quelled

Where echoes gather

I feel recycled
I've seen the loss in their eyes

Living in a world underground
In a life with no friends and no trust
While the wind tries to blow the fire
All humanity will be quelled
