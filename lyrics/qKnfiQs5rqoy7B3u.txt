Emily will find a better place to fall asleep
She belongs to fairy tales that I could never be
The future haunts with memories that I could never have
And hope is just a stranger, wondering how it got so bad

I die each time you look away
My heart, my life, will never be the same
This love will take my everything
One breath, one touch, will be the end of me

You could be the final straw that brings me back to earth
Ever-waiting airports full of the love that you deserve
Wishing I could find a way to wash away the past
Knowing that my heart will break, but at least the pain will last

I die each time you look away
My heart, my life, will never be the same
This love will take my everything
One breath, one touch, will be the end of me

Emily will find a better place to fall asleep
Maybe she will save me in the oceans of her dream
And maybe someday love
Maybe someday love
