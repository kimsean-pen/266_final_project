It is the black veil we all wear behind our eyes.
A consuming darkness eats our insides.
Dull bleak and blind, my sweet love despair.
It grows inside like a hidden deformity.
Smiles on the outside.
Desperation within unstoppable insatiable.
Why can't we see it in each other?
We could keep sorrow at bay.
Broken hearts in broken hands.
We could take your pain away.
It shouldn't have to be this way.

We suffer endless horizons until we can't suffer anymore.
Comfort waits cold and peaceful at death's side.
We don't blame you.
