Flossin' so hard, I'm the shit, watch me going
Think I'm too young to be good, I'ma show them
Baguette's so big on my wrist, they ain't swollen
E63, yes, my whip; yeah, I own that

I don't care someone else is calling me
I'ma do it my way
It don't matter, I don't this for free
So be it, I'm the boss, bitch
Ooh-ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh-ohh
When I want it, want it
I want it, want it (I want it, want it)
Ooh-ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh-ohh
When I want it, want it
Don't check the price, I just swipe that

Swipe that (Swipe that)

Y'all dumb if you think I'm gonna give you some
Y'all tripping
Y'all dumb if you think I'm gonna give you some
Y'all tripping (Y'all tripping)

Bank accounts run deep up like Geneva
My hips they move, I see them giving you a fever
And I don't care if you calling me a diva
And by the end this I'm make you a believer
I don't care someone else is calling me
I'ma do it my way
It don't matter, I don't this for free
So be it, I'm the boss, bitch
Ooh-ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh-ohh
When I want it, want it
I want it, want it (I want it, want it)

On me, I'ma spend a couple of commas
Yo' see no lies, I'm just being honest
I don't care, I don't care what the cost is
I'ma swipe it up, I'ma swipe it down
On me, I'ma spend a couple of commas
Yo' see no lies, I'm just being honest
