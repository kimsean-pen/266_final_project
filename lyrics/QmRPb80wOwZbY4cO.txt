And all our sins
Come back to haunt us in the end
To hang around and tap us on the shoulder
And smile silent
It's all implied
You'll die trying to live this down
You might as well forget it
Still I'm convinced
Wondering what if is the worst thing there is

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
Drove back home and slept a few days
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be

And all these lines fall short of what I had in mind
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling
So I just try
Fail and try and try again
Someday I swear I'm going to get it
Because I'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
Drove back home and slept a few days
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be

We'll get over it
Sad, strong, safe, and sober
We'll move forward
And know where we went wrong
But you can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
Drove back home and slept a few days
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be
