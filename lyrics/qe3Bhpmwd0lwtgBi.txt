king
of swords
no love
love is gone
you take
away
away
give pain
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and he takes
and he takes
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
and you take
from my heart
you know
you seem very very far
it's like i don't even know who you are
king of swords
no love
love is gone
