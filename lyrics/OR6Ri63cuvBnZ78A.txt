Way out here, working on the docks
Everyone sees the long day through
Well what would I do without the nights?
And the phone and the chance just to talk to you
Oh what would I do now, hey, just to talk to you?
A thousand miles away

What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight or someday
When times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes you're what I miss, every little kiss
Every little one, every little one

Everybody here's a number, not a name
But I guess that's all right with me
As I sit alone after a long day
In the absence of company
Oh I let my mind wander, hey yea
A thousand miles away

What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight or someday
When times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes you're what I miss, every little kiss
Every little one, every little one, hey yea

Hey hey
What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight or someday
When times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes you're what I miss, every little kiss
Every little one, every little one, hey hey
