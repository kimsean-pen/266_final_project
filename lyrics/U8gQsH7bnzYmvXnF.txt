I don't want to feel alone
But I don't just cause I'm on my own
As I am walking home

I got a song on my mind that only I know
So I'm gonna hum it one more time
Yeah you know to really make it mine
Whatever it takes to engrave this line

It's the only thing that may make me feel fine
Oh my heart keeps on dancing
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Even though you are already gone
Oh my heart, oh my heart
And I got my own tune for it to sing along
I do not want it to march no one else's drum

Oh my heart, oh my heart
So I get well again
Yeah right up and about again

Cautious knows once caution goes
Sticks and stones might brake the bones
But soft matter's different all along
I'm safe and sound, there's nothing wrong

And as I am coming home
I got a song on my mind that only I know
Oh my heart keeps on dancing
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Even though you are already gone
Oh my heart, oh my heart
And I got my own tune for it to sing along

I do not want it to march no one else's drum
Oh my heart, oh my heart
And from time to time it skips a beat
From time to time I feel it stumble

Yeah from time to time I'm getting weak
And from time to time my rhythm's tumbling
You might pick me up
You might turn me on
You might take me in and make me dance along
You might make it good
Feel like it should
But then again when you'll be gone
