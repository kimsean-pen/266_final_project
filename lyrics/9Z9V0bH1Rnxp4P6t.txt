Still speaks the silence
It speaks in riddles to my mind
And time keeps passing by
As I walk tearful through this life

Dreams pass by silently
I see them waving back at me
All hope is long since gone
I guess it really never was there at all
A mirage passed on

I know the darkness will break me
And you can not save me
Can't catch my fall
I feel the sorrow embrace me
This life depraves me
I'm lost forevermore

My life darkens year by year
And no one seems to really care
My fear always lingers here
It's growing stronger deep inside of me
It won't set me free

I know the darkness will break me
And you can not save me
Can't catch my fall
I feel the sorrow embrace me
This life depraves me
I'm lost forevermore

Tears shed in silence
They run in rivers down my face
And what am I still living for
I can not take this pain no more
