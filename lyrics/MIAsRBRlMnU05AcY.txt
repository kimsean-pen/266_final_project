Firework night, coffee or wine
In paper cups, when the power cut
At the edge of town, there's a silent crowd
They blocked off the road, nowhere to go

They say it's a Blood drive
Warnings from on high, sparks in the dead night
I hope your book is right
Blood drive, thunderous light
From the church to the bunker
I lost you in the running crowd
Blood drive, pastor Eli and St.Peter deny
They're afraid of the needle
Blood Drive, ammunition and tin cans
Red and white arm bands
I felt dizzy at the sight

When the white horse runs
And the helicopter comes
When the beasts are at the door
And from the heavens noxious creatures pour...

Then you know it's a Blood drive
Warnings from on high, sparks in the dead night
I hope your book is right
Blood drive, thunderous light
From the church to the bunker
I lost you in the running crowd
Blood drive, pastor Eli and St.Peter deny
They're afraid of the needle
Blood Drive, ammunition and tin cans
Red and white arm bands
I felt dizzy at the sight
I felt dizzy at the sight
