Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me know what Spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with joy
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
