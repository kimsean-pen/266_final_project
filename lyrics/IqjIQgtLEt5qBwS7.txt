Lost in my boots
Safe in my room
Under the covers
They smell like you
All of my time
All of my days
All that I treasured
Lost in the maze

Caught in confusion
Caught in a daze
Caught in the memory of yesterday
Gone with the river
Gone with the rain
Gone is the reason that I called your name

I thought that maybe we'd come to see better days
Fooled by the rapture of love, what a shame, what a shame

All of your fictional ways
Master of play, master of play
Endlessly fixed on your gaze
Fixed on your gaze, fixed on your gaze

Lost in my boots
Safe in my room
Under the covers
They smell like you
All of my time
All of my days
All that I treasured
Lost in the maze

Caught in confusion
Caught in a daze
Caught in the memory of yesterday
Gone with the river
Gone with the rain
Gone is the reason that I called your name

I held you higher than my own happiness, nooo
But you felt the need to come between our arrangements, ooh

All of your fictional ways
Master of play, master of play
Endlessly fixed on your gaze
Fixed on your gaze, fixed on your gaze
(Tell me why you do it)

Lost in my boots
Safe in my room
Under the covers
They smell like you
All of my time
All of my days
All that I treasured
Lost in the maze

Caught in confusion
Caught in a daze
Caught in the memory of yesterday
Gone with the river
Gone with the rain
Gone is the reason that I called your name

I called your name
Reason that I called your name
I called your name
