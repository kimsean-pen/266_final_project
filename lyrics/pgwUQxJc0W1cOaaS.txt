ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh
ooh ooh ooh ooh oh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh

You never deliver
In the times when I need you
If you're tired from the day
I don't blame you
But still I need you to follow through

Late at night
You and I never work out quite right

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh
ooh ooh ooh ooh oh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh

You never want me to do anything
And when I'm in the mood I think you're pretty rude
When I'm full of energy you don't see me
I'm trying to be serious and you're just laughing

Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right

I'm getting better at listening
But I don't know where you go late at night
And when I've moved along
You suddenly can't seem to get enough of what we had

Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
Late at night
You and I never work out quite right
