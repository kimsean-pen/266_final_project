Checking my heart again
It's still beating
Greyer than winter days
The clouds in my head

All my life
Been changing lanes
I'm so bored of taking my chances
Of making mistakes

Now I need to surrender
Oh I want to surrender

Years in a concrete box
TV, vodka shots
Breaking my knees in stage
Repeat and get up again

All my life I've been changing lanes
I'm so bored of taking my chances
I'm making mistakes
Now I need to surrender
Oh I want to surrender

The freaks are dying
Where did we go Berlin?

All my life I've been changing lanes
I'm so bored of taking my chances
I'm. I'm making mistakes
Now I need
I want
To surrender
