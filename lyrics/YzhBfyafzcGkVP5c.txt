Calling other sounds
You out there on the seas
Today is dull and mild
On a stroppy little island
Of mixed up people

Did you hear the story?
Of violent behaviour
The episodes get sent around
Everyone

Give us sordid details
Tie them to the main sail
The drum and gun
Of estatedom
Very near

Living in magazines
Not looking for a reason
Why people stand on their own
In the night on the scrubs

Calling other sounds
You out there on the seas
Today is dull and mild
On a stroppy little island
Of mixed up people

Some of us find
To give it all your all
Rises up the land
And nothing going to hold you down

Not going to be a victim
Not going to be a victim
Not going to be a victim

Oh it's alright
Everything jolly
Running up the hill
On a stroppy little island of mixed up people

Some of us find
To give it all your all
Rises up the land
And nothing going to hold you down
