Everyone who wanna be a star
Soon or later
Lose your mind, forgetting who you are
It sounds unreal

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Real
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Never forget
Had I known I'd ever be a star
I would have chilled
Look at all the people in the bars
They all look thrilled

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Real
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Only needed to be someone
That you're proud of
For real
Only wanted to sing a tune you would love
For real
I didn't want it like Prince
I didn't want to be The Beatles

I never thought I'd ever be a star
But now it's real
Need a stop before it goes too far
And disappear

Oh I just need a real friend
I'm done with all you green admirers
Who follow me just like a trend
And make me feel down down

To everyone who wanna be a star
It's like a deal
Do your best but forget who you are
Make it all clean

Oh I don't have real problems
I'm just a radio girl
And I know that I can't complain
I'd better calm down down

Only needed to be someone
That you're proud of
For real
Only wanted to sing a tune you would love
For real
I didn't want it like Prince
I didn't want to be The Beatles
