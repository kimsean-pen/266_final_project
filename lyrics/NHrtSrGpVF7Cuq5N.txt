Speak to the wild
reach the for wire
protect your child
from empty empire

the king has come to join the band

remove your wings
and meet us near the fire
extinguish things
of earthly desire

the king has come to meet the band
the king has come with no demand

don't let the dark get you lost
your free will has come in fire and frost

speak to the wild
reach for the wire
protect your child
from empty empire

the king has come to join the band

remove your wings
and meet us near the fire
extinguish things
of earthly desire

the king has come to meet the band
the king has come with no demand

don't let the dark get you lost
your free will has come in fire and frost
