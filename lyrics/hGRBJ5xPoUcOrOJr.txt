I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, and it had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
The British Museum, it lost its charm

How long I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles, it hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town, the sun was shining everywhere
