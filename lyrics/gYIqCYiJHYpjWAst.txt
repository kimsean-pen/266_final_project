Oh, I see what you do
But I can do it better
And the talk of the town be true
That I'll make you forget her

How can you hate something that you ain't ever tried?
You've got to lose control most every night
Yeah, you've seen what they do?
Well, we can do it better, yeah, I'm talkin' to you

You've got to feel it, see it, know how much you need it
What's the point in livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to use it, lose it, know that you still do it
What's the point in livin' if you don't wanna dance?

Oh, I know life is hard
So we'll live it for the weekend
You can hurt or take heart
I guess it really depends

What's the point in worryin' about being cool
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you in school?
I don't believe what they say
We just want tomorrow to be better than today

You've got to feel it, see it, know how much you need it
What's the point in livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to use it, lose it, know that you still do it
What's the point in livin' if you don't wanna dance?

You've got to feel it, see it, know how much you need it
What's the point in livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to use it, lose it, know that you still do it
What's the point in livin' if you don't wanna dance?

Fabrications complicate the world in a web
Too much useless information plays with your head
Very clever people know we all need a chance
To stop our clever busyness and let go and dance

You've got to use it, lose it, know that you still do it
What's the point in livin' if you don't wanna dance?
You've got to feel it, see it, know how much you need it
What's the point in livin' if you don't take a chance?

You've got to use it, lose it, know that you still do it
What's the point in livin' if you don't wanna dance?

Oh-oh, oh-oh, everybody
Everybody wanna dance now
Oh-oh, oh-oh, everybody
Everybody wanna dance now
