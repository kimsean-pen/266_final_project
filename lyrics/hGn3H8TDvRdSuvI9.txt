Don't make a sound, it's time to throw it into lock down
Watch me knock down this mess
That I've got myself into for a small commission
I'll show you how
If you just get off the ground
You've got to move a little faster

To make it out of this disaster
Before you get factored out
Turn the page, another line I should have saved
But who's to say that you wouldn't be blown away
'Cause you've always been blown away
Anchor, come and drag me down, before I take the dive

(I'll take what I can get)

Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive

Call off the search, there's been no sign for and days
And theres no way to say for sure if less is more

I'm sweating out the fever that's been spreading on the dance floor
Pick your feet up on the ground
You got to move a little faster
Faster to make it out of this disaster

Will you last or will you fall to your knees
Turn the page, another line I should have saved
But who's to say that you wouldn't be blown away

'Cause you've always been blown away
Anchor, come and drag me down, before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
At first with all the weight of all this pressure I was fine
But now I feel like I have buried myself alive
Drag me out and push me down
But hurry up before the surface freezes over now
I'm going to drown
I'm going down without a sound
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Anchor, come and drag me down
Before I take the dive
Anchor, come and drag me down before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Leave me for dead, I always said you'd find me in over my head
Now you can take it literal instead
I'm bringing it back
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
Before I take the dive
(I'll take what I can get)
Anchor, drag me down before I take the dive
