You say that I'm too complicated.
Hung up and miseducated.
Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated,
and we all fall down.

I can't sleep cause my mind keeps racing.
And my chest hurts cause my heart keeps breaking.
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking,
and we all fall down.

Frustration, desperation.
You say you need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Desperation, permanent vacation.

Heyy!
And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So lets sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

Voices coming through the speaker.
And they can't make me a believer.
I know that I'm an underachiever,
and we're all so proud.

Watch out, I think we're going under.
Right now, we're just another number.
Get out, the system's overcrowded
and we're all so proud.

Frustration, desperation.
They say I need some kinda medication.
Situation, no motivation.
Destination, permanent vacation.

Hey!
And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.
So I'll sing this one more time.
It goes,
destination, permanent vacation.

And I'm doing fine,
and I know I'm out of line.

It goes,

Congratulations, your imitations.
I can't get over the radio stations.
Corperations, calculations.
We're the voice of the new generation.
