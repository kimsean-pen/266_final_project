Oh I hoped that you were somebody
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt

Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
Calling out your name
Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
Calling out your name

Calling out your name
Now I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea then ran aground

They said I once lost but now I'm truly found
And I know the place but not the way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me
Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Stay with me
Stay with me

Then you threw your heart away
Oh, I know just what to say
Through the phone cord; it can wait

We've still got time to say
And I know you ran away
Oh, I know but I'm feeling okay
But now I found love and the feeling won't go
Now I found love but the feeling won't go
See you walk away
Feeling okay now
Happy now?

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
