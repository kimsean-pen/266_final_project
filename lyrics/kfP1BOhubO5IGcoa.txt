Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together, all your life

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we loving each other
Then we're fighting one another, all the time

When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me, they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation

So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got, when all I needed was some love and affection

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together, all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure

When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

Where are the answers that we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world to be sure of, anymore
Some days, you're feeling good
Some days, you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad

Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better, for worse
So, let's make the best of the rest of our years

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together, all your life
Pain and pleasure

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together, all your life
All your life
