Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change, 'cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love

No other thing that's as precious too
(No other, there's no other)
Than a heart that's real and a heart that's true
Something that you got to know

This girl, (don't need diamonds so bright)
This girl, (don't need money, all right)
This girl, (just got to hold me all night)
You'll never buy my love

These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love

You buy me this and you buy me that
(To win over, win me over)
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Something that you got to know

This girl, (don't need diamonds so bright)
This girl, (don't need money, all right)
This girl, (just got to hold me all night)
You'll never buy my love

Will you realise when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
It's a shame but I got to go
There's something that you'll never know

This girl, (don't need diamonds so bright)
This girl, (don't need money, all right)
This girl, (just got to hold me all night)
You'll never buy my love

This girl, (don't need diamonds so bright)
This girl, (don't need money, all right)
This girl, (just got to hold me all night)
You'll never buy my love
