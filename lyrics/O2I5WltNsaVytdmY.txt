Go
Or it's never gonna matter at all
Go
'Cause they're coming, oh they're coming to call
Go now
While you
Still can
Go before the coming of dawn
On and on
'Cause they're coming
Oh they're coming and it's never gonna matter at all

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore
(You never talk about it anymore)

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
(No you never talk about it)
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore
(You never talk about it anymore)

Go
And you're running just as fast as you can
Go
Running faster than you ever ran
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go before the coming of dawn
On and on
And you never turn your head
You never turn your head, you never turn it

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
(No you never talk about it)
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore
(You never talk about it anymore)

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
(No you never talk about it)
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore
(You never talk about it anymore)

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore

You never woken with a cold sweat
No you never talk about it
You never talk about it
(You never talk about it)
You never talk about it anymore

You never woken with a cold sweat
