Out of the darkness
I sparked a match that set the fire
Hear the wind talking
It's stirring up my bad desires
My love is leaving
Before the lightning hits the ground
While I'm looking forward
My mind is moving backwards now

Lo-ove, my love, volcanic lo-o-ove
Lo-ove, my love, volcanic lo-o-ove

You're burning me up
Tell me you feel it now
You're burning me up
I know you need it now
Lo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove
Lo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove

I get the feeling
You worry 'bout me way too much
Caught in the moment
We love what can't be good for us
And I've been sinking
Into my sheets alone at night
Under the ashes
The heat you left just won't subside

You're burning me up
Tell me you feel it now
You're burning me up
I know you need it now
Lo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove
Lo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove

Under the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes
I'm on fire, baby
Under the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

You're burning me up
Tell me you feel it now
You're burning me up
I know you need it now
Lo-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove
Lo-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove

Lo-ove
(I know you need it)
Lo-ove
(I know you need it)
Lo-ove
(You're burning me up)
Lo-ove
(You're burning me up)
Lo-ove
(You're burning me up)
Lo-ove
(You're burning me up)
Lo-ove
Under the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes
I'm on fire, baby
