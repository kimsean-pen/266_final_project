wee, (laughter)
hurry up, no
hurry up, huh

it started like a stone
i grew it out but then i rested it
i found sweet road
it came announced on the right
i left my purse but found the road

i'm tainted in a patchy problem
none can tell what i can tell ya
let them eagles have good times
it's a road and not a soda

i found sweet road,
i found sweet road

it started like a stone
i grew it out but then i rested it
i found sweet road
it came out of us on the right
i left my purse but found the road
