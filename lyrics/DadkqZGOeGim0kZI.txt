if I pretend, would you care, would you notice?
we don't talk much anymore
"How was your day?", why would you even ask that?
I know you're not listening at all
if l just left, would you swear, that you'd notice?
we don't talk much anymore
take a deep breath, it wont last, you're the last boy
she won't remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)

tum up and slow, in the dark of the side road,
I ask what you think you've seen
if we could swap, do you think, it could last long?
I still feel you moving underneath
if I just left, would you swear, that you'd notice?
we don't talk much anymore
take a deep breath, it wont last, you're the last boy
she wont remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)
no, She wouldn't remember you at all
(at all)
