Six in the morning
Everyone's coming down
Whatever we're taking
Everyone's running out

God is coming
No one called for me
God is coming
He don't remember me

Life's gonna break us down
Time's running out
Is the world ending?
Life's gonna break us down
I say softly to myself
"Fuck your Armageddon"

I wasn't worried before I was born
Why would I worry after I'm gone
With a head full of this smoke
That don't help none

Six in the morning
Everyone's coming down
Whatever we're taking
Everyone's running out

God is coming
He don't remember me

Life's gonna break us down
Time's running out
Is the world ending?
Life's gonna break us down
I say softly to myself
"Fuck your Armageddon"

I try not to worry at night
For peace on earth, peace in my mind
The bullets and the blood
Bring me down
I try not to worry at night
For peace on earth, for peace of mind
Telling myself
It's not so bad to die in your sleep
