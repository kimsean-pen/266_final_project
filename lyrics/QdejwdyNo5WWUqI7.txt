Yeah, yeah, that's the one
Plastic city
Picture box, service screens, static
One, two
Yeah

Conspiring in secrecy
My ghouls drag chains and exchange
theories on other spooks and black books
Sad souls known to grab loose and handles
They hypnotized by the truth, horrific daily news
Ears ringing from eerie noises, anti-vessels make the loudest
TV hosts invading living rooms like haunted houses
Spewing words without content, spoken out of context
I breathe deep, inhale the sweet perfume of the dead
The ghosts that haunt my spirit hide amidst some petty showers
To purify the self I throw my fears in burning fires
Desperate times call desperate measures, but situations dire
Tower over furnaces unburnt and demons cower
But the world spins, or it seems to
Watch the heavens wonder if the gods and us can be equals
Stars circle the planet, like followers to Akaba
Universal in breath directs the flow of prana
I'm folding cosmic sagas in the gallows
Where my shadow reigns supreme
Diana with the bow, the protectors of all thieves
Still, beating hearts bump chests and leave static on the screen
I live in frequencies, where strange schools of sorcery meet

Turn it on, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off
May the rhythm bring peace to your bubbling heart
Find the inner space of night, the most cosmic of sparks
The firefly that shines like the sun and lights up the dark
Turn it on, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off
May the rhythm bring peace to your bubbling heart
Find the inner space of night, the most cosmic of sparks
The firefly that shines like the sun and lights up the dark

Hark, the herald angel sings, melodies and harp strings
Rather stay blind to mass-appeal than kill the art for it
So, rhyme-books, they poison with the arsenic
Scribble lines of plots and twists confounding neurologists
Deepen my delirium, I'll write breathing little puns
Hissing sounds as they release, purge God from bitter nuns
Smoking guns, my lyrics areâ€”dense, the dark attest
They give the same sensation that sinking does
Gills are deficient, navigating watery worlds
Clouds of emotional words hang over my head like a curse
I dig through sentiment like rubble
They say, "Woman is a fish that shows
herself most when the waters are troubled"
In this no-man's-land, culture hazardous
Protect neck and self with magic amulets,
silent answers does Holding heavy hearts like Anubis
Consumed by anger, self-confusing who the activist
Only one stage down in the gallows
Where my shadow reigns supreme
Beauty for the hideous, I'm a savage and a beast
Of the stormiest of temperaments
Of waves of manic springs
Blakrok like the runners go in the east

Turn it on, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off
May the rhythm bring peace to your bubbling heart
Find the inner space of night, the most cosmic of sparks
The firefly that shines like the sun and lights up the dark
Turn it on, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off
May the rhythm bring peace to your bubbling heart
Find the inner space of night, the most cosmic of sparks
The firefly that shines like the sun and lights up the dark
