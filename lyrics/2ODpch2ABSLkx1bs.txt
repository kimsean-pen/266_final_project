I thought I should talk, man, I guess I need to listen
When she got caught in this world that she didn't even think
The wool that hides the wolf inside sheep's clothing
Could be so soft, and now she's on the brink

Over the autumn fields, across the water
Under the starry cloak of night

Blue light, baby won't you light me a lantern
It's been too many hours since I last saw your pretty face
if a night is dark but if I don't see it when the man turns
his human bark into another place

Sometimes drinking I feel so happy but then
I can't remember why
I feel sad all over again
Sometimes drinking I
don't know my best friend for my best friend

Broken on the drum, an ancient ancient arrow
his people cold, swept onto the tender plain
and slow by slow by slow by slower than slow
unto the open houses brought by the children of joseph came

Play songs by the fire a while
Here are stories my child
Don't you feel like a train chugging, train chugging
In my head
Oh and now I know who I really really am
I, I'm going to stay on track
still I can't lose myself, I'm haunted
by the sound
click clack click clack

Yes and now I know who I really am
I, I'm going to stay on track

Still I cant really lose myself, I'm haunted
By the sound
click clack click clack

I thought I should talk, man, I guess I need to listen
When she got caught in this world that she didn't even think
the wool that hides the wolf inside sheep's clothing
could be so soft, now she's on the brink
