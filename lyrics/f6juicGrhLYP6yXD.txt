Rushing through 30
Getting older every day by two
Drawing pictures of innocent times
Can you add colour inside these lines?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't let live in a dream one more day

Sure, it would change my perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't let live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't let live in a dream one more day
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day
Take me somewhere
Don't let live in a dream one more day
