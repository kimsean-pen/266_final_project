into your tomb,
i've had enough of you
cause i'm tired of playing the fool
not another kiss from you
i'll throw a rose to cover up your face
cause i'm tired of waiting for you
you're the reason that i had lost faith
in dreams of dreams i can't live in
i want to run from the rumors that are true
you want to run from the rumors that are true
don't be so rude,
i've had enough of you
cause i'm tired of feeling confused
not another kiss from you
i'll throw a rose to celebrate your end
but when you rise from the dead
i will love you again
