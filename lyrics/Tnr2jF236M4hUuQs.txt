What's this?
Don't bother listing your dependancies.
We already know that you've got them.
You've photographed the bottom glass
and it tastes like fear.
You're afraid of what might be.

You know from the get go it's over
it's already fallen apart.

Identify what's yours and what's mine,
the rest will be our secret.

I won't apologize for what is right I'm just letting go
of what might've been.

You know from the get go it's over
it's already fallen apart.

You know from get go it's over
it's already meant from the start
and you know from get go
it's already fallen apart.

You know in time as much would've happened to us,
our feelings blow out like a lamp light.
