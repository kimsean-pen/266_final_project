I gotta take
I wanna do all the day through
Slow love

You are all of me
And all that you're showin' me
Is so beyond belief
I'm livin' a dream

Baby, take it to another level tonight
Express our lovin' in the music
Baby don't you realize that this is the time
That I am yours and you will be all mine

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Freeze this moment, please
Don't wanna get it out of my head
Can't control the heat
When our bodies meet

Baby, take it to another level tonight
So excited I'm beyond control
Baby don't you realize that this is the time
Didn't you know it, didn't you know it?

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Do you believe it
Is this a dream?
Yeah, is it time, baby?
This is it

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
