gasoline, lemonade in the latest cream
wash on wax off to a different scheme.
laminate your mind as though you need it
psycho killer says it makes your shadow seem grey.
why you late in this race
it's like delay over your face
it's like you made no way
it's like you made ok.

Chorus.
i'm gonna im gonna get free this time
i'm gonna im gonna give you all my love
i'm gonna get free this time
i'm gonna im gonna give you all my love
i'm gonna... im gonna... im gonna give gonna give you all my love i'm gonna give gonna give u all my love
i'm gonna give im gonna give u all my love

i'm gonna hang around and watch when you get shot in flames
i'll let you wear my cape
recycle this if you're making the man
get a big red slap from his big white hands
recycle this if you're breaking the ban let your girlfriend do what your boyfriend can't

chorus.
