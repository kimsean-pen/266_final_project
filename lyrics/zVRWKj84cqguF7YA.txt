A little tough love never hurt nobody
Never saw this coming inside of me
I won't be ignored baby, sure let's talk it out
It wasn't too hard to see

You think you got me right where you want me
You think you've got the whole story
But I think that a proper fair warning
Might've served you well, so I'm here to tell you

It's not too late to do yourself a favor and walk away
Though I know that's never been your nature
By the way you put yourself in danger 'cause you're
Playing with my heart, playing with my heart
Playing with my heart

Every good girl's got a real good reason
To believe in breaking all the rules sometimes
Well, I'm that girl, baby you're that reason
And you see it's caused me to cross the line

You lie, but I'm a pretty good liar
You chose a game I can play better
You're bright, oh but baby I'm clever
So you might as well let me tell you

It's not too late to do yourself a favor and walk away
Though I know that's never been your nature
By the way you put yourself in danger 'cause you're
Playing with my heart, playing with my heart
Playing with my heart

For heaven's sakes what are you thinking, baby?
You won't catch what you've been chasing
Trust me when I say I'll keep you running
I'm not coming, no I won't come around

It's not too late to do yourself a favor and walk away
Though I know that's never been your nature
By the way you put yourself in danger 'cause you're
Playing with my heart, playing with my heart
Playing with my heart
