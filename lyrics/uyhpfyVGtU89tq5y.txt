Hmm... hmm... hmm...
(ooh-ooh...)
Sunshine blue skies please go away
My girl has found another and gone... away
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom

So day after day I stay locked up in my room
(ooh-ooh-ooh... ooh... ooh) I know to you it might sound strange but I wish it would rain
Oh how I wish that it would rain
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
(such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen I got to cry 'cause crying eases (pain-pain-pain) the pain oh yeah
(ooh-ooh-ooh... ooh... ooh) People this hurt I feel inside words they could never explain

I just wish it would rain
Oh how I wish that it would rain
Oh let it rain rain-rain-rain
Oh how I wish that it would rain
Ooh... baby
Let it rain (let it rain) oh... yeah let it rain
Day in day out my tear stained face pressed against the window pane

My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops

And no one will ever know that I'm crying (crying) crying (crying) when I go outside
(ooh-ooh-ooh... ooh... ooh) To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
Ooh I wish it would rain...
Oh how I wish that it would rain...
Ooh... baby
(let it rain) Let it rain (let it rain) let it rain...
(let it rain)

(rain-rain-rain-rain) I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh... let it rain (let it rain)
(let it rain) Oh... yeah-yeah listen (let it rain)
(rain-rain-rain-rain) I'm a man and I've got my pride
'Til it rains I'm gonna stay inside
(let it rain) Let it rain
