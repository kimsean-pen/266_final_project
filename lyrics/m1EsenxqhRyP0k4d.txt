My lady story
My lady story

My lady story
Is one of annihilation
My lady story
Is one of breast amputation

My lady story
My lady story

I'm a hole in love
I'm a bride on fire
I am twisted
Into a starve of wire

My lady story
My lady story

Lie in road for you
And I've been your slave
My womb's an ocean full of
Grief and rage

My lady story
My lady story
My lady story
My lady story

And still you're coaxing me
To come on out and live
Well I'm a crippled dog
I've got nothing to give

My lady story
My lady story
My lady story
My lady story

I'm so broken babe
But I want to see
Some shining eye
Some of my beauty
My lostest beauty
My lostest beauty
