Zeroes harvesting the gallows
And distances to braid the best of ropes
How many masks? How many speeches
For those you'll never see speak?
For those we know too well to meet
Millions of diagrams cover the walls
We count and locked the doors
Who the fuck defines the justice?
In a land of cheatery

Before we all have to wear the blue
The blues in you, it talks to you
Now is the time to listen
We lost the memory
And crawl in the dark
Funny how time always leaves its mark
And how shame seems to vanish
We cherish the values
That show their limits
When you ain't got to chose
To find the force to quit
Now is the time to listen
To silence all the numbers, finally
To resurrect the names
And dignify the pain
Finally

Graphics hiding
Weary shoes and critics
To quantify the pain
