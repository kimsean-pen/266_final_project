No way to get you out of this
I'll do it on my own
I'll be the world of tenderness
The one you yearn for

But, baby, now you know that
It isn't hard to see
When you're calling out
I can not resist

Baby, if you walk with me
I'm gonna set you free
Free from all of your misery,
Misery yeah-yea

She will never have the power
To control no more, You'll see
If you fall in love with me

Let me be, let me be
Just open your heart to me
Let me be, let me be

Oh! Let me be, Let me be
Just open your heart to me
Let me be, let me be

Nobody wants to be alone
A heart can not resist
The power of desire to
Be loved and kissed
Whatever happens on from now
It isn't only you
Who's gonna struggle all the way
I'm gonna help you through
There will be no longer
Be a place for all her spells
I'm gonna shatter them,
Shatter them, oh yeah

All the clouds are gonna vanish
From within your skies
If you make me your ally

Let me be, let me be
Just open your heart to me
Let me be, let me be
Let me be, Let me be
Just open your heart to me
Let me be, let me be
Let me be, let me be
To get you out of all your fears
Let me be, let me be
