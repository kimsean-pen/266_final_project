It's the simple things
Morning routine
Make me come undone
Makes me come undone

And you'll never look back at the sun 'cause it's always shining
And he'll never be the one 'cause he's always climbing
And you'll never look back at the sun 'cause it's always shining
And he'll never be the one 'cause he's always climbing

Never take for granted
I'm always there if you want it

And you'll never look back at the sun 'cause it's always shining
And he'll never be the one 'cause he's always climbing
And you'll never look back at the sun 'cause it's always shining
And he'll never be the one 'cause he's always climbing
And you'll never look back at the sun 'cause it's always shining
And he'll never be the one 'cause he's always climbing

Oh, ooh, oh, the places you'll go
Make me come undone, oh
Do I satisfy this dangerous
Never good enough for you and I
But the possibility keeps us alive
