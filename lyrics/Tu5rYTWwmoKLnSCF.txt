Losing my focus
I'm out of my ways and I know it
But there's no one else can do what we do, yeah
And I can't control it
Kept playing these games, now I'm folding
Like something keeps pulling me closer to you
No I can't be myself, not if I ever pulled away
It's like I need your help
I need your body next to me

Skin on skin, lips on lips
We both spend our nights like this
No escaping from your love
Look what you've done
Guess close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
Even with your hands all over my body
It's making me want more of your touch
'Cause close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
So give me all of you, give me what I need baby
What I need, and I got what you want

Yeah
Body like a bottle, yeah (woo)
I need you today and tomorrow, yeah (aye)
Yeah, baby lets not waste time (aye, yeah)
We just need some FaceTime, ay ooh
Girl you know I'm busy but I make time, ay ooh
Skin on skin and kisses on your waistline, ay ooh
Problem with yo' ass you never take time
Round one, round two we don't need no break time, aye
We can get it 60 minutes
If you with it then I'm with it
First you finish then I finish
Then we get right back up in it, aye
Girl you know I fall with you, aye
Come in close and make me fall in love with you

Skin on skin, lips on lips
We both spend our nights like this
No escaping from your love
Look what you've done
Guess close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
Even with your hands all over my body
It's making me want more of your touch
'Cause close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
So give me all of you, give me what I need baby
What I need and I got what you want

Close ain't close ain't, close enough
Close enough, close enough

Skin on skin, lips on lips
We both spend our nights like this
No escaping from your love
Look what you've done
Guess close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
Even with your hands all over my body
It's making me want more of your touch
'Cause close ain't close enough (close ain't close enough)
So give me all of you, give me what I need baby
What I need, and I got what you want
