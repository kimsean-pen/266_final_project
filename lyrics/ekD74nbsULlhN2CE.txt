You never thought you would be with me now.
I never thought I'd be like you wow.
You never thought I'd grow up in this dirty elegance.
Rot away in this dirty elegance.
I'm going out cause I don't wanna be here.
I'm staying down because I don't wanna be there.
I'm coming? up but I won't be.
And everyone's gonna see me.
I never go down cause I'll get another bag and if I don't smoke no more.
Thats what I gotta live with, thats why I gotta see this.
