He was standin' by the highway
With a sign that just said "mother"
When he heard a driver comin'
'bout a half a mile away
Then he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by bolder dam that day
He was raised up in milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singin' songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in boulder I don't know

It was out in arizona
That he heard the lady listenin'
To each word that he was sayin'
To each line that he would write

So he sat down by her table and
They talked about the weather
Ninety-eight point six and risin'
Down by boulder dam that day

And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the mornin' sun
Back in boulder he had told her
"i don't know when I had a better friend"

Now he's traded off his martin
But his troubles are not over
For his feet are almost frozen
And the sun is sinkin' low
Won't you listen to me brother
If you ever loved your mother
Please pull off on the shoulder
If you're goin' milwaukee way
It's ten degrees and getting colder
Down by boulder dam today
