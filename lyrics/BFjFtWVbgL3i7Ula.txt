Sometimes you look at you and the face you see's not who you want to be
Everybody's got it together or at least that's what it seems

You try to be like, why you try to be like
Whatever they like, I know what it feels like
Can't keep you up all night, don't let them tell you how to live your life

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

Yeah if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

oh-oh, oh-oh, funny how it looks when you switch the roles
oh-oh, oh-oh, never know what's underneath until it gets exposed

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

She may look better than you, but, come on, she's vain, she doesn't have a
Brain
His pants hang lower than yours but he stumbles when he tries to run, noo

You try to be like why you try to be like
Whatever they like I know what it feels like
Can't keep you up all night don't let them tell you how to live your life

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

Yeah if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

oh-oh, oh-oh, funny how it looks when you switch the roles
oh-oh, oh-oh, never know what's underneath until it gets exposed

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

Who cares, what everybody's thinking, no no
Who cares, sometimes it's cool to be uncool
Who cares, if their ship is sinking
It really doesn't matter, 'cause only you know what's good for you

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

Yeah if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits

oh-oh, oh-oh, funny how it looks when you switch the roles
oh-oh, oh-oh, never know what's underneath until it gets exposed

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in their birthday suits
Imagine everybody in their birthday suits
