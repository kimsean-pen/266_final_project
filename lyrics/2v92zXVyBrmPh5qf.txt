He misses DH like he misses school
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
I'd drink the Devil's water any time with you
He misses DH like he misses school
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
I'd drink the Devil's water any time with you
And it is easy when you're older to figure out
the things that do and do not work
Like my temper
Like me and you in the back of my car
I've got eyes like an eagle but a heart like a lion
And the drugs from your mom's car
Sittin' on the sidewalk
Everyone 'round here is just sittin' on the sidewalk
Everybody here is just sitting on the sidewalk
Well I've got bills to pay
There are hearts to break
I've got towns to see
There are towns to see
But you were head over, over heels for you
And I was head over, over heels for me
And this was head over, over heels downhill
And it's been head over, over heels for weeks
But you were head over, over heels for you
And I was head over, over heels for me
And this was head over, over heels downhill
And it's been head over, over heels for weeks
But you were head over, over heels for you
And I was head over, over heels for me
And this was head over, over heels downhill
And it's been head over, over heels for weeks
And it is easy when you're older to figure out
the things that do and do not work
oh...
And you were never the problem,
I was always the problem
And you were never the problem,
And I was always the problem
Remember middle school friends and the way you laughed
when we drank on the back of the porch to my house
And my mom tried to find
All the beer that we hid
And I turned to you then and said
Let's make this last to the end
Hey Matt, how's Japan? I bet it's really rad
Hey Josh, how's the drugs? I bet they treat you the same
I'll dig up your graves without skin on my bones
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
Hey Matt, how's Japan? I bet it's really rad
Hey Josh, how's the drugs? I bet they treat you the same
I'll dig up your graves without skin on my bones
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like Devil's water
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like Devil's water
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like Devil's water
He's got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like the Devil's water
I got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like the Devil's water
I got blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like the Devil's water
blue eyes like the Devil's water
