You've got the blood on your hands, I think it's my own
We can go down to the streets and follow the shores
Of all the people, we could be two
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home

You've got blue blood on your hands, I know it's my own
You came at me in the midnight to show me my soul
Of all the people, I hoped it'd be you
To come and free me, take me away
To show me my home
Where I was born
Where I belong

You've got blue blood on your hands, I want you to know
I hoped you'd come and take me away, back to my home
Of all the people, it had to be you
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home

You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
To my home

You've got blue blood on your hands, I know it's my own
You came at me in the midnight to show me my soul

You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
To my home

Come with me accept it, affect it, protect it (You showed me)
Come with me accept it, so now you know (Where to go, to my home)
Come with me accept it, effect it, protect it (To my home, so take me)
Come with me accept it, so now you know (Through the roads that you know, to my home)

You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know (You know, you know...)
You know
To my home

So take me through the roads
That you know where you know
You showed me where to go to my home

Come with me accept it, affect it, protect it
Come with me accept it, so now you know
Come with me accept it, effect it, protect it
Come with me accept it, so now you know

You've got the blood on your hands, I know it's my own
We can go down to the streets and follow the shores
Of all the people, I hoped it'd be you
Show me my way back home, to where I was born
Where I belong, where I belong
