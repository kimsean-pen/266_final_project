Why oh why (why)
Gave you several years of my life
And it just ain't right
What's your perception of love
Now how many times did we say it was over
And how many times did we not leave
There's no sense in this love hangover
Please come back to me
Cause I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss

I'm nervous and trembling (smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you been (smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this (smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit (smoking cigarettes at night)

In the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour
I see the etch of your face
And it makes it hard for me to breathe
What can I do to change your decision
Please work with me (me)
Sometimes my eyes won't close from weepin'
And sometimes I can't wake up from sleepin' (why)
Cause you keep callin' me
Keep callin' me in my dreams
I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss

I'm nervous and trembling (smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you been (smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this (smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit (smoking cigarettes at night)

Newport, Winston, Salem's, Marlboro Lights
Don't matter what the kind
Cause you got me smokin' out on you
Got me puffin' bout a pack a night (pack a night)
And I know it ain't healthy

I'm nervous and trembling (smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you been (smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this (smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit (smoking cigarettes at night)

I'm nervous and trembling (smoking cigarettes at night)
Wondering where you been (smoking cigarettes at night)
I can't cope with this (smoking cigarettes at night)
You're the one to help me quit (smoking cigarettes at night)

Know it ain't healthy, smokin'
Gotta quit
You're the only one
