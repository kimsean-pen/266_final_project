Come here, baby

You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're making up more than we're making love
And it always seems you got something on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Say you're leaving on a seven thirty train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feeling bad looks good, yeah

That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy
Crazy, crazy for you baby

What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
You're packing up your stuff
And talking like it's tough
And trying to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!
But, I know you ain't wearin' nothing underneath that over coat
And it's all a show, yeah!

That kinda loving
Makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah!
That kinda loving, yeah
Now I'm never, never, never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy
Crazy, crazy for you baby

What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
I'm losing my mind, girl
'Cause I'm going cra
