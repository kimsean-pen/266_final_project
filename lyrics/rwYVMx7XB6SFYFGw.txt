We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off
And our hearts nearly stopped at the sound
When we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd
I was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud

Cause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg
Yeah, my shell isn't as hard as it seems
When my insides gush out there's no telling what it's about
When it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed

Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home

Well, I take a look outside at the pretty girls outside
But I can't make myself say "Hi" because I'm scared
Because I spend all this time all locked up inside
It's the only place I know how to bare

Cause you can go out and meet some girl you can't defeat
And you think that she must be the one
Until you're walking down the isle and she takes away your smile
Boy you wish you hadn't dialed before you wrung

Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home

Well they talk of your past, yeah they said it wouldn't last
But they're running pretty fast back on their word
It was gone for a while but it's coming back in style
Better run back where you're from and join the mass

Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
