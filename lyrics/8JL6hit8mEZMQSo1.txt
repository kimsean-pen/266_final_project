Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music
To get you through the stormy weather
And do whatever you feel
When you let go
Nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

So come on, now put you hands together
Yeah, come on, now put you hands together
Oh come on
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll

Ooo are you feelin' satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride
It's up to you
You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride

Oh that funky feelin'
Is what you need to get you through
Yeah, you oughta know
I'll tell you somethin'
Don't let your troubles get to you
'Cause win or lose, it's alright
If you let go
Nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

So come on, put your hands together
Yeah, come on, put your hands together
Oh, come on
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll

Ooo are you feelin' satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride
You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride

It's up to you
You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride
