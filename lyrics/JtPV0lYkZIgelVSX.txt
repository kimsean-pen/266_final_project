Please don't flatter yourself
You're not the only one
This heart has ever felt

Please don't exaggerate
Don't tell me you're ok
Ok, ok

I will admit it
If you admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are (look where we are where we are)

I can forgive it
I can't forget it
You've left me here with all these scars
And you can't deny the hardest part
I'm not in your arms

We're more hurt than we appear
The world will never know
We both have tasted tears
My dear

You're denying what I say
Don't act like it's ok
'Cuz it's not ok

I will admit it
If you admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are (look where we are where we are)

I can forgive it
I can't forget it
You've left me here with all these scars
And you can't deny the hardest part
I'm not in your arms (Your arms, your arms)

It's not in the cards
It's not in the stars

I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
You're not sorry
I will admit it, if you admit it
Just please don't flatter yourself
Please don't flatter
Yourself
