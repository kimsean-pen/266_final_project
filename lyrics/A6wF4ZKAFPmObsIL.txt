We step through London
The streets holding on to us
We'll stand where the river bends
I hope we fall in

So this time maybe
Let's take a photograph
We'll burn all the negatives
I hope we fall in

It's never gonna be this good so just climb in
How long 'til reason makes us small again?
And it feels just like we just got started

It's still you
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care
Wear ourselves out on the way down

It's still you
And the moment you met me you said I was cheap
You were the sale of the century
Grease ourselves up on the way down

And now I touch you
I don't know where you begin
Sometimes you're a piece of me

I hope we fall in
It's never gonna be this good so just climb in
How long 'til reason makes us small again

And it feels just like we just got started
It's still you
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care

Wear ourselves out on the way down
It's still you
And the moment you met me you said I was cheap
You were the sale of the century

Grease ourselves up on the way down
It's been too long so it could just be something we ate

I knew we'd go far cause we both share the people we hate
It feels just like we just got started
It's still you
Taking me under
We turn to be scared
Then decide that we don't care
Grease ourselves out on the way down
It's still you
And the moment you met me you said I was cheap
You were the sale of the century
Greased ourselves up on the way down
