(whispered)
Don't turn away,
Just keep me holding on.
Don't turn away,
Just don't leave me now.

You're moving in circles,
Looking for the love that I thought we made
While I stand alone.
You say you wanna be certain,
Certain this feeling will never fade.
But I need to know.

So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...

Replaying the moments,
Looking for the light that I thought we made
Did we let it go?
All the kisses you've stolen,
With every whisper and word you say
I just need to know.

So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...

Nobody but you, babe,
Standing in the way of the love we made
And the hand you hold.

So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
So don't turn away or you'll see me turn to stone
So don't turn away...
