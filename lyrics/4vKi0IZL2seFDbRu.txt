In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you're got me right where you're around me
But you're just in my way

I came the party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I loose control
Yeah oh I go solo

But you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

In the shade of light you're moving closer
We're on our way to cross the line
Think you got me right where you walk me
But it's all in your mind

I came the party on my own
Don't need nobody in my soul
I get on to the beat I loose control

Yeah oh I go solo

But you can cool it down
I need to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
