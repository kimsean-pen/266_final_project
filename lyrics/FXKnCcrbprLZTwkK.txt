When I was a boy, the children
In school could be so cruel
Pick out the weakest
Push down the weak
Damage the injured
Make themselves kings

One day I told them to be kind
To have clear presence of mind
Then I was one of the weak
As the downtrodden sing their song

All faith is gone
If you can't run as fast as the others
You will still be my brother
If you can't sail into the wind
You will still be my friend

When I looked around, I found
The dregs and the hypocrites following behind
Point out impurity for they were the freaks
Those without wisdom shall suffer their needs

One day I told them to be pure
And displace their state of hate
Then I became the king
And the children began to sing

All faith is gone
If you can't run as fast as the others
You will still be my brother
If you can't sail into the wind
You will still be my friend

Oh, we were young the children were cruel
Within the shadows do you find your use
And if you were not good enough
You have been disposed
Their minds were closed

If you can't run as fast as the others
You will still be my brother
If you can't sail into the wind
You will still be my friend.
