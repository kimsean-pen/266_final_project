I thought no one could keep us from sharing the rest of our lives
A like a fool, I believed you were true and had no disguise

There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes, I'm no longer pretending you're mine

It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can

There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes, I'm no longer pretending you're mine

Nanana nana nana nana nana
Nanana nana nana nana nana
Nanana nana nana nana nana

Watch out

It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can

There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes, I'm no longer pretending you're mine

No regrets
