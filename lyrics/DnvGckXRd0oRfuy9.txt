Inhale, hold, release
Forever bound in your net of safety
And it's the most dangerous place I can be
Like torture to me
I long to taste life without boundaries
And I'm not scared
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Opening my eyes
I am alive
I'm larger than life
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Leave the past behind
I have arrived
I will light up the sky
If you let me breathe my oxygen
My oxygen
Turn my face towards the sun
Hair in the wind, down highway one
I'm looking for sense of escape
Naked I am liberated
I'll never change
I stare my fears in the face
Cos I'm not scared
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Opening my eyes
I am alive
I'm larger than life
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Leave the past behind
I have arrived
I will light up the sky
If you let me breathe my oxygen
My oxygen
Rules were made for us to break
Chances meant for us to take
And I know I will forsake
Determined to break away
Opening my eyes
I am alive
I'm larger than life
Just let me breathe my oxygen
Leave the past behind
I have arrived
I will light up the sky
If you let me breathe my oxygen
My oxygen
If you let me breathe my oxygen
My oxygen
Just let me breathe my oxygen
