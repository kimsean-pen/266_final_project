I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughts
waiting for the black to replace my blue
I do not struggle in your web because it was my aim
to get caught
But daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing
weary
of waiting to be consumed by you

Chorus:
Give me the first taste
Let it begin -- heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase -- I'll let you win
but you must make the endeavor

Oh, your love give me a heart contusion
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
I'm building memories on things we have not said

Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly, my love
Not nearly, my love, not nearly

Chorus (1x)
