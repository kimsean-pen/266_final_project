The way I have to look is
I want more than anybody possibly can
The way I have to go for it
It makes me stand up, shake and feel like a man

And I feel just like a radio
And when the DJ hit that button

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah

Anyone can have feet
Ooh, but they got to learn to use it
There's a special channel here
So do you get it or you lose it?

And I feel just like a radio
And when the DJ hit that button

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah

Hit that button, hit that button
Hit that button, hit that button

The way I have to look is
I want more than anybody possibly can
The way I have to go for it
I got to stand up, shake and feel like a man

And I feel just like a radio
And when the DJ hit that button

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah

That's the way it was meant to be, yeah
That's the way it feels right for me, yeah
