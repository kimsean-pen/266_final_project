We see light pass through the door
Down through the lasting nighttime
You've had the back seat lately
She just left right through the door
Out to the breaking day
You've left without a trace this morning

Never really read between the lines
Never heard a word or saw the signs
There were just a few who always knew
That rain would follow marble skies

Rolling in the darkness of your mind
Coloring the water of your life
Look across the plain, the shadow
Soon the fields will bloom again someday

Take us as we are
We have gone too far
Let the water rise
We have found the way, marble skies

Now we've all been told
That we were all sold
If taking a footing and everything with it
Back into a land
Where it all began
They're finding the pathways that are overgrowing

Never really read between the lines
Never heard a word or saw the signs
There were just a few who always knew
That rain would follow marble skies

Rolling in the darkness of your mind
Coloring the water of your life
Look across the plain, the shadow
Soon the fields will bloom again someday

Take us as we are
We have gone too far
Let the water rise
We have found the way, marble skies

Take us as we are
We have gone too far
Let the water rise
We have found the way, marble skies

Take us as we are
We have gone too far
Let the water rise
We have found the way, marble skies
