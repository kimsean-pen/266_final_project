Might as well get used to you
End it all like you said you'll do
Cause talk is cheap boy out on the street
Cause people know when there's heat

I'm torn and I'm tattered
Sick and tired living my life singing the same old song
Oh I, I feel a little battered
Looks like I'm living my life running a one-man show
Oh, I, I don't know where the feeling's gone
I'll survive, I'll stay alive, I'm gonna carry on

Tell me tell me, won't you tell me
Where's my mister man
Who will try to deny me now
Everything I plan to be

I'm torn and I'm tattered
Sick and tired living my life singing the same old song
Oh I, I feel a little battered
Looks like I'm living my life running a one-man show
Oh, I, I don't know where the feeling's gone
I'll survive, I'll stay alive, I'm gonna carry on

Riding the rodeo
Up and down we go, yeah

Where we'll end up
I just don't know
Like a rodeo
Down we go
(Riding the rodeo
up and down we go)
(Riding the rodeo
up and down we go)
(Riding the rodeo
up and down we go)
(Riding the rodeo
up and down we go)

I'm torn and I'm tattered
Sick and tired living my life singing the same old song
Oh I, I feel a little battered
Looks like I'm living my life running a one-man show
Oh, I, I don't know where the feeling's gone
I'll survive, I'll stay alive, I'm gonna carry on

I got to walk away
I got to end this pain
I'm gonna make it through
See, I'm getting over you

I got to walk away
I got to end this pain
I'm gonna make it through
See, I'm getting over you

I'll stay, stay alive
I'll stay alive
Look at my face
(Riding a rodeo, so high, so fly)
(Riding a rodeo, so high, so fly)

(I don't know)
I'm torn and I'm tattered
