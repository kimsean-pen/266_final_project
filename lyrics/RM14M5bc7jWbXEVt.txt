Skinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come runnin' to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

First off, fuck Dolce & Gabbana
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana
Put that on me auntie and me mama
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana
I came back again, with the platinum
To the continent, I came back again
I came back again, with the platinum
To the continent, I came back again

Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, "I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission"
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlyin' feelin's
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceilin'
Oh, what a–, oh, what a–, oh, how appealin'
Candy paint revealin' all that bullshit you concealin'
Fuck what you been hearin', I'm everything they fearin'
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealin'
Genius what I'm dealin', somethin' they ain't stealin'
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doin' donuts, it's written, I'm the POTUS, I'm focused

Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me runnin' outta patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now

And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
