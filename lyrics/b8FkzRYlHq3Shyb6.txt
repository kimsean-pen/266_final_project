And I knew you were balanced
You can face it all
And it never tastes like magic
But you can taste it all

I knew you were silenced
You can break it all
And it levitates like static
But it doesn't make you feel real after all

Your beauty burns
But you return
Give all your love to me
Your love to me

And this is so real
Baby, how your love feels whatever you do
Whatever you do

And this is so real
Baby, that was your deal whatever you do
Whatever you do

You look like you're ageless
But it doesn't feel the same
Your heart is shapeless
But it doesn't make you afraid
And you dream all the night and
You fight against the odds
And then you sing about sadness
You're only driving circles all the time

Your beauty burns
But you return
Give all your love to me
And set me free

And this is so real
Baby, how your love feels whatever you do
Whatever you do

And this is so real
Baby, that was your deal whatever you do
Whatever you do
