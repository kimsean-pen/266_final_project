Stand out by the station
Waiting for the claws to part

It's been
A very long time
You understand
My frustration

And I can see the end in sight
But I can't see anyone I know
Not you
The one that I adore
Not you
My vibration

After all the dust is settled and you
Come walking out the dark into view
I'll be there
And I let her go
Hold me there
Am I calm

So she sits on the stairwell
Her face in shadow like a dream
The whisper
Have you been here for long?
Oh no, don't worry.

When I look up she is another
A figure stripped and torn apart
The echos
Are bouncing round my brain
Within me
Not far

After all the dust is settled and you
come walking out the dark into view
I'll be there
Can I let her go
Hold me there
Am I calm

After all the dust is settled and you
Come walking out dark into view
I'll be there
And I'll let her go
Hold me there
Am I calm
