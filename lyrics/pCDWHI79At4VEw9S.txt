I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I can't get along

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you, dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I can't get along

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you, dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now.
