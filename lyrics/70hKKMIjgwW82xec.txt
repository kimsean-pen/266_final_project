Now I gotta add you to my list
Of people to try and forget about
Now I gotta add yours to my list
Of faces to try and not think about
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care
And hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'couse
There's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days
Thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you
To my list of people to try and forget about
Try and for-

And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
Don't think my heart will try
But it was waiting here

So now I gotta add you to my list
Of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic, nearly had ya'
Could you imagine, nearly had ya'

Til' it becomes another one
Of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you
On my list of people to try and forget about
Try and fo-

And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart won't try
But it was waiting in the wings

And as the years go by
You're still a banished memory
They'll say my love has died
But it was waiting in the wings
