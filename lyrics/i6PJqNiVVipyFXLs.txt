Do you have any siblings?
I got a brother, Blake, he's four years older than me
And I guess he always will be
Yeah he's clever and he's got a cool girlfriend (hey Hayley)
Aw but wait, now that they're engaged so
I hope they have kids so I can be a cool aunty, yeah

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you

What'd you think of the ultimate ending?
I fast forward, get busy pretending that
Well I've seen everything
Can I get you anything?
A soda? Campari? With lemon? Well, you got it
I got better things to do than shave my legs, my pits, oh yeah

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin too, yeah

Do you have any siblings?
You got a sister, yeah, she's a detective
Well I bet she's got some good stories

But you see, all this small talk is killin' me

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin too

I'm waiting here for you
