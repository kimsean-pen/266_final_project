A second look in the mirror
Bewildered eyes, slightly red
A second chance to calm down
I'm not that crazy
Take a deep breath, easy now

What more can I do to make you happy?
How far must I go before I'm done?
What more should I do to get some peace of mind?
Just leave me alone

Walls closing in
Pressures build up high
Weak as you are
Blind to see
It's but a storm in a glass

Don't turn away
The mirror did not lie
Why not accept just for who you are?

A second glimpse to make sure
I'm looking normal again
Internal conversations
Can't make them shut up
Take a deep breath, once again

What's left of the girl I used to know now?
What's wrong
It is hard for her to be
That face in the mirror
It's her own so calm down again
And know you're stronger

Walls closing in
Pressures build up high
Weak as you are
Blind to see
It's but a storm in a glass

Don't turn away
For mirrors do not lie
Why not accept yourself for who you are?
That's who you are!

Just leave me alone!

Walls closing in
Pressures build up high
Weak as you are
Too blind to see
It's but a storm in a glass

Don't turn away
Mirrors never lie?
Why not accept yourself
For who you are?

What more can I do to make you happy? (make you happy)
How far must I go before I'm done?
What more should I do to get some peace of mind?

What's left of the girl I used to know now
What's wrong
It is hard for her to be
That face in the mirror
It's her own
So calm the storm!

Walls closing in
Pressures build up high
Weak as you are
Too blind to see it was a storm in a glass
