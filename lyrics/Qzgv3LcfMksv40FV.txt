Sickening anguish of war
Is tearing my soul apart
I now feel desire
To enter the realm of death

Evil necromant is tearing my soul apart!

You will live to suffer the burning aftermath
Fall down on your knees in perpetual darkness

Evil necromant is tearing my soul apart!

Torn apart and frozen
(I laugh in the face of death)
(I take my final breath)

You will live to suffer the burning aftermath
Fall down on your knees in perpetual darkness

In this burning inferno
Engulfed by the flames
Drown in eternal fire
As your life fades away

Evil necromant is tearing my soul apart!
