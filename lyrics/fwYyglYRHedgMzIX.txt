Walking with my hand along the fence
Running sprints in my mind 'till I'm outta breath
And it doesn't add up, no it don't make sense
Why I want you, why I want you
Tripping over words that ya said
Talking over voices in the back of my head
Nothin's concrete 'bout what I'm gonna get
But I want you, ya I want you

I know that you're so bad for my health
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself
I should give my time to someone else
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself

I'ma jump the fence, won't second guess
'Cause the way ya got me feelin's
Got me feeling dangerous
I'ma jump the fence
And say, Fuck the rest
Falling down for you is worth
The hurt of landing on my head
I'ma jump the fence

Friends say I'm better off alone
Sitting on my hands, so I won't pick up my phone
Tryna play it cool, but you already know
That I want you, ya I want you

I know that you're so bad for my health
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself
I should give my time to someone else
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself

I'ma jump the fence, won't second guess
'Cause the way ya got me feelin's
Got me feeling dangerous
I'ma jump the fence
And say, Fuck the rest
Falling down for you is worth
The hurt of landing on my head
I'ma jump the fence

Take my love, take all that you need
You know I want ya, you know I want ya
Feel my touch, feel everything
I know ya wanna, I know ya wanna
So I'm gonna

I'ma jump the fence, won't second guess
'Cause the way ya got me feelin's
Got me feeling dangerous
I'ma jump the fence
And say, Fuck the rest
Falling down for you is worth
The hurt of landing on my head
I'ma jump the fence
