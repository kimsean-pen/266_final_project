He left me cryin' late one Sunday night
Outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself
Out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis
Workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true
Don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him
One hot July mornin'
His hair was longer but his eyes
Were the same old blue
He said: I've missed you for so long
Oh baby, what can I do?

I said: I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart

Oh, it's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad
But I've got to be true to my heart
This time

I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me
I want a man who stands beside me
Stand beside me
Stand beside me
