Reflections on the sea
Shoes are japanese
Pain will never ease
Walk on water make it freeze
Sad to see disease
I got on my gloves
I can never love
Cause I came up from above

Above
Disease
Japanese
Never ease
Walk on water make it freeze
I got on my gloves
Cause I came up from above
I can never love

I see reflections on the sea
(shoes are japanese)

Return to the forest
Waterfall calling
Back to the altar
Hidden swords in the water

Holding orbs its so easy when you weak to get absorbed
I just wanted to be yours, I have felt this way before
Got ignored, got a credit in the store, credit card
I have felt this way before when you called, that is all
All that I ever wanted to, is to be new
I return to the forest and my aura gets renewed

I see reflections on the sea
Shoes are japanese
Pain will never ease
Walk on water make it freeze
Sad to see disease
I got on my gloves
I can never love
Cause I came up from above

I wish I could miss, but I have nothing to miss
So low in the snow, I've been waiting for this
Slowly realize, that I was sleeping trough this
Rubies on my neck, I'm so unique and legit
