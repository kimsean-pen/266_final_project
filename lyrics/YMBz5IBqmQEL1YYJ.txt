Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted leaving love unshown
Makes will power weak and temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a play thing
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If ya wanna do right (do right - do right)
All day (do right - do right) woman (woman)
You've gotta be a do right (do-right - do-right)
All night man (do right - do right) (man)

Yeah-yeah they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

If you wanna do right (do right - do right)
All day (do right - do right) woman (woman)
You gotta be a do right (do right - do right)
All night man (man)

A woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood
Just like her man

If you wanna do right (do right - do right)
All day (do right - do right) this woman (woman)
You gotta be a do (why don't cha) right (why don't cha)
All night (why don't cha - why don't cha)
Man
You gotta be a do right
All night man...
