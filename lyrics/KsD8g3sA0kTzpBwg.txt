Soul, body
Do you recognize?
You used to keep me at bay
Used to keep me wake at night
I messed it up and something changed

'Cause the silence you hold between us
And i know it's because I'm me
And you act cool with your indifference
But I think I know you better than that

Owe you apology
And im missing?
So if you can be missing me
You can take it from there

'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your

It's the night i want you to meet
And the dawnlight is way pretty
And we drank under city stars
Just to realize how small we are
Do you know what you do to me?
As we walked on the steps to leave
Get your?
And I lose my breath instantly

'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your
'cause your body tastes like honey
'cause your
