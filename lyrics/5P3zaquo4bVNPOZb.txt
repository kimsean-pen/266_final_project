We took an oath in those lines
Me in my tie and you
All dressed in white
When the band played "Hey Now"
Our families danced celebrating our vows
Nobody loved you like I did
Thought you'd be mother to my kid
But it all changed when
I saw you with someone else
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord

You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love
I gotta leave these vows behind
They were empty promises

You would steal me every night
In our city our home as
New husband and wife
Drinking in fitzroy pubs till two
Singing those Fleetwood songs with you
But it all changed when
I saw you with someone else
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord

You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love
I gotta leave this vows behind
They're just empty promises
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord

I fell so hard to my knees
My eyes said no this can't be
Who was that guy, he ain't me
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord

You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love
I gotta leave this vows behind
They're just empty promises
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord

You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love
I gotta leave this vows behind
They're just empty promises
They were empty promises
Good Lord, Good Lord, Good Lord
