Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before
Is anything certain in life?

They say life is too short
The here and the now
And you're only given one shot
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we've got?

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before I'm not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove what I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

Move on be brave
Bon't weep at my grave
Because I'm no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind has help me to find
The meaning in my life again

Victoria's real, I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I'm here it's perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on
