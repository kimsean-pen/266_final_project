This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love

This is what you get when you mess with love
A morning in darkness, the eyes of the dawn
Suffering, straight from the gods
No medicine, no drugs

This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love

We gave you life to see if you'd disobey
Not interested in what we have to say
You mess with love when you go out tonight
Doesn't matter who's wrong or right
All you want is that feeling again
When someone is camping in your head
Look right, look left, what a distress
I saw a no become a yes

This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love
