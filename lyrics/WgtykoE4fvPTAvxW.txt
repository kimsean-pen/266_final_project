We're so semi-automatic, ecstatic, dramatic
Up to no good, erratic
(And) So fanatic when we hit the dance floor
Bass is pumpin' and thumpin'
Super stompin' we at it jumping'
Like it's new years eve we go
Ayoh Ayoh oh

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blowin'
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys, bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head

When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise
When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blowing
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head

Ultra magnetic, electric
Someone better call a medic
Schizophrenic, freakin' every time we hear the beat
Step into action
Chain reaction feel the attraction
I'm the captain, come on feel the heat

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blown'
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys, bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head

When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise
When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blowin'
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys, bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blowin'
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys, bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head

When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise
When you leave the club
All you'll hear is white noise
All ya, all ya, all ya, all you'll hear is white noise

We're the white noise, pink noise
Fillin' your head
Feel the speakers blowin'
Hittin' the red
We're the big boys, bad boys
Racin' full speed ahead
Head, head, head
