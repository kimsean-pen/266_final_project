So you think you can walk away now?
Nothing's happening, everything's fine
It's the same old situation
Each time you get the last word
I turn away blind

You were never there for me at all
You always gotta tear me down
You, you take the best of me, it's gone
My happiness is never allowed

So you really wanna do this shit now?
You wanna take another shot at my pride?
One of these days you'll work for ricochet
I've been tear off your high

You were never there for me at all
You always gotta tear me down
You, you take the best of me, it's gone
My happiness is never allowed

(Not allowed...)
My happiness is never allowed!
My happiness is never allowed!
My happiness is never allowed!

You were never there for me at all
You always gotta tear me down
You, you take the best of me, it's gone
My happiness is never allowed

My happiness is never allowed
My happiness is never allowed
My happiness is never allowed
My happiness is never allowed...
