In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store
My heart starts shaking
My body starts aching
And I just can't take no more

No, no,
Oh, baby

Now I just wanna get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
Over here baby

In the heat of the day
I hang my head down low
And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to c-c-come

Ooh, baby

In the still of the night
In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the still of the night

Oh, baby

I can't keep away
No.
I can't keep away
No, no no

In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

Oh! Mama
Now I just wanna get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the still of the night
Oh, yeah
In the still of the night
I will be sneaking 'round your door
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
In the still of the night

Still of the night
Still of the night
Still of the night

Still of the night
Still of the night
Still of the night
