Call you on the phone
You said don't be alone
I'm on my way
On my way
Another Friday night
Where to now?
I'm on it

Please don't
Please don't let me down
Down
Please don't
Please don't let me down
Down
We've got the world in our hands

We can drive around
All around the town
So pointless, so pointless
Maybe it's a waste
To drink our nights away
But I love it
I love it
And I know I might be wrong
In holding on too long
But fuck it

Please don't
Please don't let me down
Down
Please don't
Please don't let me down
Down
We've got the world in our hands
