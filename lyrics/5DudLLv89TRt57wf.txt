Fortune up and left me on the hotel floor
Well you know she never paid me no mind
I was lying in the corner making eyes at the door
They say it's good to start the story with a tragedy

The day I finally met you like I knew I would
You raised me from the wreck of my doubt
You were smiling to yourself as if we both understood
The silent language of the anguish of a. heart that sings but doesn't make a sound

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me?
I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh

Nobody told me all the patience it takes
For the sky to open up around me
They said love is grabbing blindly at a pit full of snakes
And wait to feel the only heel among the rows of all the venomous teeth

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me?
I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh

Our love is older than the great wall
Our love spins a gun around its finger
Our love has found its way into our mouths before
Cut our teeth until we swallow it whole
Our love hums low beneath the floorboards
Our love grows flowers in the winter
Our love has found its way onto our tongues before
There is more so take a bite and let it linger

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me?
I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me?
I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh
