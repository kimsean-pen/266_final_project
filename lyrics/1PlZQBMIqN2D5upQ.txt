Think it's 'bout that time to go
Oh I just need to get away
Ain't no right or wrong my darlin'
Out on that open highway

Been so much backwards
And forwards
And backwards with you
You say that
I say that
She said it's true
I don't wanna think about the things we go through
I'd rather drive out and take in the view

Just wanna cruise
For the rest of the night
Under the moon
Nothin' else on my mind

And I got my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin' eh
And I got my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin'
Ayyye! And I got my top down

Ain't nothin' personal
I ain't about to go astray
Well I just need a minute darlin'
I'll be back before the day

Been so much backwards
And forwards
And backwards with you
You say that
I say that
She said it's true
I don't wanna think about the things we go through
I'd rather drive out and take in the view

Just wanna cruise
For the rest of the night
Under the moon
Nothin' else on my mind

And I got my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin'
Ayyye! And I got my top down

Can you do me a favor
Let's just talk about it later
I won't get in your way, no!
Cause for the rest of the day, oh!

I'ma have my top down drivin'
I'ma have my top down drivin'
I'ma have my top down drivin'
And I got my top down drivin'
I'ma have my top down drivin' (drivin')

(Drivin', drivin', drivin')
And I got my top down drivin'
(Drivin', drivin', drivin')
And I got my top down drivin'
