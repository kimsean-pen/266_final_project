In the early days,
When you lived in caves
You hardly ever met a stranger
But if you did it could mean danger
You chewed on your bones
When you were throwing stones
And you used your club for
Hunting you were a troglodyte

And you said this land was your land
And never will be their land
How long will your aggression stand?
In a caveman's land

Now that was long ago,
But evolution's slow
Though you got Globalization,
And access to information
Even with the Internet you
Find the logic's hard to get
When your mindset's all
Jurassic you're still a troglodyte

And you said this
Land was your land
And never will be their land
How long will your
Aggression stand?
In the caveman's land
You said this land
Was your land
And never will be their land
What's so hard to understand?
It's still a caveman's land

Wonder how it's down there,
In your hole
Where it's darkness all the time
Building up these
Images of ghosts outside
Must be scary to play that roll
A tricky hill to climb that is
Gonna make you lose control
The demons of your soul
Will make you fall back into your hole

Is it too complex or
Can you tell what's next?
After and years of sinking
Can you switch your way of thinking?
Will your kids be lame
Or will they change the game
Will they act a little wiser
And not be troglodytes

And say this land is your land
And never just be my land
Yeah, will they take a stand
Against the caveman's land
And say this land is your land
And never just be my land
Who will get the upper hand
In this caveman's land
