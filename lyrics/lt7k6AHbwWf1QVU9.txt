I hope she doesn't see
The lipstick stain on the edge of the wineglass
Hope that she can't see it in my eyes

I hope she doesn't notice
I've come home late every night this week
Trying to keep it together
It's getting harder and harder each time
To keep this hidden away
I'm running out of things I can say

And I can't sleep from thinking about you
And I can't tell lies from the truth
And I can't hide you like this for very much longer
And I don't know which way to run
And I feel myself coming undone
And I don't know how much longer I can keep it
My little secret

I hope she doesn't notice
This look on my face from thinking about you
Stories are getting harder for me to tell
And each time I try
To take one step away
I find myself crashing back into you
Taking this chance that I know, now
I shouldn't be taking

And I can't sleep from thinking about you
And I can't tell lies from the truth
And I can't hide you like this for very much longer
And I don't know which way to run
And I feel myself coming undone
And I don't know how much longer I can keep it
My secret

Know that there will come a day
When it all comes falling down
I just cant walk away
I find myself crashing back into you
Taking this chance and I
Can't sleep from thinking about you
And I can't tell lies from the truth
And I can't hide you like this for very much longer

And I can't sleep from thinking about you
And I can't tell lies from the truth
And I can't hide you like this for very much longer
And I don't know which way to run
And I feel myself coming undone
And I don't know how much longer I can keep it
My little secret
My little secret
My little secret
