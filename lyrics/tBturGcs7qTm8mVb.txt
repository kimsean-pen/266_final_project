Who took the bomp?
Every day and night
every day and night
i can see your disco disco dick is sucking my heart out of my mind
i'm outta time
i'm outta fucking time
i'm a gasoline gut with a vasoline mind but
wanna disco?
wanna see me disco?
let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme
one, two, three, four
you got what you been asking for
you're so policy free
and your fantasy wheels
and everything you think
and everything you feel is
alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
I take you home now i watch me get you hard
you're just a parrot
when you're screaming and you're shouting
"more crackers please! more crackers please!"
you want what you want
but you don't wanna be on your knees
who does your, who does your hair?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
who took the ram from the ramalamading-dong?
who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
who took the ram from the ramalamading-dong?
How are you?
fine, thank you
how are you?
fine, thank you.
You bought a new van
the first year of your band
you're cool and
i hardly wanna say
"not" because i'm so bored
that'd i'd be entertained even by a stupid fuckin
linoleum floor, linoleum floor
your lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor
i'll walk on it
i'll walk all over you
walk on it, walk on it
walking one, two
who?
who?
who?
who?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?
who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
who took the ram from the ramalamading dong?
See you later.
see you later.
see you later.
see you later.
