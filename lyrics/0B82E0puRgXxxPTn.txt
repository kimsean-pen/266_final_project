In the middle of the night
When the time is right
Sexily right
I'm gonna do the right thing
I'm gonna move it slow
Much harder though
Sexily slow
I'm gonna do the right thing

I'm feeling hot
I ain't never gonna stop
To get what you got
You better take what I bring
I feel it now
Much harder now
Oh more than any old how
Say you feel the pain

Feel I'm getting harder now
(Get off your back four, get on top more)
Feel I'm sinking farther down
(Get off your back four, get on top more)

I told you to stop
You're sleeping out a lot
You told me get lost
Where's your understanding
I feel it now
Much harder than I've ever done now now
Hey I'm gonna do the right thing
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
Hit me now

Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
Hold me tight now

Feel I'm getting harder now
(Get off your back four, get on top more)
Feel I'm sinking farther down
(Get off your back four, get on top more)

In the middle of the night
When the time is right
Sexily right
I'm gonna do the right thing, oh yeah
I said I'm gonna move it slow
Much harder than I've ever done now now
Hey I'm gonna do the right thing
Lemme tell you now
Hit me now, hit me now

Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
Hold me tight now

Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
We're gonna do in the mid-night hour
Aah, oh aah, oh aah, yeah

Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
Aah, oh aah, oh aah
I'm gonna do the right thing
