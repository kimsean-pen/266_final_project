Come in
Come in
Come into my world
I've got to show, show, show you
(Ah-ah-ah)
Come into my bed
I've got to know, know, know you

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my
Fool
Will never be my fool

(Ah-ah-ah)
Floaters in my eyes
Wake up in a hotel room
(Ah-ah-ah)
Cigarettes and lies
I am a child, it's too soon
(Ah-ah-ah)
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool

A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
(bum, bum, bum)
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address; I wade downstairs

The porter smiles to me
A smile I've bought
With a couple of gold coins
A sign that I've been caught

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my
Dear
Will never be my
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum

A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine

Come into my bed
I've got to know, know, know you
