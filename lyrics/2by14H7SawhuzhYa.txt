Prince street, August 14th
A SoHo bar
A speakeasy
It's you and me, and I'm feeling free

It's crazy
How everyone
Lives up, like Top Gun
It's you, and it's a cloudy night to smoke one

Oh, things happen when you move to the city
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me

Oh, things happen when you call me pretty
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me

To the city, city
To the city, city
To the city, city
To the city, city

Oh, things happen when you move to the city
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me

Oh, things happen when you call me pretty
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me

To the city, city
To the city, city
To the city, city
To the city, city

Oh, things happen when you move to the city
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me
To the city, city

Oh, things happen when you call me pretty
When you're with me, oh, how you feel me
To the city, city
