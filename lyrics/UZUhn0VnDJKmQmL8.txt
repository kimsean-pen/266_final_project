I'm not one thing.
You're not one thing, either.
I saw something fill our souls with ether.
You'd do anything just to please her.
A person made of beautifully flawed pieces.
Accept not knowing how to change another.
Accept accepting you don't know.
Feeling so vile.
Feeling so hungry.
I'm running on fumes but there's still no stopping, no.
Midnight hour & the bed looks comfy & I'm not going home.
Loving fully, putting trust in someone.
Losing fully, losing trust in everyone.
I thought I had it, thought the world was mine.
You knew better and you took your time.
I feel stranger.
Stranger than I ever knew.
Putting faith in something bigger than me, bigger than you.
Feeling so vile.
Feeling so hungry.
I'm running on fumes but there's still no stopping, no.
Midnight hour & the bed looks comfy & I'm not going home.
