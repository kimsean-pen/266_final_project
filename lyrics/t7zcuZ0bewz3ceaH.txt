Tropicana, groovy punch sipping
Usually up, whipping for the stereo, stereo
Tropicana, watch 'em go bananas
When they see the whip they be like
"There he go—"

Coming in on the 1, no time for the 2
369, she fine, I'mma choose
Funk and the rock, I'm a genre confused
Shit, if the shoe fits, don't mind if I do
Just climbed out the blue into the gold
Only thing I never did was fit to the mould
They did what they told, I did what I felt like—
Hulk Hogan air guitar solo on the belt like, rreeoww!
Intro unnecessary, I been dope, young legendary
I'm a fire, need a hose—and some hoes, I suppose
I should hire me a secretary (ah!)
I ain't always been the best Samaritan, but still I try!
I ain't gotta go confessing every sin, but I will not lie
Don't kill my high, on some matador shit
Don't mean much to me when you scheme (on the low)
Don't mean mug at me, be mad at your chick

My ears, might lose my mind
I hear he a killer and you still say free my bro
Truth be told, he should do his time
But hey, that's another song
That's... none of my business
What go around, come around, one day it'll come along
I done come a long way, I been running off fumes
In pursuit of that bitch success
I can already smell her perfume, man it's sweet like chariots
Swinging low where the berries picked, verified, it's very lit
Got a state on your back, can you carry it? (Huh)
Don't drop that dun-dun-dun
The dunce in the cap was once in the back of the class
Ain't know how to act, but I passed didn't I?
Do what I said, did I lie? Okay I'll wait—
You wanna stay alive then you gotta look him dead in the eyes
Otherwise on the high, cause I'm a—
