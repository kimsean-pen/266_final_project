I'm shaking awful
I'm shaking-ass cold
In weather remote
Snowfall on

The snowy cover
We'll recover from both

With Christmas time coming
Hangover approaching
We've been drinking Bordeaux

As Christmas time goes
I'm coming over
I'm coming from north

I'm already gone
I'm wrapping up the presents I bought

An overcoat will take me anywhere, oh
We've suffered enough
It's scary to leave
When they're leaving from work
Cutting us off
Knowing not why
Calling on the telephone
Roy, do I know anyone?
No, I don't know anyone
