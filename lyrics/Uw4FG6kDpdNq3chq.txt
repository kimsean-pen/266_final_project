I dragged the body from road to Rome
Under the floorboards, its carcass resides

Lying in pieces I place you inside
I stretch an image of her on me
I beg to see that silver light dissipate

That black sermon followed me
I predicted the most righteous act
I stretch an image of her on me
I pray to see that silver light dissipate

Every day is all the same

It's the same

Cracked ribs, bloodied and broken
The soul will rest so all can see
We're all just begging to be free
Under the floorboards, his body it rests
His body at the rest
