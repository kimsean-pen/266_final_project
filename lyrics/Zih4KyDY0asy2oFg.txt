It started with a kiss
That one little moment set this whole thing in motion
I try to follow script
But I fall into your iris like I'm diving in the ocean

And now I don't ever wanna come up for air
Maybe we can just stay right here til' this world is over
I try to hold back but I let it out
I'm not even sure what I'm on about
I guess all I'm trying to say is

That I will love you even if we're just energy
If we're just energy
I will love you even if we're just energy
Out in the universe

Even if we're just energy out in the universe

I don't ever wanna come up for air
Maybe we can just stay right here til' this world is over
I try to hold back but I let it out
I'm not even sure what I'm on about
I guess all I'm trying to say is

That I will love you even if we're just energy
If we're just energy
I will love you even if we're just energy
Out in the universe

Even if we're just energy out in the universe

Even if we're just energy out in the universe

I will love you forever
I will love you forever more
I will love you forever
I will love you forever more
