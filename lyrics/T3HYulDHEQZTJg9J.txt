Avalanche

Freeze your pain
It won't take long
Take my hand and hear me call

This is who we are
This is who we are

Avalanche

Ease your fear
Elevate
Lay with me and close your eyes

Avalanche

Cover me with snow
Freeze me to death
Forever I'll lay in the alpine bed
Seasons will change
but I shall remain
Stripped bare of my coat
I will rest in peace

Avalanche

Avalanche

Cover me with snow
Freeze me to death
Forever I'll lay in the alpine bed
Seasons will change
but I shall remain
Stripped bare of my coat
I will rest in peace
