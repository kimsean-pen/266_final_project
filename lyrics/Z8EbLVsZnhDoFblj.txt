Does it matter how?
Does it matter when?
If you market yourself for blood, How do you come back?

She sees red at night. No one knows.
She sees red at night. No one...

If she chooses girls, If she chooses guys,
Does she profit to fill her lungs?
I want to hold her breath.

Does it matter what? She sees red at night. Does it matter where? No one knows. If she markets herself for blood...
She sees red at night. how will she come back?
