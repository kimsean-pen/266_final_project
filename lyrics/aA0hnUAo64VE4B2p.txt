From the time you understood anything
You're misled to believe a false truth
If you lived on in one's glory
All that could befoul would be diverted

This couldn't be further from the truth
You control nothing
And there's nothing you can do
Your path has been set
And to this you will see it through

Dividing the flesh and the essence
While dying - you see as you should
But could never see
Fleeing the host - panic frenzy
Your last breaths to be counted
And faint images fade as hope loses its worth

Lift the veil to see the unseen
The absence of light, exquisite agony
Forked tongue messenger
Deliverer whose words are the key
The door of perception unlocks

This couldn't be further from the truth
You control nothing
And there's nothing you can do
Your path has been set
And to this you will see it through

Dividing the flesh and the essence
While dying - you see as you should
But could never see
Fleeing the host - panic frenzy
Your last breaths to be counted
And faint images fade as hope loses its worth
