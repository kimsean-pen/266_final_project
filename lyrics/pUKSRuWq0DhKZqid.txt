I try and try to make you cry and make you love me
But I would say yes, oh I would say yes
The need to be the best before the need to rest
Oh I would say yes, oh I would say yes

See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you[?]
(Be in the dark to be in a dark side, be in a deep mind)
See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you[?]
(Be in the dark to be in a dark side, be in a deep mind)

To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
But I would say yes, I would say yes
So as you fade away your life I lay dying
And I would say yes, Oh I would say!

See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you[?]
(Be in the dark to be in a dark side, be in a deep mind)

See, my wait is you, my wait is you
My wait is you[?]
(be in the dark to be in a deep mind)
