I was just a kid workin' for the man
for the first time
He said, "Listen, kid,
you better hear my advice:
Treat 'em like dirt
They'll stick forever
to the bottom of your shoe"

I said, "Mr. Man, that ain't nice
you gotta treat a girl right
Take her out, wine and dine her,
always be polite."
"Kid, all good--just do you
but soon you'll see
she don't want no goody two shoes"

Boy you're just a goody two,
goody two shoes
You're just a goody two, two shoes!

You got style, you got grace,
But kid you try so hard
She just laughs in your face
Yeah you're a nice guy
With the wrong attitude
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

I treat her bad (so bad), she loves me good (so good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy
But that just won't do
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

Listen kid,
you hear them sirens comin' for me?
But when I get downtown
she will already be
Postin' bail in her favorite dress
Smilin' at me because I'm no good

You can buy her everything she likes
And I'm sure she'll be obliged
She'll let you steal a kiss,
maybe even spend the night
Kid, all good--just know that
She'll be thinking of me
even when she's with you

Boy you're just a goody two,
goody two shoes
You're just a goody two, two shoes!

You got style, you got grace,
But kid you try so hard
She just laughs in your face
And you're a nice guy
With the wrong attitude
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)
I treat her bad (so bad), she loves me good (so good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy
But that just won't do
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

Well, all right now
Single ladies--yeah
I'm gonna need your help now
Tell us what you want us to do now,
Tell us what you want us to do now
I need help, girls
You're a bad boy
I sure need help now (help now)
So bad--so bad
So good--so good
So bad--bad
Good--good

Goddamn--you got style, you got grace,
But kid you try so hard
She just laughs in your face
You're a nice guy
Wrong attitude
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, all we want is bad boys)
I treat her bad (so bad), she loves me good (so good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy
But that just won't do
She want a bad boy
(Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

Boy you're just a goody two,
goody two shoes
You're just a goody two, two shoes!
