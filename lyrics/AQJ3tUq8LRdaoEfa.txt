Yes I am
I hope you think you read me
Hope I start talking crazy
Before you understand me
are we through
You think that i'm beneath you
But you like the things that I do
Well wrap 'em up and take 'em with you

I'm alright
Hope I can sleep for one night
If not to cool my insides
Maybeto calm my backside
Rain on me
I got a weakness in me
I think that weakness feeds me
I don't think you, think you need me

Sunshine
You're the best time
I ever, ever had
But I think I made you feel bad
The black fly on your necktie
Time after time

But when the sun starts sinkin'
On your beautiful soul
Make you cry, cry baby
Make you feel so cold
Don't you know it's alright
Sometimes
You just got to show how you feel
'Cause that's you baby
Yeah you're so real

Run this round in your head
Like you don't know what's on the inside
You don't know me too well
You ain't seen my bad side
Shame on me
Shame on the things that I'd be
If you could complicate me
If you could get inside me

Sunshine
You're the best time
I've ever, ever known
Pretty girl with a wicked smile on
But I've cried
For the last time
Something just don't feel right

But when the sun starts sinkin'
On your beautiful soul
Make you cry, cry baby
Make you feel so cold
Don't you know it's alright
Sometimes
You just got to show how you feel
'Cause that's you baby
Yeah you're so real

You always know just who you are
You never needed someone else
To realize yourself

But when the sun starts sinkin'
On your beautiful soul
Make you cry, cry baby
Make you feel so cold
Don't you know it's alright
Sometimes
You just got to show how you feel
'Cause that's you baby
Yeah you're so real

Yeah baby you're so real
Yeah baby you're so real
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh!
