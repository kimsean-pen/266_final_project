What I hate about getting older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder when I'm gonna get taller
Where's my naivety?
Thinking back when we were younger
All of the things we believed that we could do
Don't wanna live by fear of failure
Where's my naivety?

Somehow lost along the way

This is me, honestly
I've got no apologies
I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me
This is real, it's how I feel
With one shoulder on the wheel
What I'm searching for grows further out of reach

What I hate about getting older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder what it's like not being sober
Where's my naivety?
Looking back when we were younger
Every mistake was a chance that we could take
Now I think I'm just getting colder
Where's my naivety?

It got lost along the way

I swear you won't take me back
I don't care, that's all in my past
I'm waiting for what's next
And I won't let it slip away
Get me through another day
