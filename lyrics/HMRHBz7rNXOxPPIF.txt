He'll take the money and the food that's in your hand
But you have to understand that he's a dreamer
Living my life within a mile you could believe
This place turns honest men into thieves
And I could see it in his eyes
He was the type
To sail off in the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer

He'll trade your loving for the things he's never seen
The place he's never been
Oh but remember he is just a good pretender
And he doesn't give his love away for free
And I could see it in his eyes
He was the type
To sail off in the night

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer

I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
I met him through a dancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
A tropical chancer
Didn't know he was a tropical chancer
