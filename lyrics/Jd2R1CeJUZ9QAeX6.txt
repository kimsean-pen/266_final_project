Would you take a
Straight and narrow critical look at me,
Would you tell me
Tough love style, put judicial weight on me?
If you're thinking anything,
If you're thinking endlessly.
If you're thinking anything,
If you're thinking...

I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow,
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow.
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close.

I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow,
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow.
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close.

Would you take a
Calm and tender terminal kind of care?
Would you touch me,
Cling and wage an intimate fight for me?
If you're thinking anything,
If you're thinking endlessly.
If you're thinking anything,
If you're thinking...

I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow,
Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow.
I take my aim, do you feel me coming close?
I take my aim so you feel me coming close.

Out in my yard, feathers of an arrow.
