I could tell you all about her
And what she did for me
I was swimming in the darkness
'Til she set me free

She opened up my heart
To a whole new love
I never knew was there
When it fell apart
And she left my arms
I was so unprepared

What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

I could tell you all about him
The way he touched my face
I'd be throwing such a tantrum
But he could ease my pain

He opened up my heart
To a whole new love
I never knew was there
When it fell apart
And he left my arms
I was so unprepared

What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

Gonna beg you to stay
'Cause I know that you're the one
Don't you take that away
I know you wanna quit
But I'm not ready to let go
Gonna bend 'til I break

What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

Ooh, ooh
I'm so lonesome without you
Ooh, ooh
So lonesome without you, and oh
So lonesome, I'm so lonesome
So lonesome without you
No
