Love you bigger than the ocean
I'm in a sunshine state of mind
I want this feeling forever
You are the summer

Long days, hot nights
The moments of unity
Long days, hot nights
So gorgeous for you and me

Long days, hot nights
The moments of unity
Long days, hot nights
So gorgeous for you and me

Love you bigger than the ocean
I'm in a sunshine state of mind
I want this feeling forever
You are the summer

Love you bigger than the ocean
I'm in a sunshine state of mind
I want this feeling forever
You are the summer

Long days, hot nights
The moments of unity
Long days, hot nights
So gorgeous for you and me

Long days, hot nights
The moments of unity
Long days, hot nights
So gorgeous for you and me
(for you and me)
(you and me)
(you and me)

Long days, hot nights
The moments of unity
Long days, hot nights
So gorgeous for you and me
