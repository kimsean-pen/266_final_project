White shutters enclose the boundaries
Of my heart, I hold my breath till the steady
Beating is
Shut out
In silence I wait for what is real

For I know the truth of my perceptions
Nothing in life matters more, more than You
Nothing more, more than You

When first feelings fade
I will still be here

I hold my breath
Till the steady beating is shut out
Beating is

For I know the truth of my perceptions
Nothing in life matters more, more than You
Nothing more, more than You

When first feelings fade
I will still be here
