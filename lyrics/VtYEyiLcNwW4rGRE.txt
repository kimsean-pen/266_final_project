I'm going out again tonight
To be with people I don't like
In places you will only see
In documentaries on TV

With education incomplete
Behind the door my mother weeps
A silent disco in the street
The message ends and then repeats

As I'm staring at the crowd,
I recognise the overkill
With an antidote for all the fun
A world of pain without the thrill
Complimentary perma-frown
And tickets back to average-ville
The underhanded ordinary,
Have overdone the underkill

With obsolete technology
We're building bombs internally
Full of non-expectancy
Half day closing usually

Another day that's everyday
Identical in every way
A parasite that needs a host
Well it's my mind I'll miss the most

As I'm staring at the crowd,
I recognise the overkill
With an antidote for all the fun
A world of pain without the thrill
Complimentary perma-frown
And tickets back to average-ville
The underhanded ordinary,
Have overdone the underkill

Where boredom is the norm'
I can't take it anymore
Until the day we're born
We just take it on the chin

Staring at the crowd,
I recognise the overkill
With an antidote for all the fun
A world of pain without the thrill
Complimentary perma-frown
And tickets back to average-ville
The underhanded ordinary,
Have overdone the underkill
As I'm staring at the crowd,
I recognise the underkill
