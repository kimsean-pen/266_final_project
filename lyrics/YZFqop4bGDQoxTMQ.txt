Whatever I do, wherever I go
The same afterglow is keepin' me low
Don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay here too long

They see you go by, I tell you no lie
You're up in the sky, make everyone cry
Don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay around here

I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

I hear them talkin' and they go on and on
They think that nothing is wrong
And so they just carry on about you
Don't wanna lose it
But I gotta move out of here

I see them waiting there for most of the day
I know you asked them to stay, but they just won't go away
Don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again

I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

I know it ain't real, but when you are near
You're saying the things that I wanna hear
Don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again

I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run
Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run

Come out, I gotta move around
Come out, I gotta get away
Come out, I gotta move around
