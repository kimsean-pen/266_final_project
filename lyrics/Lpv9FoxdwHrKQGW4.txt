I was born in '67
the year of Sgt. Pepper
and Are You Experienced.

Into a suburban heaven,
Yeah, and it should've been forever.
It all seemed to make so much sense.

But after a while
you realize time flies.
And the best thing that you can do
is take whatever comes to you.
'Cuz time flies.

She said luck is what you make it;
You just reach out and take it.
Now, let's dance a while.

She said nothing ever happens
if you don't make it happen.
And if you can't laugh, then smile.

But after a while
you realize time flies.
And the best thing that you can do
is take whatever comes to you.
'Cuz time flies.

And laughing under summer showers;
That's still the way I see you now.

How does time break down?
with no marker, things slow down.
A conference of the strange,
and your family is deranged.

I could tell you what I'm thinking,
while we sit here drinking,
But I'm not sure where to start.

You see, there's something wrong here,
I'm sorry if I'm not clear,
Can you stop smoking your cigar?

And the coat you wore to Alton Towers
Is still the way I see you now.
