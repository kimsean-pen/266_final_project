Workin' on the road across this great, big world
Yeah, I've been rollin' like a stone and never get back home
Yes, I've been long gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

I've been across the ocean to the South Sea isles
Yeah, I travelled to the East and West for miles and miles and miles
And I've been long gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

Across the world (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name

Oh, I wouldn't change the things that do for anything
But I'd just like to hear the message of the streets again
Give me a ticket
'Cause, boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

It may be kind of homely but it sure is sweet
Industrial Revolution put it on its feet
But it's a long, long way
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues

Across the world I've seen (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name

I go and stay a while and all the folks I meet
They say, "You won't stay long, you got them travellin' feet
You'll soon be long gone
'Cause, boy, you got the rest of the world blues"

(Across the world) Across the world I've seen
(People and places) People and places
(Everywhere I've been) Don't you know it could be the same?
But with a different name

(Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
(Everywhere I've been)

Across the world I've seen (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But you know, it's got a different name

(Across the world)
(People and places)
(Everywhere I've been)
