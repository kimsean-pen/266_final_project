Strange things can happen
When you least expect them to
Strange things can happen to you
Out of the darkness
Into the blue
I've been waiting a long time for you
Ooh the thrill of it all, tonight
Move your body to mine aaah

La la la feel the music
La la la dance music
La la la feel the music
La la la dance music
(Dance music, dance music)
(Dance music, dance music)

Nothing else matters
Locked in your sweet embrace
Nothing compares to you
Ooh the thrill of it all, tonight
Move your body to mine aaah

La la la feel the music
La la la dance music
La la la feel the music
La la la dance music

Music makes me wanna dance
Wanna dance with you
Music makes me wanna dance
Wanna dance with you
Ooooh the thrill of it all
Ooooh the thrill of it all
Dance dance dance dance dance dance dance music
Dance dance dance dance dance dance dance music

La la la feel the music
La la la dance music
La la la feel the music
La la la dance music

Music makes me wanna dance
Wanna dance with you
Music makes me wanna dance
Wanna dance with you
Dance (dance music, dance music)
Dance (dance music, dance music)
Music
