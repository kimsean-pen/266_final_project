you watched a lukewarm ocean from an archipelago
i fell asleep to the sounds of the cape as water rushed my nose
and i swore by my own soul that god would right our wrongs
and then you faked a smile and whispered to me, "Je te fais confiance, so don't go home tired and alone"
if nothing becomes, at least soft light lay on us
