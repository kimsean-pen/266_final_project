Breathe this air

I wake and I miss the sea
What can I miss of the ether?
I sleep and I wish for not a thing at all
But the rest of the rest that will take me
The rest of the rest that will take me
Breathe air
Now, which of these things, mother
Will give the dust less age?
For none of them was or will be
But they're all given, find me
(Can you breathe?)
Now, which of these things, mother
Will give the dust less age?
For none of them was or will be
But they're all given, find me
I wake and I miss the sea
What can I miss of the ether?
I sleep and I wish for not a thing at all
But the rest of the rest that will take me
The rest of the rest that will take me
Now, which of these things, mother
Will give the dust less age?
(Breathe air)
For none of them was or will be
But they're all given, find me
The sea, the air, the earth are not a thing at all
The sea, the air, the earth are not a thing at all
But the rest of rest of
The sea, the air, the earth are not a thing at all
But the rest of the rest of
The sea, the air, the earth are not a thing at all
