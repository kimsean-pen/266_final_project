You pulled your things off the walls, took all that was yours.
You packed your books into boxes and placed them at the door.
You emptied your half of our closet, and went through the drawers.
Taking it all for granted and left what was left for me on the floor.

And still I"m pouring my heart out to you, trying to move you.
Still I"m pouring my heart out to you, trying to get you to stay.
Still I"m pouring my heart out to you, trying to move you.
Still I"m pouring my heart out to you, trying to get you to stay.

And I said, "What about this? What about that? Don"t you remember the good times?
What about this? What about that? Don"t you remember our life?"
She said, "What about this? And what about that? Don"t you remember the hard times?
What about this? And what about that? Don"t you remember our lives?"

And I said, "No, wait. (No, wait)."
And she said, "No, it"s too late. (No, it"s too late)."
And I said, "Wait, please stay. (Wait, please stay)."
But she said, "No, I"m going away. (I"m going away)."

And I said, "No, you cannot go."
And I said, "Wait, please stay."
She said, "No, I have to go. It"s too late, I"m going away.
And there"s nothing in the world that you could say to make me stay."
