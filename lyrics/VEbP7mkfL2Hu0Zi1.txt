Can't you tell that I'm anxious?
Don't you know that I
I didn't want this at all?
Can't you see that it makes me sick
When I act overconfident about nothing?

I'm not feeling the way
No, I'm not feeling the way that you want me to
I'm just peeling away
That big, thick skin you want me to put on display

I'm the same as I
I was a week ago
But everyone's saying that I
I'm not at, I'm not at all
The same and it's become unusual
And everyone says that I
I got it, I got it all

You should know that I'm thankful
Even though I feel stuck
Just remember I envy you
Because you don't have to fake anybody at all

I'm not feeling the way
No, I'm not feeling the way they expect me to
I'm not pulling away
See, I'm just pulling the same shit on a different day

I'm the same as I
I was a week ago
But everyone's saying that I
I'm not at, I'm not at all
The same and it's become unusual
And everyone says that I
I got it, I got it all

It's the same as it
It was a week ago
But everyone's saying that it
It's not at, It's not at all
The same and it's so fucking difficult
How nobody's there until
You've got it, you've got it all

I'm the same as I was a week ago
But everyone's saying that I'm... oh, fuck

I'm the same as I
I was a week ago
But everyone's saying that I
I'm not at, I'm not at all
The same and it's become unusual
And everyone says that I
I got it, I got it all

It's the same as it
It was a week ago
But everyone's saying that it
It's not at, It's not at all
The same and it's so fucking difficult
How nobody's there until
You've got it, you've got it all
