Do you dare to taste her soul
Do you like to trick control
Did you think this world was real
Realize this was the deal

She's ether fire
Burns away all the dire
You will feel her touch for a while
For a while

She's eternity behind her disguise
You have almost seen a world in her eyes
But you've known that it would never be born
She's flown away like a leaf in a storm

Do you see her through the waves
Do you think it's her who saves
With a blink of radiant eye
Would you really dare to try?

She's like a fawn
Just appears and then gone
What remains will be just this one song
This one song

She's eternity behind her disguise
You have almost seen a world in her eyes
But you've known that it would never be born
She's flown away like a leaf in a storm

She's bliss (she's bliss)
She's ether (she's ether)
She's dark (she's dark)
She's nirvana

She's eternity behind her disguise
You have almost seen a world in her eyes
But you've known that it would never be born
She's flown away like a leaf in a storm
