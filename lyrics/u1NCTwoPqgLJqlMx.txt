I found you so I was never poor
Just to live that lucky
Then throw every day to a pack of wolves
You don't see when you're not looking
Don't wake up
I'm waiting for the sounds of night
When everyone's asleep I just hope to put this right

My Dance with the Lotus fades
My Dance with the Lotus fades
I danced until I fell behind and forgot the steps I love
My Dance with the Lotus fades
My Dance with the Lotus waits
I danced until I couldn't lead you anywhere that's good

I found you
So I was never bored
A little lost like rising smoke
Got all these dreams and you're in every one
I let you think I wasn't wishing

Don't wait up I'm waiting for the sound of night
Don't wake up, oh I just need this time
Alone with the sky that forgives me silently
And when the sun rises, when the sun rises
My Dance with the Lotus fades

My Dance with the Lotus fades
My Dance with the Lotus fades
I danced until I fell behind and forgot the steps I love
My Dance with the Lotus fades
My Dance with the Lotus waits
I danced until I couldn't lead you anywhere that's good

Dance, dance, dance...
Fades, fades, fades...
