Yeah
Alright

Yeah
Alright

Two skies
Watching it all fading
Two skies
Living it all fading

Two skies
Watching it all fading
Two skies fading
One's abating

Two suns
Living it all dying
Two suns fighting
One's abiding

Two suns
Watching them both fighting
Two suns
Seeing them both dying

Two suns
Watching them both fighting
Two suns fighting
One's abiding

Two skies
Seeing them both dying
Two skies fading
One's abating

Crack pipes, needles, PCP, and fast cars
Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star
When I feel like talking I never be wrong
If I feel like walking you best come along
I close my windows, crank the heat up high
Till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die

I'm a
Midnight fistfight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die

I'm a
Midnight fistfight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die
Alright

I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die
Alright

Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die
'Cause I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die, ye-ah
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
I'm a stupid motherfucker if I die, I die
Alright

Yeah
Alright
Yeah
Alright
