It's getting closer to the end
Every part of me
And then disaster takes it's toll
And now I'm left with only me

Maybe sorrow plays a role
When you feel unkind
Your abuses will let her stand in a line
Forever lost in time

Save me, save me
Before I drown
Save me, save me
Before I drown

It's getting closer to the end
I look back and smile
We conquered every single bump in my road
Made it all worth while

Just remember how I cared
When it came crashing down
I'd like to toast to all those
Angels that were always hangin' 'round

Save me, save me
Before I drown
Save me, save me
Before I drown, drown, oh, oh

Maybe life ain't what it seems
'Cause it's all a dream, forgive me
Sometimes I feel like a fool
'Cause I'm so uncool, forgive me
