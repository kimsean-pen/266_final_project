I dont' wanna loose
This good thing
That I got If I do, now
I would surely
I got to, I got to lose a lot

'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know

I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightn'in
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood

I'm not superstitous...

About what?
About you
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnning
Spinning
Baby I'm in a trance

Your love is better
Than anything I know

I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood

I dont see that women
To feel my loving colour
You got me seeing
She can really see
That I can't get enough

It's just one touch
From you baby
You know it just means so much

I said it's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock
on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
