The web that makes the role of the slave encases you
The last worker of this charade
Ashamed and blamed
From anger to hopelessness
That pulls your will
Undress the blood

Drowning in the black blood
Your attitude enslaves you in traps that steal your ambitions
Your solitude encases you in webs
You are the prisoner

Force open the locks of your shameless desire
Put both your feet inside the fire
Let go of this continuous deploy
Set it free
And breath
