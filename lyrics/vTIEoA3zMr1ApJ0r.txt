Bad dreams ricochet ricochet
Walking talking endlessly
Dancing dancing on my tongue
Paris scream avalanche avalanche
Talking talking in my sleep
Dancing dancing on my tongue

Where the road meets wild
And concrete meets the river
Young and wild shake and shiver
And your eyes talk to the blind

Where the wind made the house go tired
Fall to the ground from the voice you speak in
Bored when you're not sleeping
Tired and awake

Bad dreams ricochet ricochet
Walking talking endlessly
Dancing dancing on my tongue
Paris scream avalanche avalanche
Talking talking in my sleep
Dancing dancing on my tongue

Cold where skin meets fire
Where letters burn your lips
Where reason seems careless
And the desperate lead the fight

And when she tells me she's in love with me
In a room above light
You could pick me from a field of lies

Where the road meets wild
And concrete meets the river
Young and wild shake and shiver
And your eyes talk to the blind

Where the wind made the house go tired
Fall to the ground from the voice you speak in
Bored when you're not sleeping
Tired and awake

Bad dreams ricochet ricochet
Walking talking endlessly
Dancing dancing on my tongue
Paris scream avalanche avalanche
Talking talking in my sleep
Dancing dancing on my tongue
