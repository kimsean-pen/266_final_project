At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

Oh! Here we go, y'all

Yesterday is history, oh!
You gotta get through it
Tomorrow is a mystery, so
Let's just do it

And even when the rain falls you and I will stand tough***
No matter what you go you go through, I'll never leave you

So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of this song (song)
Together is where we belong (-long)
Never stop dreaming, keep holding on

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

When it's been a long day
I don't know if giving up, if it ain't okay
And we don't care what the world say
To spread love is the only way

So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of this song (song)
Together is where we belong (-long)
Never stop dreaming, keep holding on

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

We keep falling but the
World keeps spinning and I
Might stop winning just as long as I got you by my side

We keep falling but the
World keeps spinning and I
Might stop winning but I know that we're gonna be alright

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...

At the end of the day, some you win, some you don't
So I'm glad that I'm here with some friends that I know
Always there with a smile saying "You're not alone"
Singing La, La La La, que sera...
