Curse the swinish church,
Of the impostor god,
The psalms of the foul,
Lowly piggish liturgies,
Played by the odious whores,
Worshiping the rotting fish.
The fall of the limp God
You shall suffer and die.

Denounce Jesus Christ,
May his followers rot.
The foul Deceiver
and all his feeble works.
Praise to the One,
Who drove the nails,
And hail to the One,
Who thrust the spear.

Christ's sleep is deep,
The keys shall not,
Open the doors.
Death awaits at the gates.

Denounce Jesus Christ,
May his followers rot.

Curse the swinish church,
Of the impostor god,
The psalms of the foul,
Lowly piggish liturgies,
Played by the odious whores,
Worshiping the rotting fish.
The fall of the limp God
You shall suffer and die.
