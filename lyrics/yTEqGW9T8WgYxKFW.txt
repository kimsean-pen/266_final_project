Useless, nervous, but tasteful...
Whatever happened to graceful, judgment, patience?
How did I do you wrong?
Time goes slowly when you're feeling guilty
Think about the boundaries that you pushed
Wandering broken limbs, born to resist
And you make things much worse for me, only me
Don't tear me at the seams
Just cut all ties that are choking me
"Don't you listen to him"
The best advice that I've been given
But I guess I didn't listen
And you will always be useless, nervous but tasteful...
Whatever happened to graceful, judgment, patience?
How did I do you wrong
Did you wish for a quick death?
Was It worth it in the end
This is no longer your place
I'm glad to see you go to waste
But I'm starting to feel different
When it's your father that I hate
How does it taste to not relate?
Don't tear me at the seams
Just cut all ties that are choking me
"Don't you listen to him"
The best advice that I've been given
But I guess I didn't listen
And you will always be useless, nervous but tasteful...
Whatever happened to graceful, judgement, patience
How did I do you wrong
Patience is no virtue for you
The waiting, self-defeating
You can suffer from the truth
So condescending, you deserve it and you know it too
"Don't you listen to him"
The best advice that I've been given
But I guess I didn't listen
And you will always be useless, nervous but tasteful...
Whatever happened to graceful, judgment, patience?
How did I do you wrong?
