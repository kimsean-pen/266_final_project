A too mortal war
And simple mind
I'm standing beside myself
Standing beside myself
Cut and run
Take what you paid for
Cut and run
Hole in the wall
Get what you give
And take what you paid for
Faith caving in
And blind lead blind
And i stand beside myself
Standing beside myself

Cut and run
Take what you paid for

Cut and run
Take what you paid for

Hole in the wall
Get what you give
And take what you paid for
Wall to wall
A too mortal war
And simple mind
I'm standing beside myself
Standing beside myself
A too mortal war
