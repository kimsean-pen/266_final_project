Sometimes I just don't feel like waking up
wanna stay inside my dreams
sometimes I feel like I am breaking up
do you know just how that feels

Hope is for the hopeful
it's a dream that never dies
safe is for the faithful
I see it in your eyes

And I got angels on my side
I got angels flying high
and everything will be alright
‘cause I got angels on my side

I need the people that I really love
to only give me truth
don't fake, I can't take it
my heart is close to breaking
it reminds me of my youth

Hope is for the hopeful
it's a dream that never fades
faith is for the faithful
And I will now be

‘Cause I got angels on my side
I got angels flying high
and everything will be alright
‘cause I got angels on my side

Everything will be alright
everything will be alright,
everything will be alright,
everything will be alright.

Everything will be alright,
‘cause I got angels on my side.
Oh, yeah.

Can you see them?
Can you see them?

I got angels on my side
angels flying high
and everything will be alright
‘cause I got angels on my side.

I got angels, you got angels,
everybody got their angels on their side,
everything's gonna be alright
You got angels, I got angels
everybody got their angels by their side,
it's alright, it's alright.
I got angels, you got angels,
everybody got an angel by their side,
we got angels on my side.
I got angels, you got angels,
everybody got their angels by their side,
oh, yeah.
