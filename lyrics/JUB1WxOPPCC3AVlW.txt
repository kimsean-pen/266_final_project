Now I'm not feeding off you
I will rearrange your scales if I can, and I can
Marching to the ocean, marching to the sea, I had a hat
I dropped it down and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever

I wish to meet each one of you
And you meet you, if I can, and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go

Now I'm not feeding off you
I will rearrange your scales if I can, and I can
I wish to meet each one of you, and you meet you
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you

Carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy
(Take away the scattered bones of my meal)
Wherever, wherever you go
