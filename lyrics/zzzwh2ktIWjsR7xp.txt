It's the price I guess
for the lies I've told
that the truth, it no longer thrills me

Why can't we laugh,
when it's all we have?
Have we put these childish things away?
Have we lost the magic that we once had?

In the end, in the end,
there's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end,
it's time for us to lose our weary minds.

Will you dance with me,
like we used to dance,
and remember how to move together.

You are the torch,
and it all makes sense.
I've waited here for you forever
I've waited here for you forever

In the end, in the end,
there's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end,
it's time for us to lose our weary minds.

We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We are lost'til we learn how to ask
So please, please, just ask

In the end, in the end,
there's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end,
it's time for us to lose our weary minds.
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
