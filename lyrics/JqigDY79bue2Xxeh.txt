So why the sudden change
And what's this all about?
I know they speak your name
But where's the sound right now?
I can't stop praying you'll hear me play.
I know that I'll be with you there someday.
So where the hell's my hope
And why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot
But I won't let this die.
I know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
And another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight.
Can I pull out all the stops
And get out of this town?
I want to make you proud
But I really don't know how.
I know it's not helping to hear me say
"I wish it was me in the car that day."
Though something made me stop and think of what you said.
You know it meant a lot
But I was just a kid
One with all these dreams of growing up and playing music on the road.
I've been screaming all these years and thinking of you both.
So where's my hope
And why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot
But I won't let this die.
I know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
And another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight.
I wrote this note
Because I never even told you.
You know I've got some things to sing about
Like we were young and holding true
To all these songs that always made us pull through
And now I've got some words that I'll write down.
I'm sending this shit out.
So where's my hope
And why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot
But I won't let this die.
I know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
And another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight.
So where's my hope
And why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot
But I won't let this die.
I know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
And another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight.
So where the hell's my hope
And why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot
But I won't let this die.
I know I've got this friend up in the atmosphere
And another reason not to fear the sky
No, not tonight. no, not tonight
