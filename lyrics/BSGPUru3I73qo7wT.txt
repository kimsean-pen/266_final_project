Tell me again what you believe
Won't believe, 'bout anything
Somebody's thinking, what are ackes

Tell me I'm no one
I've been like a thief
Hole like the water
It's all around me
And the second before
The moments you leave
Just let me say this

Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home

Tell me again what you believe
Let one thing be broken
Close the door
And leave within deep hole, and

Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home

Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
