Take This Life And This Form, One And All
Wish That I Could Give You More, Gonna Have To Break The Law
I've Got More To Give Then I First Thought To Give
We'll Have To Make A Pact Or Something Like That

Something Good, A Little Trouble In Your Neighborhood
An Understanding That You're Understood
Oh, I Kinda Wish You Would

Give Yourself To The World, Baby Girl
Spread Your Wings And Uncurl, To The World
You've Got More To Give, Then You First Thought To Give

We'll Have To Make A Pact Or Something Like That Or Something Like That

Something Good, A Little Trouble In Your Neighborhood
An Understanding That You're Understood
Oh, I Kinda Wish You Would
Something Real, Another Feeling That You Never Feel
Another Reason That You Wanna Be Alive Just To Watch The Bruises Heal

Something Good, A Little Trouble In Your Neighborhood
An Understanding That You're Understood
Oh, I Kinda Wish You Would
Something Real, Another Feeling That You Never Feel
Another Reason That You Wanna Be Alive Just To Watch The Bruises Heal
