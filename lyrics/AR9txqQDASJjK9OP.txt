I was once like you
Used to be like you
Embraced the same horizons
And shared the setting suns

I was once like you
But the surroundings are different
Now the darkness is different
I used to be like you

But if I can't erase you
If I can't face this alone
I might be there one day

Someday, someday
With arms wide open
Someday, someday
With arms wide open

The universe is now a darkened room
And even still nothing's starlit
I'm here alone
Is this void? It's devastating
I feel like I have lost my armor
I feel like I have lost my armor

Someday, someday
With arms wide open
Someday, someday
With arms wide open

With my arms wide open
My arms wide open

So I can't just erase you
Can't do this alone
I'll be there that day

Someday, someday
With my arms wide open
Someday, someday
With my arms wide open

Someday, someday
Someday, someday
