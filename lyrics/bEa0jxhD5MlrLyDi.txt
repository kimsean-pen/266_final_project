Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right
For every win

Someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale, yeah, yeah, say
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop be doop

Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
All you gotta do is say shoop be doop
(Shoop) Shoop de doop (Shoop be doo)

Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop (My love, uh)
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry

Life never tells us the when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find your point when you will exhale, yeah, yeah, say
Shoop, shoop, (shoop be doo) shoop be doop

(Shoop, shoop, shoop) shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, (shoop be, shoop be, shoop be)
Say shoop, say shoop, say shoop be, say shoop ooh, say shoop be
Shoop uh be doop
Oh, hearts are often broken when there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
Sometimes you'll laugh
And sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
But when you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find your point when you will exhale, yeah
Say shoop be
(Shoop, shoop) Shoop be
Shoop be, shoop be, shoop be
(Shoop, shoop) Shoop be doop...
Doo, doo, shoop be, shoop be
Things alright you can say
Shoop, shoop (oh), shoop, shoop be doop
