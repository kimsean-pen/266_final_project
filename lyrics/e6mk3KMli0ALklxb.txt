(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
There ain't nothing I can do, I'm way to deep with you

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
I've only got my heart to lose
Should I be scared of you
In love, in love, in love, in love, in love
I'm in love with you
I'm in love

Now this picture's so clear
I want to trace you
And I'll make no mistakes
I won't erase you
I can travel high
I can travel low
I can do that in my sight
You're in reach
You're the perfect match
Ooh I'm falling

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
There ain't nothing I can do, I'm way to deep with you

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
I've only got my heart to lose
Should I be scared of you
In love, in love, in love, in love, in love
I'm in love with you
I'm in love

Like a star when it falls it lights up the sky
Found a love, proper nice
It makes me fly
When I'm all alone in my world
I can feel you touching me
In my thoughts
In my mind
You come carry me
Ooh I'm falling

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
There ain't nothing I can do, I'm way to deep with you
(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
I've only got my heart to lose
Should I be scared of you

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
There ain't nothing I can do, I'm way to deep with you
(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
I've only got my heart to lose
Should I be scared of you

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)

(Catch me, catch me I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you)
