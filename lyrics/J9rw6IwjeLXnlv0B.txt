Well I just heard
The news today
It seems my life
Is gonna change
I close my eyes
Begin to pray
Then tears of joy
Stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know
If I'm ready
To be the man
I have to be
I'll take a breath
I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe
We've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
I'll show you everything, oh yeah
With arms wide open (wide open)

If I had just one wish
Only one demand
I hope he's not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
I'll show you everything, oh yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
