When I scroll back through our recent days
Try to understand how we could forget
We made a promise to one another
that nothing would ever break what we had
Now we never talk when we fall apart
We never talk when we fall apart

We pretend we're OK, surrounding ourselves
with one-way friendships and so-called friends

I know we got used to new us,
and I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there where we are
I know we got used to new life,
and I don't want to be there
No, I don't want to be there where we are

Silence fallen between
All the doors are locked,
all the words unsaid,
and we're still afraid of time
Started to keep ourselves
at a distance that we could control
Not too close
Not too far
Now we never talk when we fall apart
We just never talk when we fall apart
We pretend we're OK by filling up our inner space
with little hates and so-called love

I know we got used to new us,
and I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there where we are
I know we got used to new life,
and I don't want to be there
No, I don't want to be there where we are

I know we got used to new us,
and I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there where we are
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there where we are
So walk away with me
