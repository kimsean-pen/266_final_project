Okay, alright, uh huh

What a fine day
After we spa
Netflix and chill and we pick some new dogs
She sent for my Uber 'cause she wanted some dick

'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate, that's when we started to kiss

Hooba stank. hooba stank
Swim walk and swag
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the ride
She's a creepy creepy witch with heck of a rise

'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate, that's when we started to kiss

Wee little gets my veiny eye
Beachwood is where she resides
So taking what is mine
Mine, oh mine

What a fine day
After we spa
Netflix and chill and we pick some new dogs
She sent for my Uber 'cause she wanted some dick

'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate, that's when we started to kiss

Hurricane junkhead melody lounge
Protien shake, oh
It's so easy, it's almost a crime

'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate narcissist
'Cause I'm a dreamdate, that's when we started to kiss

When we started to kiss

Wee little gets my veiny eye
Beachwood is where she resides
So taking what is mine
