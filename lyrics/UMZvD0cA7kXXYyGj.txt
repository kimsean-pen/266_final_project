Swimming at night
We've dug this hole
The water's fine
I wonder how far down it goes
Down it goes...
Down it goes...

The stars above have lost their shine
And so, my love, departs our sight

The unending plains project a void
Where lovers gawk in pantomime

(scream: So let me up?)

Shallow means, deep ends
When the regret sinks in
Pressure erupts
Which way is up

Swimming at night
We've finally hit, hit...
We've finally hit bottom...!
Swallowing promises back into our lungs
Losing direction of our affections
Alright...

Shallow means, deep ends
When the regret sinks in
Pressure erupts
Which way is up

Down it goes...
Down it goes...
