Every day, dreaming
Of a time and a place not far away
Every time, I begin
Feeling fine cos I know I'm going
Up up up oh oh
Up up I know I'm going
Up up up oh oh
Up up I know I'm going
Up up up oh oh
Up up I know I'm going
Up up up oh oh
Up and away with you
Maybe you know
Where to go when you feel
Like the world wants to bring you down
Maybe you know
That we all wanna feel like we make a difference
Do you believe
Do you believe
Do you believe
I've got what it takes
Do you believe
Do you believe
Do you believe
I'm gonna make it to the top
I'll never let you down and
I'll never let you go
You make me feel like
I wanna take it all the way
I know that you're the one and
I just want you to know
You make me feel like
I'm a superstar
I'll never let you down and
I'll never let you go
You make me feel like
I'm gonna make it
I wish I could
Make you believe in you the way I do
The things I do, I do for you
You... I.Know
I-I Know
I Know
I know that you're the one and
You make me feel like
I'm a superstar
(I'm a superstar...)
I know that you're the one and
You make me feel like
I'm a superstar
I know that you're the one and
You make me feel like
I'm a superstar
I know that you're the one and
I just want you to know
You make me feel like
I'm a superstar
