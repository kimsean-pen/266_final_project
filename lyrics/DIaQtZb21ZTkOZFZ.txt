Oh. I know I'm drunk man.
Ladies and gentleman I forgot my favorite man sittin' over there.
His name is:
Mistadobalina
Mistabobdobalina

1:
Mistadobalina, Mistabobdobalina
Mistabobdobalina won't you quit?
You really make me sick wit your porgalit behavior
Your daughter make me feelin' that a army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave you little Rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid
Because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin to mock me
Now you in your car on a mission tryin ta hawk me
But it isn't happenin' you porgalit pose
You used to front bigtime now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of the pair you adopted
You used to make fun of, but now you want to rock it
Don't you gotta kick it wit tha homies?
But del is already hipped to your cronies
But ded rocks like we never have seen her
But nobody rocks like Mista... Mista... Mistadobalina

2: Ooh! Ooh! Mistadobalina
You thought you could manipulate, you thought you could fool me
Ooh! Ooh! Mistadobalina
Teach wizard put me on the stump but then he schooled me
Kids could be frogilante, just wait and see
First he was my money grip, then he stole my honey dip
Mistadobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-timer
rezembles Anja Mama
wit jeans and a dirty, white hoody
he seems like he wouldn't be a snake, or would he?
disguizes come in all sizes and shapes
notice the nice side of snakes
last year all the fans teach you
took a lot of time before the del could see through
the mask, all I had to do was ask the hemfera and quama
my crew soon found out they were bamay
porgalit bowl with the strength of Hurcules
the way you on my **** must really hurt your knees
you need to take me and quit bein a groupie
ever since I did a little show in Bataloopie
I never saw a groupie like you
but what is funny is you wanted to be down wit my crew
but del is not down wit any clowns of justice
just this is to impress the Professor Dobalina
because you don't impress me Dobalina
the stlye of justice is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind, and the heart so you should start
by rememberin' you got ta pay a fee Dobalina

Ooh! Ooh! Mistadobalina
