I am the healer of all diseases
I push my drug in this world
Strategic torment and fake relief
The tricky strings that I pull
With infantry blood and mothers' tears
I wash the hands of this court

I believe in nothing, believe in no release
As darkness rises without fire, war is the remedy

I breed the hunger and spread the thirst
I burn the wheat that I sow
Embodied essence of contradiction
I bend the steel that I forge
I am the answer to every need
I am the minister of war

"Nihil de corum sententia dicturus sum
Qui turpissinam servitutem deditionis nomine appellant
Animi est ista mollitia non virtus
Paulisper inopiam ferre non posse
Qui se ultro morti offerant tacilius reperiuntur
Quam qui dolorem patienter ferant"

Burn this world to the ground
Tear down whatever you encounter, exterminate all
And make no prisoners or slaves, kill'em, destroy their heritage
For every soldier falling down behead ten of them
As the only order is to maraud 'till we dominate
Inflamed with the anthem you will rise, slay without mercy the enemy

I am the bleeding, I am the scar
I cauterize through my sword
Perpetual fire that darkens stars
As I'm the rise, I am the fall
