All the lying and cheating
Will surely bite you
Dishonesty tears you apart
And will eat you
All the anger and pain
And the suffering and the shame
And the voices in your brain
Will surely haunt you
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens, I can't break through

All the anger, the pain
And the suffering and the shame
And the voices in your brain
Will really haunt you
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go
Let the guilt go

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens, I can't break through

Now we waste our lives away!
Letting guilt lead the way!

I'm such a stupid fuck
Listening to my head and not my gut
Constantly thinking, thinking, thinking
And thinking and thinking and thinking
And thinking, and thinking, and thinking
And thinking, I'm screaming!
Now we waste our lives away!
Letting guilt lead the way!

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens, I can't break through

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens, I can't break through
