I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
You are crazy
Maybe you are crazy
Maybe you are crazy
Maybe we are crazy
Possibly
