Let the horizon lead
On through the ether of the night
Dragged across the burning heavens
Flying homeward like a burdened soul

Shattered into a million brighter stars
We fragile, naked, rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creations core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Now is the time to leave
We lie awake, we stand afire
At the edge of the world
Above, a myriad of light
Below, the mantle of the stars
And strangely they fall

Shattered into a million brighter stars
We fragile, naked, rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creations core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Shattered into a million brighter stars
We fragile, naked, rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creations core

An end beyond compare
An end beyond compare
Iridium
