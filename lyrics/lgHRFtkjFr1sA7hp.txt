Take a leap,
Of faith with me,
If you believe,
Honestly,
That I am yours,
And you are mine,
I know you're scared,
And so am I.

Cos I know that love can be so strong
And yet so frail,
And there ain't no guarantee that
You and me won't fail,

But I'm dying to try.
I'm dying to try.
I'll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart
Everyday.
I'll give you it all,
But I'm not going to lie.

Cos no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly,
Will ever learn how to fly

Oh but I'm dying to try
I'm dying to try
(I'm dying to try
(No one can promise that love will ever learn how to fly)
Yeah
I'm dying to try
I'm dying to try
I'll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart
Everyday
I'll give you it all,
But I'm not going to lie.
O cos no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly
O cos no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly.
But I'm dying to try

Take a leap,
If you believe.
