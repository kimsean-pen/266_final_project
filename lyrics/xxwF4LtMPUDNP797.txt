So we've been frozen
Battered and broken
Soon sublimation
Will make us weightless

As God is my witness
We could dodge the danger
So grab the hand of a stranger
The mother and the father
And the sun come down
It's summertime
Ohh-ohh-ohh
It's summertime

These persecutions
(We take communion from this coming hurricane)
Stubborn and shameless
(Take of her body, take her blood, her gold grenades)
The war is over
(And now these promises precede a golden age)
Let our courage take us

As God is my witness
We can dodge the danger
So grab the hand of a stranger
The mother and the father
And the sun come down
It's summertime
Ohh-ohh-ohh
It's summertime

Sun comes down
It's summertime
Ohh-ohh-ohh
It's summertime
