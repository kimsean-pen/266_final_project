I was feeling rather good
Should've touched some wood
Here she comes again
Reaching out to bend my ear
She's worth another look
All the time it took
Pleasing to the eye
How can I just disappear
It ain't clear, no

She's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh I just might

I could have let her in
Give her just a spin
Let her think it's love
Better rise above it all
She's knocking at the door
Seems to want some more
Never gets the clue
What am I to do she'll fall
And she might call, oh no

I say she's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh I just know

She could do me well
I can always tell
She's ready for the kill
But I think that I will go
Sure I'm going to see
Something just for me
Till it comes along
When it's feeling wrong I'll know
Got to take it slow

She's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh I might

She's a bright and blazing star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Sensitive to light
