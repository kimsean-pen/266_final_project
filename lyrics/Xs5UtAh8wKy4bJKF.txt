What are the chances of three Libras
Three brothers

Hh take them back to the morning
Oh take them back where they may shine

And each drop of rain
Goes by in May
And I knew them
They are not to blame

Oh take me back to the morning
Oh take me back where I may shine

And if you need a hand put away your hand
And speak the words you will understand
Then you'll return to the morning
Then you'll return where you may shine, shine, shine
