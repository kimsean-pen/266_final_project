This is how we party
Foolin' with your body
C'mon, everybody
Can't get enough of you

Here we are, back in the game
Raise your hands and feel the rain
Got one thing you've got to try
Making many money, making big boys cry
Too bad that he's a liar
She's so cool, but her hair's on fire
Let me go; make me feel strong
We've got to set it off till the break of dawn
This is how we do it
When somebody want to turn you down
You got to keep on movin'
Don't let nobody catch you, hit you
Get you down to the ground
Here we say...

C'mon, everybody, we can get it together
The sun will shine in any kind of weather
Just stop trippin' and change your feel
We come to party when we come around here
Lisa lives; she never lies
Simon says no time to cry
Doing what we like
We can do it all night
This is how we do it
When somebody want to turn you down
You got to keep on movin'
Don't let nobody catch you, hit you
Get you down to the ground
Hear what we say...

I'm doing it for you
If you're doing it for me
Baby, we'll keep on movin'
Don't let 'em get you down
Just listen to the sound
