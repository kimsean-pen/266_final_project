Catch a fleeting glimpse
Then be on your way
Oh the end is near
If you choose to stay
This forsaken land
Torn by grief and strife
No it's not worth the value of your life

The smell of death lingers in the air
Bloodstained bodies scattered everywhere
In the distance
Thunder in the sky
See the sorrow
Hear the battlecry, battlecry
Battlecry

The carnage races on
Well into the night
As the sun creeps up
We see the morning light
On the battlefield
The tragedy of dawn
Through the crimson tide
We still carry on

The smell of death lingers in the air
Bloodstained bodies scattered everywhere
In the distance
Thunder in the sky
See the sorrow
Hear the battlecry, battlecry
Battlecry

Catch a fleeting glimpse
Then be on your way
Oh the end is near
If you choose to stay
This forsaken land
Torn by grief and strife
No it's not worth the value of your life

The smell of death lingers in the air
Bloodstained bodies scattered everywhere
In the distance
Thunder in the sky
See the sorrow
Hear the battlecry, battlecry
Battlecry

Battlecry
