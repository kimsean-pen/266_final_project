Soul destroyed
With clever toys
For little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable
It's a soul destroyed

You're free until you drop
You're free 'til you've had enough

And you don't understand
You've no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
Aeroplane do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable

Oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour

On politics and power that you don't understand
And no ripcord, no ripcord

No ripcord, no ripcord
The answer to your prayer
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
