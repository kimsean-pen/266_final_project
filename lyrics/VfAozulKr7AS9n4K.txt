you shouldn't hide but you always do
cause even when you're gone, I can see right through
you want disconnection
you want me there enough for two

pull a woollen blanket across my eyes
dream a quiet place for us to fight
oh no, your heart is broken
don't you think that's a little trite?

I climb where I can see
you're close but I won't reach
blank stare at the tv
CNN's on channel 3

in the passing lane on 1 and 9
stuck in sad, car stuck in drive
oh no, your heart is broken
well, you can have what's left of mine

I climb where I can see
you're close but I won't reach
blank stare at the TV
the howling II's on channel 3
oh, I drift off to sleep
while the snow falls on the screen
