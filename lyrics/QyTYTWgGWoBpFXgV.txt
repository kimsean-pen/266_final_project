You will find me - Alex & Sierra

Words are lost
Mouths are closed even through the silent parts
I take it all
Table talks getting through the car ride home
it could be a late night call
I take it all

Anger to hold
Leave me room for my imperfections
I'm a mess and you jump right in
If i drift in the wrong direction
You turned the tide and you calm the wind

Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
You'll find me 4x

Faint applause
Empty rooms even when the crowds all gone
You take it all
Lines are crossed even when my minds consumed
I never meant to bruise your heart
but you take it all

Anger to hold
Leave me room for my imperfections
I'm a mess and you jump right in
If i drift in the wrong direction
You turned the tide and you calm the wind

Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
You'll find me 4x

You leave me room for my imperfections
I'm a mess and you jump right in
And if i drift in the wrong direction
I turned the tied and you calm the wind

Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
Anytime, every time I get lost you'll find me you'll find me
You'll find me 5x
