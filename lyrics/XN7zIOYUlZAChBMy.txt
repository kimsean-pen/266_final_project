Take a walk in a ghost town
The sky is black as crows
They don't make cars as they used to here
Times they change
The factories closed

Take a ride on a ghost train
Stare at the windows
See time moves fast as a hurricane
But it's so strange
It feels so slow

Well sometimes it gets so cold down here
Where I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Hey I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in the ghost town (hey, hey, hey)

See the crash in the rust
See the ash in the dust
Feel it slipping through your hands
Falling on the shoes and the shoulders
of the ragged man

You see the pride and the shame
Like fire and the flame
Well it burns through every mind
And drops them like drunken soldiers
On the riverbanks

Well sometimes it gets so cold down here
Yeah I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Where I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in a ghost town

Yeah sometimes it gets so cold down here
Hey I swear it burns
The wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes
Sometimes it gets so dark in here
Oh I see it turn
The emptiness that moves within my soul
We on down in the ghost town
