I cannot wait
House of one hundred days
Wait for the white arms of Abel to
Tear me out of the waves, wet

I will not lay
Give you one hundred ways
For what I know isn't able to
Pull me up from the grave's bed

Oh santa sangre saint
Oh lift and sift the blood of shame
Undone, undone, the way we came
It's said you wait for forever, too

I cannot keep
So low, one hundred deep
Bent down, unwilling, unable to
Pull us out of the shade he said

I will not sleep
Show in one thousand ways
That I am willing as Abel to
Raise us up from the pavement

Oh santa sangre saint
Oh lift and sift the blood, our vein
Undone, undone, the ways of shame
It's said she waits for forever

I'll wait, I'll wait, till you've bled out
I'll wait, I'll wait forever

I'll come back when you've bled out

I'm saved
