I smacked your face
You fell in love
When I said fuck your mom
I looked at you
Said it's all over
I turned around and walked away
And you just grabbed my arm
I look at you said
I can't stay sober

Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals

Madness
Feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Madness
No one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world and let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Oh baby baby won't you break me
Won't you fantasize
About the time when we were lovers
I tried to phone you
Try to warn you but no compromise
I grabbed your ass under the covers

Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals

Madness
Feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Madness
No one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals

Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals

Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals

Madness
Feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Madness
No one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me
Come eat some chemicals
