Don't get me started love
I've had too much to drink
Had to much time to think
So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself
'Cause of what they think
About you
Next time go slow, slow, slow, yeah
Makes time go slow, slow, slow
Slow

Something's gotta give soon
Or I'm gonna lose it
Substance abuse it
And never come down, down
Fall off the deep end
And forget my English
What's the point of language?
If you don't say what you feel, ohh

So with that being said, oh
To all the bitch ass hoes
That hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks
That just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass
That's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and mimosas
Champagne and Cocaine
Help to get me through

Ten in the morning
And i'm skipping breakfast
And drinking a beverage
To ignore it all, oh-oh
'Cause ignorance is bliss and
I've come to embrace it
It's all overrated
Except drugs and alcohol

So with that being said, oh
To all the bitch ass hoes
That hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks
That just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass that's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and mimosas
Champagne and Cocaine
Help to get me through

Slow, slow, slow
