Sweet woman, are you feeling right?
What was it that you did last night
You made me crazy, you made me fly
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye

Ooh, what's the matter with me
I'm just a runner, I was born free
Since I met you I can't leave you alone
Leaving now but I'll be coming home, I said

Keep it warm red, the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our, our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget, will you pretty one that your man
Your man is coming home?

Do you hear the rumor that's going around?
They say I'm ruined 'cos I've settled down
It's not true, well, maybe half and half
You know I love you but I still like a laugh

Ooh, feeling fine
I got it right for the first time
Sweet woman, I can't stay for long
Everybody will be proved wrong, I said

Keep it warm red, the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our, our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one that your man
Your man will be home

Like a gypsy, I need to roam
Don't worry, I'll be coming home
Need the danger, I need the thrill
I need to know what is over each hill

Ooh, I'm a different man
Still running but you understand
Since I met you, I can't leave you alone
Leaving now but I'll be coming home, I said

Keep it warm red, the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm red, warm for your man
Nobody's gonna take away our dreams to the plan

Keep it warm red, the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one that your man
Your man is coming home?

Your man, man is coming home
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one that your man
Your man is coming home?
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one
Don't forget, pretty, pretty one...
