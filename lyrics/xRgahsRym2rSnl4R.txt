Why do I live in a world which is not real?
Liquid swords of death. Depths of solitude. Nights of pure hatred. Hours of self mutilation
Why do I let my mind caress me like this?
Liquid swords of death. Depths of solitude. Nights of pure hatred. Hours of self mutilation
How can I let this slip through my suspicious mind?
I do not care about your opinions anymore. They mean nothing to me.
A reckless past catching up to me... and for what?
I demand answers, and they are not hard to find
This tormenting reality makes you dream of things you can never have, or will ever live to see
Life is so obscene, it fools the weak. It lets you dream eternally.
It sickens me and it pisses me off
I for one want to dream eternally, to see the injustice. To control my life and my situation
Solutions are rare and the answer lies in death. Death hails the courageous
Calling from beyond the cut of this blade. I need only to flick my wrist and the escape is at hand
