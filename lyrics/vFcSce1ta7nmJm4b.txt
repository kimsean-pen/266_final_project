Give me a smile
Give me your name girl
Give me a sign to get my way
And get what I came for, you
'Cause you don't come easy
Give me your hand
Come walk with me girl
Nothing's that far when you're near
So come even closer to me
Something so easy to do

And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms
Taking me deeper
Where all the pain goes

Give me a smile
Give me your name girl
Let them know that you're mine
And I'll do the same for you
'Cause our love comes easy

And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms
Taking me deeper
Where all the pain goes

And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms
Taking me deeper
Where all the pain goes
And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms
Taking me deeper
Giving me new life

You're mine
You're mine
