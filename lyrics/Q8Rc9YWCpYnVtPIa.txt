do you know Wim
he likes cities and I like him
do you know Wim
oh, just go and take an inner city train
and play a game and you'll meet him, Wim
do you know Wim
he likes cities and I like him

do you know Wim
he likes cities you'll find him
by the slot machines realizing dreams
it seems a very outstanding mark
that he writes a color postcard
twice a week go and seek for him
want to meet him, Wim

do you know Wim
he likes cities and I like him
do you know Wim
he likes cities and I like him
do you know Wim
oh, just go and see an cinema show
in the first row and watch him cry, him, Wim

sometimes he's not the same
sometimes he takes a plane to Vienna
maybe
he's filled up with pain
oh it's a shame
that you don't know Wim
he likes cities and I like him
that you don't know Wim
he likes cities and I like him
oh I do know Wim
I do know Wim
he likes cities
I like him
