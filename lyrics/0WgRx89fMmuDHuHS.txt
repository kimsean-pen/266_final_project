Hey lover
I'm questioning our love song

How did we get the words wrong?

Hey lover
The key's in the ignition
But nothing's in the engine
And just when I'm about to say
I'm sick of you, so go away
You do that little thing you always do
And then I know

I gotta wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you

(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
I gotta wanna, I only wanna

I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)

Hey lover, I'm screaming on the inside
I'm running but I can't hide

Hey lover, with everything we've been through
A fool would only doubt you and I doubt you
And just remember what I'm about to say
It's time to throw it all away

You look at me the way only you can do
And then I know

I gotta wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)

I gotta wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)

I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)

And just remember what I'm about to say
It's time to throw it all away
You look at me the way only you can do

I gotta wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
I gotta wanna, I only wanna
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
I gotta wanna, I only wanna
(I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die)
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
I gotta wanna, I only wanna
(I wanna be with you when the love is right
I wanna be with you even when we fight
I wanna be with you 'til the day we die)
I gotta gotta, I gotta be with you
Hey! I gotta be with you!
(Hey! I gotta be with you!)
