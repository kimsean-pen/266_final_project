I pursued the serpent
Eyes blindfolded
Words of wisdom sung to the deaf
Dancing in ashes, drowning in tears

The bloom of dissolution, like a shadow close to my skin
Let me stare through your eyes into the void they created

A barren wasteland where dark wind blows and the great old ones reign
Slowly carrying ourselves to the grave
We're sinking in the rivers bleak
And in the end only ghosts will know your name

Suffocating by the grace of time
Starving by the hand that feeds
Bury me in the soil
The weight of life becomes my curse
Vestiges of the past
Vestiges of the fallen
Woe is me
In atrophy we will remain
