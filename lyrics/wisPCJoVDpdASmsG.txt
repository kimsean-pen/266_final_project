Cry myself to sleep.
I... could hardly speak
Cause you stood on every word,
That I much heard
I look at you and lied with my lips I thought that I loved you
While my soul was asking why
Why am I surprised
I lost the faith in the truth and in turn I lost you
But I won't cry myself to sleep no stop start before it starts
Gonna find myself a pen and write down my heart
I won't cry myself to sleep, No don't let it go too far
Put it down on paper
The reasons were apart

I... where it's tough to see
Or even begin to understand a girl like me

I find it hard to say
Anything I'm feeling
So I will concentrate
The hurt I live and breathe in so I won't...

I won't cry myself to sleep no (stop start before it starts)
Gonna find myself a pen and write down my heart
I won't cry myself to sleep, no (and let it go too far)
Put it down on paper
The reasons were apart

Is there a good reason

I won't cry myself to sleep no (stop start before it starts)
Gonna find myself a pen and write down my heart
I won't cry myself to sleep, no I won't (and let it go too far)
Put it down on paper
