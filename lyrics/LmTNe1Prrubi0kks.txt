My girl's on a train
She's going far away
She's never coming back
She gives me heart attacks

Walking in the day
The sunshine's in my way
She's asking for a talk
Running down my block

She'll never be the same
She'll never be the same
And I'm the one to blame
When you got off that train
Off that train

Walking up the stairs
She doesn't even care
She's the one that left
Leading on the path

She left there torn
Pierced like a thorn
It was all my fault
She forgot about the call

She'll never be the same
She'll never be the same
And I'm the one to blame
When you got off that train
Off that train

I said that she's clich√©
She said: What did you say?
Of course I said nothing
Go sew your old buttons

In the garage
I gave you your corsage
It wasn't right
I forgot about the fight

She'll never be the same
She'll never be the same
And I'm the one to blame
When you got off that train
Off that train
