It's killing me
Yeah, the thing that you can do
That no one else can do to me at all

Am I wasting my time?
As I feel that I'll go out
And find someone's out of love too

And if I had to do it all again
I were to feel the love that I know you can send
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
When the wind blow her away
When the wind blow her away

And I saw you cry
So I know you didn't mean
To creep into my dreams just to turn me down

You say you feel so used
But it is you who turned it on
And used all of your chance just to bring me in

And everybody knows the games she plays
And every time she loses she runs away
Did I send love?
Did I move too close?
When the wind blow her away
When the wind blow her today
When the wind blow her away

But you can help me out
I want to love you again
But you can help me out
I want to love you again
'cause I feel so cold without sun
I've got to one I can't run, run

When the wind blow her away
When the wind blow her away
When the wind blow her away
