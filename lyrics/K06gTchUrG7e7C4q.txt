True romantics don't kiss for fun
Even for a moment of monotone
True romantics are monochrome
Rosy echoes metallic groans
In a misty wood two rose buds
Always in mid bloom, mid bloom
True romantics don't think alone don't think alone
They sit together on an oh oh oh opaque throne
Under one home two hearts making one whole
Their age may show but their one heart shall always glow
