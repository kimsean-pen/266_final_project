Been around the world and back this year
Told myself I wanna face this fear
But I don't think I can stand on my own
She's got eyes like spring, legs like the summer
Everybody says she looks just like her mother
But I think she wants that left alone

There's too many ways to say goodbye
But it's quite the opposite this time

Sometimes I can't help but say
I'm falling in love and it's scaring me
It came to me in a dream
Now all that's left is our empathy
But this is just the life I ordered
One step back and two steps forward
Sometimes I can't help but say
We're making history

Been around the world and back this year
I never wanted to be so sincere
I'm not a hero or a saint
But don't push me away
When you believed in me it brought us together
Everybody says that it won't last forever
Close your eyes, don't cut the ties, it makes sense

There's too many ways to say goodbye
But it's quite the opposite this time

Sometimes I can't help but say
I'm falling in love and it's scaring me
It came to me in a dream
Now all that's left is our empathy
But this is just the life I ordered
One step back and two steps forward
Sometimes I can't help but say
We're making history
Our history

You pulled me in like a tidal wave
And let ourselves just float away
With no direction, or a way to rewind
Yeah, you pulled me in like a tidal wave
Thought that it was my mistake
And we'd fall apart before I say goodbye
But it's quite the opposite this time

Sometimes I can't help but say
I'm falling in love and it's scaring me
It came to me in a dream
Now all that's left is our empathy
But this is just the life I ordered
One step back and two steps forward
Sometimes I can't help but say
We're making history
Our history
