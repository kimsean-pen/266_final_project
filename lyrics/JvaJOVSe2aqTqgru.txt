Daddy can be rough, that's why I can be tough
Kicks in even when it comes to little bit of love
On the ground to be stuffed, police put me in cuffs
Ain't a victim but I am a diamond in the rough

I'm illegal
Above the law

Illygirl, illygirl, illy
Illygirl, illygirl, illy
Illygirl, illygirl

Shirts, tops, tees, I'm always in tight jeans
I know Billie Jean and the Bruce Springsteen
I also know Palestine and Mujaheddin
Playing Tekken on the weekend, eating mango sleeves

I'm illegal
Above the law

Illygirl, illygirl, illy
Illygirl, illygirl, illy
Illygirl, illygirl

We be machine, I'm the stream with my team
I'm from England from Mitcham near Cheam
Have you heard my dream? Even Martin Luther's king
So put it down and I'ma try explain what it means

I'm illegal
Above the law

I'm illegal
