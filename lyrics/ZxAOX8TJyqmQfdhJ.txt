Noises, noises
Are all I hear when you speak
The point of it all left much faster than it crept to me
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold is fool's gold
Predictable in nature so it seems

They've clairvoyant
They created your dependency
They're clairvoyant
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold
Fool's gold, all
It's as if they already know all
It's as if they already know

They're clairvoyant
They're clairvoyant
Stuck in the lines that they prescribe
This can't be what we need
Recommended daily for dependency
Best of luck with your recovery
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold
Fool's gold, all
It's as if they already know all
It's as if they already know
