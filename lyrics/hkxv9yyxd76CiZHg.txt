Leave a light on in the wild
'Cause I'm coming in
A little blind
Dreamer of a lighthouse in the woods
Shining a little light to bring us back home

When to find you in the backyard
Hiding behind our busy lives
Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
To help us get back into the world

'Cause I know
I've seen you before
Won't you shine
Ah, a little light, ah
Ah, on us now

Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard
Won't you shine a little light
In your own backyard

Dreaming of a lighthouse in the woods
