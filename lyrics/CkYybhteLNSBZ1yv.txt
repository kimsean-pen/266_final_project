He'd had enough he couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him fed him by hand

Yeah i've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there staring into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye and then he died

Yeah i've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin it's not fit for living in
Yeah I will start again it can take forever and ever and ever
But I shall win

How many like him are there still
Who to us all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands blank and lost
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost

He'd had enough he couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him fed him by hand

Yeah i've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there staring into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye and then he died

Keep the world with all its sin it's not fit for living in
Yeah I will start again it can take forever and ever and ever
But I shall win

How many like him are there still
Who to us all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands blank and lost
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost

Beyond the realms of death
