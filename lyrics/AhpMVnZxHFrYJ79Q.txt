Take me away, directionless
It doesn't have to make any sense
Use what you have, I'll follow you
Use what you have, don't you worry now

Drifting in and out...

Choose what to be, take a side
What if I don't want to step out in the light
Give it to others, just let it go now
Give it to others, don't you worry now

Drifting in and out...
