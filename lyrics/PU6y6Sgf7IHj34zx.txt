I got a feeling that I cannot contain
I can't believe this moment
You've got your eyes locked on me
In my head I think it must be a mistake
But my heart says, take your chances
It could be this first dance is the "unexpected beautiful"
I can barely admit I've been longing for

Stay here in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'd take you anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you
'Cause I'm lost without you

I see it all aligned in front of my face
But like a shooting star fades
It could be gone just as fast as it came
I'm gonna take this moment and chase this fear right out of me
Come one day
I will have no regrets after today
'Cause the "unexpected beautiful"
I'm about to admit I've been longing for

Is staying in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'll follow anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you

Just stay here in my arms
Just stay here in my arms tonight

Stay here in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'd follow anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you

'Cause I'm lost without you
'Cause I'm lost without you
