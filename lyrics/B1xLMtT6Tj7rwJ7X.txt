Never seen such good things go so wrong
And everywhere we turn they're playing our song

I should have known someone so much like me
Would give me hell and send me to my knees

Love you're a strange fella
Won't you leave your mark on me

Love you're a strange fella
Won't you leave your mark on me

If we ever make sweet love again
I'm sure that it will be quite disgusting
Race to the end, race to the end

The memory of a ceremony so
Empty bitter boring and hollow
Hollow

But love you're a strange fella
Won't you leave your mark on me

May as well be forever
Love won't you come and punish me

Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
Sad lady you win
