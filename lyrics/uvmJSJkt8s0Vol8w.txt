Take me by your hand
Make me feel like a new man
It helps me understand, man
It helps me understand, man

Listen to the sad bands
Get drunk on weekdays me and myself and
It helps me understand, man
It helps me understand, man

Now she's with a different man
Hand in hand, well that used to be my hand
I don't understand, god please help me understand
So I'm taping bottles to my hands,
Breaking bottles cause I can, well it helps me understand
I'm staring at a blank wall waiting for the ceiling to fall
Well it helps me understand

I don't need her anymore
Where's the kid that we used to know gone?

I don't need her anymore
Where's the kid that we used to know?

He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone (Eee...)

Well the last time I had my eyes on you
Was the first time I really saw you
And to this day I have dreams of you
Yeah, my bed has kept that part of you
No one has your lips and your hair
Your lips and that stare
But I see you everywhere

I fucking go

So I'm taping bottles to my hands,
breaking bottles cause I can, well it helps me understand
I'm staring at a blank wall waiting for the ceiling to fall
