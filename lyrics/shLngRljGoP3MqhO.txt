Enslavement in destruction, I break the seal of my fate
Horrors build but broken still, blood will be my own
Everything you want from me, everything you dо
Broken in the folds of hate, this evil takes its form
Broken bones i gnaw, this earth to be my own
Agony I choose, this bloodlust endures

Tear my soul away
Unsheathe seal of death
Empty minds collapse
Enlightened in...

Agony for the chosen, twist the knife, you feel it still
Agony for the chosen, break the seal, you slowly die
Agony" for the chosen, heart pumps slow, little life left
Agony for the chosen, blood runs black, you've reached your end

Beating and clawing, you beg to me for life
Your life is mine, I skin your flesh from bloody bone

(solo - Gibbs)

Agony forthe chosen
Twist the knife, you feel it still
Agony for the chosen
Break the seal, you slowly die
Agony for the chosen
Heart pumps slow, little life left
Agony for the chosen
Blood runs black, as you seek your end
Enslavement in destruction, I break the seal of my fate
Horrors build but broken still, blood will be my own
Everything you want from me, everything you dо
Broken in the folds of hate, this evil takes its form
Broken bones i gnaw, this earth to be my own
Agony I choose, this bloodlust endures

Tear my soul away
Unsheathe seal of death
Empty minds collapse
Enlightened in...

Agony for the chosen, twist the knife, you feel it still
Agony for the chosen, break the seal, you slowly die
Agony" for the chosen, heart pumps slow, little life left
Agony for the chosen, blood runs black, you've reached your end

Beating and clawing, you beg to me for life
Your life is mine, I skin your flesh from bloody bone

(solo - Gibbs)

Agony forthe chosen
Twist the knife, you feel it still
Agony for the chosen
Break the seal, you slowly die
Agony for the chosen
Heart pumps slow, little life left
Agony for the chosen
Blood runs black, as you seek your end
