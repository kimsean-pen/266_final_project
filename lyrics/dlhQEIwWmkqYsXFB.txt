They were lying but falling in love

They were dying but falling in love

A heartbreak

A heartbreak

I saw your friends and they were driving
They were falling in love

They were lying but falling in love

Girl, you're just a child
A heartbreak

Girl, you're just a child
A heartbreak

Girl, you're just a child
Falling in love

Girl, you're just a child
A heartbreak
