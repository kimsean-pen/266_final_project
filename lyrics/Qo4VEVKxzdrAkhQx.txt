You can see through the veil,
And forget all your cares,
Throw them,
Throw them away

Ooh life's a feeling yeah
Ooh the body's a feeling yeah
Emotions come and go
Even strike you a blow
But life, life's a feeling yeah
Ooh life's a feeling yeah

A shimmering pattern,
The events of one day
But it's a luminous feeling yeah,
It's a luminous feeling

There's plenty of sadness
Already today
So why should we make any more?
Ooh life's a feeling yeah
The future is uncertain for us all, just now

Why make things worse? (2x)
