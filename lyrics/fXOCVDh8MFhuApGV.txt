(Keep in touch when I'm always on the move)
La-da-da-da-da
(You tell me that you love me
I don't know what I would do)
Menoh
Ayy, ayy

Going through the motions
I'm just tryna make it through
Hard to keep in touch
When I'm always on the move
You tell me that you love me
I don't know what I would do
If you wasn't by my side
Will I be able to move?

Going through the motions
I'm just tryna make it through
Hard to keep in touch
When I'm always on the move
You tell me that you love me
I don't know what I would do
If you wasn't by my side
Will I be able to move?

Ayy, ayy
But it's okay, you don't need to worry
I'll stand outside waiting in the snow flurries
I'm a bad boy,
I don't fuck with nobody
Tell them niggas stop me
I'll fuck up the party

Ayy, ayy
They used to count me out
Now they wanna count me in
Now they see me out in public
And be actin' like we friends
I don't know you, you just tryna get close to my dividends
Ran it up and got a check,
Now niggas actin like my mans
And my pockets stuffed with them bands,
Got fans all in Japan
I'm just doin' what I planned,
Now people like what I'm saying
And niggas know I'm not playin',
I came up bringin' heat
My whole life in these beats,
Can't lose my life to these streets (Ayy, ayy)
And I'm...

Going through the motions
I'm just tryna make it through
Hard to keep in touch
When I'm always on the move
You tell me that you love me
I don't know what I would do
If you wasn't by my side
Will I be able to move?

I'm a bad boy
I don't fuck with nobody
Tell them niggas stop me
I'll fuck up the party

Ayy, and tell them people stop me
Still walk in this bitch, I got his girl all on my body
I came up from nothin', put my shooter in Versace
She got on Chanel, she ain't rocking no Armani
It's a lituation
I'm a little faded
I wanna be the greatest
How could I ever fade? (Ayy, ayy)

Going through the motions
I'm just tryna make it through
Hard to keep in touch
