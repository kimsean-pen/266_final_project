I've waited for this moment
All my life and more
And now I see so clearly
What I could not see before

The time is now or never
And this chance won't come again
Throw caution and myself into the wind

There's no promise of safety
With these secondhand wings
But I'm willing to find out
What impossible means
A leap of faith

Parody of an angel
Miles above the sea
I hear the voice of reason
Screaming after me:

"You've flown far too high, boy
Now you're too close to the sun
Soon your makeshift wings will come undone"

But how will I know limits from lies
If I never try?

There's no promise of safety
With these secondhand wings
But I'm willing to find out
What impossible means
I climb through the heavens
On feathers and dreams
'Cause the melting point of wax means nothing to me
Nothing to me
Nothing to me

I will touch the sun or I will die trying
Die trying

Fly on these secondhand wings
I'm willing to find out
What impossible means
I climb though the heavens
On feathers and dreams
'Cause the melting point of wax means nothing to me
Nothing to me

It means nothing to me
Miles above the sea.
