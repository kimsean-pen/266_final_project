In the log book of the LRC, I
Well, I knew I'd find something
A hundred stories sitting there to read
I got my focals out and I put 'em on

And all is calm
All is calm

There's a doggie coming here to eat now
It's dated back to 1993
And I don't care what the people say 'cause
That dog, he don't come around here anymore

No, no the dog is gone
The dog is gone
The dog is gone
The dog is gone

The town's so small
How could anybody not
Look you in the eyes
Then wave as you drive by?

The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful

I see everyone before me, there was birthdays, sex, and sleep
Some weren't getting along
Nobody's outside trying to murder
Nobody's outside, there's no one really at all

What the hell I saw
The hell I saw
The hell I saw
The hell I saw

The town's so small
How could anybody not
Look me in the eyes
Or wave as I drive by?

The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful place
