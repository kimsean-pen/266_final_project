Tucked inside the pocket
Sitting little rabbit
Filthy cellphone ringtone
Visitation relic

Rising up high into the tunnel
She was taken in by the creature
Telepathic talking and I can't kick it
Unusually calming, transcend habit

Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay

Betty dreams of green men
Taken now and again
A faint sound of a humming
Is a twin to nothing

A bronzer seen from the future
Watching changes within the skyline
Telepathic talking and I can't kick it
Unusually calming, transcend habit

Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
Do not call me, Do not say my name
Waiting for the alien okay
