One good thing about music
When it hits you, you feel no pain
One good thing about music
When it hits you, you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now yah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music
Trenchtown rock - I said don't watch that
Trenchtown rock - I said do your job
Trenchtown rock - Never let your children cry
Cause you got to tell Jah Jah while you're movin
Kingston town movin
Kingston town woah
Kingston town
One little fear I foe you can't fool Jah no
One little fear I foe you can't fool Jah no
Cause they're movin, yes I'm movin
I said one good thing, one good thing
When it hits you, you feel no pain
