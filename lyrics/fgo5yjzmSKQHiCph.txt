When I'm gone
I hope that everything
In your world is right
When you're lost
I pray that everything
That I taught you
Can turn you right
Back around
When you need me
I will always be by your side
Oh baby, oh baby
Just know everything
Is gonna be alright

When I get home
I'm gonna hold you just
A little bit closer
Until I'm gone
I'm gonna love you just
A little bit longer

Been around the
World and back
That is a country boy
Just trying make it in the city
And I don't know when
I'm coming back
I'd never seen you
Underneath the sky,
Looking so pretty
'Til I pack up my Cadillac
Me and the boys got some work,
it's about to get busy
Turn up the radio
Step on the gas now,
Baby, gotta go, gotta go, yeah

But when I get home
I'm gonna hold you just
A little bit closer
Until I'm gone, hey
I'm gonna love you just
A little bit longer, yeah

Just a little bit longer, yeah
I'm gonna love you just
A little bit longer, yeah
I'm gonna be your, oh oh man

When I get home
I gotta hold you just
A little bit closer
Until I'm gone
I'm gonna love you just
A little bit longer, yeah

When I get home
(When I'm home)
I wanna hold you just
A little bit closer, yeah
Until I'm home
(When I'm home)
I'm gonna love you just
A little bit longer, yeah
(I can't wait to hold you, love you)

When I get home
(When I get home, oh yeah)
I'm gonna hold you just a little bit closer
(Oh baby, baby)
Until I'm home
(Oh yeah, yeah, baby)
I wanna love you just
A little bit longer, yeah
(I wanna love you just
A little bit longer)
