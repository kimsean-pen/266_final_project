It's not for nothing but I've seen a transformation,
like I consider my happiness for the
first time in ages. You might say I'm off, but
it's the first time I'm feeling on. Don't worry,
I still get dizzy in the usual situations. Most
people I know I've used as camouflage. I've
circled myself with pretty people to hide who
I was. I won't miss them and they won't miss
me. I'll tie in those loose ends, a string is
just the thread to separation. I'll retire these
old clothes to brace for a wardrobe that no
one knows. Don't worry, I still get dizzy in
the usual situations. But it's those instances
I have used to ground me on occasion.
