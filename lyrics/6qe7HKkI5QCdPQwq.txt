There must be some kind of planet
For all the people who can manage
All of us who can handle it
With all of this damage

There must be some kind of message
Simple but somehow impressive
Anyone who can think of something
Come on now just express it

There must be some kind of planet
For all the people who can manage
All of us who can handle it
With all of this damage

All of us
All of us sing about it
