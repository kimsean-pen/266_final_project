We haven't been what you call 'in love' for a while
"Did she know that?"
"She knew it first"

The butterflies I felt had only begun to cut and itch
As much as you tried to hide it I knew
You were just dying to flip your switch
Tried to play dress-up, but never learned to play house
Fear giving license to the words falling from your mouth

Our love was lost
Your heart turned cold
And that was when I let you go
I let you go, I let you go

Poking corpses and throwing blame
How could I have thought I'd be the one to drive the demons away?
Romanticism seduced by the beauty of form
Those supple lines, a familiar warmth
Turned heart as cold as stone

"I've lost track of what is love and which is hate"
"But I'm through being your punching bag and your referee in your battleground. I'm going to help myself"

Our love was lost
Your heart turned cold
And that was when I let you go
I let you go

Fall back to the upstairs bedroom
Way back when it all just seemed
To make more sense then and fall in place
There was a time when I felt okay

I felt okay (I felt okay)
I felt okay
