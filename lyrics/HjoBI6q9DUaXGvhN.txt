Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins, ya

So the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'
Johnny strummed his Tommy gun
Left blastin' through the ceiling
What became of rebels
Who sang for you and me?
Grapplin' with their demons
In the search for liberty

Sufferers who suffer all
Can swim upon the desert
Avarice has ravaged all
In spite of good intentions
Don't fill your mouth with gluttony
For pride will surely swell
But nothing's unforgevin
In the four corners of Hell, so

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

I envy and its evil twin
It crept in bed with slander
Idiots, they gave advice
But sloth it gave no answer
Anger kills the human soul
With bitter tales of lust
While Pavlov's dogs keep chewin'
On the legs they never trust, oh

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins, yargh

Haha

But it's the only life we'll know
Blaggards to the bone
So don't wreck yourself, take an honest grip
For there's more tales beyond the shore

Ah, the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'
In and out came crawlin' out
And spewed upon the ceiling
What became of rebels
That sang for you and me?
Grapplin' with their demons
In the search for liberty, ha

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
