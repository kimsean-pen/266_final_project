Dead is the new alive
Despair's the new survival
A pointless point of view
Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game
You never win

Dead is the new alive
Life's only living rival
A casket built for two
Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game
You never win

So take me now or take me never
I won't wait
You're already late
So say goodbye or say forever
Choose your fate
How else can we survive?
Dead is the new alive

Dead is the new alive
A gothic play revival
The last act of the show
Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game
You never win

So take me now or take me never
I won't wait
You're already late
So say goodbye or say forever
Choose your fate
How else can we survive?
Dead is the new alive

What is a day without a blessed night?
And what is peace without a blessed fight?
What is a day without a blessed night?
And what is peace without a blessed, blessed, blessed fight?
A quick taste of the poison, a quick twist of the knife
When the obsession with death
The obsession with death becomes a way of life
A quick taste of the poison, a quick twist of the knife
When the obsession with death
The obsession with death becomes a way of life

Alive, alive, alive
Oh oh oh oh oh
Alive, alive, alive
Oh oh oh oh oh
Alive, alive, alive
Oh oh oh oh oh
Alive, alive, alive
Oh oh oh oh oh
Dead is the new alive
Alive, alive, alive
Dead is the new alive
Alive, alive, alive
Alive
Dead is the new alive
Alive
Dead is the new alive
