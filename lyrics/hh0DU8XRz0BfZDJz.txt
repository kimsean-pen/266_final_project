At the end of it all
We will be sold for parts, sold for parts
We will try to rebuild
But we ate it all away, all away
All ambitions now run dry
Someone stop this thing, turn it off
In search of new life
Nothing will be left to walk the earth again
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
We always said it wouldn't end up like this
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
We will be the new ice age
We will be the new plague, the new plague
Disguised as a colony
We will wipe them all away
Feast your eyes or just rip
