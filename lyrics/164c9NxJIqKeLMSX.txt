Guess you just call it a phase, babe
Call it a wave that you've been going through
Got all these signs here from everyone
From everyone that's near
Just call it a phase
Call it a monser
Say that you'll still be moving on

Call it a wave
Calling out cause you'll see
It won't pass

See when they say
Say you can
Let that be all
Be all doubt

They move forward
And they go forward
Even if it's on your own
Let it be
They move forward
And they go forward
Even if it's on your own
Let it be

Even if it's on your own
Let it be
They move forward
Forward, forward, forward here

Let it be
They move forward
And they go forward
Even if it's on your own
Let it be
They move forward, forward
And they go forward
Even if it's on your own
Let it be

Forward
Let it be
Now move forward
There we go
Even if it's on your own
Let it be
