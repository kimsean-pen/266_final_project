I lay in darkness today
I shut the blinds and fade away
Your things collect dust
I keep them for the memory, still not enough to rescue me

Cause I still feel you, will you pull my body close?
Like you used to, I'll never let you go
I believe in phantoms baby
You said you'd find your way back to me

The silence sings me to you
The noise is violent, so confused
Faucet's running and the record's stuck
Blue notes playing on repeat
Phone keeps ringing and the neighbours knock
But your ghost is all I need

Cause I still feel you, will you pull my body close?
Like you used to, I'll never let you go
I believe in phantoms baby
You said you'd find your way back to me

I'm melting in your memory
They'll all forget you, but not me

I'm gonna feel you when you pull my body close
Like you used to, we'll never be alone
I believe in phantoms baby
You said you'd find your way back to me
And there's nothing else I can believe
Tonight I'll find my way back to you
Tonight I'll find my way back to you
