Hodad made the scene toting a six-pack of cold cola
A stogie smoking in hand
A groovin' in his sandals

California's on my mind
Surf and sand setting in the sun
California's on my mind
One day you're gonna be a place in our memory
Na na na na na na na

When Woody hit the dunes flying foxtails and Old Glory
(Glory)
Rubber ripped the sand
He gunned a souped-down Stingray
Hey hey

Ah, California
She's in mythical Malibu
Sitting on the ocean
Goodbye mythical Malibu
The San Andreas Misfortune
Will claim the lives of sons and wives
The headlines will fill page after page

California's on my mind
Surf and sand setting in the sun
In the sun in the sun in the sun
In the sargent sun
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
One day you're gonna be one sweet memory
Oh yeah
California
Swingin' on the beach
To the sounds of their time
Yeah yeah yeah
