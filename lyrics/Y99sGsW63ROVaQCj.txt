I know how it feels
To wake up without her
Lying here all alone
Just thinking about her

I can't believe
Her hold on me
It's somethin indiscribable
I know she knows

But won't you please
If you see my girl
Just tell her I miss her smile
Tell her I'm counting the minutes

Gonna see her in a little while
'Cause I know when she
Holds onto me
She's the one thing that I could never live without

Oh oh oh oh
Tell her I love her
Oh yeah
Just tell her I love her

The way that she moves
You know what it does to me
When I catch her eye
I can hardly breathe

Still can't believe
Her hold on me
She's just so indiscribable
I know she knows

But won't you please
If you see my girl
Just tell her I miss her smile

Tell her I'm counting the minutes
Gonna see her in a little while
'Cause I know when she
Holds onto me

She's the one thing that I could never live without
Oh oh oh oh
Tell her I love her
Every time that I'm around her

I just go to pieces crushing, tumbling to the ground
I'm so glad I found her
I know how it feels

If you see my girl
Just tell her I miss her smile
Tell her I'm counting the minutes
Gonna see her in a little while

'Cause I know when she
Holds onto me
She's the one thing that I could never live without
Oh oh oh oh
Just tell her I love her
If you see my girl
Just tell her I miss her smile
Tell her I'm counting the minutes
Gonna see her in a little while
'Cause I know when she
Holds onto me
She's the one thing that I could never live without
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
And tell her I love her
Just tell her I love her
