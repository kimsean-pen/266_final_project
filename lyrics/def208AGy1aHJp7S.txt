You turn to face me, hold out your hand
Don't you know that this is the promised land
With bright lights shining it seems so bright
Don't you know that things go nice with spice

It felt like we'd been here a thousand years before
When the door broke open and let in
the light
So we ran to an empty space and felt so free
You know we've never felt like this before

You turn to face me, hold out your hand
Don't you know that this is the promised land
With bright lights shining it seems so bright
Don't you know that things go nice with spice

Now I think the time has come to open the box
Let in to the world what's been hidden from inside
Not covering what the day brings, it seems so bright
Don't you know that this is the promised land
Alright

You turn to face me, hold out your hand
Don't you know that this is the promised land
With bright lights shining it seems so bright
Don't you know that things go nice with spice
