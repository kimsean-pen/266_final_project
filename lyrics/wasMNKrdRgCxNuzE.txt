Some people live that selfish desire
Some choose to shout when they speak and they'll be the start
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice
One for tomorrow

They say we've lost our minds, we've just gained control
Search endlessly, fight till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky
Guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

Destroys their perfect crime, watch the power fold
Search endlessly, fight till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on
