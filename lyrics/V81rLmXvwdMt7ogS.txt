Mercy like a gun
When you've come undone
I've awoken in the hour
That receives no one
The sound of a tribe
Will shake me out until sunrise

The heat of tomorrow
Released as the wind blows
A beating stare from all the trials
No sleep tonight

The howl from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing all of control?
All spirits in trance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass
The prison breaks like glass

Stripped of all the air in my lungs now
Flee from the walls, so alone
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Raise me up in my throes

The howls from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing outta control?
All spirits entrance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass
The prison breaks like glass

Upon the burial lie thieves of their past
Firewater, tenacious
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground

Between the living
And the dead we move
Between the living
And the dead we all move
Shift all placement
But they're sifting you
Between the living
And the dead we all move

The claim we stake
A land within our wake
A garden in the bones
A headdress down in the soil we own, whoa
We build it on the bullshit
Or build it upon the burial
A garden in the bones
A headdress down in the soil we own, yeah

Stripped of all the air in my lungs now
Feeling so alone
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Feeling so low (whoa oh)
Pull out all the ground from below
You've, given quite a show
Stampede in the room like a buffalo
Raise me up in my throes

The howl from below
The wolf and the soaring crow
Am I losing control?
Am I losing all of control?
All spirits entrance
I toss and turn in no romance
From six under the grass
The prison breaks like glass

Upon the burial lie thieves of their past
Firewater, tenacious
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground
Upon the burial ground
Between the living and
The dead we move (We move)
Mercy like a gun
