Hold me now
I never thought I'd have to ask
Come on, baby, hold me down
It's such a simple request
And maybe if we sell ourselves
We'll make it through what's passed
And maybe if you tell me now
We'll be the last, we'll be the last
Baby, I'll remember you always
Baby, I will wait for you always
All the signs are pointing south tonight
We follow them to our demise in a tower of flame
And I can see headlights, I can see people
Waiting for direction
Secretly hoping we were both wrong
I hope we were wrong
Baby, I'll remember you always
Baby, I will wait for you always
We held the knife, we paid the price
Baby, I'll remember you, I'll remember you
All this time too far to fall
All our lives too far to fall
All the signs but now we're falling down and down and down and down
All this time too far to fall
All our lives too far to fall
All the signs but now we're falling down and down and down and down
All this time too far to fall
All our lives too far to fall
All the signs but now we're falling down and down and down and down
Baby, I'll remember you always
Baby, I will wait for you always
We held the knife, we paid the price
Baby, I'll remember you, I'll remember you
