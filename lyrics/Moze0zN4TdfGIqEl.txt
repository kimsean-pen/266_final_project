The inevitable exchange
Is when knowledge comes without judgment
The final, the final transition
Is when knowledge becomes the internal

The facilitators of darkness
Are the true providers
To the world's light

Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality

From illusion of mortality

Open are all the doors
All will run its course
Leaving the former paradigm
Escalating, further the climb

Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality

Ascending the highest mountain
Beyond the perception of reality
Forever free
From illusion of mortality

The flow, the flow is ever present
Upstream and against the current
Ascending the highest of mountains
Free

Upstream and against the current
Ascending the highest of mountains
Free
