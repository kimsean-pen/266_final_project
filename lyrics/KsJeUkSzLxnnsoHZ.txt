The liquid of life
That is captive under your skin
Is deeply Infected
And slowly perishes from within
You're looking at your body
Your skin turns to a morbid color
Suffocates endlessly
For this case you won't find any doctor
(Lead: Luc Lemay)
Your veins become dry
And then your organs putrefy
You vomit blood down the floor
To leave your corpse soaked deep in gore
For you life you pray

Intense cardiac decay
No more human fuel to stay alive
Too lets your insides mortified
Painful drainage of your body
Without a drip of blood
You will be
Hematological Allergy
Putrefaction is getting close
Arteries had decomposed
Clotted blood drains from your nose
Rigor mortis takes control
Hear no more heart beats
Death, you try to defeat
No more oxygen in your cells
Your brain rots inside of it's shell
