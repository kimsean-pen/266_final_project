Mrs. Jones is 17 and 6 and 24
Moderately pretty
She is all the girls you know
We are going far away
We're going for a ride
Mr. Jones has got a plan
If you just come inside
So good so far
Slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on
I don't want to dance
Mr. Jones is beautiful
Your eyes are made of glass
Looking through the window
You can see the world go past
Here's another 9 o'clock
And here's another day
Wonder how the weather is
And what the people say
So good so far
Slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on
I don't want to dance
Mr. Jones can turn you on
And turn you off again
Mr. Jones is all of you
Who live inside a plan
Put your head upon the pillow
Never put it down
That would only wake you up
And turn your head around
So good so far
Slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on
I don't want to dance
