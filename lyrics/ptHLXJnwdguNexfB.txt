Always said I was a good kid
Always said I had a way with words
Never knew I could be speechless
Don't know how I'll ever break this curse

Now the world is only white noise
Frequencies that I can't understand
I can't be bothered with the teachers
Always trying to shape the way I act

Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

I'll set fire to the whole place
I don't even care about our house
It's not the same in here since he left anyways

Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

Always said I was a good kid
Always said I had a way with words
Never knew I could be speechless
Don't know how I'll ever break this curse

Now the world is only white noise
Frequencies that I can't understand
I can't be bothered with the teachers
Always trying to shape the way I act

Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down

Mamma told me all of this is
Just a place we have to settle for
Less than anything we dream on
We'll continue to be disappointed

I feel down, I feel down, I feel down, I feel down
I feel down, I feel down, I feel down, I feel down

Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it
Burn it, burn it
