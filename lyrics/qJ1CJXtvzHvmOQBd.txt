I'm just tired of counting bodies, is this mausoleum tardy?
Let's just paint you a pretty face
Flies dip tongues into tear ducts in toothpicks fought unborn

Proto-culture null and void

All veins in highway laps this breath collapsed again
This hex was delivered spent
Orchestra influenza drawn and quartered pets
It dwells and grows in veins

This is the pocket-sized edition, rapid sleep through benediction

Museums mark their bodies down, all the tenants found
All the distance in their prefix

Proto-culture null and void

All veins in highway laps this breath collapsed again
This hex was delivered spent
Orchestra influenza drawn and quartered pets
It dwells and grows in veins

Fever bliss into central nervousness
Bitten on the entrance, I was bitten on the entrance
Fever bliss into central nervousness
Bitten on the entrance, I was bitten on the entrance
Bitten on the entrance, I was bitten on the entrance
Bitten on the entrance, bitten
