I don't live to rise again
to reborn and never end
once I'm on the other side
I'll see if it was the end of my ride
I don't live to transform
present into past
or fall into a lifeless pattern
going nowhere fast

Master I will always be
of all that is of me
but I can't ever touch
what is of thee

I question things to see
if they are what they're said to be
I ask the why and wherefore
I reap the fruits of time but I let it take it's course
but where no-one can answer me
where nobody'll ever know
that is where my path begins
that is where I go

Master I will always be
of all that is of me
but I can't ever touch
what is of thee

Human flesh - human blood
but in your words I'm nothing but god

A master eye is the eye
able to behold
and part truth from lie
in what it's been told
