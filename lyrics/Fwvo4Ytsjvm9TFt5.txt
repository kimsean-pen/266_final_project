We've come here, from so far away
I can save you
If you leave it all behind
This suffering's, been far too long
Would you take a trip with me
On the back of a star
I feel like Earth's gravity is just here to pull
Us down

Mother of creation wait
Embrace the souls of a lost World
Carry them away
Darkness negative receptive
Pour firmament between our waters
Seperate the space
Mother of destruction wait
With a belt of skulls strap me down
And send the ship away
Progress with the process
Mine the souls from their casts
Pour form and reshape

This dark womb
Wraps and covets me
Redefining understanding, if you open
Up the heart
Nurturing this phenomenon
We can carry you on our wings, our wings
Through the dark
Lightning flashes of insight
Into the mirth of a dark sky
Pain of division is nothing
Joy of dissolution is everything

Mother of creation wait
Embrace the souls of a lost World
Carry them away
Darkness negative receptive
Pour firmament between our waters
Seperate the space
Mother of destruction wait
With a belt of skulls strap me down
And send the ship away
Progress with the process
Mine the souls from their casts
Pour form and reshape

Portal sits deep within the eye
The eye of Yin's severity
Rewards understanding
Portal sits deep within the eye
The eye of Yin's severity
Rewards understanding

Blackness consumes body covets core of nothing
Blackness consumes body covets core of nothing

Mother I can't remember, a vault of security
Can you take me away?
Would you take me away?
Won't you take me away?
Away

Mother of creation wait
Embrace the souls of a lost World
Carry them away
Darkness negative receptive
Pour firmament between our waters
Seperate the space
Mother of destruction wait
With a belt of skulls strap me down
And send the ship away
Progress with the process
Mine the souls from their casts
Pour form and reshape
