Treading water is the sound I'm familiar with
The sanctified sea is turning sky into rain
Gathering fuel for the fire they feed
We cower in fear of the souls, we escape

Why do I fight it
Giving up feels so unnatural
Whether I like it or not
Love's just a piece of the puzzle now

Heavy armor is the burden they leave us with
Guarded in tone this layer is shaking me free
Cover our tracks from the shadow that's casting this
The tower of fear and the soul of our peers

Why do I fight it
Giving up feels so unnatural
Whether I like it or not
Love's just a piece of the puzzle now
