Those trainers and rolled up jeans
No make up on, she looks good to me
I want her, I need her[?]
I swear to god that I love her
And I want her, she's for me

She wears hats above her ears
Oh, god, I want her here

I saw you with him again
You looked happier than me
I'm just moving on without you, without you
You've grown your hair out long
And you look happier than me
I'm just writing songs about girls with short hair

Do you remember those nights last summer?
Do you remember what I said?
I remember how I felt last summer
I didn't want it to end
