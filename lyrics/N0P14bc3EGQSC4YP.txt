I haven't lost anything except my mind
Expect a thousand confessions that you will not find
I try to take off my head sometimes
Because I can't escape the memories
I haven't lost anything except my mind

You could be empty
And I can be right here empty with you
Or you could be hollow
And I can be right here hollow with you
If you want to say goodbye to everything
I could say goodbye too
I can be right here empty with you

I haven't wasted a thing except my time
Forget the treasures we burned because we'll be just fine
I try to take off my head sometimes
because I can't escape for the life of me
I haven't lost anything except my mind

You could be empty
And I can be right here empty with you
Or you could be hollow
And I can be right here hollow with you
If you want to say goodbye to everything
I could say goodbye too
I can be right here empty with you

Instead of going under ground
Instead of calling them out
Instead of running 'cause you're still breathing

Instead of swallowing lies
Instead of buried alive
Lets twist the knife
till they cant stop bleeding

If you need a confession
I'm guilty
lets twist the knife
till they cant stop bleeding

Do you think I feel sorry
Forgive me
lets twist the knife
till they cant stop bleeding

Instead of going under ground
Instead of calling them out
lets twist the knife
till they cant stop bleeding

You could be empty
And I can be right here empty with you
Or you could be hollow
And I can be right here hollow with you
If you want to say goodbye to everything
I could say goodbye too
I can be right here empty with you
