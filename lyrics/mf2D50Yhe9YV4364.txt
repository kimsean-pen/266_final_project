She said I'm blue as a robin's egg
I've done nothing to make me proud
I rehearse conversations in
The shower when I am home alone
No one has ever bought me flowers
Or smoked a joint on my persian rug

Go to Mexico
And lie under a mango tree
And watch a line of crows
Grace the Souther breeze but
You won't know where they go
Everything just scatters out like
Acorns in the snow
Or dust clouds in a drought

She said I care too much these days
About my place in this ball of yarn
There's not a lot that I can boast
I water plants and make french toast
And muse like some misanthrope
Afraid to sow all my widos

Read Walt Whiman poems
Drink a bottle of champagne
And sing some Leonard Cohen
I love it when you speak so plain
The way you often do
When I am crying after midnight
Just between us two
It makes me smile to know you're alright
