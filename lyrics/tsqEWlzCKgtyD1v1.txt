I wish I don't need you
I've been so deprived
Boy, when I'm with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

No Stockholm Syndrome
'Know full well you're the Devil
Disguise, feels right
Wrapped in your chains of love
Now I'm so miserable
When I'm free I just suffer
Too much, not enough
Wrapped in your chains

It ain't love if it don't hurt
No safety word

I wish I don't need you
I've been so deprived
Boy, when I'm with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, faithfully
To the bedpost
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, unconditionally
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

Two hands cover my screams
Porno on the big screen
You ain't shy, don't lie
I'll try anything twice
Hit me when you're cumming
Safe shit that you're running
I ain't her, I can learn
I'll try anything

It ain't love if it don't hurt
No safety word

I wish I don't need you
I've been so deprived
Boy, when I'm with you
My hands are tied
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, faithfully
To the bedpost
My hands are tied
Literally, literally, unconditionally
My hands are tied
My hands are tied

And there's nothing, nothing I can do
I ain't deprived, I just wanna feel
You bring out the worst in me
And that ain't how love's supposed to be
And I ain't disturbed, I just prefer
Let's not pretend that we're friends
I don't care about your plans or how your day went
Just pin me up on the wall
Or the floor, or the bed, oh
There's nothing I can do
All I want is to bring out the worst in you
All I want is to bring out the worst in you
