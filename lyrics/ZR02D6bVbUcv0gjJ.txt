Blessed are thee who speaks the word
Pray for the weak and lead the herd
Dollar signs in the faithful eyes
The anti-saint sunday disguise

You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Won't make you a savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

Raptured are thee who sees (?) the word
Holiness so well rehearsed
Dollar signs in the faithful eyes
Anti-saint sunday disguise

You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Won't make you a savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

The water
The water
The water

Money made messiahs
You're televised to tell your lies
Not another martyr
You're dead in the water

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
