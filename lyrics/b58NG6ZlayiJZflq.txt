By the window in me
I climb up to be astounded
By the window of the sea
I climb up, I may have found it

But I was lost, I was bored
By the thought of wanting more
But I was lost, I was bored
By the thought of wanting more

I demand you
Be here with me, a light in the quiet of the morning
Be here with me, alive in the quiet of the morning
