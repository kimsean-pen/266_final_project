Lying in the wiped out park
Where silver screams from the dark
There's no direction
A still erection to feel

Can you swallow the mist from the space
And suffer the dirt on your face
Well you can't imagine
The things that could happen this way

There's no reason to cry
Anyway you won't get no reply
'Cause you're alone
But not me not me

That painted face feels so sad
But it's the biggest thrill you're ever had
Well it's funny to think of the fun
That you link with this game

So why not be out of your mind?
Having a real good time
But don't bother to choose
Between calling this good or bad

There's no reason to cry
You won't get no reply
'Cause you're alone
But not me not me
I'm not alone

(Instrumental Break)

Lying in the wiped out park
Where silver screams from the dark
There's no direction
A still erection to feel

Can you swallow the mist from the space
And suffer the dirt on your face
Well you can't imagine
The things that could happen this way

There's no reason to cry
You won't get no reply
'Cause you're alone
But not me not me
I'm not alone
But you are
