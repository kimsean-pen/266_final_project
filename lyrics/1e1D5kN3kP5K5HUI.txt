On and on
We wait for we hear xxxx
And move forward
All we want is love
It breaths for us
It feeds us even though
We don't realy know it
All we want is love
All we want is love
All we want is love
It's as light as butterflies
And when we miss it
We fantasise
All we want is love
It wakes us up
Early in the morning
Or helps us sleep
All through the night
All we want is love
All we want is love
All we want is love
We give up our names for it
We arrange parades fighting for it
We buy castles and go to get it
And we xxxxx countless songs
All we want is love
All we want is love
We reflect ourselves in it
To make sure
That we exist
All we want is love
