From a black widow's reckoning
Your fortuitous spine
Opened up like a marionette
Danced a whimsical pride
Lend a hand to the silver blade
Stir your gut 'til it pours
Fill our cups with profanity
'Til the earth is stained orange

How my tongue dried into the dust
How my skin willed a lie
Drill a hole in the field
Just the size of my thighs

Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, I do

Dried up seeds neath our parting seas
Floating pears on the tide
Slow motion to drown me
Roaming streams from our eyes

How my tongue dried into the dust
How my skin willed a lie
Drill a hole in the field
Just the size of my thighs

Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, I do

Hold the pain in a soft crux
With our palms facing up
Push it thoroughly through and through
This is ours to drink up
Oh, the madness in weakness
Doubled o'er on the plate
Fill an ocean with weaponry
Hurricanes of our grace

Feel as lonely as I do, as I do
Feel as lonely as I do, I do
Feel as lonely as I do
