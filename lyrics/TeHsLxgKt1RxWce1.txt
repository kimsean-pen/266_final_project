TV screen in your living room
Stereo on high
Dreaming of a famous love
Dancing high above

Driving to your mansion
We can let it all out
I'm too dirty for the sidewalk
You're too clean for the South

These people are the same
These houses are the same
I'm glad I'm not alone
I'm glad you're not at home
I'm glad I'm not alone

So many calls to your old cell phone
Too many walks to the park
So many knocks on your childhood home
Too many drives in the dark

No one home for the weekend
Girls come running, running in the hills
You call me up slowly and hop in your Bentley
Meet me at the hills

Driving to your mansion
We can let it all out
I'm too dirty for the sidewalk
You're too clean for the South

These people are the same
These houses are the same
I'm glad I'm not alone
I'm glad you're not at home
I'm glad I'm not alone
