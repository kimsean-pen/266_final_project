Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised

Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about

Hey you! hey you! hey you! hey you!
What's this now
Going down going down
Are you sorry now
Going down, why do you want to die

Black tar in your veins
Once new, now stained, stained, stained, stained

Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about
Hey you you're nodding out
What's this all about

Hey you! hey you! hey you! hey you!
What's this now
Going down going down
Are you sorry now
Going down going down
What's your story now
Going down, why do you want to die
Die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die

Your life, mislaid
Spoon-fed, well raised
Hey you
Hey you
Hey you
Hey you

Hey you! hey you! hey you! hey you!
What's this now
Going down, going down
Are you sorry now
Going down, going down
What's your story now
Why do you want to die
Die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die
Why do you want to die
