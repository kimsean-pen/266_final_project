Now still your soul's
In turn the man to Gods?

Oh the villager's moan
Made cities out of homes

He's you, I said
You keep running through my head
I swear so

Longing for the while
In absence of job

The end of the tries
And the start of the crimes

But this blood red skies
Cover my eyes

From the sleepless nights
And a haunted life

He's you I said
You keep running through my head
I swear so

Cause there are voices in my head
People screaming you're not dead
I'm not sure

These kingdoms in my veins
Lost playing children's game
It's source of cure

But he's you I said
You keep running through my head
I swear so
