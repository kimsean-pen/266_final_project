I remember walking back from the bar
We were like 21
There was no live scene
Just a mic, screen, and a little buzz
You were so lightning
Think I might be in a little love
There you said it first
And I'm pretty sure you
Were a little drunk

I was just a college kid
What did you expect?
Rocket ships take off and
There's no turning back
Hands on that line, no apologies
Stupid kids in love
Why'd you follow me?

Hooked me on your line when you came
When I saw your light
Gave me life, all the way
Oooh, you're my type
Take the flight all the way, oh whoa
Now I got you here right beside me
Think I might, think I might wife thee
Love me all the time, all life, please
Try me, try, oh

Now, I remember walking
Back from the bus
I was like 25
It's a lot quieter when your backstage
In a little light
I just played my biggest show
Right before that we had our biggest fight
How can dreams end when
The other dreams feel so alive?

I was just a young man
What did you expect?
Rocket ships take off and
There's no turning back
Hands on that line, no apologies
Stupid kids in love
Why'd you follow me?

Hooked me on your line when you came
When I saw your light
Gave me life, all the way
Oooh, you're my type
Take the flight all the way, oh whoa
Now I got you here right beside me
Think I might, think I might wife thee
Love me all the time, all life, please
Try me, try, oh

I'd climb a mountain
I'd mine the fields
Go through hell
I'll sign the deal
For all time that's how I feel, oh
I'd cross the ocean
I'd plant the seed
Dive down the well
So you could see
For all time it's you and me, oh

I planted 8 rose bushes in my garden
Think that I found you
Think it's starting
Point, blank, boom, you're where my heart is
Think that I found you
Think it's starting
I planted 8 rose bushes in my garden
Think that I found you
Think it's starting
Point, blank, boom, you're where my heart is
Think that I found you
Think it's starting

10 years, been 10 years, magic
If we let it go, that'd be tragic
Believe in love, believe in us, that's it
100 years, 1000 years, galactic
