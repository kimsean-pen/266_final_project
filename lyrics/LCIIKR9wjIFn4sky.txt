You're a head case with a smile
Can't stop to make up your mind
Education is so lame (so lame)
When you bitch and you moan

You're a loose girl, I'm a guy
You're a truth freak with a lie
The situation is so strange
It's a T.V. show

In a hotel on the phone
You're gonna leave me
I should have known
And I was thinking

It's so sad
I didn't want you to go
You wanna follow the laws of man (yes sir)
Bloody April, leg of lamb

It's so hard to win
When there's so much to lose
Infiltrate the walls that are cavin' in
It ain't a barricade, you save reality

Infiltrate the walls that are cavin' in
It ain't a barricade, free cover is natural
Second avenue, raising Cain
I'm a singer, ring my bell
I tell you what, I'd get up
If I knew how I fell
