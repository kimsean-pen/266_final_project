Could I?

Could I just find a way?
I'd find you everyday
and we could alter time
But
I've come to find

Everyone's gone away

So this may be the time
For the perfect crime
Yes, this is perfect

(This is!)
Our Medicine
(This is!)
Our time to...
Medicate!
Here with me

Now as we

Lose ourselves to this and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate

Come Day
You'll say you cannot stay
What's more I'll feel the same

It happens every time
So, I've come to find

Everyone goes away
I'm destined to remain
You were never mine

So you were perfect
(This is!)
Our medicine
(This is!)

Our time to
Medicate
Here with me

Now as we
Lose ourselves to this and ignore
That you don't even know my name

Medicate
Can you describe what it's like?
I feel nothing

Can you feel this?

Does it sting?
I feel nothing at all

I feel nothing at all
I feel nothing at all
(Can you tell me how it feels?)
I feel nothing at all
(Can we pretend this is real?)
I feel nothing
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to this and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to this and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Medicate
Here with me
Now as we
Lose ourselves to this and ignore
That you don't even know my name
Oh!
You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name
Oh!
Medicate!
