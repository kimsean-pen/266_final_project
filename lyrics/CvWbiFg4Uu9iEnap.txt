My body moves in time
We're begging on the feeding line
We're lifting out above this head space
See my body over flows

But I got my whole damn life
Caught up in moments entirely of yours
But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow
And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know
Know know

See my body keeps in line
And I got my whole damn life
Oh I want to be somebody, somebody, someone
You're so desperate now
Oh no you won't let it go
You bit of your tongue to become one

Nevertheless when this pain in my chest seems to grow
I'm living it harder to feel what it feels like to know
You know, know, know

The home I lived in I came to grow
My body's cumbersome and slow
But I felt it felt it coming over me

The home I lived in I came to grow
My body's cumbersome and slow
But I felt it felt it coming over me

I got my whole damn life
Caught up in moments entirely of yours
But I'm finding it harder to reason in order to grow
And finding it hard is a feeling that all of you know

Nevertheless, when this pain in my chest seems to grow
And grow
You know, know, know
