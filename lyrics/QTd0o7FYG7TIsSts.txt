Take in what they tell you to
I spit to spit they spew to spew
My aura draws - you follow suit
Finks in packs and bred in twos
Peasant thoughts and peasant dreams
You were born to bow to me
There comes a time to test yourself
When you live a coward that is how you die
Continuously slowed down by our perception of ourselves
But in a world of servants and liars and spies

I am king.
