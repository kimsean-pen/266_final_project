And I see through you
For all the things you put me through
Yeah I see through you
And everything you used to do

I'm longing for something that I have lost
I'm trying to find it at any cost
Feels like I'm running in circles back and forth again
And I wish you'd stay here 'til the very end

And I've been running in circles
Back and forth again
We're going back and forth again
(Back and forth again, back and forth again)

I've laid it all to rest, running around with no sight at all
I try to blame it on the weather
But truth be told I'm not doing better
I'm barely functioning
I'm barely functioning

I'm longing for something that I have lost
I'm trying to find it at any cost
Feels like I'm running in circles back and forth again
And I wish you'd stay here 'til the very end

And I wish you'd stay here
And I wish you'd stay here with me
And I wish you'd stay here
And I wish you'd stay here with me

Back and forth again
