All alone in
Waiting for a new day
You're a survival
You are you are young
You are alone
Only listen
Are you falling into?
Waiting for you to come
Love story
Your ...
You are alone
You are alone
More alone
...down forever
And left all alone
Waiting for you to come
I'm so alone
Your lips say I'm alone

You are alone
You are alone
You are alone
Your lips say I'm alone
I'm all alone
Waiting for you to come
I'm so alone
Your lips say I'm alone
