I'm tired of your talkin'
Spillin' lies upon my floor
And the ground that you're walkin'
Don't shake for me no more
The world is so cold
We're tryin' to get by somehow
It's a cruel old world
But we get through anyhow

Cuz I've been lost
I've been pushed
Pulled and turned around
I've been crossed
I've been forced
Torn and broken down

Livin' ain't easy
Hard times
Hard times
Hard Times
You better believe it
I'll be stronger
In hard times
Hard times

I was born a poor child
I was raised by the zoo
My momma ain't caught no breaks
And I can't get none too
The world is so cold
Trying to get thru somehow
This cruel old world
But I'll get through anyhow

Cuz I've been lost
I've been pushed
Pulled and turned aroung
I've been crossed
I've been forced
Torn and broken down

Livin' ain't easy
Hard times
Hard times
Hard Times
You better believe it
I'll be stronger
In hard times
Hard times

Oh
Someday, someway
Somehow, baby
We'll make it through
Livin' ain't easy

Hard times
Hard times
Hard Times
You better believe it
I'll be stronger
In hard times
Hard times
