A red cell, a perfect view out of the
Novotel, sat gently listening to
This song, "it started over again"
And the girl gets higher, the room is on fire
If you want her, let it go, hello,
The sun went in, and it started over again

Linking an encyclopaedia of nothing
In half-written signatures and false names
"it started over again"
And the girl gets higher, the room's on fire
If you want her, let it go, hello,
The lights went out and it started over again.
