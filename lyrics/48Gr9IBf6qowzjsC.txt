When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low.
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow.
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Why is the bedroom so cold
Turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed
Every feeling run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
that we've kept through our lives.

And love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Do you cry out in your sleep,
All my failings expose?
Gets a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold.
Why is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

And Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again...
