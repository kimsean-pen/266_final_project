I've never wanted to be that far away from you
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

But it seems that you've made your choice
You stayed here, you and your voice
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

I've never wanted to be that far away from you
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

But it seems that you've made your choice
You stayed here, you and your voice
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

You are belong those stars, now
You belong to the stars, now
You are belong those stars, now
You belong to the stars, now

I've never wanted to be that far away from you
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

But it seems that you've made your choice
You stayed here, you and your voice
You've never wanted to be the start of something new

I've never wanted to be that far away from you
You've never wanted to be the start of something new
