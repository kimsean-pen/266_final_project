Mother told me, yes, she told me
I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch"
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going round

Mummy's all right
Daddy's all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

Father says, "Your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married, Mummy served
In the WACS in the Philippines"
Now, I had heard the WACS recruited
Old maids for the war
But mummy isn't one of those
I've known her all these years

Mummy's all right
Daddy's all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking
When'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mum and Dad
Are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin'
Got my KISS records out

Mummy's all right
Daddy's all right
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

Away
Away
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
