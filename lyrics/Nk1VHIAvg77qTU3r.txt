I'll walk alone again
There's no other way but face it
It's the end
Sometimes i clearly feel
The falling pieces of my soul
I gotta get a grip and go thru this
Still i think i did the besto for me
Who were we trying to fool?
Haven't been the same
I guess you know it too
We couldn't hear no more
How could we've found with the wind
In time you will see that i'm right

Cause even if it's over, it's over
The sun will shine its light
Even if it's over, it's over
The stars will be our guide
Even if it's over, it's over
The faith will makes us try
Even if it's over, it's over
My love it hurts to say
So soon we'll be ok
Memories and stories
Will be washed away
Don't ask me what went wrong
Or try to find out who's to blame
Time to fix my own mistakes now

Cause baby you'll see i was right

Maybe we'll find
A way back to this love
But now i just have to be strong and move forward
Got to find out what's like life without you
There's so much to grow, there's so much to find out
Even if it's over, even if it's over
Even if it's over, it's over
The faith will makes us try
Even if it's over, it's over
My love it hurts to say goodbye
