Just like an angel you're gonna make me fly
Into your arms you're wrapping me up so tight
You had me crawling so bad
Had me heels over head
You had me easy you had me easy
Tangled up in my head we're trying to hold on to have me
'Cause we're already beautiful

So don't make me cry
'Cause this love don't feel so right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
But you can make me unreachable

I may be sweet but I'm still on the vine
You couldn't wait no, you had to take your bite
You had me crawling so bad
Had me heels over head
You had me easy, you had me easy
Too late to go back to realize what we had
We were already beautiful

So don't make me cry
'Cause this love don't feel so right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
But you can make me unreachable

Sometimes love is addiction
Sometimes it hurts like hell
Sometimes you just can't get enough
You can't make me love you anymore than I do
But you can make me unreachable

Don't make me cry
'Cause this love don't feel right
You can't push a river
You can't make me fall
But you can make me
So don't make me cry
'Cause this love don't feel right
You can't push a river
You can't make me fall
But you can make me unreachable
