When I try-y-y (There you are)
To look sly
When you push all my curtains to the side
To the side
Call me fighter
I'll mop the floor with you
Call me lover
I'll take you for a drink or two
You'll get older
Maybe then you'll feel some control

When I learn (like that like that)
To look stern
You broke my heart and now it's your turn
It's your turn
Call me fighter
I'll mop the floor with you
Call me lover
I'll take you for a drink or two
You'll get older
Maybe then you'll feel some control

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
Yes yes thank you all for coming out
Tonight we've gotta wild wild show for you all
So let's give it over to Jack Stauber
Roller skating tomorrow
Hold my gaze tonight
Hold my baby I love you
Sing a song so bright
If you truly love me
Why'd you train me to fly?
If it wasn't in my blood
Why do you see pride

When I try
To look sly
When you push all my curtains to the side
To the side
When I try
To look sly
When you push all my curtains to the side
To the side
Call me fighter
Call me lover
You'll get older
(Mmmm)
