Is there a dark on the roll
Blue lights they guide you
So many miles between you and me
And no way in knowing in wich god to believe
Sell a better life promise a better way
I would sell up my soul and take me away
I don't know how we end up here
Broke bottles living in fear

Concrete and spray paint love
Buy white roses all covered in blood
Chained fences and gasoline
Light up a match and baby burn up my dreams
Ooh, more than a one night song
Ooh, more than a one night

Full moon and we are together
By the morning I'll be gone
And you think that we could ever be more
More than a one night song
I follow lines on the road
And they all lead to your bed
Drinks and the lights
And the music i will find you
Dancing in front of my head
Ooh

Concrete and spray paint love
Buy white roses all covered in blood
Chained fences and gasoline
Light up a match and baby burn up my dreams
Ooh, more than a one night song
Ooh, more than a one night

More than a one night
More than a one night
More than a one night

Concrete and spray paint love
Buy white roses all covered in blood
Ooh, more than a one night song

Chained fences and gasoline
Light up a match and baby burn up my dreams
Ooh, more than a one night song
Ooh, more than a one night
