Only you
Only you
Only you
Can treat me like you do
And only she
Only she
Only she
Shows me where I'll be
So sorry boo, we're through

'Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down
Since I'm done crying over her

Here I am
Brand new day
Now there's you
Let me show you, boo
That only she
Only she
Only she
Shows me where I'll be
So sorry boo, we're through

'Cause I'm done getting over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down

Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
