Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Oh boy, boy, you're a heart breaker
I'll tell you everything if you didn't take her
School shopping in the neighborhood mall
I know, I know that I killed it all

When you say nothing, well, you say it all
Can't blame you, baby, I can take the fall
Tuck you in just-a one last time
Tell you, little baby, it'll be alright

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Oh boy, boy, you-a are the one
Sights so high it'll never be done
Love you so hard in-a every day
Letters on your body, I can read your name

I flew the coop, I said it all
Left you in the nest in the tree so tall
Darkest summer and we're losing light
Tell you, little baby, it'll be alright

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

And mama and your mama don't see
And your mama, no, your mama don't see
And your mama, no, your mama don't see
But your mama hmm hmm is coming after me

And mama and your mama don't see
And your mama, no, your mama don't see
And your mama, no, your mama don't see
But your mama hmm hmm is coming after me

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love

Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Mama's gonna give you love
Give you love, give you love
