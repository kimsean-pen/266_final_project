Come put on your shoes and step out your door
We're standing on the river along the shore

Crying, it's a riot in the valley of the wind staying far from timid
Come out, we are quiet waiting for the next standing back to back

Your goddesses of greed, all our broken dreams
Barefoot and bleak yet we're all, you're seeing

Crying, it's a riot in the valley of the wind staying far from timid
Come out, we are quiet waiting for the next standing back to back

Quiet and tiered, stepping aside held in this grim mess
Asked who escaped, who was outside, nothing to confess
Do what you want, chase us and haunt, some day it will end
Yet rivers and fields and forests
we wield and all the untouchable lands
