I'm heaven sent, don't you dare forget
I am all you've ever wanted
What all the other boys all promised
Sorry I told, I just needed you to know
I think in decimals and dollars
I am the cause to all your problems
Shelter from cold, we're never alone
Coordinate brain and mouth
Then ask me what its like to have myself so figured out
I wish I knew

I hope this song starts a craze
The kind of song that ignites the airways
The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are
With whoever they're there with
This is war
Every line is about who I don't want to write about anymore
Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose
Don't have the cure for
Holding on to your grudge
Oh it's so hard to have someone to love
And keeping quiet is hard
'Cause you can't keep a secret if it was never was a secret to start
At least pretend you didn't want to get caught

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, now we're throwing the fight
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
I just want to believe (in us)

Oh we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial
We are entirely smooth
We admit to the truth, we are the best at what we do
And these are the words you wish you wrote down
This is the way you wish your voice sounds
Handsome and smart
Oh my tongue's the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart
And it's all from watching TV
And from speeding up my breathing
I wouldn't stop if I could, oh it hurts to be this good
Holding on to your grudge
Oh it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love
Oh so let it go

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, now we're throwing the fight
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
I just want to believe

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, now we're throwing the fight
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
I just want to believe (in us)

(This is intolerable)
This is the grace only we can bestow
This is the price you pay for loss of control
This is the break in the bend
This is the closest of calls
This is the reason you're alone
This is the rise and the fall

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, now we're throwing the fight
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, now we're throwing the fight
I just want to believe
I just want to believe
I just want to believe (in us)
