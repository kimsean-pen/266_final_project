There's a med man in the desert.
Who controls the gates of heaven.
There's a med man in the desert.

There's a med man in the desert.
Who can make me fly in heaven
There's a med man in the desert.

Inhale the love, explore the dream.
Just close your eyes,
I'll make your darkness disappear.
Far from the world, believe in me.
As we set sail out to another galaxy.

Inhale the love, explore the dream.
Just close your eyes,
I'll make your darkness disappear.
Far from the world, believe in me.
As we set sail out to another galaxy.
