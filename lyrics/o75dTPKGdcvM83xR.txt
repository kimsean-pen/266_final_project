Fire in the sky
Shadows unite
The world is outside
We hide
Beats fight the war
Close the door
Close the door
Searching for the cure on the floor

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right

Tears fallin' down
Underground, underground
Following the sound
Of the crowd
Reflection of the light
In your eyes
In your eyes
We are rising high
Tonight

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right

We don't care
We don't care
We don't care
We don't care
We don't care
Don't care

It hurts, but it feels right
We found love
In this club tonight
We found love
In this club tonight
We found love
In this club tonight
Girls and girls
And boys and boys

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right

We found us, us
In this club, club
We found us, us
It hurts
But it feels right
