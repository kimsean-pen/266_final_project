Everybody needs that special place
That kinda makes you feel a certain way
Somewhere you're at ease, somewhere you're safe
Oh oh oh oh

It can be a million miles away
It can be the smile on your mothers face
Be a helping hand on a bad day
Oh oh oh oh

No hold on
Wait a minute
Say what
Let me finish

Home
Home is wherever you roam
Home's where you're never alone
Home is that place in your heart
You are home
Where you pick up the strength to move on
The side of your loved ones arms
No matter how close or far
You are home

Oh oh oh oh
You are home
Oh oh oh oh

I was there when hell froze
When the walls came down and the gates closed
Family and friends are lost and both
Oh oh oh oh

Had to dig myself up from underneath
Find some solid ground to place my feet
On the road I didn't know where it would lead
Oh oh oh oh

A new day
A new beginning
Thank God
I'm still living

Oh oh oh oh
Home
Home is wherever you roam
Home's where you're never alone
Home is that place in your heart

You are home
(Home is wherever you roam)
Home's where you're never alone
Home is that place in your heart
You are home
You pick up the strength to move on
The side of your loved ones arms
No matter how close or far

You are home
