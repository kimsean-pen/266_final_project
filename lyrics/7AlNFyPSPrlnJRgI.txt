I'm in a band and I love it
I'm in a band and I love it
All I wanna do is play my guitar and rock 'n' roll

When I hear speakers pushing the air
There's nothing better you can feel it
It's addicting, I swear
Step on stage, feel lights on my face
Let the whole world know that I'm ready for 'em, baby

I don't care if this thing doesn't work out
Because the louder you scream
The louder I'll shout
I'm gonna bash it till I'm blue in the face
The time is now, gotta do this, gonna make my day

I'm in a band and I love it
All I wanna do is play my guitar and rock 'n' roll
Plug me in and I'll kick it
All I wanna do is jam with my band and hit the road

I love this music, wanna play it so bad
I feel the call of the road, it makes say hot damn
All I wanna do is leave right now
I've been waiting for so long and I have no doubt

When we rocking out it feels like we're dreaming
When I say it, believe it, when we play it, we mean it
Nobody gonna stand in my way
If they do, oh yeah, I know exactly what to say

I'm in a band and I love it, oh yeah
I'm in a band and I love it
All I wanna do is play my guitar and rock 'n' roll

Turn off the lights, let me rip it
All I wanna do is pick up a microphone and put on a show
I'm in a band and I love it
All I wanna do is play my guitar and rock 'n' roll

You might think I'm foolish
That's alright
You might think I'm outrageous
That's out of sight
You might think I'm silly
Or just wound too tight
You might think I'm crazy
Oh, you might be right
You might just be right
You might just be right, oh yeah

I'm in a band and I love it
All I wanna do is play my guitar and rock 'n' roll
Just plug me in and I'll kick it
All I wanna do is jam with my band and hit the road, baby

I'm in a band
It feels so good
I wanna leave town and never come back
I'm in a band and I love it
You wanna be in a band?

In the heat of the night or while the sun is shining bright
Let's hit the road and rock 'n' roll, so glad to be alive
And if you only knew
It's all I wanna do
Play my guitar and rock 'n' roll
