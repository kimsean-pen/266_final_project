When you see a ghost
Someone that you used to know
You want to stand
For what it is you had
It's happened again
You go and get away with it
This room ain't cold
After you walked in

And if your past calls don't you pick it up
It's got nothing new to say
I know that people change but never stay the same and leave without a trace
And woah
Are you waiting on someone who can make you feel a little more like you
Are you waiting someone too to make you feel to make you feel brand new

It don't feel right letting you walk away
What if I
What have I got to gain
Filling the gas of your first contender
It's not what you planned
You're history holds you back

And if your past calls don't you pick it up
It's got nothing new to say
Are you waiting on someone
Who can make you feel a little more like you
Are you waiting someone too
To make you feel
To make you feel brand new
And I hope they do

Woah

Are you waiting on someone
Who can make you feel a little more like you
Are you waiting someone too
To make you feel
To make you feel brand new
And I hope they do
