Do some people wind up with the one that they adore
In a heart shaped hotel room, it's what a heart is for
The bubble floats so madly will it stay sky high?
Hello partner, kiss your name bye bye
Sometimes

Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
Chinese speaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail

And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand in hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark

Do some people wind up, with the one that they abhor
In a distant hell hole room, third world war
But all I see is films where a colorless despair
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
Sometimes

Get up a voice inside says, "There's no time for looking down"
Only a pound a word and you're talking to the town
But how do you coin the phrase though that will set your soul apart?
Just to touch a lonely heart

And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand in hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark

It's you I need in the summertime
As I turn my white skin red
Two peas from the same pod yes we are
Or have I read too much fiction? Is this how it happens?

How does it happens?
How does it happens?
How does it happens?
Is this how it happens?
Now, right now
