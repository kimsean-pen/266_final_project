Gun fire in the street
Where we used to meet
Echoes out a beat and the bass goes
Bomb right over my head
Step over the dead
Remember what you said, you know, the part about
Life is just a waking dream
Well I know what you mean
But that ain't how it seems right here right now
How can this be real
I can barely feel
Anymore

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe

Blood hardens in the sand
Cold metal in my hand
Help you understand
The way that things are gonna be
There's nowhere else to hide
'Cause god is on our side
I keep telling myself

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe

No one's even sure
What we're fighting for
Or who we even are
Anymore
I feel
So far away
