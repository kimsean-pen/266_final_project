Chhh, Chhh, Chhh, Chhh
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhh,
Ohhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhh

Bringing out the holden
Shining in the view
We've been bored to seldom don't know what to do
All these empty lies we pasteurized as truth
We're left in the cold and now it's up to you

You've been tricked and you made up your mind
Without even thinking
All the good deeds you did left behind
And the options are shrinking
Do you know why we all look the same?
The scale of destruction
You feel guilty and know who to blame
It's the Puppet Theatre
The Puppet Theatre

Half the population laying on the couch
And the rest of us in a constant state of doubt
Yeah they look so neat sized up in shirt and tie
But you wouldn't want to be at the rot in the side

You've been tricked and you made up your mind
Without even thinking
All the good deeds you did left behind
And the options are shrinking
Do you know why we all look the same?
The scale of destruction
You feel guilty and know who to blame
It's the Puppet Theatre
The Puppet Theatre

Living in a box no windows to the world
Not caught up your sleeve no hate to watch you hurt
Let me be your guide to fall off from your cliff
Laying side by side till we're cold and stiff
Till we're cold and stiff
