I was running out in the cold night
Wondering where to go
To run away
Without you
All my fame is coming home
And it's ripped out for the soul
You can't be me
I will become you tonight

I was wandering under black skies
Clutching at what is mine
No control
Left to lose
Well I thought that it wouldn't faze me
I am hiding like a child
I feel so guilty
I'll make it up to you tonight

Visions I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return to abuse us

I was breaking out of my old skin
Choking upon release
I'm in no state
To judge you
Scratching itches best left alone
Chasing memories I used to own
I can't wait
'Til this is over
Tonight

Visions I've been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return to abuse us
Well the nightmares I've been having have arrived
They're changing my future
Signs of my creation at my door
How could you do this to her?
