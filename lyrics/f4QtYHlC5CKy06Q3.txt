I can't stand the way you always lead me on
I follow blindly right behind you and I still get lost
You never look and check to see
If maybe I'm ok
This crazy world you live in
Is filled with mistakes
I, I lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream your name
I try to fight it
I try to fight it
And I can't stand the way your lies they seem so real
Now every time I burn inside it's all that I can feel
You promise you will always change
But things just stay the same
You bend me till you break me and it's driving me insane
But then I see you smile...
I, l lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream your name
I try to fight it
I try to fight it
It's just the touch of your skin
The way you pull me in
I can't deny it
I try to fight it
But then I see you smile
And I, I lose it all when I speak to you
Your face, your eyes, changes what I've been through
Now, now I can't help but to scream out your name
I try to fight it
I try to fight it
I try to fight it
I try to fight it
