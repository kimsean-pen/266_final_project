Now don't tell me what a man won't do for a man
What a woman won't do for her man
Since I have met you
It ain't nothing but trouble
But girl Sho'got a thing about you
Friends say it's just a matter of time
Before you leavin
Before you leavin
Me behind
I know you're using me just like a stepping stone
But guess what
I'm gonna use you like the way you've used me

It's how you make it good it makes you bad
Girl you sure got my mind messed up
You know i'm just a fool for ya
And I need you
And I need you tonight
Friends say it's just a matter of time
Before you leavin
Before you leavin
Me behind
I know you're using me just like a stepping stone
But guess what
I'm gonna use you like the way you've used me

I know you're using me just like a stepping stone
But guess what
I'm gonna use you like the way you've used me

I know you're using me just like a stepping stone
But guess what
