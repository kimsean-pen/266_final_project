Oh baby, hey!

Spend three hours on your hair (For what?)
But he don't notice, he don't care
Goddamn, you looking good
He don't appreciate ya' like a real man should

All my independent ladies, all my independent fellas
I'm just here to make your ex-man jealous
Dance the night away with me

I can keep you warm
Be the candy on your arm
So let's take a shot, or two
Dance the night away with you

Single ladies, got no ring on your hand
Baby, I'll be your stand-in man for tonight
Sexy ladies, no, I ain't on your team
But you gonna be my queen for tonight

Oh, I'll be sleeping in your bed
Watching old re-runs of Friends
No, I won't ever make a move on you, no
But I heard your brother's pretty cute

All my independent ladies, all my independent fellas
I'm just here to make your ex man jealous
Dance the night away with me

I can keep you warm
Be the candy on your arm
So let's take a shot, or two
Dance the night away with you

Single ladies, got no ring on your hand
Baby, I'll be your stand-in man for tonight
Sexy ladies, no, I ain't on your team
But you gonna be my queen for tonight

All my ladies, all my handsome men
If you out here single as Hell, just raise your hands
You're amazing, you're a perfect ten
And if you out here single as Hell, just raise your hands

All my independent ladies, all my independent fellas
I'm just here to make your ex-man jealous
Dance the night away with me

I can keep you warm
Be the candy on your arm
So let's take a shot, or two
Dance the night away with you

Single ladies, got no ring on your hand
Baby, I'll be your stand-in man for tonight
Sexy ladies, no, I ain't on your team
But you gonna be my queen for tonight

Shout out to my sexy ladies
Oh, baby
