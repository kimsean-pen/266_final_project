PEARL BOMB

Croak radio gives me the shakes. That's no surprise
Cuz I can feel both barrels of your eyes. Understand
what I'm sayin just like a hole beat red. You think
I'm bine. You take a leg. You feel a nice teen tone
bime-b-b-bye. Left dog. See big, boy, after your
dirty little tee bits all in seein my meat. I took a
team of you. Your bo-dy. For left-ov-er your sane.

Green water like a sugarback I bet your bine. Read
both bladder steps of foamy decline. Limbo. Lacky.
Sucker. Yes her limbo baba's at home and they cry
like half-dead dog bug.
