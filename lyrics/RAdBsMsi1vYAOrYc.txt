Stand aside now no one will survice can't tell you how I know
In some time I will change my name and lay low
In the light you can see me walk down by the way
The one who did this to us well he got away

Keep it quiet here I will not tolerate your noise
This is where I listen for

Keep it quiet here I will not tolerate your noise
This is where I listen for the forgiving voice

Keep it quiet here I will not tolerate your noise
This is where I listen for the forgiving voice

It haunts my dreams
It haunts my dreams
It haunts my dreams
It haunts my dreams

Keep it quiet here I will not tolerate your noise
This is where I listen for the forgiving voice

It haunts my dreams
It haunts my dreams
Haunts my dreams
