Who are you?
You're looking like a stranger
You were once my love & my savior
Now I'm left with nothing but your makeup on my pillow

And I can't sleep, the pills, they never help
Try counting sheep, still hurts like hell
I can't believe this rose has lost its red and its petals

Who put that rock in your chest?
Won't you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

Wakin' up just brings me down, down
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found
And my bed is half empty, not half full
I'd rather live with broken bones than lay here all on my own
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool

Where'd you go?
You said you'd never leave me
All alone my heart is barely beating
Like a ghost, you haunt me everyday that you're gone

I'm not the same now something went missing
There's a cage, it feels like a prison
Here I'll stay until you come back home, home

Who put that rock in your chest?
Won't you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

Wakin' up just brings me down, down
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found
And my bed is half empty, not half full
I'd rather live with broken bones than lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Am I a lovesick fool?
Or am I giving up?
Am I a lovesick fool?

Wakin' up just brings me down, down
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found

Wakin' up just breaks me down, down
'Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found
And my bed is half empty, not half full
I'd rather live with broken bones than lay here all on my own
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
Like a lovesick fool
