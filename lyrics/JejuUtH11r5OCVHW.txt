Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Down, down under the earth goes another lover

12 Tongues put a hex on you
Small mouths don't dare to shout it out
No fun for a night out
No fun for a night out on the town

Twelve times put a hex on you
Small mouths don't dare to shout it out
No fun for a night out
No fun for a night out on the town

Runaway, runaway not a ghost or roach would stay,
You're on your own, on your own, you're not safe.

Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Milk you for what you're worth and call it murder
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
