Time can't erase, together, oh

Fucked up nigga, I don't want your pity
I just wanted love but I'm way too busy
Rap moving up, I might come to your city
It's hot in the H but my heart still chilly
I just need a gram, some bread and a quickie
If I ain't your man, I don't want no hickey
Right now I ain't shit 'cause the roll ain't shitty
Been like that for months, I might roll a blunt
And hit that shit once
'Cause a nigga been sober
Bet I can't wait till the day this shit over
Used to walking round with a chip on my shoulder
For every last person I loved who folded
I would give grace
But I'd rather give closure
I would take breaks
But I'd rather move forward
I done been chewed up, spit out, kicked out, let down
But I'm still a motherfucking soldier

So fuck what you told me if you showed me different
Fuck what you showed me if you came up missing
I know that actions speak louder than words
The thing about change
They never consistent
I didn't got paid more than I paid attention
I didn't feel pain more than I like to mention
Heart on my sleeve 'till it's left on the curb
When I smoke these herbs
I can't make decision

You niggas be bitches, you bitches be hoes
You switching up more than you switch out clothes
I push that white till I get it in gold
And light up the heat with the knife, you too cold
The only thing keeping me up from the nose
Besides all the bread I'ma make from these shows
My life going fast and I like moving slow
And I've been unknown for five days in a row

I might fly away, yeah yeah
I might fly away, yeah yeah
I'll be fine today, yeah yeah
I'll be fine today, yeah yeah

I might fly away, yeah yeah
(Fly away, go fly)
I might fly away, yeah yeah
(Fly away, go fly)
I'll be fine today, yeah yeah
(Fine, you go, be fine)
I'll be fine today, yeah yeah
(Fine, you go, be fine)
