We are the scum of the Earth
The voice in the crowd
Of a thousand mouths
The ones who fight on
Because we always fight on
Oh, we'll never back down

Pre-
Will I ever be the man?
They never expected of me
Will I lose myself in this
I am not free, we are not free

We are not free,
We will be lost and forgotten
Lose myself in this
We are buried under the ashes we warred in
When will we be free?
So lost and forgotten
So lost and forgotten

Just a couple steps closer
It's only getting harder
With every inch I know that you wonder
If in the end,
All the Wain has made you stronger

Will I ever be the man?
I am not free, we will never be free

We are not free,
We will be lost and forgotten
Lose myself in this
We are buried under the ashes we warred in
When will we be free?
So lost and forgotten
So lost and forgotten

We're lost and forgotten
We are not free,
We will be lost and forgotten

The voice of a thousand mouths
We are not free,
We will be lost and forgotten
We are buried under the ashes we warred in
So lost and forgotten
When will we be free?
So lost and forgotten

We are the, we are the scum of the earth
