Time can't afford no time
Can't afford the rhyme
Never mind, someday maybe
Boy meets girl
And love, love is on it's way

Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl

Bang, feel a little love
Carino dime
Never mind, someday Terry
Feel the pain
Hit, feel, rap, sweat

Why, feel the floor
Sweets for my way
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl

Why, feel the floor
Sweets for my way
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl

Feel the rhyme
Take the time
Go fighting to the top
Go number one
Stick a honey bun
Your mind begins to flop

How take in steam
Recall your dream
Hey Camisas
Your favorite shirt is on the bed
Do a somersault on your head
