I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you
I never slide upon your face
You give it all with join grace
When I found you

When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burning up inside
When I found you
I never slide upon your face
You give it all with join grace
When I found you

When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burnin' up inside
When I found you
I never slide upon your face
You give it all with join grace
When I found you
When I found you

I saw the tears in your eyes
They got me burnin' up inside
When I found you
When I found you
