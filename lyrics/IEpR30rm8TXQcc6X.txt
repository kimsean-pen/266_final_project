Just let me close my eyes.
I haven't been this scared in a while.
I'll keep not listening to you.
Even after all you put me through.
Just wake me up when this is over.
Because I can't stand to be like this forever.
And I hope I don't wake up until you die,
and I hope they eat out your insides.
Don't wake me up.
