Cause the freedom fires from my memory
But I know you're still haunting everything
And though someday maybe it'll be okay
But I can't escape right now...

I've damned myself tonight
I pray I'll be alright
But you let me down I swear
Trying to cut you out
Can't even scream or shout
Cause you left me numb my dear

Oh, won't you let me go?
Don't say it's okay
I was on my way to healing, oh

Something I just need to learn
Every time I feel alone
I can't keep running back to you again

Turned my golden into dust
Rain on me until I rust
All I do is run to you again

Summers are over, lights can shine again
Leaving myself to something I can't mend
And although someday maybe I'll be okay
But I'm not to blame, oh no...

I've damned myself tonight
I pray I'll be alright
But you let me down I swear
Trying to cut you out
Can't even scream or shout
Cause you left me numb my dear

Oh, won't you let me go?
Don't say it's okay
I was on my way to healing, oh

Something I just need to learn
Every time I feel alone
I can't keep running back to you again

Turned my golden into dust
Rain on me until I rust
All I do is run to you again

Baby, I was on my way
I was on my way
I was on my way

Something I just need to learn
Every time I feel alone
I can't keep running back to you again

Turned my golden into dust
Rain on me until I rust
All I do is run to you again

Baby, I was on my way
I was on my way
I was on my way
