I remember you said
Do you even need me?
Is it outside my head?
Tell me am I worthy?
I remember you said
Do you even see me?
Go find someone else instead
Tell me am I worthy?

Am I even worthy
Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?

Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?

I remember you said
Do you even hear me?
Are you ever coming back?
Tell me am I worth it?
I remember you said
Do you even feel me?
Looking back at my worst end
Tell me am I worthy?

Am I even worthy
Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?

Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?

Am I worthy
Am I worthy
Am I worthy

Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy?
Tell me am I worthy
