When sorrow calls my name
And grief runs in my veins
Can I begin
The bleeding

When air becomes a pain
And it hurts to inhale
Can I just stop
Cease breathing

A shriek from the void
Exhales the words
Painted to be seen
Screams from within

Speaks softly, howls aloud
Rushing forward like a tide
Drowns like a flood
Buries inside

Vaikka aurinko jo nousi
Ja valossa kylpee maa
J
