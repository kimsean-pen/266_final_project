Wrap your arms and hold me still
I don't wanna think about what I will
Speak in tones that I can't hear
And tell me how no one knows anything in here

Is it any wonder I try?
Is it any wonder I try?
'Cause I thought we were so much more
I thought you wanted what I want
So completely I did fall
If I'm not here to love you, what am I here for?

I didn't know where to begin
So I wore a dress the sequined
I wanted to say that I adored
The way that I felt and we always knew more

Is it any wonder why?
Is it any wonder why?
'Cause I thought we were so much more
I thought you wanted what I want
So completely I did fall
If I'm not here to love you, what am I here for?

You started looking to your right
So I looked to follow
You started looking to your right
So I looked to follow
You started looking to your right
So I looked to follow your right, your right
You know she was in-between
Something out of heaven and a holy dream

Is it any wonder I cry?
Is it any wonder I cry?
'Cause I thought he was so much more
I thought you wanted what I want
So completely I did fall
If I'm not here to love you, what am I here for?
