Where did everybody go, may you never know
.slipped away
Seeking out where the rights alone
I feel sick man the world treat the.

I'd see the light... carry us
Can't you read this now, you're sincerious

Chorus:
Get out, get out, get out if you can
'cause my hands are shaking
Let's go again, again and again
This walls are breaking.
Bro bro bro, broken again.

What's wrong with me man I don't do right,
Just relax, take a breath for something
It's too late 'cause the shame.
.I'm crolling you out

I see the light,. can't you read this .

Chorus:
Get out, get out, get out if you can
'cause my hands are shaking
Let's go again, again and again
This walls are breaking.

Bro bro, let's go again
Bro bro, again.

So come on and say what you wanna say
We can break this game, anyway, anyway
'
What you wanna say
Would you play this game
No one, .again.

Chorus:
Get out, get out, get out if you can
'cause my hands are shaking
Let's go again, again and again
This walls are breaking.

Broken again
Bro bro 'broken again
