Sometimes when you're Zorg, hm
And I'm your 'Betty Blue'
And we're singing it close
Like, the girls in 'Belleville Rendevous'

I wish
That we
Could somehow freeze the frame
But this isn't the silver screen, no...

There's no pause...
No rewind...

Time to find out where the story goes
Sat hip to hip with the curtains close
Watching ourselves 'Au Cinéma'

Take our positions as the cameras roll
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl
Watching ourselves 'Au Cinéma'

Now we'll cut to the girl, alone
She's found on the Brooklyn Bridge
And she's truly at home, home
Her step has a whole new spring
Big bright lights of the city are shining for her
There's a thirst in her eyes in her eyes and her heart
Though she thinks to look back
Back, she won't

There's no pause
No rewind
No pause
No rewind
Time to find out where the story goes
Sat hip to hip with the curtains close
Watching ourselves 'Au Cinéma'
Take our positions as the cameras roll
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl
Watching ourselves 'Au Cinéma'
