I can't keep up
You're moving too fast
Deep holes and darkness
These things will part

Dark times and strange places where
When I came to see you
You had nothing to say
I stood right beside you
You turned the other way
I reached out to hold you
And found nobody there
You turn into air

Trust me, I want you
Just as you are
Don't change the things you do
Just stay as you are

Dark times and strange places where
When I came to see you
You had nothing to say
I stood right beside you
You turned the other way
I reached out to hold you
And found nobody there
You turn into air

Dark times and strange places where
When I came to see you
You had nothing to say
I stood right beside you
You turned the other way
I reached out to hold you
And found nobody there
You turn into air
