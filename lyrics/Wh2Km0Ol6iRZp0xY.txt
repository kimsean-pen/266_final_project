It'd been too many times that i stuck out my neck
for you
it's been too many times that i spoke my mind
for you
it's been too many times that i caught all the flak
from you
apathetic crap is all i can find
in you
I don't want no part in this
i don't feel the need to score
burnt all bridges close to the heart
i don't want to be a part
no more
Dosvidanija ciao adieu
hasta la vista i'm on my way
goodbye sayonara
auf nimmerweidersehen
over and out
and down the drain
It's been too many times that i raised my voice
at you
it's been too many times that i walked the line
with you
it's been too many times that ive had no choice
but you
hypocritical swine i have had it this time
thank you
I don't want no part in this
i don't feel the need to score
burnt all bridges close to the heart
i don't want to be a part
no more
Dosvidanija ciao adieu
hasta la vista i'm on my way
goodbye sayonara
auf nimmerweidersehen
over and out
and down the drain
