I made a resolution and I plan to keep my work
But I need you to make it work
You've got to read the message
Understand what's on my mind
'Cause not to see would be a crime
And we could lose it anytime

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

But I believe in workin', then I believe in a little help
'Cause I'm not a allowed unto myself
Without a thing of value
Why settle for second best
And we don't know what's up ahead
And we can't let ourselves forget

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

For the things that I love about you
From the woman that you see inside
Don't let it walk out the door
Love follows every time

A little respect
For the things that I love about you
For the woman that you see inside

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
Got to, got to show some respect

Got to, got to show some respect
Got to, got to have it, got to, got to have it
Got to, got to to hold it, got to, got to hold it
Got to, got to earn some respect
