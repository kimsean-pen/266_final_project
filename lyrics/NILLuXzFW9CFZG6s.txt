He did nothing perfect
He did nothing quite well
He did nothing perfectly, much better then anyone I've ever seen

He did nothing all the time
He did nothing constantly
He did nothing everyday, more often than anyone I've ever seen

He felt, and he felt miserably
He felt, and he felt quite bad
He felt, and he felt quite miserably
What's better he never even had to try
