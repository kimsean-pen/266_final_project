Sometimes I find another world
Inside my mind
When I realise
The crazy things we do
It makes me feel ashamed to be alive
It makes me wanna run away and hide
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I don't think It's funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I think we got it all wrong anyway
We find strange ways of showing
Them how much we really care
When in fact
We just don't seem to care at all
This pretty world
Is getting out of hand
So tell me how we fail to understand?
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I don? t think It? s funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I think we got it all wrong anyway
Anyway
Cause it's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I don't think it's funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I think we got it all wrong
Anyway
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I don't think it's funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum...
And I think we got it all wrong anyway
Anyway
