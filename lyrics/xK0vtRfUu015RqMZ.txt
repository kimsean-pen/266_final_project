From the beginning
I drew pictures
Of the searching sun
Blissfully denying what is instinct

Since the beginning
I've seen color
But lately it's been tainted
With grays and under-glows

A constant fight
With who I am and who I have to be

Forgive me for the fool that I've become
I take back the stupid things I've done
How do we keep our innocence?
We're burning away...

Sometimes the human resides inside of me
A temperamental fire that's burning like a midnight star
For you

A backlit medley of hello and goodbyes
Our trip-wire catching
There's good in every try

A constant fight
With who I am and who I have to be

Forgive me for the fool that I've become
I take back the stupid things I've done
How do we keep our innocence?
We're burning away...

One kiss
No one
Toxic melody
Creeps in my
Body
Wrapped in
Morning
Paint my future

Forgive me for the fool that I've become
I take back the stupid things I've done
How do we keep our innocence?
We're burning away...

I'm tired of trying
How long will it take?
To break away
From all of my dirty mistakes

How do we keep our innocence?
We're burning away...
