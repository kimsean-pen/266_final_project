You think we look pretty good together.
You think my shoes are made of leather.
But I'm a substitute for another guy.
I look pretty tall but my heels are high.
The simple things you see are all complicated.
I look pretty young but I'm just back dated, yeah.
Substitute your lies for facts.
I see right through your plastic mac.
I look all white but my dad was black.
My brand new suit's really made out of sack.
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth.
The North side of my town faced East and the east was facing South.
And now you dare to look me in the eye.
Those crocodile tears are what you cry.
It's a genuine problem you won't try
to work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by.
Substitute me for him.
Substitute my Coke for gin.
Substitute you for my Mum,
at least I'll get my washing done.
