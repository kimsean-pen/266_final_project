What you get is get what you see
Like a birds and bees
It should be easy to be free

You might not knowing yet
But I'm someone you won't forget
No apologies for being me

Cause if that's what I am
So be it
Know that when I say
I'll be
If that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
And if I can see
I can be
Whatever I believe
Let me believing
If that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am

Nobody's fool
I was born to break the rules
I'm just looking for the answer
Somewhere deep within my soul
I know it's gonna show

You might not knowing yet
But I'm someone you won't forget
No apologies for being me

Cause if that's what I am
So be it
Know that when I say
I'll be
If that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
And if I can see
I can be
Whatever I believe
Let me believing
If that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
That's what I am

So be it, so be it
I'll be
That's what I am, that's what I am
Yeah that's what I am
Look at me baby, look at me baby
This is what I am, it's what I am
That's what I am, that's what I am
Got to believe, got to believe
