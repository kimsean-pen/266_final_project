Get out there and make it look good

Well, she threw downtown on a gambling green
And fenced a chicken dog in a movie
A long haired baby got a record machine
Like a hacksaw falling on me
Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon
Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon

Dead girl, dead girl
Dead girl, dead girl

Well, she blew uptown on a cemetery sound
And wore leather pants for a week, yeah
A canteen butcher got tiger teeth
And a handmade circus freak, yeah

Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon
Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon

Dead girl, dead girl
Dead girl, dead girl superstar

Woman: I want you to come out there and shake your asses proper you hear you hear
Woman: I want you to come out there and shake your asses proper you hear

Well, she hit the ground like a bounty killer clown
With a fistful of dollars to eat, yeah
I see her there with blood in her hair
And a flesh killing brat to beat, yeah

Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon
Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon

Dead girl, dead girl
Dead girl, dead girl
Dead girl, dead girl
Dead girl, dead girl superstar
