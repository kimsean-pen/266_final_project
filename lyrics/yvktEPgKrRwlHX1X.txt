How'd I wind up here again?
It's like I'm always getting
Blood on my hands.
All it takes is one
And I'm gone
And a thousand till the end.
How'd I wind up here again?

You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.

Holding on too hard.

Tell me why
Does everything that I love
Get taken away
From me?
Why does everything that I love
Get taken away?
You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.
Holding on too hard.
Tell me why
Does everything that I love

Get taken away
From me?

How can nothing ever lasts?
It goes from
Good to bad to worse
So fast.
All it takes is one

And I'm gone
And I can't erase the past.
How come nothing ever lasts?

You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.
Holding on too hard.

Tell me why does
Everything that I love
Get taken away
From me?
Why does everything that I love
Get taken away
You take me to the edge.
You push me too far.
You watch me slip away.
Holding on too hard.

Tell me why
Does everything that I love
Get taken away
From me?
Here I am alone again.

Alone again.

Here I am alone again.
How can nothing ever lasts?
It goes from
Good to bad to worse
So fast.
Tell me why

Does everything that I love
Get taken away from me?
Why does everything that I love
Get taken away?
You take me to the edge.
You push me to far.
You watch me slip away.
Holding on too hard.
Tell me why
Does everything that I love
Get taken away?
Tell me why
Does everything that I love
Get taken away
From me?
