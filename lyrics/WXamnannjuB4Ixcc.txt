Tell me of the moor
I've heard them say that it is true

Eliminates every piece of you

Forget it all

Take me to the moor where memories fade
And I'll begin anew
Walk with me this long remorseful path
Until I prevail

Forget it all
Sorrow until nightfall
Forget it all
Torment me until dawn

Forget it all
Sorrow until nightfall
Forget it all
Torment me until dawn

Take me to the moor where I will feel
Like a newborn
Dusk will lure me in, and make me pay for a new dawn

Forget it all
Sorrow until nightfall
Forget it all
Torment me until dawn

There's no doubt, I'm caving in
Giving in, letting go
Take me there, oh take me there
To the moor, to the end
Will I be innocent again?
Forget every single day?

Take me there, oh take me there
To the moor, to the end
Will I be innocent again?
Forget every single day?

Take me there, oh take me there
To the moor, to the end
Will I be innocent again?
Forget every single day?

Take me there, oh take me there
To the moor, to the end
