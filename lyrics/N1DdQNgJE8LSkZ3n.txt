It's weird to think about it but
We are all throwing ourselves into the abyss
Into some unknown environment
We like to say we know to an extent, but really don't
I guess I am trying to rationalize it but it's difficult
The monsters out there are way scarier than the ones in my closet
Yet, we're are so drawn to take those steps outside
Do you think it's because we see something more out there?
Maybe, but we also know the dangers
Are possibilities something to be feared or celebrated?
I don't know
Well, we move forward regardless
Are you scared?
Terrified

And when I said I could never stay
The wind will sweep me away
The sun is melting the glue
Holding these wings that promised more

As summer came and went, our friends took flight
We spent a year collecting all the feathers they left behind
Maybe I was wrong, maybe I should stay
But maybe I was lying to myself
And maybe everything will be okay
But, no matter what I say
Our futures lie in the North Migration
