Come on, can't I dream for one day
There's nothing that can't be done
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone

'Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Can I break the spell of the typical

I've lived through my share of misfortune
And I've worked in the blazing sun
But how long should it take somebody
Before they can be someone

Cause I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Can I break the spell of the typical,
the typical, the typical, uh huh

I'm the typical
I'm the typical
Can I break the spell of the typical

Because it's dragging me down
I'd like to know about when
When does it all turn around

I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical

Yeah I know there's got to be another level
Somewhere closer to the other side
And I'm feeling like it's now or never
Can I break the spell of the typical
The typical, the typical, uh huh

Of the typical
Break the spell (of the typical)
Break the spell (of the typical)
Can I break the spell of the typical, of the typical
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical
I'm just the typical
