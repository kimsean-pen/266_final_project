Rollin' out of Richmond
With a load of dusty gold
It shines
I gotta get a little more time
To shine
I just need a little more time
Uh huh

Goin' wherever I can
Put the money in my hand
So I can shine
I gotta get a little more time
To shine
I just need a little more time
Uh huh

Workin' just to be there on clock
Alls I need is one more stop

If you even knew
The things I do for you
You'd pray
Like I do

Killing time forever
Waiting for the man
So I can shine
I gotta get a little more time
To shine
I just need a little more time
Uh huh

Today is gonna be the day
All my sins get washed away

If you even knew
The things I do for you
You'd pray
Like I do

If you even knew
The things I do for you
You'd pray
Like I do

Heard a shot comin' in
From the apple orchard line
In the pines
I gotta get a little more time
To shine
I just a need a little more time
Uh huh
I gotta get a little more time
Uh huh
I just need a little more time
Uh huh
