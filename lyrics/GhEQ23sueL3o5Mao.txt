We are the ones
The ones forgotten
And this time
The future is ours
Its in our hands

We're the tear in your eyes
We're the blood in your veins
We're the beat of your hearts
We're the sweat on your face
We're the ones that you chase
We're the promise that you made
We're the voice in your head
We're the lies that you said
We're the kids that you pushed away
We are...

We are the ones
The ones forgotten
And this time
The future is ours
Its in our hands
We are one

We're the pride of your lives
We're the light shining deep in your eyes
We're the choice that you made
We're the smile on your face
When you sleep at night

We're the best thing you had
But you left us behind
We're the kids that you pushed away
We are...

We are the ones
The ones forgotten
And this time
The future is ours
Its in our hands
We are one

We're the pain that you feel
We're the scars that don't heal
We're the tear in your eyes
We're the reason you cry

We're the voice in your head
We're the lies that you said
We're the best thing you had but you pushed us away

We are the ones
The ones forgotten
And this time
The future is ours
Its in our hands
We are...

We are the ones
The ones forgotten
And we've got
Nothing to lose
Together we stand up tall
We are one
