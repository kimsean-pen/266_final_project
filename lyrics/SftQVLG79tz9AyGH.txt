I had a change of heart
But don't know where to start

Cause you dont deserve him and theres no other way, yeah yeah

I won't let you go, you know I'm comin for you
No matter what it's gonna take I gotta make this move
You're the one that I choose, you know I'm comin for you

And I just can't go another day
Without you next to me, oh, oh yeah

Don't know what to say
Guess I'll take the blame
Eventually it was bound to happen
I know you played your part

But it's the right thing to do

When you dont wanna hurt him
Cause you dont deserve him
And theres no other way, yeah yeah yeah
