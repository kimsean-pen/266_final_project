A fading hope and a broken dream
Is all there is for me
It's all there was and will ever be
And I keep falling further down

We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can't deny
We've been lost all the time

There's no way to cope for these wasted years
Nor for these long lost tears
I'm giving in to all my fears
As I keep falling further down

We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can't deny
We've been lost all the time

We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can't deny
We've been lost all the time

We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can't deny
We've been lost all the time
