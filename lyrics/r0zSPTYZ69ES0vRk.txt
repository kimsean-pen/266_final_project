I can't understand
What's going on in your head
But I want you back

Does it make you scared
That the fault lies in my bed
Does it make you mad, all the tears you shed

Things will never be the same
Always looking for someone to put the blame on
You know I still want you

Patience wearing thin
It's getting harder to breathe
Standing all around me

I think astronomy
Clouds in the galaxy
Closing in on me, and it's spiraling

Loose threads rippin' off
My glitter finery
Lost my identity
A horrible tragedy

Things will never be the same
Always looking for someone to put the blame on
You know I still want you

Sinking deeper or so I fear
Risking everything I have for you, my dear

Loose threads ripping up my glitter finery
Lost my identity, a horrible tragedy
