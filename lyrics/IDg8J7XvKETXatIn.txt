I drop a sweat, running down my innocence
Touching me the way you do
I can't breathe and my heart beats so fast
Knowing it belongs to you

I'm out of words, it's just my body's talking
A spoken truth of desire
My blood is pumping and my mind goes crazy
I'm sacrificed in this fire

'Cause you got me craving so bad
Just give it to me
'Cause you got me needing so bad
Gimme gimme

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind

Just give it to me
Ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a

My body's burning but I can't stop shaking
Fever's got me fooled
This sweet pain that I don't wanna medicate
Is only gone when I'm with you

'Cause you got me craving so bad
Just give it to me
'Cause you got me needing so bad
Gimme gimme

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind

Just give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay-yeah
Give it to me
A-a-a-ay
