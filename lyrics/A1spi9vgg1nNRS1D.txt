Snow falling on the tree tops
The streets are bare
Bright lights in the windows
and up the stairs
And all of your silence
And all of your sounds
I still hear the choir
that you are gone
Can't go back
Can't fight this
Oh, water, water
Teardrops are falling out of rain
Oh, daughter, daughter
See, hear you calling my name
Oh
I see your light
In the water, for our life
I'm standing on my tip toes
I'm coming undone
You are my hero
when I was yours
We live but we never know
Lost in the wind
A million candles
just flickering
Can't go back
Can't fight this
Oh, water, water
Teardrops are falling out of rain
Oh, daughter, daughter
See, hear you calling my name
Oh
I see your light
In the water, for our life
Oh, lifted high
Let me lay down on your side
Here I stay
So your soul comes back to mine
Oh, water, water
Teardrops are falling out of rain
Oh, daughter, daughter
See, hear you calling my name
Oh
I see your light
In the water, for our life
