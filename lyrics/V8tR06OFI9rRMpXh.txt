Pain
Come alive
I try to breathe
Shade my eyes
Follow the damned
I have lost the way again

Stay
Trust in life
Carried beneath
Dead arise, sorrow avenged
I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to heaven

Hate, lost inside
I dare to dream
Faithless lies
Caught in the web
I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to heaven

Love

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Release me my love
So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to heaven
I'll sleep close to heaven
I'll sleep close to heaven
