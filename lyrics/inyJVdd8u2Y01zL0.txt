I let the bass drop
Hit that nigga straight up off the glass
Yeah that's a bankshot
Aaron Gordon soarin' over niggas
You the mascot
Nigga hit my jack up for the tricks I brought the mask out
Jim Carrey with the mack out and spazz out
Uh, but all my niggas 'bout the business
Harlem shakin' to the bank and milli rockin' out with chicken
I'm Matt Damon in that bullshit with a pistol on a mission
Like Bruce Willis tryna get it every move you see commitment
Nigga hustle for my piece of pie
Ain't tryna see the [?]
Blow my smoke up to the city sky
We comin' for the shine
Don't approach me from behind
Know the gang is with it, try
Wolves is howlin' at the night
Before it end I bet he cry

I'm addicted to the green
Yeah, that's a strictly veggie diet
I'm what happens if 2Pac and Jay Elec ever collided
Hustle hard dodgin' confinements see the chance to raise the climate
Hydroponic twisting now
Crescendo this shit go loud aye!

If a hater run his mouth, like tic tac toe we cross him out
Take control, the Golden Child
I lead a army, Colin Powell
Like a Marley, smoke a pound
That shit hardly make a sound
Harley David, grip the pavement huntin' niggas hoppin' out
I was brought up in the drop up in the car [?] rhymes
With the product kick the block no bank deposit Nike box
Load the cartridge for the opps
My caller Doodie get the crop
My niggas moody with the choppa
Throw a tantrum shoot ya block up

I'm addicted to the green
Yeah, that's a strictly veggie diet
I'm what happens if 2Pac and Jay Elec ever collided
Hustle hard, dodgin' confinements see the chance to raise the climate
Hydroponic twisting now
Crescendo this shit go loud aye!

All my niggas chase the green we relay racin' to the cabbage
We the nicest two to spit since Prodigy linked up with Havoc
It's a knife no it's a clip and the whole clique is livin' savage
It's a joint no it's a spliff a couple rips will do you damage

Take two hits I'm off the planet
Fuck her raw I'm all organic
Play my cards just like I'm Gambit
Handicap 'em they can't stand it
This that flow that sunk Atlantis
The Titanic make 'em vanish
Like Saitama, I got no challenge
Break your armor with an ad-lib
Most these artists need g-checkin'
They set trippin' talkin' loud
Frontin' all up on a record 'till we run up and get foul
Like a bitch they throw the towel
Yo weak defense won't make the trial
I'm descending straight from heaven but I still will knock you down, uh

I'm addicted to the green
Yeah, that's a strictly veggie diet
I'm what happens if 2Pac and Jay Elec ever collided
Hustle hard, dodgin' confinements see the chance to raise the climate
Hydroponic twisting now
Crescendo this shit go loud aye!
