觸碰的柔軟 持續蔓延
(The softness of touching spreads all over)
像是船舶終於靠岸 太平洋溫度的纏綿
(Like a boat stopped traveling by the
seashore just to feel the gentleness of the ocean)
我甘願淪為 滄海一粟的平凡 卻只是今晚
(Usually I wouldn't be there for no one, except for tonight)
You are telling me not to think too much
(你告訴我不要多想)
加主觀臆斷
(So we don't have to complicate things)

你披著星辰來世界頂端
(You came to the top of the world with
the sky full of stars on your shoulder)
陌生熟悉的信任給我心安
(We don't know each other that well but you got my trust already)
You are too different from them baby
(你和他們太不一樣了)
I hope you know it know it know it
(你知道的)
你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
(The ocean blue flowing in your eyes)
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
(Like how people come and go in our lives)
I've been thinking about u lately
(我最近常常想起你)
I hope you know it know it know it
(你知道的)

你到底是否 在我身邊
(I'm not sure if you are really with me)
像是鯨魚潮汐擱淺 陽光下低沈嗚咽
(Feeling like a whale stranded on the beach
crying under the sun because of insecurity)
我渴望擁有微風看到的視野
(I wish I have the eyes of the softly blowing wind)
漂浮上升空中 尋著你的行蹤
(Elevating and hoping I could look for you from up in the air)
伴著你一路狂奔 卷起了漫天一路揚塵
(So I can follow you in eddy of dust)

你披著星辰來世界頂端
(You came to the top of the world with
the sky full of stars on your shoulder)
陌生熟悉的信任給我心安
(We don't know each other that well but you got my trust already)
You are too different from them baby
(你和他們太不一樣了)
I hope you know it know it know it

I hope you know it know it know it
(你知道的)

Red bottom Louboutin and Yves Saint Laurent
房間散落滿地的星光
(Starlight shed on the floor)
微妙顫動著的心臟
(My heart shivers)
You know that I ain't ready yet I know that you know where she at
(其實我並未為即將到來的一切做好準備，你最好還是回到她身邊)
Empty your glass and get outta my sight then tonight
you'll be gone but I know that we are better than that babe
(杯中的酒已幹涸請你就此離開吧, 雖然我的雙眼依然在渴求)

Why don't you stay with me
(你為什麽不能留下呢)
貪婪地深呼吸氧氣
(You are oxygen to me)
時而怯懦哽咽著我的勇氣
(Sometimes my fear chokes me from telling the truth)
難開口唯一唯一唯一
(that you are my only)

你披著星辰來世界頂端

(你知道的)

不能說與你與你無關
(When I think of you)
腦海裡候鳥飛過湖藍
(birds fly through a peaceful lake of blue)
請你傾聽我沈默呼喊
(Can you hear me in silence?)
I'm calling your name
(我在呼喚著你的名字)

你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
(The ocean blue flowing in your eyes)
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
