: Hey, I ain't never coming home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow
No say goodbye, don't follow
Misery so hollow

Hey you, you're livin' life full throttle
Hey you, pass me down that bottle
Hey hey you, you can't shake me round now
I get so lost and don't know how
And it hurts to care, at all now

Forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done, where I've been
Sleep in sweat the mirrors cold
See my face, it's growin' old

Scared to death no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page it's cold and dead

And take me home
Yeah and take me home, home
Take me home
Take me home
Yeah take me home, home
Say goodbye, don't follow
