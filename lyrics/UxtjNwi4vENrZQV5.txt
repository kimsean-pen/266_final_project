You know I was...
Broke down, I had hit the ground
I was crying out, couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting
You know I had...
Lost hope, I was all alone
Never been so low 'til you came along (came along)
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible, what was I runnin' for
I was hidin' from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

Now I am a warrior, a shootin' star
Know I got this far, had a broken heart
No one hears the silent tears collecting
'Cause it's being...
Weak that's strong, in the truth I've found
I have courage now, gonna shout it out

Teacher, I feel the dots connecting
Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall

'Cause baby, I am ready to be free
Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible, what was I runnin' for
I was hidin' from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible

And I'm a perfect storm
I was runnin' from an empty threat...
Of emptiness
I was runnin' from an empty threat...
That didn't exist
I was runnin' from an empty threat...
Of abandonment
I was runnin' from an empty threat...

That didn't exi-
But now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible, what was I running for
I was hidin' from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm
Now I am invincible
No I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah I am invincible
What was I runnin' for (What was I runnin' for)
I was hidin' from the world
I was so afraid, I was so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm
