Hear me now, it's my time to talk
I'm throwing out these 2 years of thoughts
Freeze and take a deep breath
I'll lay my heart out helpless on the floor

Tears crash down
Your face, not mine.
Screaming out how I changed through time
I know it's hard to leave it
To say we've been defeated

But everything around me has changed
My my
We had

Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
(No more)
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops

Memories, without fortune or fame
Endlessly, through the night and through the day
We make hard times seem easy
Dark days seem so pleasing

But everything around me has changed
My my
We had

Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
(No more)
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops

And I'm so sorry darling
When I wake you're just gonna leave me
I don't want you to be lonely
'Cause I know you'll find your love again
And I promise I'll stop calling
If it makes it easy for you
I hate to see you leaving
But it's for the best believe, my friend

Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
(No more)
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops
