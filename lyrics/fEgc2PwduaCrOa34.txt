Let's get used to this disorder
I cup my hands
I drink the water
The news was fake
The drugs were real
The dream was gone
Not it's appeal

The picture does appear
But something interferes
Couldn't come home with it
Supported it

And if there was a land there
Could give us a raw power
We rather and sit around without them
She did everything for you

And everyone I know
They have the means to destroy
Couldn't come home with it
This time so certain I do
