You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonite
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are
Ruling the earth
Will show little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
there goes your life
It's so underhanded
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll

Oh-no!

Some Heads are gonna roll

Oh-no! (Some heads are gonna roll)
