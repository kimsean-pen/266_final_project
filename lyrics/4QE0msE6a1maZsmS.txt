Don't know what it's all about
But every time I look around
All I see is how we're holding on
Don't ask me what's wrong or right
I don't even know the time
All I know is I'm holding on

I haven't figured anything out
I haven't figured anything, anything, anything out

City dove
Fly between the buildings and fences
Soft inside, but rough on the edges
Waiting here for something to come
Just holding on, oh
City dove
Fly between the stars and the headlights
Passing by the clouds and the street signs
Knowing that there's something to come
Just holding on, oh

I don't really know my fate
I just know I'm on my way
There will be mistakes, movin' on
I try to get to the heart of it
Fly low, but looking for heaven
I know, I know I'm holding on

I won't figure everything out
I'll never figure everything, everything, everything out

City dove
Fly between the buildings and fences
Soft inside, but rough on the edges
Waiting here for something to come
Just holding on, oh
City dove
Fly between the stars and the headlights
Passing by the clouds and the street signs
Knowing that there's something to come
Just holding on, oh

(City dove, you fly high)
(City dove, you fly high)
(City dove, the headlights)
(City dove, the headlights)
(City dove, the street signs)
Waiting here for something to come
Just holding on, oh
(City dove, you fly high) Fly between the stars and the headlights
(City dove, you fly high)
(City dove, the headlights) Passing by the clouds and the street signs
(City dove, the headlights)
(City dove, the street signs)
Knowing that there's something to come
Just holding on, oh, yeah
