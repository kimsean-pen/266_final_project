Have you ever been lost?
Floating on the ground
Like a fading frost
Falling asleep next to the bed
And you feel so low

Oh, they've stolen your pride
Stand up while your conscience
Sits inside
I've made up my mind
I feel the time
And I feel so low

Stay and highjack the hurt
I feel so low, I feel so high
Take a look inside my mind
Ooh

If the object is clear
There wouldn't be a point
Only God-less fear
By the end of July
I wonder will I,
Still feel so low?

Oh I'm close to the guide
Moving in time
Falling in line
I've made up my mind
Papers are signed
And I feel so low

Stay and highjack the hurt
I feel so low, I feel so high
Take a look inside my mind
Ooh

Once a lover
Now you suffer
So far away from here
You're feeling hollow
And you tell sorrow

Stay and highjack the hurt
I feel so low, I feel so high
Take a look inside my mind
Ooh
