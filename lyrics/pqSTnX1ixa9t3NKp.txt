Hey boy what's cooking in that lab you got
Since I've been looking show me what you got

Take it out on, me if you want
Blame it all on your god

Hey boy, time's ticking in this skin I wear
Don't need you sticking your advice in there

Take it out on, me if you want
Blame it all on your god

Take it out on, me if you want
Blame it all on your god

Take it out on, me if you want
Blame it all on your god
