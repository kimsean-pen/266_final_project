Face of our father in the abyss
Controlling our mind, churning the void
Subconscious torture to open the chasm
Our will is enslaved in these festering caverns of death

Drenched in the blood of a thousand lives
Witness the slaughter of humans as sheep
Memories fade as nightmares will rise
Building our church for the oldest one to see
His will be done
The righteous fall and tragedy will strike
Once more to crown
Our sovereign commander of emptiness

This poison will linger in the blood of fools
The void will expand and the cleansing is nigh
Government of death, the tyrant ascending
His chemical talons drill their way through your hearts
