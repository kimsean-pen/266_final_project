If I came to you empty handed
A barren ocean with nothing at all
And if I came to you empty hearted
Searching for pieces after the fall

All I've ever known is
How to hide a secret
But I'm tired of going
On without believing
That love is not illusion
Love illuminates the blind

If I fell into you
Would it be close enough?
If I finally let you in
Would you show me what love is?
If I had nothing to give

If you came to me
Empty handed
I'd brave the ocean to bring you home
And if you came to me

Empty hearted
I'd find the pieces to make you whole
If I fell into you
Would it be close enough?
If I finally let you in

Would you show me what love is?
If I had nothing to give
If I am a promise
Will you let me break again?

I will be your compass
I will only let you bend
All I've ever known is
How to hide a secret
But I'm tired of going
On without believing

That love is not illusion
Love illuminates the blind
If I fell into you
Would it be close enough?
If I finally let you in
Would you show me what love is?
If I had nothing to give, oh
Ooh, ooh, if I had nothing to give
