What do you feel when you look like that
Don't think too much – one day it's all over
You make me feel like a different man
Just stay in touch – and one day it's all over

Realise we belong together
You and I we're apart together
Close your eyes and we're all together now
Realise we belong together
You and I we're apart together
Close your eyes and we're all together now

You try to find what you leave behind
Hunt high and low and one day it's all over
You can't fight knowing what's wrong or right
When all we know is one day it's all over

Realise we belong together
You and I we're apart together
Close your eyes and we're all together now
Realise we belong together
You and I we're apart together
Close your eyes and we're all together now

How can the people sleep alone
