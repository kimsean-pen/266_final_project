I am the light upon your path when you have lost your way
I am the footprints in the sand the ocean's tide can't wash away
I am the shelter from the storm that rages on and on
The incorruptible foundation that the wise man builds upon
I am the bread that feeds a starving man upon the street
I am the bounty on the table in the palace at the feast
I am the rain upon the earth after a scorching drought
I am the quenching of the thirst you never thought you'd be without

I am the melody that weaves its way inside your soul
I am the symphony, the masterpiece, the actor's greatest role
I am the poetry that speaks to you with every rhyme
I am the songwriter who seems to write your life in every line
I am the simple truths that shaped your world from your birth
I am the vast volumes of knowledge spanning all across the earth
I am the whisper of the wind you feel but cannot see
I am the alpha and omega, first and last, eternally

(I am) You cannot see me
(I am) The resurrection and the life, the doorway and the vine, I am
(I am) You cannot touch me
(I am) The bread of life, light of the world, long before Abraham, I am

I am the trusting child whose simple faith is ever sure
I am the parent's love, unchanging, unconditional and pure
I am the loyal friend whose heart will never let you down
I am the hand that pulls you back into the boat before you drown
I am the thunder and the glory and the blinding light
I am the still small voice that tells you what is wrong and what is right
I am the sacrificial lamb a guilty world reviled
I am the Father ever waiting for his lost and wayward child

(I am) You cannot see me
(I am) The resurrection and the life, the doorway and the vine, I am
(I am) You cannot touch me
(I am) The bread of life, light of the world, long before Abraham, I am

I am the heart of the righteous desire and the fourth man you see in the midst of the fire
I am the giver of life and the promise of Israel
I am the hope of the lonely and lost in the blood running down to the foot of the cross
I am the breaking of chains and the tolling of freedom's bell

I am grace and mercy (I am the notes that eternally ring in the music too holy for angels to sing)
I am sacrifice (I am the fire on the altar consuming the sacrifice)
I am endless glory (I am the three and yet I am the one in the grace of the Father and death of the Son)
I am light and life (I am the one who redeemed you by paying the highest price)

I am from the beginning of time, and I am sustaining the system of life (I am the heart of the righteous desire and the fourth man you see in the midst of the fire
I am the giver of life and the promise of Israel) ((I am long-awaited hope of Israel))
I am symmetry, reason and rhyme, and I am conviction that cuts like a knife (I am the hope of the lonely and lost in the blood running down to the foot of the cross
I am the breaking of chains and the tolling of freedom's bell) ((I am longing sated, prophecy fulfilled))

I am the author of order and flow
I am the Father of Lights: watch me put on a show!
I am the seeker of all gone astray
I am the keeper of souls till the end of all days

I am power, I am glory, I am love's unending story
I am justice, I am honor, I am hope and living water
I am righteous, I am holy, I am three and one and only
I am sovereign, I am faithful, everlasting, I am that I am

I am humility, the one who laid it all aside
Traded a crown of kings for a crown of thorns, betrayed by human pride
I am humanity, took on your curse and all your pain
I am divinity, eternity, forever I remain

I am your guilty scars, as roman soldiers tear my back
I am the crimson stain that washes all the souls faded to black
I am the one who bled in silence and endured it all
I am the word who spoke no word, with a thousand angels waiting for my call

I am your covenant, your hero in these bloodstained pages
I am your guilt, your sin, your debt fulfilled for all the ages
I step into your shoes, your substitute
Your sacrifice
Your raison d'etre
Your second chance
Your breath of life
I am

I am the joy of angels dancing in the streets of heaven
I am the sinner's prayer for mercy and a past forgiven
I am the lamb upon the altar dying willingly
All hope that was
All hope that is
All hope to be
I am
