I can tell that you're a real bad girl
Underneath it all (eeeh)
You never want to let me see the wild side
Go on let it show (eeeh)

This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can

Let your naughty talk
And dirty thoughts for me
(Take over, take over, take over)
Let the crazy drug
That you call lovin' me
(Take over, take over, take over)
(Say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (let me hear you say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na
(Take over, take over, take over)

I wish that I could just read your mind
Tell me what I'll see? (eeh)
You're always try to wear your disguise
Take it off of me (eeh)

This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can (ooh)

Let your naughty talk
And dirty thoughts for me
(Take over, take over, take over)
Let the crazy drug
That you call lovin' me
(Take over, take over, take over)
(Say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (let me hear you say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na
(Take over, take over, take over)

I know you understand that I want you to stand
Right wherever I am
I know you understand that I want you to stand
Right wherever I am (eeh)

This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can (ooh)

Let your naughty talk
And dirty thoughts for me
(Take over, take over, take over)
Let the crazy drug
That you call lovin' me (call lovin' me)
(Take over, take over, take over)
(Say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (let me hear you say!)
Na na na na na na na na na na
(Take over, take over, take over)
