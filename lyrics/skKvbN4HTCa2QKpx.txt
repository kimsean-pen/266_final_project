Heartbreak can't change me
I am crazy for you
It's a sad world we were raised in
Let it fade into something new

If you try, I will try
If we fuck up, it's alright
There is so much more to life
Than all these wastes of time

Heartbreak can't faze me
I am crazy, but I'm true
It's a sad world we were raised in
You could hate it, but what's the use?

If you try, I will try
When we fuck up, it's alright
There is always more to life
Than all these wastes of time
