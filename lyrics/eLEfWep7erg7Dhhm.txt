I've been distracted and distant
And I'm all out of ideas
The bees keep swarming around me
The sun starts running on empty

Grace once watched over me as well
But not anymore
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go

I couldn't just leave it all
I couldn't stop craving the tension
But we keep winning the races
(We're framed, we're fine, we're good enough)
But we keep winning the races
(We're framed, we're fine, we're good enough)

We set our sails with the north wind
In love or vein it'll need a winch
To carry us above 'cause you need to know
You need to know
You need to know the winds
You need to know
You need to know the winds

I'm all out of everything
Lacking in oxygen
I'm all out of everything
Lacking in oxygen it seems
So you came to me in cloak
And you spoke to me in slang

You sing as loud as the sirens
You sing as loud as the sirens
