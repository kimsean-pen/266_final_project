I'm the kind of brother
Who been doin' it my way, gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me

Let me go, baby
Now listen

My momma told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same ol' song
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight,
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style
And I can't figure it out, but

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feelin' it (caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold

I'm so (Caught up)
Really feelin' it (Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (Caught up)
Really feelin' it (Caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me

And I think I like it baby
Oh no, oh no, oh, yeaah, oh my

This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, suga
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style

I'm so (Caught up)
(Caught up)
Don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (Caught up)
Really feelin' it (Caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girls got a hold

I'm so (Caught up)
I'm so (Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm (Caught up)
Really feelin' it (Caught up)
I'm losin' control
This girl's got a hold on me
