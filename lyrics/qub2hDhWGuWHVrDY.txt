Ah, there should be a price on your head, yeah
'Cause you're ahead of the game
A bullet graved outta lead yeah
Headed straight to my brain

But my heart won't stop it now
'Cause your eyes, they feel like profit
But did you know you can't top it, no
End of me, let this be the end of me, now

One floor down
We didn't even sleep that night
Don't ever wanna lose that sound
Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now
One floor down
We didn't even dim the lights
Don't ever wanna lose that sound, now
Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now
(Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now)

Are we more than just friends now
Or is there a hidden agenda, yeah
You might have some backup, but do not forget
I might be a contender

My heart won't stop it now
'Cause your eyes, they feel like profit
But did you know you can't top it, now
End of me, this is the end of me, now

One floor down
We didn't even sleep that night
Don't ever wanna lose that sound
Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now
One floor down
We didn't even dim the lights
Don't ever wanna lose that sound, now
Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now
(Bring the heat now
(Bring the heat now)

Ah, there should be a price on your head, yeah
'Cause you're ahead of the game
A bullet graved outta lead yeah
Headed straight to my brain

But my heart won't stop it now
'Cause your eyes, they feel like profit
But did you know you can't top it, no
End of me, let this be the end of me, now

Don't ever wanna lose that sound
Bring the heat now

Don't ever wanna lose that sound, now
Bring the heat now

Bring the heat now
Bring the heat now
Didn't even dim the lights, no
Bring the heat now
