Do you feel it?
Do you feel it all come through?
Like I do
Could you still hear it?
Would you stay? It's been too long
And I'm not done

I never fell asleep, I will go on
And then I will be waiting for the sun
And in your eyes I see all the flowers in bloom
Will you take a look?
Feel my hands now
We can watch the days go by
Just you and I

I never fell asleep, I will go on
And then I will be waiting for the sun
And then I will be waiting for the sun
I never fell asleep, I will go on
