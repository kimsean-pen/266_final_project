Always when we fight
I try to make you laugh
Til everything's forgotten
I know you hate that

Ba ba da da ba ba ba ba
Ba ba da da ba ba ba ba

Always when we fight
I kiss you once or twice
And everything's forgotten
I know you hate that

I love you Sunday sun
The week's not yet begun
And everything is quiet
And it's always

You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always

You tell me I'm a real man
And try to look impressed
Not very convincing
But you know I love it

Now we watch TV
Til we fall asleep
Not very exciting
But it's you and

Me and we'll always be together
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba ba
