i need my conscience to keep watch over me
to protect me from myself
so i can wear honesty like a crown on my head
when i walk into the promised land
we've been too long american dreaming i think we've all lost the way
forlorn somnambulistic maniacal in the dark

i'm in love with an american girl
well she's my best friend
i love her surreptitious smile
that hides the pain within her
and we'll go dancing in the rings of laughter
and leave alone by the shores
feel alone in the brands of rapture
and leave alone for the loss

faith on the lea the rising wind blows
faith on the lea the rising wind blows
how long? how long?

here alone on the grounds of allegiances
we've left behind
turned back by the foot of the doorway
never lost and found
we've been too long american dreaming
i think we've all lost the heart
forlorn somnambulistic maniacal in the dark
