It's the kind of night that's so cold, when you spit
It freezes before it hits the ground
And when a bum asks you for a quarter, you give a dollar
If he's out tonight he must be truly down

And I'm searching all the windows for a last minute present
To prove to you that what I said was real
For something small and frail and plastic, baby
'Cause cheap is how I feel

Half moon in the sky tonight, bright enough
To come up with an answer
To the question why is it that every time I see you
My love grows a little stronger

But your memory leaves my stomach churning
Feeling like a lie about to be revealed
But I'll horde all this to myself
'Cause cheap is how I feel

It's not the smell in here that gets to me it's the lights
I hate the shadows that they cast
And the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing
I'll always drag with me from my past

I think I'll find a pair of eyes tonight, to fall into
And maybe strike a deal
Your body for my soul, fair swap
'Cause cheap is how I feel
