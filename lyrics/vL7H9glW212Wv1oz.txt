Wait
I watched you throw out your bouquet
Now I think about you every day
And I'm alone now in my bed

And there's a lake
And at the bottom you'll find all our friends
They don't swim cause they're all dead
They never are what we intend
Or invent

'Cause I made little lives, and then I pulled them apart
Think something dark's living down in my heart
And if I wanted to die before I got old
I should've started some years ago digging that hole

Well I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down and let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
Well I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)

A deer that a hunter shot in the heart
Some dogs that got hit by cars
All came to spill their guts

And we spoke
'Bout the Father, Son and Holy Ghost
And which songs we done' loved the most
And then we all turned to dirt
And dust

Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold
Some die looking for a hand to hold

Well I'll carry this box to its proper place
And when I lower it down I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
Well I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)

Well I stole bricks from the dam almost every day
Now I'm drowning in the flood I made
Explain myself to me on the other side
I'm gonna want some answers when I die

Well I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
