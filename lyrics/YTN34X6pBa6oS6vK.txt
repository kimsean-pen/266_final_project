The shape of your hand is just like mine
A whole different skin but I don't mind
Why should I mind?
The body you're in is undefined

Bones like a cage trapped inside
The need in your veins it's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
The body you're in, the body you're in is undefined

In the light we are the same
In the light we all are sane
Our eyes are all to blame
In the light, in the light, in the light, in the light

In the light we are the same
When we cry we are the same
Our eyes are all to blame
(In the light)
Our eyes are all to blame
In the light

Raise up your voice, collide with mine
Your blood is like tears, running wild
Running wild
A body of sin, a body of sin is under mine

In the light we are the same
In the light we all are sane
Our eyes are all to blame
In the light, in the light, in the light, in the light

In the light we are the same
When we cry we are the same
Our eyes are all to blame
(In the light)
Our eyes are all to blame

In the light, ooh
In the light, ooh
In the light, ooh

In the light we are the same
In the light we all are sane
Our eyes are all to blame

In the light we are the same
In the light we all are sane
Our eyes are all to blame
In the light, in the light, in the light, in the light

In the light we are the same
When we cry we are the same
Our eyes are all to blame
(In the light)
Our eyes are all to blame
