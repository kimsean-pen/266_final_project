And I was in the shadows when you met me
I was broken, I was barely alive
Ah, alive
My heart was like a ghost town at sundown
It was a beautiful disguise
A beautiful lie

I'll hit you when you're down on one knee
I'll give you my heart when I'm six foot deep
It's beautiful
Baby, my love's like a funeral
You came in like a God from above
And give me your soul, I wanna soak it up
If you only knew
Baby, my love's like a funeral

Looking down the barrel of a warm gun
Throw me, I end up higher
I wanna feel my higher power
Let me wear your halo on a Sunday
I'll be on my best behaviour
I'll be a good, good girl

I'll hit you when you're down on one knee
I'll give you my heart when I'm six foot deep
It's beautiful
Baby, my love's like a funeral
You came in like a God from above
And give me your soul, I wanna soak it up
If you only knew
Baby, my love's like a funeral
Baby, my love's like a funeral

And if I give you up, would it bring me down?
Into the blue where no light is found
I can see you in the distance but you're fading away
Wait a minute, wait a minute, start it over again

I'll hit you when you're down on one knee
I'll give you my heart when I'm six foot deep
It's beautiful
Baby, my love's like a funeral
You came in like a God from above
And give me your soul, I wanna soak it up
If you only knew
Baby, my love's like a funeral

I'll be a good, good girl
I'll be a good, good girl
(Baby, my love's like a funeral)
I'll be a good, good girl
I'll be a good, good girl
(Baby, my love's like a funeral)
