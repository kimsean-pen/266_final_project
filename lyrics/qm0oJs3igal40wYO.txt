Await the coming storm, behold the sign in the sun
Chaos upon us spawn! The arrows of time pinpoints us all
Oh, well the maddening laughter growing louder with the memories
Atoms like incense rising, like a thousand candles all blown out at once
Fear tangled with despair, this ghastly symphony of malice breaks it
The spirit sails out on waters, an intergalactic sea of sorrow
Solemn oblivion with thee

Ways of darkness
The third eye reflects the images of vast reluctant pasts
Ethereal eternity awaits the final act
It crawls toward the altar, destined to collapse
Tragic legend, eerie stratum

Twisted, this mortal flesh evoked again, with echoes still haunting
The curses chanting
Embrace the outcast state of chaos - after all, it's unalterable
Beweep this thought, then arise with wisdom
Now when I hallow in the gateway of different plains
Open your heart and let go, oh vanish, divine infinity

Ah, this wraith I am, so many aeons ago since
Ah, I suffer eternally, the inevitable did unfold
Oh well, a collection of particles held together
By the force of a soul and its memory
Be warned (you stand) on the edge of infinity
Where coloured waves will lead the way into the void
Fear tangled with despair, this ghastly symphony of malice
Oh well, the maddening laughter growing louder with memories now
Atoms like incense rising

Ways of darkness
The third eye reflects the images of vast reluctant pasts
Ethereal eternity awaits the final act
You are drawn towards the altar destined to collapse
Tragic legend, eerie stratum

In between the arrows of time I suffer eternally
