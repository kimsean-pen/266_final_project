Standing on the platform
Waiting for the train
Watching the weather change
I'm seeing shades of gray

They say love's a many splendid thing
We've made a mess of everything
It's left me wondering...

If it's just a picture, postcard
Made to teach ya
Some place that you're never gonna go
Never gonna know
You give all your heart and got nothing to show

Days turn to nights
And the nights never end
You break my heart
And I'll break yours
That's how it goes
It goes over and over and...
And all that we are
Is just playing a part
In the game
You know what they say...
With Saturday sun.
Always comes Sunday Rain

Another tear drop falling down my face
You stand there at the gate
But i know i can not stay
The part I hate
Is standing here in the ashes of the fire
Watching me pay the price of my desire
You know I'm gonna go
You're never gonna know
I've givin' all
And got nothing to show

Days turn to nights (turn to nights)
And the nights never end (never end)
You break my heart (break my heart)
And I'll break yours (I'll break your yours)
That's how it goes
It goes over and over and...
And all that we are (all, that we are)
Is just playing a part (a part)
In the game
You know what they say... (ohh)
With Saturday sun. (day sun)
Always comes Sunday Rain (Sunday rain)

Ohh... Ohh... (Ohh.)

days turn to nights (turn to nights)
and the nights never end (no)
you break my heart (break my heart)
and i'll break yours (i'll break your yours)
that's how it goes
it goes over and over and...
And all that we are (all, that we are)
Is just playing a part (a part) (ohh.)
In the game
You know what they say...
This ain't a day sun. (day sun)
Oh it's called Sunday Rain (sunday rain)
Ohh.
