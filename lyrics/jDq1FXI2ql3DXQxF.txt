Never slept so little
Never smoked so much
Lost my concentration, I could
Even lose my touch

Talking to myself
Crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm
Stuck inside a cloud

I played some exhibition
I lost my will to eat
The only thing that matters to me is
To touch your lotus feet

Talking to myself
Crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm
Stuck inside a cloud
Talking to myself
Crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm
Stuck inside a cloud

Talking to myself
Crying out loud
Only I can hear me, I'm
Stuck inside a cloud

Never been so crazy
But I've never felt so sure
I wish I had the answer to give
Don't even have the cure

Just, talking to myself
Crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I
Also lose my heart
Talking to myself
I'm crying as we part
Knowing as you leave me, I
Also lose my heart
