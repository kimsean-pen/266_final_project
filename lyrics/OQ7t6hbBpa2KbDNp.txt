So bold and fine, I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine, do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, I'm hollow without you
In a world, with everything, but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow in the blue
It's the time for everything I have for you

Sweet love of mine, distraction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we cry
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world, with everything, but it won't do
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so much shallow in the blue
If you down, boy, everything I have for you
