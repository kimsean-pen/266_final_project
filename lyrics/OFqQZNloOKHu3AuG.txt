You never seen a man so calm in your life
They afraid of this might
And I got the type of mind to grind into that white light
I rock the mic inside the china shop and spit that bull shit, this ain't no bullshit
It's eating past after the stomach full shit
No eating ass, no groceries, I ate at restaurants
They serve me well since I'm a baby of the Kant renaissance
You may recall my marvelous reconnaissance
I never forget, like elephants on 4chan
Remember I'm a poor man, but got a fucking kingdom up in here
Where the beer flows like memes, seeded without a peer
See I had it up to here, all these doubters in my ear
Tryna tell me I don't have the whole world up on my spear (what you do?)
I Van Gogh 'em, pretend I don't know 'em
Too busy showboatin' to roast 'em, the flames floatin'
No jokes, see my quotes remain potent
Even in the casket, I'll be one to close it
I'm a poet and I know it, see I could do some good
But these demons in my ear make me feel misunderstood
Lord knows, my intentions are hood
And I rub it in a little bit more than I should
But what would you do if you were great and you knew it?
I put up a page, I get in my range
I open up a vein and let a river run through it
You call it music
(that's close enough)
