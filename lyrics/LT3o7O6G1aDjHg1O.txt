In the beginning, it was worth this
Do the worst, feel complete
Passing standards others meet
Now perfect endings make you anxious
A heavy head, a colder sweat
Leaving nothing here, nothing to regret (regret)
Why am I still suffocated?

I'm constantly devastated
Just to stay alive
Why am I still suffocated?
I'm constantly devastated

Just to stay alive, oh
I miss the old days that we murdered
They're so far gone, we're out of reach
Watch 'em fade with summer's heat
Without a break from this distraction
I need a change
A different scene

A new approach to coming clean
Why am I still suffocated?
I'm constantly devastated
Just to stay alive

Why am I still suffocated?
I'm constantly devastated
Just to stay alive
Still searching for a back door out of here
Reassured that my friends will reappear

Why am I still suffocated?
Hold your breath deep and I'll keep waiting
Still searching for a back door out of here
Reassured that my friends will reappear
Why am I still suffocated?
Hold your breath deep and I'll keep waiting, waiting
Why am I still suffocated?
I'm constantly devastated
Just to stay alive
Why am I still suffocated?
I'm constantly devastated
Just to stay alive
Woah oh oh
