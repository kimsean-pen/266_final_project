If I could take what I so believe in
Draping its hand in front of me with it all
And I'm ever reaching
Straight from this heart in me

It's the tallest I've ever seen it
Strange in this place of little dreams
Like a wall in my sure to be things
Standing in spite of me
It's all I ever wanted

And I won't give up on a dream
It's all or nothing
The sound of doubt I'll never need
It's all or nothing

If I could blame the right kind of evil
Then maybe my fall would be undone
But then why would I build a fable
To carry this burden on?

So it's on to write down the sequel
As real as it gets with brick and stone
And the heart is not weak, but able
And strong cause I'm holding on
To all I ever wanted

And I won't give up on a dream
It's all or nothing
The sound of doubt I'll never need
It's all or nothing

And I won't give up on a dream
It's all or nothing
The sound of doubt I'll never need
It's all or nothing

And I want it
I breathe it out
Never needed
I want it out
Though I want it
I breathe it out
Never needed
I want it out
Though I want it
I breathe it out

And I won't give up on a dream
It's all or nothing
The sound of doubt I'll never need
It's all or nothing

And I won't give up on a dream
It's all or nothing
The sound of doubt I'll never need
It's all or nothing
