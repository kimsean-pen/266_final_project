It's like that feeling of the first snow
Your last smoke
Sink softly through your bones
It's tugging on your insides
Your small frame
Let's shift our stare from the sea
Sink the beam out to reach
It's cold company
It's cold company

I need you here with me
I'm finding you in further in our freights
I need you here
Come on stay long x 4

We're diving like ducks in the sand
Finding old flames to fan
It's always right brain first left
It's always right brain first left
And there you stand setting fire to sea
Setting fire to me
And there you stand setting fire to sea
Take it out on me

That's when I heard your voice in the depth x 2
