You're not telling me nothing
That I haven't heard before
You'll have to try harder than that
You'll have to dig deeper than that
Reminds me of myself
You'll have to try harder than that
You'll have to dig deeper than that
Reminds me of yourself

You can't hold your breath when
You talk try not to let sound slip by
I come from inside
Raise it up so I can see just
What you're doing to me
Do you even know why?
Your place is still at
The heart of my everything
(And I gotta let you know,(?))
