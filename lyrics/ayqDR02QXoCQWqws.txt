Twice I turn my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose
So tell me where would I go
Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now
Thought I had an answer once
But your random way swept me along
Colossal signs so I got lost
With so many lovers singing songs
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now
