From birth to death, just a slave,
From birth to death, what am I,

I can't believe in myself,
I can't see past myself,

Why should I fight [?],
Why should I fight, turn my back,
Nothing can hurt me if it's not real,

From birth to death, it's all the same

From birth to death, just a slave,

Nothing can hurt me if it's not real,
From birth to death, what am I,

From birth to death, I'm just the same
