In her mourning
In her grave
Don't you miss the way
That she brushed her heavy hair
Oh la la la la la

Acid burned face clowny tear smile
She's the one who made you wild
She made you question all your answers
Made you beg for her forgiveness

Baby girl don't cry
Momma's gonna buy you a glass eye
And it will glimmer like starlight

She's got no reservations
Ain't got no place to be
He graveyard's in the backyard
Where the meadows used to be

Lord knows my destination
Lord heards my inner prayer
Mom'll find me by the river
Sunken with her party balloons

Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
