Hey brother, happy returns
It's been a while now
I bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm still here, nothing's changed

Hey brother, I'd love to tell you
I've been busy
But that would be a lie
'Cause the truth is
The years just pass like trains
I wave but they don't slow down

Hey brother, I see the freaks
Dispossessed on day release
Avoiding the police
I feel I'm falling once again
But now there's no one left to catch me

Hey brother, I feel I'm living in parentheses
And I've got trouble with the bills
Do the kids remember me?
Well I got gifts for them
And for you more sorrow
But I'm feeling kind of drowsy now
So I'll finish this tomorrow
