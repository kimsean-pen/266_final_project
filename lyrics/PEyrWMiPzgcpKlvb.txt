Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me?
I tell you man, it's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery, we won the lottery
I tell you man, it's all right here

And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being anyplace, anyplace but right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there

So wherever we go
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(It's all right here)
Excuse me officer

If you're smart you'll know you want to be
In the mix of white hot energies
It's all to welcome you

Talk so good it's moving way too fast
If we could I know we'd make it last
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
It's all here for you

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
It's all right here
(It's all right here)

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Come on
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Come on let's go
It's all right here

In the open road
Will take us anywhere
And as long as I'm with you I won't care where
And we can choose the desert or the sea
Cause the good times are in front of you and me

Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me?
I'll tell you man it's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I'll tell you man it's all right here

I can't believe you'd even think
Of being anyplace anyplace but right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
You wish you were here
You wish you were here

And if I could make you want to stay
Just one more day
Maybe everything would be okay
Come on, come on, come on

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(It's all right here)

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(It's all right here)
