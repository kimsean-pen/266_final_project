It's gone away, it's gone away, it's gone for good
Animal spirits come calling me home
Through the tunnels of brilliant light the magnet of wisdom is pulling
Burrowing faster the fabric of time

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Rapid descendants, the wormhole is empty
The center of Khlysty surrounds me
The fire is dancing in a silvery sheet of breath
Black robe necromancing, summon the soul of the spectre

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty

No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space

Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty
