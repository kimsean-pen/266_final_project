I keep on searching for some way around
All that I've been given
And all that I have found
Coming down from the ceiling
Scratching wall just like dreaming
My impulse, my reflection
Eyes are wide and stinging

When I look up to you
I know that I'm not alone
When I look up to you
I know we can go higher
I know we can go higher

Inherit
Whatever you want
Inherit
It's all in the way that you feel it
All that you are
Inherit, yeah, yeah
Inherit

I know that we can go
I know that we can go
I know that we can go higher

I get so lifted
Gnawing on a dream
Started from I can't remember
Now the riot time is on

Inherit
Whatever you want
Inherit
It's all in the way that you feel it
All that you are
Inherit, yeah, yeah
Inherit

Kiss me, do it
Be my wife, speed of life
Kiss me, do it
Be my wife, speed of life
Kiss me, do it
Be my wife, speed of life

Inherit
Whatever you want
Inherit
It's all in the way that you feel it
All that you are
Inherit, yeah, yeah
Inherit
Whatever you want
Inherit
It's all in the way that you feel it
All that you are
Inherit, yeah, yeah
