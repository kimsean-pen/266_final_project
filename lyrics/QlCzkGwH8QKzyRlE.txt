I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I've been losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I ever had

Back in the days there was ways
I was moving on guns all ablaze
Dwelling on the past like I do
Still can't forgive all the abuse
That ain't the way to rise from the crib
Still running hard from this shit
Why you want to push my buttons
Making sure that I feel nothing
Do you really think you need to remind me
Every time every single second that I'm alive
Just to make yourself feel better I don't think so
I just want to do it all right
Find me a better place in this life
We bring out the worst in each other
That ain't a way to love one another

I just want to be okay
There ain't nothing wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losing myself and I want it back

I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I've been losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I ever had

Do you remember when we both used to be so in love for eternity
All the promises that we made
All our friends said we had it made
Yeah there were times we were up times we were down
Our world spinning around
Everyone goes through a brawl
But me and you crash through it all
We were both lions in a cage
We would both live through the rage
We were still afraid
And both had everything but didn't have it made
We're feeling bad that we both gonna have to say goodbye now
What it is is what it is baby and I'm going to have to take a time out

I just want to be okay
There ain't nothing wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losing myself and I want it back

I just want to be okay
There ain't nothing wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losing myself and I want it back

I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I've been losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I ever had

I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I've been losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I ever had

I just want to be okay
There ain't nothing wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losing myself and I want it back
I just want to be okay
There ain't nothing wrong with that
I'm losing my life away
Losing myself and I want it back
I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I've been losing since I met you
