It must have been him
Just a glimpse of a face in the crowd
That's all it takes
My heart is racing

I stand in a trance
As I stare at the back of a bus
Knowing there's no use denying
I can't stop thinking about us

The story of a heart
The story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story

Story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
All emotions pent up inside, my story

I try to resist
But the images keep coming through
So many years
Still I'm defenceless

The house by the lake
His hands resting a while on the oars
Speaking with quiet conviction
Carefully unlocking doors

The story of a heart
The story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story

Story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
All emotions pent up inside, my story

Did he see me
Or did I just imagine it all
Putting a face on a stranger
A face I find more and more hard to recall

Never given up
I look for you everywhere
Time went by and sadness took the place of despair
In a way you'll stay with me 'til death do us part
Like a shadow deep in my heart forever

Story of a heart
A story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story

Story of a heart
I laid myself open wide
Yet to read the pages
Where the ink hadn't dried
Swept away and lost in love what was I to do
I just had to read it to you, my story

Story of a heart
A story all of it mine
Then you took it from me
Every glorious line
I was safe and warm
And now I'm out in the cold
And I know I shouldn't have told my story
