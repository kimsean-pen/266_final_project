On a race to the top
You know where you're going
You got a spot, you got a spot
On the hood of your car
Engine's keeping us warm
You wanna take this far, this far
She's fallen out of love, she's tellin' me
You never did enough, I know it's true
Up in the clouds above I see your face
And it's telling me to let it go

But when I'm around you
I can't relax
I really do try to keep my mind on track
But when I'm near you
I just want to run my fingers up your legs
When I see you, all I can think about is sex

Oh baby, please give me a sweet goodbye
I wanna hit it for the very last time
I know it's over between us two
My baby don't love me like she used to
My baby don't love me like she used to

She doesn't want to do this anymore
She's sick of the bullshit and I, I get it, get it
She says: You just can't put me through this anymore
I, I, I got to get away, I got to get away
Baby, I know I've got a problem
Baby, I don't mean to bring you down
All these girls I just can't live without 'em
I gotta get away

But when I'm around you
I can't relax
I really do try to keep my mind on track
But when I'm near you
I just want to run my fingers up your legs
When I see you, all I can think about is sex

Oh baby, please give me a sweet goodbye
I wanna hit it for the very last time
I know it's over between us two
My baby don't love me like she used to
My baby don't love me like she used to
