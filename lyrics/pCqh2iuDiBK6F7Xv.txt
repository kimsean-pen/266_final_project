For your future's sake
I've got advice I'd advise you to take

Don't keep betting, well,
It's gotta light me up sometime
But you lost your turn
(But you lost your turn)
But you lost your turn
(But you lost your turn)

All I wanted to be was one of your children
All I wanted to be was one of yours

See how clean the water is where you are
Wash off your handcuffs
Know the hidden messages you hear
They aren't real, you tricked your mind to feel
(You tricked your mind to feel)
You tricked your mind to feel
(You tricked your mind to feel)
You tricked your mind

All I wanted to be was one of your children
And all I wanted to be was one of yours

Are we even now?
Are we even now?
We are unrelated
We are unrelated
Are we even now?
Are we even now?
We are unrelated
We are unrelated

If blood is thicker than water then
You'll drown quicker than we intended
If blood is thicker than water then
You'll know where you can find us in the end

So we can begin again
So we can begin
So we can begin again
So we can begin

All I wanted to be was one of your children
All I wanted to be was one of yours
