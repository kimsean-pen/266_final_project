Come smell the fruit for a while
And the time, lost despair, burns to smile.

And then, tonight's the night you live your life
Tonight's the night you broke the line
Tonight's the night you live your life
I'm not surprised you broke the line.

Fear, fall inside, over style
And if life, time exist, for a while.

And then, tonight's the night you live your life
Tonight's the night you broke the line
Tonight's the night you live your life
I'm not surprised you broke the line

Everybody wants to know you quick
Nobody wants to let you die
Everybody wants to keep you nights
Nobody wants to know your mind

Everybody wants to know you quick
Nobody wants to let you die
Everybody wants to keep you nights
Nobody wants to know your mind

And then, tonight's the night you live your life
Tonight's the night you broke the line
Tonight's the night you live your life
I'm not surprised you broke the line.

Tonight's the night you live your life
Tonight's the night you broke the line
Tonight's the night you live your life
I'm not surprised you broke the line.
