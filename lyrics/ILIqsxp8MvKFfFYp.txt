I need your energy, I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

Hot life, hot life, hot tie, don't drown
Big breath, taste stale, stay cool
When I'm down, dead vibe
That's right, on top
That height, I fly, skydive
High-five, we won't die
See hoe, seat drive, see why
In my eyes, windy, wind life
Take-off, bye bye
No slip, black eyes
Big shooter, lit fly
Don't stop, must try
Energy, that's why
I'm doing the most
In the middle of the road or runnin' the globe
I'm fightin' for doors to give everything back what they owe
So close, don't fold, live bright, live bold
Kick back, get clothes, light it up, light it up for yours

I need your energy, I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

This what they want, this what they need, this what we on (on)
Took it worldwide and brung it back home, turn it on (energy)
Never been scared (scared)
Always would pay, taking you there (there)
You need to be here, hands in the air, yeah, yeah (energy)
Bossed up, flossed up, fly like a saucer, live in the moment (moment)
Get it, get it, own it (own it)
Live it, breathe it, zone it (zone it)
No time to waste (waste)
No time to slow down when we out on the chase (chase)
Don't be pumping your brakes (brake)
When you come over, nothing, I'm doing what it takes (takes)
Dodging these gunshots man, still gotta stay focused
Ain't no sleep, stay woken, gotta keep your eyes open
When all of my energy gone (gone)
Don't leave me out on my own (own)
Don't leave me all on my own
Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up

I need your energy, I need your energy
This world is killing me
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
Light it up (light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up)
If you feelin' me, I feel
I need your energy

Different every time, you keep me on my feet, I feel
Heavenly excited bout
