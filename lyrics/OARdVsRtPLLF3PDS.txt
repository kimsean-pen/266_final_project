I'm having so little impact
I'm having so little impact
So I change the position of my bed
And try to teach myself the cryptic

I'm having so little impact
Yeah, I don't even make a dent
I'm just a face on the tram
I'm just a face on the tram

And I go up in the lift
And I go down in the lift
And I go up, in the very same lift
And I get out at the seventeenth floor

I sit down at my desk
And I take in the view
And girl that's when I think of you
That's when I think of you

And babe, I only wanted to be by your side
Yeah babe, I only wanted to be by your side
Yeah babe, I only wanted to be by your side
And babe, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I'm thinking of you

Now I sit in the park
And I watch people walking their dogs
Look at all that just add water unconditional love
I knew love
Yeah, I knew love
I knew love And I threw it away

So I get up in the morning
And I go to sleep at night
And in between I am numb, in between I am numb

But I'm a human animal
Yeah, I'm a human animal
I'm a human animal
And I'm leaving it all behind

Jingles!

And it's better the devil that you know
Yeah it's better the devil that you know
And it's better the devil that you know
But he sure is a beast

And babe, I only wanted to be by your side
Yeah babe, I only wanted to be by your side
Yeah babe, I only wanted to be by your side
And babe, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I'm thinking of you

Ohhhh
Ohhhh yeah
Baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I'm thinking of you!
