Heaven, a gateway, I hope
Just like the feeling inside, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Each way I turn I know I'll always try
To break this circle that's been placed around me
From time to time I find I've lost some need
That was urgent to myself, I do believe

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes, oh, you've got grey eyes
Oo, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes, you've got red eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Thoughts from above hit the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Thoughts from above hit the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Thoughts from above hit the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Thoughts from above hit the people down below
People in this world, we have no place to go
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before
Oh, no, I've never met anyone quite like you before
