To see what lies beyond our sight...
The secrets robed in blackest night...
The things we dream but never see...
Caged and blinded by the Beast...

From age to age it stalked the earth
The apish scum of evil birth
Up from slime it has seen man crawl
It waits to see our final fall

The Finger of Scorn, it points to us all
The Finger of Scorn, it points to our fall

Black idols lie beneath the sea
They hold the secret to our destiny
The ancient tales are left to die
And leave mankind to wonder why

The Beast will rule the hearts of men
'Till mankind falls to ape again
And when our souls are stripped and torn
Still we face the Finger of Scorn
