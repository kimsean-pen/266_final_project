Too dumb, too small to feel the fall
Do you recall when she was something beautiful?
I don't, not at all, giving up for you

I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do

Too fair inside to see the signs
Do you recall the rush you once saw in his eyes?
I don't, another life
A trade for daydreams sold to have and never hold

I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do
I'm giving up for you
I do, I do, I do, I do, yeah

Giving up for you
I do, I do, I, do
I'm giving up for you
I do, I do, I, do
I'm giving up for you
I'm giving up for you
I do, I do, I do
