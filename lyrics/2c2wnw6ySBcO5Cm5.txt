i don't want to hurt no one
but i will
i only understand this body for it's needs
turning myself out to pay my secrets

my cage is beautiful, but insincere
new heaven, new earth

my prayers are eternal
but feeding no one
peroxide loves me like no one ever has
wound up with passion for nothing exactly

you will remember me for who you think i am
new heaven, new earth

violate my world
i'm not a person
i know the one true love is settling a score
peeling back the skin reveals no meaning

my cage is beautiful, but insincere
new heaven, new earth
