I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied

If the sun came up tomorrow
And you lived in the perfect place
That just wouldn't be good enough for you
You could have a happy family, money
And the perfect face
But that wouldn't be good enough for you
Enough for you

And I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
On a Sunday morning, now I'm moving on

I, no I never wanna see you die
But I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you said
Satisfied, oh

I crashed and burned a thousand times
Just to be your friend
But you gave me nothing in return
You played on my obsession for you
Until the bitter end
I can't believe I got what you deserved
What you deserved

I, no I never wanna see you smile
And I never wanna see you satisfied
Are you satisfied

Are you satisfied how it came and went
Satisfied when I pay your rent
Will you ever regret all the things you said
Are you satisfied
Are you satisfied in another man's bed
Satisfied you left me all but dead
How dare you ever deny all the things I did
Satisfied ahh
Ohh
I, no I never wanna see you die
But I never wanna see you satisfied...
