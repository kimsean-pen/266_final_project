Over through a dark and gentle sea
Open into portal seventeen
I wanna laugh and tape it down
I wanna know you mean to stay

Oh and on and on down
Time, these two things
I don't want to leave

And I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming

Running through a coral castle wall
Neon wrapped around your china horns
I wanna see the Tracy Falls
I wanna know you mean to stay

Oh and on and on
Time, these two things
I don't want to leave

And I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming

I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming

I'm only dreaming
Oh oh oh
I'm only dreaming
Oh oh oh
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
Oh oh oh
I'm only dreaming
Oh oh oh
I'm only dreaming
Oh oh oh
I'm only dreaming
