All our wants are seething like comets
Our siren call silences the morning

In the, the higher nodes,
We reach a kindness calming
Fall when it leaves us in wild love
Come climb up, feels light

Hiding in our lies
I was waiting to find all this
You can't keep
Away your wildness
I'll find other violence here
I was stupid in the skies
Making water from wine, no less
Found out those heavy warnings
Left carvings in this

All we want is wasted
By our stalling
The nights we owned are
Broken by the morning

In the, the higher nodes,
We reach a kindness calming
Fall when it leaves us in wild love
Come climb up, feels light

Hiding in our lies
I was waiting to find all this
You can't keep away your wildness
I'll find other violence here
I was stupid in the skies
Making water from wine, no less
Found out those heavy warnings
Left carvings in this

These are the moments
That lie ahead of us
I was at waste in the
Wild with cannibals
I wasn't leaving the light
It all wasn't right
We'll see in the morning
What's all the waiting up for
If you and I can't
Heed a warning?
So we want to hear it all
And leave at
Two in the morning
