The feeling starts to sink in
But it's beginning to rust
Still hanging onto the things that we discussed
But the point that was made isn't said and done
Now the sun shines so bright, but it won't shine for you
You remind me of rain in July
And the gloom that I felt for a year
And the clouds are always shaped just like you
But there's a parting light
I always told you that someday
I would be packing my bags and I would be on my way
You always laughed in my face
And made the world seem so grey
Lay in the bed that you made
So I can finally say that I'm fine
You can just say "whatever"
I won't change my mind 'cuz I know that I'm better off
But I am cursed with a staircase wit
Always find the words when it's too late to let them slip
Don't judge me on my bad habits
I could pick out every flaw of yours
And unearth all your imperfections
Beneath the surface I have seen
The ugly truth behind the beauty queen
Held it back
Lost the nerve
Was too scared to talk when you gave me your hand
And you gave me your heart
When you should have kept it to yourself
You should have kept it to yourself
I wish you'd kept it to yourself
