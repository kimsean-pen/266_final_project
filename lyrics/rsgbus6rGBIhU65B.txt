I didn't know
You didn't come and it's past two
You should go
Yeah, it's fine
Where'd you decide to?
You can hang with your friends
Have a prime life
You can show them your city in the night time
Fake a smile on your face and it's all up to you, my friend

When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way

I didn't know
You didn't come and it's past two
You should go
Yeah, it's fine
Where'd you decide to?
You can hang with your friends
Have a prime life
You can show them your city in the night time
Fake a smile on your face and it's all up to you, my friend
You can't deny
You get me now
You can hang with your friends

When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
When you'll stay
When I'm on the way
