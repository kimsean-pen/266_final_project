I'm sorry for the things I've said
I never meant to break you the way you broke
In a distance of the bridges
I hear you calling out
through the smoke
And I hold my breath
while you choke
I watched the cars crashed in slow motion
Didn't look away
Should've seen what was coming
Stopped running
But all I know is I chase
I never learnt
how to stay
The truth is
I'm no good for you
You probably know it
by now
in case you don't
or you may forgot
Give me one more chance
I'll let you down
I hope you find somebody to love
It's what you deserve
Someone to adore you more than you know and you know
I'm not her
All I can promise is thhe worst
The truth is
I'm no good for you
You probably know it
by now
in case you don't
or maybe you forgot
Give me one more chance
and I'll let you down
And I'll remember you
drunk and crying
The time you told me
you felt like dying
Cos you know
we've only been lying to ourselves
The truth is I'm no good for you
And you should know it
by now
in case you don't
or maybe you've forgotten
Give me a chance
and I'll let you down
