Grant me a wish, my master
Take heed of me
I have been loyal servant
Heartfelt, humble

Gave up - what belongs to me
Gave up my greed
My self-examination
Made me see, to be me

I am now like Judas, done
Ashamed of what I've become
Fear for life I wear as a ring
To bask in your favor, I will kill the king

You say I am invincible
I cannot die
I know, but anyway
The words, they maim me

Grant me a wish, my master
Compassion, please
I'd like to be a human
Maybe one day

I am now like Judas, done
Ashamed of what I've become
Fear for life I wear as a ring
To bask in your favor, I will kill the king

Entreaty, let me go
Master, I hate you so
How can I sleep my nights?
When my whole being cries

I tried to be like everyone
Open my soul
But what I had to give
Resulted loathing

Enchanted by the power
Licked by the grace
One beautiful black flower
The end of the human race

With pride now face my faith
King and Queen now lie slain
Fear for life I wear as a ring
I bask in your favor, I have killed the king

Entreaty, let me go
Master, I hate you so
How can I sleep my nights?
When my whole being cries

I had a nightmare

The Wolf eating The Raven
Entrails of life on my plate

And I ate them
Interested in what I see
Try that Rorschach test on me
Have you seen the beauty of an
Enticing beast
Entreaty, let me go
Master, I hate you so
How can I sleep my nights?
When my whole being cries
Entreaty, let me go
Master, I hate you so
How can I sleep my nights?
When my whole being cries!
