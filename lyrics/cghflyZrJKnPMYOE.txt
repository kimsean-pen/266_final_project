I was gone for a while
Holding my breathe for this trial
Unspoken words made me smile
I went then to exile

For you, I do
Will I do
You now

For you, I do
Will I do
You now?

I don't know

Time is the healing friend
But it is right till the end
I don't want to pretend
You're my lady friend

For you, I do
Will I do
You now

For you, I do
Will I do
You now?

I don't know

Till the end, we had fun
Suddenly, everything's gone
We didn't argue about song
Now we just gotta move on

For you, I do
Will I do
You now

For you, I do
Will I do
You now?
