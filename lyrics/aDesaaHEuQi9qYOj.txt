There is nothing
No education, no family life to open my arms
You'd say that my job is today
Yet gone, tomorrow I'll be broke in a gutter
I know the opinion
A broken record
Fuck you and your college dream
Fact is we're stronger than all
You're working
For perfect bodies, perfect minds and perfect neighbors
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets and I'm making a fortune
You're muscle and gall
Naive at best
I'm bone, brain and cock
Deep down stronger than all
A sad state of affairs
A crippled America
A pipe dream buttfucked
Immune, stronger than all
We've grown into a monster
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck
Hard as a rock, shut like a lock
The president in submission
He holds out his hand on your television and draws back a stump
It's too late for some
Far too late
Far too late!
Hail kings
The new kings
Stronger than all
A simple process
To legalize
There would not be a choice
But to take our side
Be there no question
Of certain strengths
Know this intention
Forever stronger than all
Stronger than all
