When I called on my nursemaid
Come sit by my side
But she cuts through my rib cage
Pushes the pills deep in my eyes

...
The taste was much sweeter
Than chlorine and wine
And my doctor is unable

To cut through the cable that leads to my mind
...
In spite of the winter
There's ways to keep warm

Whatever you give me
Please know that I'm asking for more
...
The day I stopped swiming

Came out of the dark
I've never felt so uncomfortably numb
Here by your side
...

Black birds on the bed
Turning to fire
Black birds in the day
Shining a ray

...
Please, don't let me go
Under the rock where I found
My place in the crowd

Hope for the fathers and sons
...
Black birds on the bed
Turning to fire
Black birds in the day
Shining a ray
...
Please, don't let me go
