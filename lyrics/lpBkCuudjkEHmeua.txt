Well the drums rolled off in my forehead
and the guns went off in my chest
Remember carrying the baby for you
Crying in the wilderness

I lost track of my friends, I lost my kin
I cut them off as limbs
I drove out over the flatlands
hunting down you and him

The sky was big and empty
My chest filled to explode
I yelled my insides out at the sun
At the wide open road

it's a wide open road, it's a wide open road

How do you think it feels
sleeping by yourself?
when the one you love, the one you love
is with someone else

Then it's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go any place
that you ever wanted to go

I wake up in the morning
thinking I'm still by your side
I reach out just to touch you
then I realise

It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
