I came here without a choice
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light

And let it shine on
let it shine on us

And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you

The innocence in your face bled out without a trace
You've won without an enemy
You're ill without a remedy
As night bleeds into night
And I know I came off better than you
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better

And let it shine on, let it shine on us

And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you

And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you

Show me your hands
Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
They any drier than mine?
Your soul survives
But peace, you'll never find

And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you

And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
And if I say I love you
Well, then I love you
