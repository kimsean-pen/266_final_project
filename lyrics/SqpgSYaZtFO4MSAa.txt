moonlight over the water
it's just you and me
midnight floating together
like a melody

there's a fire in my head
luminate the words you said
can't believe it, am i dreaming?
i just feel like this ain't real life

we're alone and we're alive
so take my hand let's take a dive
don't hold your breath
we're jumping in
dipping in a pool of life
the water's dry
it's sinking in
baby this is paradise

sunrise over my shoulder
reflecting in your eyes
untied
we do what we wanna
drifting in the wind
don't know where this will end up

there's a fire in my head
going wild over things we did
can't believe it, am i dreaming?
i just feel like this ain't real life

so take my hand let's take a dive
don't hold your breath
we're jumping in
dipping in a pool of life
the water's dry
it's sinking in
baby this is paradise

don't let me go
won't let you go
not even for a minute

so take my hand let's take a dive
don't hold your breath
we're jumping in
dipping in a pool of life
the water's dry
it's sinking in
baby this is paradise

don't hold your breath
we're jumping in
dipping in a pool of life
the water's dry
it's sinking in
baby this is paradise
