A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be... adored

Look me, in the eyes, don't believe a word they say
For life is good, life is glory, though we live, one life only
Tell me, in real time, don't hesitate to profess
Love me, in the flesh, don't wait till death to sing my praise

A moment of silence... but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored
IN the bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living gods, More real than any God ever was

Adora Vivos - Our people are civilized... Love the living while they're still alive
Adora Vivos - Our people are civilized... we shouldn't worship the dead.

In The bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Where the living still walk the earth alone, more real than any God ever was

In bleak life, (We are realer than gods!) - More real than any God ever was
In modern times (we are realer than Gods!) - More real than any God ever was
Under grey skies and electric light, we the living still walk the earth alone
Where mortal men are living gods, more real than any God... ever was.

A moment of silence, (for the dead) but not one moment more
They've all gone to be forgotten, were still here, to be adored

Look me, in the face, and don't believe a word I say
This life is hard, this life is lonely, and we are here, for one night only
See the pain, in my eyes, the defeat, of my age
Feel the urgency of time, and don't wait till death to sing my praise

A moment of silence (for the dead), but not one moment more
The dead are to be forgotten, we are here to be adored
If you're waiting for tomorrow, save yourself for another day
But if you're living in the moment, don't wait (till death) to sing my praise

In The bleak life and modern times, Under grey skies and electric light
Mortal men are living Gods, More real than any God ever was
