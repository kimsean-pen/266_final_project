I slip softly through your slim fingers
Feeling traces, I embrace this feeling that lingers
Oh, the lingers, the lingers

So take me far away
And hold me close to your heart
And do me just this little favor
For I do, yes, I do love you
Yes, I do love you

This silence sits easy
So peacefully like the skin
Like the skin upon your body
On your body, your body

So take me far away now
And hold me close to your heart
And do me just this little favor
For I do, yes, I do love you

Little universe between our backs
This little universe between our backs
This little, little universe between our backs
This little, this little universe between our backs

Little, little universe between our backs
Little, little universe between our backs
Little, little universe between our backs
This little, little universe between our backs, yeah

Little universe between our backs
This little universe between our backs
So beautiful and colorful I lean on that
