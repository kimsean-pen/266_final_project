My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Sleeps on water walks on ice
Sleeps on water walks on ice
got no father, immortal wife
I'd exchange my soul for her
there's no antidote for her
I'd exchange my soul for her
there's no antidote for her
my little girl was born on a ray of sound
my little girl was born on a ray of sound

Like a dancing flame on a bed of nails
She is one thing that you cannot buy
with zero reasons for living
with zero reasons for living
my little girl was born on a ray of sound

Our only defence is together as an army
I'll hold you like a gun

Western values mean nothing to her
Western values mean nothing to her

She is beyond good and evil
