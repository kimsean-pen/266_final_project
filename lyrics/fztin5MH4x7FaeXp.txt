I don't love anyone,
But you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me
I don't love anyone,
But you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger from the wish
You live this way, and oh I'll never leave
yes I will, it seemed so cold

I don't love anyone,
But you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

The luck a penny brings, means everything
When you kiss and cross superstitiously-aly-aly-aly

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger from the wish
You live this way, and oh I'll never leave
(yes I will, it seemed so cold)

Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah
Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah
Johnny comes marching home again,
With this and that and a big bass drum
And they all come marching, over the hill from war

Well I don't love anyone,
oh you're not just anyone
You're not just anyone, to me

The luck a penny brings, means everything
When you kiss and cross superstitiously

Anything, mostly everything
You drop an eyelash and finger from the wish
You live this way,
And oh you'll never leave
She never would,
It's just so cold
