You move it to the left yea and you go for yourself
you move it to the right yea if it takes all night
now take it kinda slow with a whole lot of soul
don't move it too fast just make it last
You know you scratch just like a monkey yea you do real yea
you slide it to the limbo yea how low can you go
now come on baby I don't want you to scumble now
just groove it right here do the Harlem Shuffle
Yea yea yea do the Harlem Shuffle (oh do the monkey shine)
yea yea yea do the Harlem Shuffle
Hitch hitch hike baby across the floor
oh oh oh I can't stand it no more
now come on baby now get into your slide
you gonna ride ride ride little pony ride yea
Shake shake shake shake a tail feather baby
shake shake shake shake a tail feather baby
shake shake shake shake do the monkey time baby
