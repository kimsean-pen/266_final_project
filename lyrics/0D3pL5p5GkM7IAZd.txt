Chorus:
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see

Oh tell me why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say...

Chorus

In a passionate set we're moving close
Every bit of love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name

Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

Chorus (repeats twice)

Mike's monolauge:
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot love
Sweet caresses and yes' to me as you rub
And clench my back
Ecstacy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty

Chorus (repeats a lot and fades out)
