My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl I could've been someone, to you
Would have painted the skies blue

Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue

Baby blue
Baby blue
Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl I've got no chance
And nothing to say

Girl but stay here for a little while
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue
But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last baby blue
You are my baby
You are my baby

Bobbing on, the problem
On the problem, on the throbbing
She was falling, I was bawling
But I was stopping, she was throbbing
