All kinda crazy, crazy
All kinda crazy, crazy

You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, we say love
You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, now here we come

Sitting around, thinking about getting crazy
My right and wrong start duken' it out they knock me hazy
Well, I might not be the smartest one
But I got what it takes to get things done
Sitting around, thinking all kinda crazy

You see violence, we see love
You see violence, we see fun
You see violence, we see life's
You see violence through cold eyes

Sitting around fighting off thoughts of going crazy
The hate I feel makes my conscience get lazy
The urges that I feel are not new to me
I been there, done it, do it easily
Sitting around, thinking all kinda crazy

You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, we say love
You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, now here we come

All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy

I, I fuck 'n knew it
My mind says just screw it
You make me the maddest
I, I fuck 'n had it

Do you know what it's like?
You don't know what it's like
Wanna know what it's like?
I'll show you what it's like!

I won't sit and take it
Now I'm gonna break it!
Why I have to do it?
There ain't nothing to it!

Sitting around, thinking about getting crazy
The who, what, where, when, why, what? Doesn't even faze me

You see violence, we see love
You see violence, we see fun
You see violence, we see life's
You see violence through cold eyes

All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda

You say violence, all kinda crazy
We say fun, all kinda crazy
You say violence, all kinda crazy
We say love, all kinda crazy
