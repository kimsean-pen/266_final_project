Meeting eye to eye
so disparate.
All unrecognized,
come indifference.
Grounded in the flow
that all vigorate.
Source we long forgot
with our innocence.
Heed the Other,
clear the mind to conceive the whole.
Every cell
interblend.
Put the world before me.
One for one in the
individual
handed down ideal
how to find.
no more sympathy
for the vulnerable
as they're turned away,
out of mind.
With another face on.
Heed the Other,
clear the mind to conceive the whole
Every cell
interblend.
Put the world before me.
Once eyes turn
all is lost,
yield this love
tied umbilically.
We once for all
cause the Other's fall,
time has come for all.
Carnal body echoes.
Member notion fading.
Thoughts dissolve transcending
into satcitananda.
Spirit consciousness begin the rising.
Satcitananda parabrahma.
Purushottama paramatma.
Guide me over,
let me render.
Once it's over,
turn asunder.
Breathe in the possible.
Breathe in the charge of the light.
Breathe in the passing night,
come be it lost from sight.
Be the past here.
Be every thought you have.
Let everywhere be your side.
New is the same old.
Affirmed is the new unknow.
Infinite torans,
eternal the hours.
