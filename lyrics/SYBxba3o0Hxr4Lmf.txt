Alive, alive, alive, alive

Never thought the day would come when I'd see
My reflection smiling right back at me
It's been a while since I've been happy
Not sure, that I'm ready
I never planned on letting love in
Didn't wanna go back there again

But maybe I could (maybe I should)
Take a, take a chance on you

Tonight, I'm lost in the music and lights
I don't wanna let go but I might
If it's right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Is this real? Cause this heart is just startin' to heal
And you're so close to makin' me feel (me feel)
Alive, alive, alive, alive

I didn't ever think that I'd be given
Everythin' that I was missing
It's like somebody out there's listening
Still not sure, that I'm ready

But maybe I could (maybe I should)
Take a, take a chance on you

Tonight, I'm lost in the music and lights
I don't wanna let go but I might
If it's right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Is this real? Cause this heart is just startin' to heal
And you're so close to makin' me feel (me feel)
Alive, alive, alive, alive

You're makin' me feel, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive

I don't know if it's love again
But I'm closer than I've ever been
You're makin' me wanna let you in (wanna let you in)
I can feel your energy
I can't explain the chemistry
All the signs are telling me
Take a chance on you

Tonight, I'm lost in the music and lights
I don't wanna let go but I might
If it's right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Is this real? Cause this heart is just startin' to heal
And you're so close to makin' me feel (me feel)
Alive, alive, alive, alive

Tonight, I'm lost in the music and lights
I don't wanna let go but I might
If it's right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Is this real? Cause this heart is just startin' to heal
And you're so close to makin' me feel (me feel)
Alive, alive, alive, alive
