Good times always start when you call me up
But I can't even see you
It's love in the dark
I can tell myself that it's a plastic heart
Impossible to break it
Melt it down

Fifteen hundred birds singing out your name
You didn't hear a thing, they were singing in vain
Good times always end if you sing too soon
Oh, how I love the silence when I'm with you

A distant voice in your head singing
Nothing matters
Such a hard thing to do, running in between the raindrops
And until the rain stops
Nothing matters
It's just your heart beating too fast
Nothing's gonna hurt you
Nothing matters

Good times always start when you call me up
But I can't even see you
It's love in the dark
I can tell myself that it's a plastic heart
Impossible to break it
Melt it down

Fifteen hundred birds singing out your name
You didn't hear a thing, they were singing in vain
Good times always end if you sing too soon
Oh, how I love the silence when I'm with you

A distant voice in your head singing
Nothing matters
Such a hard thing to do, running in between the raindrops
And until the rain stops
Nothing matters
It's just your heart beating too fast
Nothing's gonna hurt you
Nothing matters

Hey fade away singing
Nothing matters
Hey fade away singing
Nothing matters
Hey fade away singing
Nothing matters
Hey fade away
Nothing's gonna hurt you
Nothing matters

Good times always start when you call me up
But I can't even see you
It's love in the dark
I can tell myself that it's a plastic heart
Impossible to break it
