Don't tell us this is normal
Don't tell us there's no change
So selfish and immoral
You're to blame

Cause you're the greatest rotter
Still crossing out of line
Now tell me who will suffer
For all your crimes?
We are running out of time

Out of time

And the writing's on the wall
That the end will begin
Still you do not fade at all
And keep denying the greatest sin

Ignore the truth and follow
Reap all that you sow
Spawn the future sorrow
We will know

Refusing every warning
Deny the rate of change
The ignorance is swarming
What a shame
Then you know that you're to blame

You're to blame

And the writing's on the wall
That the end will begin
Still you do not fade at all
Throwing lies to the wind

And the writing's on the wall
So I say it again
Still you do not fade at all
And keep denying the greatest sin

You're the one to blame
For this rate of change

No tomorrow
When will you see?

And the writing's on the wall
That the end will begin
Still you do not fade at all
Throwing lies to the wind

And the writing's on the wall
So I say it again
Still you do not fade at all
And keep denying the greatest sin

The greatest sin
Deny it again
When will it end?
