Baby I don't care
The what, when, how, or where
Folks may try to laugh and make a fuss
They'll try to make shit hard for us
But Baby, I don't care

Darling, I don't mind
What they think they'll find
Of all the secrets they have told,
At least I've still got you to hold
So, darling I don't mind

Cause I'll be the one to hold you
When the nights are cold
And although I know I told you
I will tell you forever more that

I don't give a damn
If they can't understand
Of all the things that we have learned
They're nothing as far as I'm concerned
So I don't give a damn

Cause I'll be the one to hold you
When the nights are cold
And although I know I told you
I will tell you forever more that

Babe, it ain't no thing
That viper venom sting
Cause even if it got your goat
I'd kiss you with the antidote

So babe, it ain't no thing
Darling, I don't care
Baby I don't, baby I don't mind
