I'm so mad, so mad at you
This what you do just to watch me go off
Even half a world from you
You found a way to get my blood running high

You love wanted me up,
I love shutting you down
Like we're tryina get even
Look at us now, going out again,
And again, and again
Till we're out of reasons
I heard them say

You can walk through fire
And you'd still come out alive
What's gonna kill ya
It's what you love, what you love

It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love

Why did you drag? Drag me into?
I keep on pointing that thing as past and the blame
But I'm just as bad, as bad as you
Yeah, it's half my ego, half of my shame

You love wanted me up,
I love shutting you down
Like we're tryina get even
Look at us now, going out again,
And again, and again
Till we're out of reasons
I heard them say

You can walk through fire
And you'd still come out alive
What's gonna kill ya
It's what you love, what you love

It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love

And I, I, I, I'm so mad at you
That's what you do just to watch me go off

It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love

It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
It's what you love, what you love
