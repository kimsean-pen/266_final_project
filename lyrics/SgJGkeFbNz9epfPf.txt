Look at my mind, I'm feeling like a drugger
Don't hit me like it used to do
I'm burnin' like a coal thrown down in the ocean
Running out of time when I look at you

I'm hanging by a thread, just tryna remember
All the things you said that you needed to do
I'm breaking like a wave strung out on the water
Holding onto anything that I can use to pull me through

I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had
I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had

I'm tired of the same emotion
Just humming at the [?]
I'm drifting on a wave of cold illusion
It's all that I can do on the funeral pyre

You could've been [?]
The city light burns as you walk on by
It's burning like a cigarette out of the ashes
Hanging on a breeze, I see them break
Towards the sky

I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had
I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had

I'm hanging by a thread, just tryna remember
All the things you said that you needed to do
I'm breaking like the wave strung out on the water
Holding onto anything that I can use to pull me through

I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had
I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had

I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had
I never really wanted you to know
It's not like I was just another darkened door
Holding onto something that I never had
