You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking you let me hide
Defend my honour, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But looking back it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no you ain't lying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you
Why are you speaking when no-one asks you
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
What are we doing?
Could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki and I say "Who me?"
You say "No you" and I say "Screw you"
Then you start dressing, and you start leaving
And I start crying and I start screaming
The heavy breathing but what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm asking you something
Yo, answer this question, class is in session
Tired of letting passive agression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Ok you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, its in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You can turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
Stop, oooh stop, oooh
Won't you just stop looking through me
Cause I can't take it
No I can't take it
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You see right through me
You see right through me baby
You see right through me
You see right through me
How do you (do that)?
How do you (do that)?
How do you (do that)
How do you (do that)
Oh, Baby
