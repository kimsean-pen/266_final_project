It's when you showed up late at night
I knew you were my ty-ype (yeah) ty-ype
We fell asleep to "Neverminds"
I woke up by your si-ide, si-ide

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go-o, ohh
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go-o, ohh

I thought that I was you were mine
You finished all my li-ines (yeah) li-ines
There's a time that we were riding
Side-by-side, but now I'm wondering
Where'd the time go?
Where'd the time go-o?
You said that young love never dies
We never got to try-y, try-y

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go-o, ohh
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go-o (You didn't, you didn't), ohh

You were one in a million, weren't ya?
Thought you were one in a million.
Who-o-o-o-o-o-oa
Who-o-o-o-o-o-oa
You were one in a million, weren't ya?
Thought you were one in a million.
Who-o-o-o-o-o-oa
Who-o-o-o-o-o-oa

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go-oooooo
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go-oooooo (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go (You didn't, you didn't)
You didn't have to go-o (You didn't, you didn't), ohh
