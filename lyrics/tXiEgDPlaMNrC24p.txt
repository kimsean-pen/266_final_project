Rip My Throat, Drink My Blood,
Strangle Me, Drown Me,
Give Me Vain And Give Me Pain,
Knives Running Through Me,
Oh, Master Of Wounds - Cut Me
Chase Me, Waste Me,
Leave Me In Your Arms
Cold Hands, Fingers Like Razors,
Break My Neck, Put Out My Light,
Crush My Hope, Rape My Life
Cut Me, Hurt Me, Cut Me, Hurt Me...
Cut Me, Cut Me, Cut Me, Cut Me,
Take My Life, Kill Me And Kill Me (and...)
I Am What You Deserve,
Death Do Me Submerge
