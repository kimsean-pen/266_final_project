Other Side - Metric
Ten tonnes may fall, down from the fallen sky
Onto the other side
My heart may break, don't look the other way
Don't look the other way
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
Fools may rise - all fall in their time
Burning with the forest fires
And all we want is to feel like all we got
Didn't cost us everything
Even if we never win
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side)
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side)
Free my mind, on with the other loves
On with the other lives
And all I want is to feel like all I got
Didn't cost me everything
Even if I never win
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side)
(You were mine on the other side
You were mine on the other side)
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side)
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side)
Ten tonnes may fall, down from the fallen sky
Onto the other side
