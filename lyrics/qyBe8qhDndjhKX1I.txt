Losing it, get a grip, turn it around
No one here cares if you're running your mouth
I won't wait around til you figure it out
Dead, dead, you'll always be dead to me
Pointless ignorance, living a lie
Nothing but a parasite sucking me dry
Feeding on the weak waste of life
Dead, dead, you'll always be dead to me

No reasoning, no legacy
All the words you speak are pure blasphemy
Work your system, you're nothing but trash
You belong in the grave never to be heard from again

Violence looking you dead in the eyes
Push it to the edge till you realize
Just another thing I will always despise
Dead, dead, you'll always be dead to me
Every word's putting you into the ground
Losing my mind when you make a sound
Gotta be an end, its gotta be now
Dead, dead, you'll always be dead to me

Work your system, you're nothing but trash
You belong in the grave never to be heard from again

Dead, dead, dead
You'll always be dead to me

Dead, dead, dead
You'll always be dead to me
Dead, dead, dead
You'll always be dead to me
