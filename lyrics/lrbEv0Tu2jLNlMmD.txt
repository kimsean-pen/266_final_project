What are we waiting for
This time we must be sure
No going back, no bow to take
Can't even hesitate
We've nothing left to lose
There's no one here but fools
A rush of blood, a bitter taste

This world has sealed our fate
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now

We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God

No one will stop us when we're playing God
Thrown out, cast aside
Rejection won't subside
Don't turn the cheek, don't walk away
It's time to decimate
Let's make them hurt and pay
Their turn to run away
Tonight we fight

We make a stand
And dance on shallow graves
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all

No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God

Playing God
No one will stop us when we're playing God
Nothing can stop us if we're playing God
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Oh
Now hear our noise, hear us coming so loud
And so clear, this is our call to arms
And confrontation is near
No one can stop us now

We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us when we're playing God
Nothing can stop us 'cause we're playing God
We're playing God
