All our secrets they are tailored trouble
Draped loose now around your hips
Your spotless instincts are valid
We coexist
Got 26 days to work with (Got 26 days)
We got 26 days to work with (It moves, it moves, it moves)
We'll see what all gets done

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
"You can't tell me that you don't beg"

Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogant)
Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best

Got 26 days to work with (Got 26 days)
Then back on that island
That you swear by
Still barely can't afford
It's still a question of
"How long will this hold?"
"Well Is it any different now that we are"
"Don't you go there not here, not now"
(It moves, it moves, it moves)
Not here, not now

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
"You can't tell me that you don't beg"

Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogance)
Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
Were all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogance)

We're all choir boys at best

Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best
(Intrusive and arrogance)
Liar (Liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best

It takes one to know one
