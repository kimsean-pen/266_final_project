I thought about calling you
But I changed my mind
The moment I thought about
What you do to me every time
I'm tryin' to come home and see you
You actin' like you can't make no time for me
So I'm puttin' down this receiver
'Cause if you don't know by now just how much I need ya
Then you'll never know

How i feel
Slowly gonna change if you let it
And it's real soon
If you don't do what I ask of you
Boy, I'm still missing you so bad
It's pathetic
I'm for real
See, I need more than your guarantees
Boy, you're losing me

You used to be so attentive
Call me at least twice a day
But now, I have no support, no incentive
To keep me lovin' you this way (yeah)
I sit alone, waiting patient
For you to return to me
And I can't believe just how long you have plans to take it
If you don't know by now what mistake you're makin'
Then you'll never know

How I feel
Slowly gonna change if you let it
And it's real soon
If you don't do what i ask of you
Boy, i'm still missing you so bad
It's pathetic
I'm for real
See, I need more than your guarantees
Boy, you're losing me

I hate it when you treat me like a burden
It hurts when I feel like you don't need me
I wanna believe that you love me
But it's so hard to relax
When you won't call me back
Throwin' me off like it's a wrap
Then just say that
'Cause I'm tired of complaining
If you ain't never gonna change it
Then you can't change the way i feel
No...

How I feel
Slowly gonna change if you let it
And it's real soon
If you don't do what I ask of you
Boy, I'm still missing you so bad
It's pathetic
I'm for real
See, I need more than your guarantees
Boy, you're losing me

How I feel
Slowly gonna change if you let it
And it's real soon
If you don't do what i ask of you
Boy, i'm still missing you so bad
It's pathetic
I'm for real
See, I need more than your guarantees
Boy, you're losing me

Yeah
