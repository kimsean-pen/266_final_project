Before I could ever let you go
Gonna beg until I drive you mad
Say something you could understand
I'm a statue baby, knock me out

Oh how these moments fade away, you say you never loved me
We say things we didn't mean to say
I take it back, I take it all back now
I take it back, I take it all back

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same?

You mean more to me than you'll ever know
You're my girl and I think it's a shame
That we get along this way
I'm just a statue try to knock me out

I guess these moments fade away, saying you never loved me
We said things we didn't mean to say
I take it back, I take it all back now
I take it back, I take it all back

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?
Thinking back now will you ever feel the...

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?

Thinking back now will you ever feel the same?
Yea I know you feel the same

You gotta let me know
I'm dying inside to know
Knock me out, I'm dying inside to know
Let me know, knock me out
(Knock me out)
(Knock me out)

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?
Thinking back now will you ever feel the same?

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?
Thinking back now will you ever feel the.

Paralyzed by the same old antics
Back and forth like some walking spastic
How could a fistfight be romantic?
Thinking back now, could you feel the same?

You gotta let me know
I'm dying inside to know
Knock me out, I'm dying inside to know
Gotta let me know, knock me out
(Knock me out)
