Take me through the pyramid
Show us life & things that you did

Each & every thing I see
Takes me back before I was me

We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been & will become

Where are all these singing birds?
We would say, but that's not what we heard

We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been & will become

We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done

Just one day is all that we needed so we could believe it all
In some way we already knew it, we just had to prove it all
We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been & will become
We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done
