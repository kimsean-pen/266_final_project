My mind falling to your eyes
With fall in the shallow of of your lights
Fall into the light
Crawling into the night

My heart sink into your bones
Now breath, Let him to the share of love
Falling to the light
crawling into the night

I'm gonna make you dance all the night then you will be right
I'm gonna make you dance all the night Then you will feel love
