I've got a head rush, hush, you're heaven's dial, a crush
I prayed for you forever and he sent you last November, finally
You better hold tight flight two shadows, one at night
Each instant lasting so long the spirit in this very song, reminding me

Life has taught me lessons like don't dare to question fate
For God will do the gifting all we've got to do is wait
So if anybody asks you if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

365, 365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear
365

I got a love Jones in my bones, I hear a saxophone
A melody so haunting it leaves my heart never wanting
More than you, you really fit the bill the first day of April
Now I know that deep inside my heart
You're gonna play the biggest part in my love debut

For with you comes the passion like springtime I fathom grand
I cherish every blessing I get when you kiss and hold my hand
So if anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

365, 365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear
365

Do you remember last November, baby
That's when I met you, heaven sent you baby, ah

Sometimes I stop and throw my hands up in the air
You make me holler, hey Tee Tee won't go away
It's more than just a feeling, it's destiny
I'm gonna testify about the long you're giving to me

I'm gonna break it down for you, gonna break down
Break it down, break it on down, I love you
Anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five

365, 365 days a year
That's how much I love you baby
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you

365, 365 days a year
That's how much I love you baby
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you

365, 365 days a year
That's how much I love you baby
