My friend dario
Has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
And the way the wheels are spinning
Forth screeching on the tarmac

Echoes in his head
Then echos through his veins
Drives too fast
Doesn't care about the crash

Dario knows it's prohibited
You either driver or a trainer
But he dresses for pleasure
Downs a bottle before each trip

My friend dario has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
Doesn't care about the crash

My friend dario has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Doesn't care about the crash
