To the end I'll never know,
temperatures are rising slow.

I came so hard, in your mouth.
I saw the future, it was dark.
I know I'm not afraid
I'm consumed.
and another thing,
I'm still bruised.

So it seems you're not my friend,
anything is better than.

I came so hard, in your mouth
I saw the future, it was dark.
I know I'm not afraid
I'm consumed.
and another thing,
I'm still bruised.

Nobody knows what I bring.
