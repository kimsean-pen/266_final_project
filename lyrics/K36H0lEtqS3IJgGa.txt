Some things fall apart
Some things makes you whole
Some things that you find
Are beyond your control

I love you and you're beautiful
You write your own songs
What if the right part of leaving
Turned out to be wrong

If I could kiss you now
Oh I'd kiss you now again and again
'Til I don't know where I begin
And where you end

Thought I fell in love the other day
With an old friend of mine
I was running kisses
Down every inch of her spine

We had the roof down
The sun came shining in
The black fact is
That I was thinking of you

If I could kiss you now
Oh I'd kiss you now again and again
'Til I don't know where I begin
And where you end

I slept in the sun the other day
I thought I was fine
Everything seemed perfect
'Til I had you on my mind

I tried to love you
I did all that I could
I wish that the bad now
Had finally turned into good

If I could kiss you now
Oh I'd kiss you now again and again
'Til I don't know where I begin
And where you end

If I could kiss you now
If I could kiss you now
If I could kiss you now

Oh where you end
Is where I begin

Oh where you end
Oh where you end
Oh where you end
