When did it get so hard to listen?
When did my ears go numb?
Maybe if thinking followed speaking
I'd understand my native tongue

Pick your poison
Call your burdens
Pick your poison
Ignore your purpose

We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort
(Woah-oh)
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another
(Woah-oh)
Why don't we think the same
When our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want no
(One)

This is the same old song and dance
Crying out give me another chance
It's pretty hard for me to learn my lesson
When I push the limits 'til I'm barely breathing

Pick your poison
Call your burdens
Pick your poison
Ignore your purpose

I'm not useless
I'm not useless
We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort
(Woah-oh)
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another
(Woah-oh)
Why don't we think the same,
When our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want no
(One)
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
I'm not useless
I'm just the king of excuses
