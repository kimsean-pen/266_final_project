I want to live each day
underneath your skin
Put your mouth on mine
let me pull you in

When the tables turn
and I know I'll lose
But the choice is mine
and how could I refuse?

No love lost no love here
Wasted time wasted years
No love lost no love here
Wasted time wasted years

I want to live each day
as though I've disappeared
I can't give you more
than what's already here
You reach out your hands
and touch my skin
And I'll forget the pain
and let you in

No love lost no love here
Wasted time wasted years
