Look out behind you
Jojo's got his gun
He wouldn't mean to do but
Ya know he likes his fun
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines, you know him.
(You know him)
He's got you covered
You'll know it right out front, mmm
mmm
Hey fifty dollars
He'll get you all you want
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
And it's all below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines, you know him.
Ever so rarely that man in a millon's
born
Gentle and soft, but who'd just as
soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jojo)
Go Jo
His baby stays high
Got to keep her sweet
He keeps her just right
Keeps her on the street
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
oh, below him
Jojo dig those ... Broadway nights
(Flashy lines oh, you know him)
Do you know you are so nice?
Do you care?
I'd love to take you home
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
(Jojo dig those)...Broadway nights
Flashy lines you, know him
Say, what do you think of gentlemen
wearing mink
Gentle and soft, but who'd just as
soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jojo,)
Go Jo
So you can't hang you
Jojo guide them
Though he wouldn't need to
He'd be loved to, ahh
Jojo did those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
Man is well below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines you, know him
(Yeah)
Yeah yeah
Jojo... our love can grow
Jojo... now now now...
(Woo woo woo wooo)
