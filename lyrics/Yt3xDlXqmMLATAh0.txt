Step up into the ring
You might have just met your match
You can't control that thing
I would not take that chance

(Hey) I am the red cape diver
(You can talk that talk, can you walk that walk?)
I am the red cape diver

Ah, it fires torpedoes
Kiss your lolitas
Make sure she knows you might
Die, hug your bambinos
Have your last meal
Make sure they know you're scared
Ah, I'm so scared
I don't want to die
I don't want to die
Ah, it fires torpedoes
Kiss your lolitas
Make sure they know

Tell my mama that I love her
Tell my papa the same thing
And when I step up into the ring
Pray for me, I'm gonna need it

(Hey) I am the red cape diver
(You can talk that talk, can you walk that walk?)
I am the red cape diver

Ah, it fires torpedoes
Kiss your lolitas
Make sure she knows you might
Die, hug your bambinos
Have your last meal
Make sure they know you're scared
Ah, I don't want to die
Please don't let me die
Please don't, please don't let me die
Ah, it fires torpedoes
Kiss your lolitas
Make sure she knows you might (die)

Both of our eyes lock eye to eye
Battle to the death, which one will die?
I'm so scared, I don't want my mom to die
Or my dad or my dog or my best friend
What if my boo boo died, what would I do without them?
What would they do without me, what would I do without

Ah, it fires torpedoes, I'm hit, I'm down

Ah, it fires torpedoes
Kiss your lolitas
Make sure she knows you might
Die, die, die
