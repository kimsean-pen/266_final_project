You there the bringer of my despair
You are stagnation of hope and wealth
Oh you personify loss and greed of mine
And you hide until my fear reappears

The love for life once bright
I'm burning fuse the only flame I have
From spiral down the sky
The seed is growing my misery

These wounds have killed time
We struggle to climb
Idle blood
Black state of mind
All my dreams left behind

You claim to be my long-absent friend
You are the curse in
You come with the dark night of the soul
But i'm turning my back on you
You know I do

The love for life once bright
I'm burning fuse the only flame I have
From spiral down this curve
The seed is growing my misery

These wounds have killed time
We struggle to climb
Eye of the blind
Black state of mind
All my dreams left behind

Eye of the blind
Oh the black state of mind
All my dreams left behind
