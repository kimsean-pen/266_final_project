A vial of hope and a vial of pain
In the light they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
On every boy and every girl

It's in the neon Bible, the neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the neon Bible is right

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
What I know is what you know is right
In the city it's the only light

It's the neon Bible, the neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is right

Oh God! well look at you now!
Oh, you lost it but you don't know how
In the light of a golden calf
Oh God, I had to laugh

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
It was wrong but you said it was right
In the future I will read at night

In the neon Bible, the neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is true
