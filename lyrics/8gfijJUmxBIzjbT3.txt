If you're like us
Calling all riders
Roll up beside us
No place to hide us

All freedom fighters
Let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and
Let's go
Destination
For navigation
Man up your stations
Feel the sensation
Surround invasion
With communication
Move quick, we might avoid contamination

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet to this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
Let me show 'em all how you move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Don't let these spiders
Crawl up beside us
They want to bite us
Inject the virus
Raise up your lighters
Praise to the righteous
Need you to guide us
Get prepared to go

If you're like us
Calling all riders
Roll up beside us
No place to hide us
All freedom fighters
Let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and
Let's go

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet to this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
Let me show 'em all how you move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Can't take it anymore
Shake until we move the floor
What are we waiting for? Let's go!
I'm tired of being ordinary
Don't care if there's people staring
I'll rely on your strength to carry me on

I'm not invisible like you
Next time things get a little messed up
I'll shine, but I'll never be see through
I'm fine just trying to wake the rest up

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet to this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
Let me show 'em all how you move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon
You move to this phenomenon
You move to this phenomenon
