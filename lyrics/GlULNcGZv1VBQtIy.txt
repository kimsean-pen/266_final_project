When we were old enough
To know there was something else
Did you go to your dad?
Did you go to your mom?
They used to say that you're old enough to know
But what's the use of that if you have no control?

Still you come, took away the sun
No one is trying to control it
We could go somewhere with different length
We could learn to love the controller

.To know exactly what to do
You remember it all ...
I used to say you're old enough to know
You never say that you're a controller

Still you come, took away the sun
No one is trying to control it
We could go somewhere with different length
We could learn to love, to control it
We could learn to love, to control it
We could learn to love, to control it
Still you come, took away the sun
No one is trying to control it
And we could go somewhere with different length
We could learn to love, to control it
