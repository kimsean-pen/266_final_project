It's hard to be a realist in this world where real doesn't exist
Thankfully, I much prefer to dream
In this place that we live
Pointing blame, we've lost all sense of logic
Nightmarish scenes on repeat
Rewind

Have we forgotten that we created it all?
Fascinated by manipulation
Seduced by power, molded the clay all wrong

What happens when we reach out and find that we're all alone?
There's something missing
What happens when we scream to the night, "Is this all we know?"
Is your heart listening?

The earth's bounty is rich, but children will continue to starve
While we mistake human rights for privilege, our brother as enemy
War for economy

Oh, how we abuse our imaginations!
Focus our ambitions selfishly
Instead of dreaming together, forgiving dysfunction
To end the collective suffering

What happens when we reach out and find that we're all alone?
There's something missing
What happens when we scream to the night, "Is this all we know?"
Is your heart listening?

Where's your love? Where's your soul?
Has the whole world's blood gone cold?

Where's your love? Where's your soul?
Has the whole world's blood gone cold?

Where's your love? Where's your soul?
Has the whole world's blood gone cold?

Where's your love?
Has the whole world's blood gone cold?

What happens when we reach out and find that we're all alone?
There's something missing
What happens when we scream to the night, "Is this all we know?"
Is your heart listening?

When did our souls become so lazy?
Heads in the sand to avoid the hurting
Shit tends to repeat itself when we refuse to fucking learn from history

What happens when we reach out and find that we're all alone?
There's something missing
