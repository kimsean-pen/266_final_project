Some people watch,
Some people pray.
Body in lights can fade away.
Some people hope,
Some people pay
But why we have to stay?

'Cause even here
Role cares of blues
Or any mysery you choose
You like to watch,
We like to use
And we were born to loose

I choose to sit,
I walk away,
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep,
We like to play
Just look at all that pain.

You want the heart
Or to be saved,
But even good cash's still get payed
So watch my back and keep the blade
I think it'll got you laid

So fake your death or is your blame
And leave the lights on when you stay
Take off your clothes and dream that fame
Come'on and feel that shame

I choose to sit,
I walk away,
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep,
We like to play,
Just look at all that pain

Just look at all that pain
Just look at all that pain
Just look at all that pain.

Just give me all that pain
Just give me all that pain
Just give me all that pain

I choose to sit,
I walk away,
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep,
We like to play,
Just look at all that pain
