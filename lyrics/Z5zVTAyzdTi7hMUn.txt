And the brightest sign, it is full of holes
and it's full of paying lost violent criminals
with a little fate
and the worst of lies, with a love so deep
Its war with endless fire inside
Go right back to the line
Every single day, every nine to five
Every body works it hard, but then we finally die
and there's no remorse
Or the slightest sound
We're forever cool with the way it breaks up and down
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
it's just one epic holiday
On the Sunday rain
like a lonely ghost
And the furthest point from here is right outside the door
Open up your eyes
Take a breath if you will
And the sun is still alive even though it's hard to tell
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
it's just one epic holiday
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
it's just one epic holiday
Nobodys rightnobodys wronglets start a riot
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game it's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday
