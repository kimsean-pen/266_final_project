I don't need a seance
I don't read grey lines
I signed it away
way long
I hate, slow songs

whoa yeah,
I don't even care
whoa yeah,
I go over there

my hair is,
real long
no brains
or braun
no shoes
just thongs,
I hate, slow songs

whoa yeah,
you cry like I care
whoa yeah,
buck naked and there...

hooray, hooray for you
hooray, hooray for you
hooray, hooray for you
hooray, hooray for you
hooray, hooray for you
hooray, hooray for you
