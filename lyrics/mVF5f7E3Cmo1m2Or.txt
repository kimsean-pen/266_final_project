Well where I come from,
You learn to take it nice and slow.
But baby since we met,
Oh, it's been go, go, go.

So you can rough me up (you can rough me up),
Yeah baby you can hurt me too.
Because all I got (all I got),
You see, all I got is you.

You can rough me up,
You can break me down,
Baby don't stop now.

Oh, you can use me up 'til it all runs out,
Baby don't stop now.

I'm all yours,
I'm all yours somehow,
Baby don't stop now.

I said where I come from,
You learn to make the best of things.
But, honey since we met,
You know you've had the best of me.

So you can lock me up (you can lock me up),
Yeah baby throw away that key,
Because all I know (all I know),
Is that this is where I wanna be.

You can rough me up,
You can break me down,
Baby don't stop now.

Oh, you can use me up 'til it all runs out,
Baby don't stop now.

I'm all yours,
I'm all yours somehow,
Baby don't stop now.

Oh, you you can rough me up,
You can break me down,
Baby don't stop now.

Oh, you can use me up 'til it all runs out,
Baby don't...

Oh, you can rough me up,
You can break me down,
Baby don't stop now.

Oh, you can use me up 'til it all runs out,
Baby don't stop now.

I'm all yours,
I'm all yours somehow,
Baby don't stop now.

(Hey)

No, honey don't stop now.

Well, baby don't stop now.
