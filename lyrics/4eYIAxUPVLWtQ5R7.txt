Easy said and easy done is how we like this
Keep us in our place

You're the night, the dirty night
That keeps us going
Nothing left to waste

Pull a sentence from your lips
To keep them quiet
What they want to hear

Oh you're the night, the dirty night
That keeps us going
No-one left to fear

As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you
Keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me

Smile for once, for a moment
It makes us happy
What we need is here

Oh you're the night, the dirty night
You make us angry
There's everything to fear

As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you
Keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me

As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you
Keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me
Keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me
