Oh I love to dance
Under an alien sun
Along the dunes with you
I kiss you in the sand
We give so that we live
Beside the sleepy snakes
They dream of you and me
When will they ever end
For a million years they dream
For a million years they dream
And the fog conceals and hides
and eats our souls
Before they open up their eyes again
How far we'll be
Remember me
Won't stop lovin' you
Although it seems to be
Our time is running out
I'm leaving you behind
No matter what they say
We'd never meet again
Our love is bigger than our lives
For a million years they dream
For a million years they dream
And the fog conceals and hides
and eats our souls
Before they open up their eyes again
How far we'll be
How far we'll be
And we know that yesterday
The moon was brown
And that today it is black
And that tomorrow it is red
And we know that when we go to the sun
The moon comes along
(Hello there!)
And the cows in the pasture graze
And we know that we know what we know
Is it truth?
