Summer comes and when it fades you're in that little dress again, yeah
It's like a knife that cuts deep
And I can't bear to think about just how close we used to be
It keeps me up, I can't sleep

All my friends were lost but I was found
Then I threw it away
When we walked on hollow ground

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are, if you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for you

We needed space and a little time, girl I hope you change your mind
And come back to me
Remember all the mornings you would make me late
I couldn't bare to leave you when you looked at me
The way you do

All my friends were lost but I was found, yeah
Then I threw it away
When we walked on hollow ground, yeah

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are, if you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for you
You're the star that makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you

And if I'm there too late, mmh, yes
A couple things I got to say

But I will run back into your arms
No matter where we are, if you need me to
If you still got some space in your heart
I would tear this world apart for you

You're the star that makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you

You're the star that makes my heart burn brighter
I would walk through the fire for you, for you
