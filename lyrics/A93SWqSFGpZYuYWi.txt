I'm standing in the dark
Let the music start
I can hear you call out my name
I see the flashing lights
Cutting through the night
The spotlight is shining on you
I've always been around
I'll never let you down
I've seen it through right from the start

We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again
We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again

I'm standing in the dark
Let the music start
I can hear you call out my name

We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again (rockin' again)
We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again

Do what you wanna do tonight
We're gonna make you feel alright
Do what you wanna do tonight, tonight

Do what you wanna do tonight
We're gonna make you feel alright
Do what you wanna do tonight, yeah

Stop the show
I gotta go
But we'll be back for more

We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again (rockin' again)
We'll be rockin' together, rockin' again (rockin' again)

Rockin' again
Rockin' again
