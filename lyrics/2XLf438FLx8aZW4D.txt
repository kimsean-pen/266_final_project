I believe that you and me are gone

Bees in the honey
Don't you wanna get some?
It's a feeling
I don't need a reason
Take a little
Take a little risk, hmmm?
If you're playing
Play me like the best
Woo
I can hear it
Can you hear the sweet song?
Keep on talking
Kissing (in the back hall[?])
Can't resist ya
Sing it like a rebel yell
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Woo

There's no turning back
So don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
Don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
Don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
That little mamma, woo-oo
That little mamma
That little mamma

Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna try some
I'll repeat it
Do a little more harm
Serenade ya
Got you under my spell
What you're doing
You do it so well
Woo
Give you wishes
Give you all you dreamed of
Drag you under
Drag you to the deep dark
Don't resist it
Be my ever-loving one
Let me hear ya
Let me hear ya
Woo

There's no turning back
So don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
Don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
Don't you ever treat me like that,
Little mamma,
That little mamma, woo-oo
That little mamma,
That little mamma

I believe that you and me are gone...

That little mamma,
That little mamma, woo-oo...
