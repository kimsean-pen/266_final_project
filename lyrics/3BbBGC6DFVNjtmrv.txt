She's dying
everybody came to see
She's falling
and I know I'll never see her face again
And I don't really know
just why she's leaving
All she ever said
was she just had to go
And I watch her
as she walks away from me
Yeah, I can see her
then I know that in a moment she'll be gone
Yeah, she'll be gone and
and then I'll say
"You've got to understand
She's not really breathing
no not at all
those years of endless rain
they just washed her away."
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah she's going for good
Oh and I'd love to go with you
but I never would
Face it
you've blown it this time round
Now I understand
just why she's leaving
Oh
If she'd have hung around with me
well you know she'd never go, no nonono
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah, she's going for good
and I'd love to go with you
but I never would
Oh and I know she's leaving
Yeah, she's going for good
and I'd love to go with you
oh but I never would
No I never would
No I never would
No I never would
Oh no
Dadadada dadada...
She's never coming back
Face it
She's gone
Oh
Lalalala lalala...
No I never would
No I never would.
