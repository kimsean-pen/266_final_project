Dear old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again
I'm giving in to my vices bottle in hand

Dear old friend
I think I'm slipping again
At the end of my rope with this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some words to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping most nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

{I've got a} short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

Dear old friend
In this letter I'll never send
I confess I kill them both where they stand

Dear old friend
You only get what you give
At the end of my rope with this pain in my head

I could use your sage old advice
Some words to calm me down
I ain't been sleeping most nights
With my girl sleeping all over town

{I've got a} short list of my enemies
Since days I spent in the trench
But he ain't no man, he's a cheat
A coward staring down death

My old friend, my old friend
My old friend, my old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again

On the front lines I watched as good men died
I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now
I was a father once. Lies built on losing ground

On the front lines boys buried where they lie
I left a piece of me in foreign country side
And in my own home, I'm a stranger now
I was a husband once. Lies built on losing ground

My old friend, my old friend
My old friend, my old friend
My old friend, my old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again
My old friend, my old friend
My old friend, my old friend
My old friend, my old friend
I'm feeling hopeless again
