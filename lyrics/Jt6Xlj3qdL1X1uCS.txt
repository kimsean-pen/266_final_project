I left home a long, long time ago
In a tin can for the road with a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the nighttime making tracks
With no time for looking back to the place where I belong

How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away

How I miss you and I just wanna kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long

When you're sad, you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear and set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true wherever I might be

Time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning sometimes
I feel I'm wasting my day

How I miss you and I just wanna kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day

How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long

Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echoes in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last, forever by your side

How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away

How I miss you and I just wanna kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day

And time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning sometimes
I feel I'm wasting my day

How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day

How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long
