Ooh, these feet carry me far
Ooh, my body oh so tired
Mouth is dry
Hardly speak
Holy spirit rise in me

Oo, here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything
Mmm, mmm, mmm
In this life
I'll join everyone
Ooo, when I die

Have my body
Have my mind
Have my coat
Take me tie
These are borrowed
Borrowed so far
Turn to dust
Fall apart

Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything
Mmm, mmm.mmm
In this life
I'll join everyone
Oh, and understand
'Cause all men die (all men die)
'Cause all men die

And I'll take everything
Mmm, mmm, mmm
In this life
I'll join everyone
Ooo, since I'm gonna die
And I'll take everything
Mmm, mmm, mmm
In this life
I'll join everyone
'cause all men die
