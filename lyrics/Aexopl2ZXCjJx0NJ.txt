Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Slave driver, the table is turn (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, now (Catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire: gonna get burn (Catch a fire) woah, now!

Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize the very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good God, I think it's illiteracy
It's only a machine that makes money
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh)

Slave driver, uh! The table is turn, baby, now (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, baby, now (Catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire: so you can get burn, now (Catch a fire)

Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize the very soul

O God, have mercy on our souls!
Oh, slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn (Catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire...
