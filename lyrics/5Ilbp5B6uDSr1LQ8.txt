Stop, don't say that it's impossible
'Cause I know it's possible
Though I know you never look my way
I can say, you will one day
I can say, you will one day

I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I get you when i'm popular

I put my hands up in the lights
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular

Spread the news, I'm gonna take the fight
For the spotlight day and night
I can't take this to the number one
Be someone before you're gone
Be someone before you're gone

I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I get you when I'm popular

I put my hands up in the lights
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular

Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-pop oh-oh-pop oh-oh-popular
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-ooh

I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there
My body wants you girl, my body wants you girl
I get you when I'm popular
I put my hands up in the lights
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
Popular
