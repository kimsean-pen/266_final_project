I can't reach you now, you're gone
I can't reach you now but I'm holding on
And I try to find a way to make you stay
I can't reach you now, you're gone
I can't reach you now but I'm holding on

It's not easy when it hurts, so don't please me when I am hurt

I try to hold you
I try yes I try but you won't get back

I can't reach you now you're gone oh my heart is numb
I can't reach you
