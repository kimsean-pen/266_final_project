If I were you I wouldn't trust
A single word I say
Think by now you should know
That nothing's gonna change

Can I ask you something; what did you expect
So disappointed with what you get
Do you ever want to just get outta here
So disappointed; just disappear

Look at you, Superman
With all the world to change
Think by now you'd figure out
That nothing's gonna change
And I am part of the reason

Can I ask you something; what did you expect
So disappointed with what you get
Do you ever want to just get outta here
So disappointed; just disappear
