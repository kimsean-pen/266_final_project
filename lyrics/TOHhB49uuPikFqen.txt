Give me purity, strength and affection
Give me lust to ignite my devotion for life
It's where beauty comes alive

Can't you see I'm a slave to the darkness?
Cutting down
And I know I have done this before
As I stare into the wall

And now it's time to let it shine
'Cause don't you know I'm addicted?

Massive addictive
And suddenly I'm greatly affected
Like burning fire inside my cyanide
Scared of losing my mind
Massive addictive
I'm totally completely afflicted
As I inspire the lie like a lullaby
Crawling around in my mind
My mind

Unremitting demand of my hunger
Time stands still
As I am losing the grip of it all
Like a thousand times before

Give me antidotes
Constant removers
Make an instant deductive denial in vain
'Cause I always stay the same

And now it's time to be reborn
Although I know it's addictive

Massive addictive
And suddenly I'm greatly affected
Like burning fire inside my cyanide
Scared of losing my mind
Massive addictive
I'm totally completely afflicted
As I inspire the lie like a lullaby
Crawling around in my mind
My mind

It's a massive destruction
Combination of glory and hope
A schematic affliction
Of a feeling inside what I sworn

Massive addictive
And suddenly I'm greatly affected
Like burning fire inside my cyanide
Scared of losing my mind

And now it's time to let it shine
'Cause don't you know I'm addicted?

Massive addictive
And suddenly I'm greatly affected
Like burning fire inside my cyanide
Scared of losing my mind
Massive addictive
I'm totally completely afflicted
As I inspire the lie like a lullaby
Crawling around in my mind
My mind

Massive addictive
