Oh god
You wanna play god
You wanna play god
Yes, you wanna play god

We make do with the time we have alive
Take the rules made for granted
Organize crime
Our morals always come after the prize
I'm not a sheep
Better take those words to mind

Somebody tell me
What is the bug in this game?
Can't wrap my head around the comma's only making you stay
The lack of truth in this world
Wanna throw it away
But in my mind I will never let it be that way

We make do with the time we have alive
Take the rules made for granted
Organize crime
Our morals always come after the prize
I'm not a sheep
Better take those words to mind...
