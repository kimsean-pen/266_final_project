A violent conflict
Between two foes
At close quarters
Pound and slash, the blood will flow

Barbaric melee
A hateful duel
Shared abhorrence gives the conflict

Fuel
Add to the fire
Lies
Resentment built
For years

Now
It's time to end this
Fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

The cracking bones
And shattered teeth
Wounds are swelling
Lacerations running deep

Losing blood
But still we fight
Both resolved to end the other's

Life
The only answer
Hate
Can only end
With death

Now
It's time to end this
Fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

Both of us are killers
Both of us are evil men
Unforgiving murderers today may kill again

Both of us will throttle
Strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness
Revenge has us enslaved

Both are badly wounded
And struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death
But only one will die

Both of us will bludgeon
Both of us will pound
Facial bones will splinter soon
The blood will drench the ground

Both are rending flesh
Both are gouging eyes
Escalating violence
The brawl intesifies

Both of us will throttle
Strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness
Revenge has us enslaved

Both are badly wounded
And struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death
But only one will die

Kill
The only answer
Hate
Can only end
With death

Now
It's time to end this
Fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die
