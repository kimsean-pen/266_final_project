Asinine white light, come feed me
Come remind me of my grievances
Twice imbibed, confer the how and why

With a slight hint of emotion
Waste no thought, avoiding questioning
What is the point? Undo, undo again

Scream I'm whole one more time
Can't remember why
It stopped; go rewind
Screamed whole one more time

What's the art in killing all emotion?
I choke on mine, it's barely noticeable
Who am I to think I could forget?

Scream I'm whole one more time
Can't remember why
It stopped; go rewind
Screamed whole one more time

Scream I'm whole one more time
Can't remember why
It stopped; go rewind
Screamed whole one more time

'Cause I can feel it in the rest of me
Part of what appears to be
More than just the taste on my tongue

I can feel it in the rest of me
Part of what appears to be
More than just the taste on my tongue
