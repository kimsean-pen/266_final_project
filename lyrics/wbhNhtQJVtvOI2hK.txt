I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
Do these karats like I worked in a farm
(Like I worked in a farm)
Left wrist bust down Audemar
Lil' mama, I'm a country star (I'm a country star)
I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
Do these karats like I worked in a farm
(Like I worked in a farm)
Left wrist bust down Audemar
Lil' mama, I'm a country star (I'm a country star)

I'm a country star, it's no joke
Karats on my neck, these diamonds,
They can make man choke
I'm too flash, don't stare, get a stroke
Pull up to the farm and get smoked
I'm a cash cow, you can go and ask Andy
Numbers that I do are no joke
I'm a sex addict, and a young boss, plus GOAT
Always with a peng gettin' throat
My tings, them love of reverse cowgirl
You don't exist, you ain't even in my world
You could never even get a handshake off my girl
Never cared about rap, cared about the clienteles
I'm a young stunna, ride the guitars like Gunna
Like Sosa, and 24, free Hunna
My niggas push big horseback, no Hummer
And keep two sticks like a drummer
I had beef all 'cause of one yatty
I was foolish, mind all scatty
Backed my ting like I worked in the yard
Flew shots and I put three holes in the patty
Wow, some of my opps are too weird
They do a likkle works and they want get chatty
I'm in the zone nowadays
Only way that I'm gonna look astray is a complete fatty

I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
Do these karats like I worked in a farm
(Like I worked in a farm)

Lil' mama, I'm a country star (I'm a country star)
I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
Do these karats like I worked in a farm

Lil' mama, I'm a country star (I'm a country star)

From the wild west where we move unruly
If you got beef, better tuck that toolie
I'm a G like Ali
Man'll get their right hand chopped if they touch my jewelry
I got a big bad ting in a tied up shirt
And some buckwheat, lookin' all coolie
Trini boy saw me live a life man
Skrrt the Phantom or the Ghost, I'm ghoulie
My J1s got spurs and snakeskin
Kickin' out dust when I'm big bat chasin'
Stand and deliver, need the money or I'm lacin'
Free up all my niggas with the birds they're facin'
Mirage, look at mans virage
I roll up mans sleeves and they ask what I'm in nah
Just whips in the garage, the skeng love barrage
Don't wanna link, man, I hate niggas like Farage
I eat goat enough times I'm a cannibal
Independent, but the label dem say mi flammable
Big crew, big zoo, man a animal
Me and dem lames over there not comparable
I drip hard, whip hard, then I spend hard
Cash for that blam, Pakistan, then I spend card
Strong circle, will can't bend ours
Paper tag boys, cashed out, never rent cars

I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
Do these karats like I worked in a farm
(Like I worked in a farm)
Left wrist bust down Audemar
Lil' mama, I'm a country star (I'm a country star)
I've come too far, I've come too far (Too far)
Horsepower whip with a star (With a star)
Cowboy spins in the car (In the car)
Cowgirls rippin' off bras (They rippin' off bras)
When I ride then I scream, "Yeehaw"
