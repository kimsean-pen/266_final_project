Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my
Hopes and my dreams

But I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me

So I'll make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad
On the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the crazy
These places I've seen

But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me

I'll spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I met a man
In the bar down in Memphis
And he told me he went there
To follow his dreams

He told me "Son
You know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason
That you crossed the sea"

And I found truth
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oh my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oh my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
