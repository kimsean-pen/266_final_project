Maybe I just don't know which way to go and I show
Maybe I just won't go
Maybe I'll just head back to West Virginia by god
Maybe I just don't know
All of the lights are out up on Castle
All of the stores are closed
Maybe I'll just walk back down Queen one time
Maybe I'll just head home, oh no my god

It ain't over yet

Maybe the way you look it doesn't matter to me
Maybe I don't think so
Maybe you don't want me to hang around anymore
Maybe I best just go
I'm headin' back down south to Key Bumps
Maybe down to Key Low
I know it's hot as hell in the summer down there
All year round it snows, oh no my god

It ain't over yet

It ain't over yet
