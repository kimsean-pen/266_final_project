Lightsaber, party favors
We should meet up, kick our feet up
Say a prayer, elevator
We so high now

I could meet my maker
I could meet my maker
I wonder what she'd say to me
And would she be ashamed of me?

I'm a real bitch when I'm hungry
Got a Netflix special but you ain't funny
I'm so high now, ain't no cat or mouse
When you in the clouds, birds can't fly now
But I was ditzy, I'm more Kasitsky
I'm talking Bondie
I don't got no money for this movie
But I'll star in it, catch a couple scars for it

Lightsaber, party favors
We should meet up, kick our feet up
Say a prayer, elevator
We so high now

I could meet my maker, oh
I could meet my maker, oh
I wonder what he'd say to me
And would he be ashamed of me?

'Cause I'm a real bitch, Lafortuna heels, bitch
If you wanna die, I recommend you cop a feel, bitch
Ain't no proposition if you're the opposition
We hit the top position, we pay enough tuition

Lightsaber, party favors
We should meet up, kick our feet up
Say a prayer, elevator
We so high now

I could meet my, oh
I could meet my maker
I could meet my maker
Hmm
