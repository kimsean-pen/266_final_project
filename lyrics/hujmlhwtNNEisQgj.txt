In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune
You're entering this town
Yourself a weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune
You're all out of tune
See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh
You're all out of tune
See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
Oh oh
New car
You're all out of tune
In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune
You're entering this town
Yourself a weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune
You're all out of tune
