I'm thinking of your wide open eyes
Smiling as they feed the nerves
That push the field of silver and the colorful lines
That only you could see, like only you could do

I'm picturing a forceps in ice
That you would see if you could reach
And reconnect the ends into the delicate threads
But I just sit and wait for a blip to break the perfect little thin green line

I dreamt of jet this high
Seeding clouds from the other side
And glowing softly 'til the underbelly shines
And the back skims through the steam

Feeding upturned mouths and sprinkling away
A dusty sleep you took too soon
And you, you need watering if you are to bloom

I'm thinking of your failing green eyes
Smiling as they greet the day
But they can't see me

And now I'm picturing us opening wide
And drinking down our days in haze
And bliss together 'til it tumbles aside

But I just sit and wait
For a rhythm in a perfect little thin green line
It's true, so soon

And the coil speaks
I'd like to see us together
I'd like to lay my head low
I need to lean on a soft one
And bring the spin of the world to appear slow

And you've been gathering angels
And fading further each day
I love you now as I never
Remember my face as it quietly make you're way

I dreamt of jet this high
Seeding clouds from the other side
And glowing softly 'til the underbelly shines
And the back skims through the steam

Feeding upturned mouths and sprinkling away
A dusty sleep you took too soon
And you, you need watering if you are to bloom
