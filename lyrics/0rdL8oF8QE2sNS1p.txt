Sacrifice won't suffice
Resurrection needs your death to happen twice
Fall on my heart and burn and forge your tortured black-smitten
Into the sharpest fucking sword

Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be

No sin-eater to slay us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide, Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away

Christ consciousness manifest to the Golden Ratio, five or 500 million years ago
We were 15-foot high and to die was a Bardot Bridge we never thought we'd cross
To burn down behind and below

No sin-eater to slay us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide, Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away

Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be

So take your little black book
I see the way that you look in to it
I'll eat it and I'll cut my tongue
And all the pages you spread, sweet as honey you said
But I'm choking on your bitter stories

No sin-eater to slay us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide, Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
Sunday AIDS and church wine wash it away
