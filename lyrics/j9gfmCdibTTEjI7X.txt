Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight
Through the dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine
Through the dark times, the dark times

I remember a time when I was young and blind
Couldn't take the fall from anything at all
I blamed it on everybody else
(I blamed it on everybody else)

Like the New World Order, the Illuminati
As long as it wasn't me
I was afraid of the mirror, of what I would see
I didn't wanna see me

Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight
Through the dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine
Through the dark times, the dark times
If the sky is always raining black
If the world is always stabbing you in the back
Open your eyes and you will find
That we all live broken lives

(That we all live broken lives)
We all live broken lives

I was envious of, other people's love
Hung up on why, I didn't have their lives
I blamed it on everybody else
(I blamed it on everybody)

Like corrupt politicians or the shitty economy
As long as it wasn't me
One day I lifted my head and looked into the mirror
I was staring at me

Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight
Through the dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine
Through the dark times, the dark times
If the sky is always raining black
If the world is always stabbing you in the back
Open your eyes and you will find
That we all live broken lives

(We all live broken lives)

We all live broken lives

Remember we all go down in flames
We fell to live up to invincible mains
Without a heart and stuck in our minds
We can't forget how we all live broken lives
