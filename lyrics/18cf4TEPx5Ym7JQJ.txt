I was born before the storm
My mother placed a dozen thorns
The sorry's and the take it back's
Lay silent in her folded hands

And head to headstone I just danced
Oblivious to consequence
As the morning sank into the ground
The highest branch I sought it out

Oh, I didn't mean to let it go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
And when she said to me "It's still a ghost."

All your love may fade away
All you'll become, may all go to waste
So I can't stand to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse

Oh, you caught me come to life
The moment when your eyes met mine
And from your bed the sun came in
And to this day it never set

But here's to this, I'm used to it
I stepped out for some cigarettes
The, neon lights they called me in
Her eyes like yours, just different

And oh, I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
What didn't mean a thing destroyed us both

Darling, all your love may fade away
All you'll become, may all go to waste
So I can't stand to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse

I, couldn't quite believe
The way you used to pull me down, it'd take its to-ll
I survived the loss of gravity
These jaws of gravity
I will not let them sink their teeth into my soul
Oh, oh

All my love may fade away
All I'll become, may all go to waste
So I can't stand, hear it say it hurts
When it only gets much worse

All our love may fade away
All we'll become, may all go to waste
So I can't stand, to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse
