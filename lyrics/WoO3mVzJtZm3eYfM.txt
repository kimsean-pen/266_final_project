Oh it's cold world
But it's home to me
Oh a little ghost of a girl
She came to me
She's been haunting me
Strange creatures, oh yeah you and I both
Strange creatures, deep down you and I both

This man knows it all
Don't have a clue about me
I'm in a nightmare, not a thing can set me free
If only we could see that we're
Strange creatures, oh yeah you and I both
Strange creatures, deep down you and I both

Oh mmmmm

Strange creatures, oh yeah you and I both
Strange creatures, deep down you and I both
