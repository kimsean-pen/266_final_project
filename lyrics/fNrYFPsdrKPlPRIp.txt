Weather is in a style
To keep the hope
We tread these waters make our waves yes we do,
Peaceful shall proceed
An every single week,
Come lets bring light
To the night of need

Weather is in a style
To keep the hope
We tread these waters make our waves yes we do,
Peaceful shall proceed
An every single week,
Come lets bring light to the night of need

There comes a time in somewhere new
A time when trueborns really show
Can you depend on friends to help when your in need
Everybody got problems of they own
Look all the silver seasonin shown
Somethings are besta left alone
