I was a quick, wet boy, diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map and called for you everywhere

Have I found you
Flightless bird?
Jealous
Weeping
Or lost you
American mouth
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown in the cold
And clean blood of Christ mountain stream

Have I found you
Flightless bird?
Grounded
Bleeding
Or lost you
American mouth
Big pill stuck
Going down
