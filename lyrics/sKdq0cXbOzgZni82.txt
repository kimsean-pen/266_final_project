Does he meet you with heart shaped balloons
Offer you everything and never pull through
Does he love what you've done with the place?

And does he take you the liquid rooms after work
Just to unwind you, but then goes and makes it worse
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?

And I've not stopped thinking this shit since I come away

Hey, how about I change?
How about you look at me the same?
Hey, how about I change?
How about you love me again?

Does he assure you at four in the morning
That you just haven't seen his good side yet?
Does he love what you've done with the place?

And does he take you the liquid rooms after work?
And does he join you on the tables baby?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?
Can he do what I do for you?

And I've not stopped thinking this shit since I come away

Hey, how about I change?
How about you look at me the same?
Hey, how about I change?
How about you love me again?

Hey, how about I change?
How about you look at me the same?
Hey, how about I change?
How about you love me again?

Me again
Me again
Me again
