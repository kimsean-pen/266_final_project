And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go chasing the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the street without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch

Oohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, the time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we've been? Yeah

So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearing my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin

Oohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, the time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been? Yeah

Or will I see you, dear, and wish I could come back?
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see?

Oohoo, the time is getting closer
Oohoo, the time to be a ghost
Oohoo, every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been?

And if I die today
And if I die today
And if I die today
Ah, ah, chasing nuns out in the yard
Ya, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
