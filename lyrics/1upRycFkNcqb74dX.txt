Push me down
I will not crack
You're just a monkey
With your claws in my back
I said it and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like
All I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

Oh, it's like
All I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

Push me down
I will not crack
You're just a monkey
With your claws in my back
I said and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like
All I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

It's alright
