Sadistic society, show me who's your maker
Let me see
Put 'em in front of me
We don't owe you anything
Tell me how to live, what to believe
But I don't owe you anything
Anything, anything, anything

If we don't know anything,
then you're the runner-up in this fucked race
Straggling behind me and everyone fighting for equality
Can't tell us how to live, what to believe
'Cause we don't owe you anything
Anything, anything, anything

What's it like to oppress every living thing?
What's inside of your head?
Fuck racism
Fuck oppression
Fuck hate
Only love
We're all that we have on this earth that won't be here one day
So take that and press on
