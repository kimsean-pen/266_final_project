Now all the secrets of old age
They tell us we should really stop
Now they implore us oh
They should adore us oh

It's been a year and now we find
We're lost behind enemy lines
They're gunning for us oh
They never even met us oh

Now what happened to our heavy metal?
Now what happened to our coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts

And there will be no comfort
For all that we have lost
The actors seemed so happy
But somehow ended all washed up

Now what happened to my heavy metal?
Guess what happened to my coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
