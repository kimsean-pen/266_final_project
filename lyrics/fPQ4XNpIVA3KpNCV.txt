Oh, did I meet me once before?
Was it you or just don't you care?
Once more ignore
As I wrap me around we
I'm never quite there at all

So, which me should I put on
To go out driving in my car?
Feeling so sore
I took me out dancing
Three of me or more
Insane I'm sure
That living inside me
Is several girls galore

Once more
Ignore
As I wrap me around we
I'm never quite there at all
Insane I'm sure
That living in side me
Several girls galore
