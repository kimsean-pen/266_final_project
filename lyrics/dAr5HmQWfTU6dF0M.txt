Gone all my life
Worried about my soul
Brimstone and fire, stories I've been told
Then I saw grace right before my eyes
I should break through those gates
And fall from the sky

I hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no
Hate to say it now, hate to say it now
But, hm

I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that he's wasting his time, oh
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Sins wash away
Dark tuns to light
Your body is a temple so take me inside, oh
I feel no pain, pleasure's all mine
You give me a taste of eternal life

I hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no
Hate to say it now, hate to say it now
But

I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that he's wasting his time, oh
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no
Hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no

I don't really care where I go when I die
You can tell the devil that he's wasting his time, oh
Oh, I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time, oh
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Halle-, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Oh, Hallelujah
'Cause I just found heaven, Hallelujah
(Oh, hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no)
Hallelujah
(Hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no)
Hallelujah
