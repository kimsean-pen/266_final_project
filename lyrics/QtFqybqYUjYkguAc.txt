She's starting to live her life
From the inside out
The sound of failure calls her name
She's decided to hear it out

So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not tryin' to go against all them
'Cause she's too scared and she, she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends
Or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on

Standing there in the graveyard
While the moon sprays its fireworks in your hair
the sound of failure calls her name
She's decided to hear it out

So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not tryin' to go against all them
'Cause she's too scared and she, she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends
Or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let it go on, let it go on

Where it begins or ends
Or what it's means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let it go on, let it go on

Where it begins or ends
Or what it's means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let it go on, let it go on

Where it begins or ends
Or what it's means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let it go on, let it go on

She's going on, where it will be taken
And she's going into the unknown
