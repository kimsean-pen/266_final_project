I have never felt as empty as I feel today
Even when the moment's beauty fades in and away.
That's all it is. A moment.
And the images creep back into the forefront of my brain
From picking up the pieces of unearthing devotion. Re-energizing dead feelings.

I can see the flowers growing out of your mouth
while the cancer in your brain begs to get out.
And i'll try to understand (your) pain again
by laying my body on the fire
by accepting myself as the enemy
It doesn't take much to recognize that these leeches aren't my friends
and it gets harder when everything goes through a formula filter (your head)
Erase the ones I love the most so I can bleed in peace.
Relieve the poison from my tongue.
Embrace a reverie.
