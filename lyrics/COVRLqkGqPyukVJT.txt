Open all the windows
Clear away the floor
Look into the future now
And all that went before

For love
All of the above
Tell them that you love them
Take them by the hand
Teach them how to love
And show them how to understand
This life
Cause you only have one chance

Cause all of the places you've been
Are hidden now
And all of the faces you've seen
Are going down

Pick another villain
Bring me more bad news
Open up the Daily Mail
And it's enough to lose your mind
Uh well. I've had it up to here

Cause all of the places you've been
Are hidden now
And all of the faces you've seen
Are going down

England's asleep
But I'm still wide awake
Be that as it may
I close my eyes

Cause all of the places you've been
Are hidden now
And all of the faces you've seen
Are going down
