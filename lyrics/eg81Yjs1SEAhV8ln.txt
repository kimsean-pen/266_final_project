They say that you've come to end the sadness and pain
A barer of light to the darkness that reigns
Destroyer of fear and the war of man
To live forever just take my hand

Take these eyes so I can see
Are you just a story in a book for us to read?
I wanna believe

They say that you heal the sick, breathe life to the dead
You've come to save us all, so they have said
Destroyer of fear and the war of man
To live forever just take my hand

Take these eyes so I can see
Are you just a story in a book for us to read?
Are you God or just another man that bleeds?
Please tell me there's a heaven that awaits
I wanna believe
I wanna believe

Take these eyes so I can see
Are you just a story in a book for us to read?
Are you God or just another man that bleeds?
Please tell me there's a heaven that awaits
I wanna believe
I wanna believe
I wanna believe
