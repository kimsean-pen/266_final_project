Salute it more
o thee great misery
long pass deceased
has reborn
Misleads your path
as you running
chase the trails of misfortune

As they left you haunting
it's darkest tragedy
as louder you cry
through all the times repeatedly
still louder they cry
tarnish they betray the hearts
the curse written in my scars

It holds you
it's sinking fast
plain rot
within my core
blindfold and punished
there after seam
harbing your requiem

This paralyzing glow
seduce us to abhorrence
