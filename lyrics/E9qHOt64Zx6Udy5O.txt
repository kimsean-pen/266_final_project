You sound tired on the phone
It's fair enough, it's been a while since you've been home
You say the smile on your face is gone beyond the realms of pretend
It's clear to me, you've reached your limit once again

Oh, sometimes
You get a little teary 'cause you were sick of feeling
That all your time
Is waiting to be weighted by something you were missing

You take off at Cape Canaveral
And pick me up like coach Bombay
You're school captain every year
Christmas without Boxing Day
You haven't had a day off in weeks
Your voice is shaking when you speak
It might not be my place to help
But don't, but don't, but don't
Be so hard on yourself

You don't do anything by halves
Don't change, because I've known that from the start
You say that things are spinning around and around
And you've lost control and you need to slow down
It's clear to me that you were ready for the end

Oh, sometimes
You get a little teary 'cause you were sick of feeling
That all your time
Is waiting to be weighted by something you were missing

You take off at Cape Canaveral
And pick me up like coach Bombay
You're school captain every year
Christmas without Boxing Day
You haven't had a day off in weeks
Your voice is shaking when you speak
It might not be my place to help
But don't, but don't, but don't
Be so hard on yourself

No regrets when you get old
'cause you won't stop til the stars turn gold
You want things done by yesterday
A force of nature everywhere
Don't always have to grin and bear
And even when you're far away

You take off at Cape Canaveral
And pick me up like coach Bombay
You're school captain every year
In Christmas without Boxing Day
You haven't had a day off in weeks
Your voice is shaking when you speak
It might not be my place to help
But don't, but don't, but don't
Be so hard on yourself

Don't be so hard on yourself
Don't be so hard on yourself
Don't be so hard on yourself
But don't, but don't
Be so hard on yourself

Don't be so hard on yourself
Don't be so hard on yourself
Don't be so hard on yourself
But don't, but don't
Be so hard on yourself
