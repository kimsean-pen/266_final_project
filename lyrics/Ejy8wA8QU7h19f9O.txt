Eight times of fel-an-fo-fi
Like cobalt cast and clean
I got a mojo felt the wheel
Real fashion feel
Tri-Jack it, black it for more
Handcuffs with special keys
Triple locked and been down defiled
It's a V. S. I.

Throw a case of plasticine down
Baby I can immolate
And it's rotten in my rounds
Sister's in my way
I'm as fast as my home town
Green glass it most of all
Been around this foreign cage
Villiage in the wall.
