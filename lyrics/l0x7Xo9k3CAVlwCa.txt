Dr. heckyll works late at the laboratory
where things are not as they seem
dr. heckyll wishes nothing more desperately
than to fulfill his dreams
letting loose with a scream in the dead of night
as he's breaking new ground
trying his best to unlock all the secrets
but he's not sure what he's found
Dr. heckyll is his own little guinea pig
'cos they all think he's mad
sets his sights on the search of a lifetime
and he's never, never sad
Whoa oh, its off to work he goes
in the name of science and all its wonders
This is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
they are a person who feels good to be alive
this is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
believes the underdog will eventually survive
Not long now till the ultimate experiment
he's breaking all the rules
he wants to cure all matter of imbalance
in this world of fools
He locks the door and looks around nervously
he knows there's no one there
he drinks it down and waits for some reaction
to all his work and care
Hey, hey he fumbles for what to say
he loves the world except for all the people
This is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
they are a person who feels good to be alive
this is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
believes the underdog will eventually survive
Whoa, oh, its out at night he goes
he sips easily into conversation
hey hey, he's cool in every way
sometimes he likes to sing that old black magic
This is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
they are a person who feels good to be alive
this is the story of dr. heckyll and mr. jive
believes the underdog will eventually survive
