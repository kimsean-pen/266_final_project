Eternity hangs heavy
A pendulum swings
The Deep Bell rings low
Through the void's mournful throat
The Deep Bell rings low
Head hung heavier still

Though, the inner scale, it denies a full tilt
My body screams through the static
The mind buckles, frantic
And the burning tears cascade, thunder below

Forged in the blackest reaches of irony
In front of me dangles the key
My body screams through the static
In front of me dangles the key

But through the dust a blossom breeze caresses my cheek
A hand of winter dream and purest ivory
Tears and dust run as the Styx beneath my feet
I feel the crystal ice voice whisper and repeat

"The Gate has opened
A passage for the weary
And a bed for the weak"

And I weep

It hangs so heavy, eternity
I lack the strength to rise from my knees

An echo rings in the silence
A narrow of the eye

Eternity hangs heavy
And so do I

I weep
With the Styx beneath my feet
The cold breeze
It whispers and repeats
"The Gate is open
Rest your weary feet
I weep
While the Styx, it runs beneath
