Three one seven seven
I'm alone again
No one here to be my friend
I said please son
Tell 'em tell 'em
Now my love is gone
No one here to warm my bones

I'm gonna take you to eleventh floor
I'm gonna show you off and ask for more
Bugs are trying to get in my room
We'll be dancing if you sing in tune

Shush, you're waking up the clock
No time for us
No stopping us
They'll wake us up at dark

Don't tell me what to do
Sipping' on my

Three one seven seven
I'm alone again
No one here to be my friend
I said please son
Tell 'em tell 'em
Now my love is gone
No one here

I'm lost in translation
I need my mates in
It's horrific
It's making me sick
It's making me

It's making me

Shush, you're waking up the clock
Oh oh
No time for us
No stopping us
They'll wake us up at dark
Oh oh
There's no drugs in my jam
Sit down on the chair now ma'am
Don't tell me what to do
Sipping' on my

Three one seven seven
I'm alone again
No one here to be my friend

Tell 'em tell 'em
Now my love is gone
No one here

I'm lost in translation
I need my mates in
It's horrific
It's making me sick
It's making me
A freak of creation
God give me patience
It's horrific
It's making me sick
It's making me

I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you
While I'm wide awake
In the daylight
In the daylight

I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you
While I'm wide awake
In the daylight
In the daylight

I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you
Of you
Of you
Of you

I'm lost in translation
I need my mates in
It's horrific
It's making me sick
It's making me
A freak of creation
God give me patience
It's horrific
It's making me sick
It's making me
Day time dreaming of you
