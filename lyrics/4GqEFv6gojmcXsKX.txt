Can you help me out can you lend me a hand
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right

A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more

Something more
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine

With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's gonna rain for days and days
I feel it's gonna rain
I tried to figure out I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth and the consequence

Nothing's real nothing's making sense
A thousand times before

I've wondered if there's something more
Something more
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away

I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this

Rain like this
Rain like this
Fall down
Wash away my yesterdays

Fall down
So let the rain fall down on me
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
Let it rain down and wash everything away

I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this
Rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's gonna rain this
Rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's gonna rain like this
I feel it's gonna rain
