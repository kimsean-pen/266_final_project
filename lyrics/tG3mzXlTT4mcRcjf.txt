Into the whirlpool
Where matter vanishes
Degenerate star
Arm of Orion
An iron sun
The forbidden circle
Anti-matter is the
Black horizon

CHORUS
Heavy metal
Black and silver
Fallen matter
Of the Sun
Pours itself
Into a place
Where there was never
Never one

By starlight
The heaviest will rise up
Magnetic mirror
Scattered bodies slow
All chaos of matter
River of fire
A night sea crossing
The cosmic fluid flows

CHORUS

Fallen matter
From the cross
Freedom
That was never lost
Beyond being
Will be coming
Beyond time
Space and control

Direction (starlight)
Creation (starbright)
Foundation (we forged the Einstein bridge tonight)
Spans a river (starlight)
We call time (starbright)
World (light of darkness)
Without end (light of light)

Heavy metal
Black and silver
Fallen matter
Of the Sun
Pours itself
Into a place
Where there was never, never, never
Never one
