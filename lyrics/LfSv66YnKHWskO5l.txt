The towers that shoulder your pride
The words you've written in stone
Sand will cover them
Sand will cover you
The streets that suffer your name
Your very flesh and your bones
Sand will cover them
Sand will cover you

So put your faith
In more than steel
Don't store your treasures up
With moth and rust where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs
From out your heel
Oh we live in but a shadow of the real

Step out from time
Breathe the dust of nations
Step out from time
Hear the stars' ovation

Saturn will not sleep until
The sand has made us clean
Still we stack our stones and bury what we can
But it all will be undone
And nothing built under the Sun
Will ever stand before the endless march of sand

So put your faith
In more than steel
Don't store your treasures up
With moth and rust where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs
From out your heel
Oh we live in but a shadow of the real

So put your faith
In more than steel
Don't store your treasures up
With moth and rust where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs
From out your heel
Oh we live in but a shadow of the real.
