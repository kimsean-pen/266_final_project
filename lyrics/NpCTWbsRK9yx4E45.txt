Can I tell you everything?
All I ever wanted was to be interesting
You say you don't mind
Riddle me one more time

I'm boring, no fun at all
I've put my head right through the wall
I try to make myself feel
No luck this time, I'll try again next year

I've led myself to believe
The world has turned its back on me
How's that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting

Sorry if you don't see me
As much as you deem necessary
You say you're there for your friends
Did you lie or just pretend?

I never wanted sympathy
Just wanted to be something
I never wanted sympathy
Just wanted to be something
I never wanted sympathy
Just wanted to be something
I never wanted sympathy
Just wanted to be something

I've led myself to believe
The world has turned its back on me
How's that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting
