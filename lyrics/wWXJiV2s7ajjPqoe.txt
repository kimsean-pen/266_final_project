You are a chime in Memphis
We cannot reply,
you said that it's sad But it's right
It's a crude fail in white
I've begun to realize
How the entrance maturely identifies

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh From the time
you have solely been here Slowly remote your face up.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Meet my rags,
they flutter away Gonna be a robber

(Post-) You feel more,
I've got You see more,
I've got You stay more,
I've got Real June, I've taken you behind

We got out of the car
In the graveyard
I fell further from death
Than we had in our heart
Poor fortune seem impaled
But you move swift with the fall
But the actress maturely identifies () (Post-)
