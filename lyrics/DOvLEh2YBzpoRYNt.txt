Wait there, just enough to see you smile.
I mixed up the distance of the miracle mile.

You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love

Just stand there, you could never make me go through it.
The congas, they're bleeding through his bit-battle wounds

You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love

Whip me, but don't beat me.
I can't can't call?
I can't can't call?
You never left?

The sun beats down upon the brain of confusion?
But houses seems much better if the roof is connected.

You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love
You could never publish my love

Whip me, but don't beat me.
Yeah, i can't cat fall?
A cat cat call?
You never left.
A cat cat call.
A cat cat call.
A cat cat call
