I think about you
Every day and every night
What can I do?
You're always on my mind

Every night and every day
Fuck this shit
I'm running late
I'm running late
Why the fuck is she kissing you and not I?
Why the fuck is she kissing you and not I?

I don't know what else can I do
But think of you
You're always on my mind
And I don't know what else can I do
If you're not here
If you're not here

I don't know what else can I do
But think of you
You're always on my mind
And I don't know what else can I do
If you're not here
If you're not here

I don't know what else can I do
But think of you
You're always on my mind
And I don't know what else can I do
If you're not here
If you're not here

I don't know what else can I do
But think of you
You're always on my mind
And I don't know what else can I do
If you're not here
If you're not here
