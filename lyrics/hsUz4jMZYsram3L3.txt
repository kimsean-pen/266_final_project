Looking back I knew somebody who
A destiny to death was all he knew
Paced around the room and ate his hand
Chased no demon till the sky was red

I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness
I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness

Following a ghost over a lake
Checking all the bones under its flesh
Late, when all the shadows wore a dream
I see him now but don't recall a thing

Now that I've seen how you've changed
I know no way you'd have it the same
Oh no, now that I've seen how you've changed
I know no way you'd have it the same
Oh no

I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness
I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness

Looking back I knew somebody who
A destiny to death was all he knew
Late, when all the shadows wore a dream
I see him now and know it wasn't me

I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness
I wouldn't have it again
My way is an eveningness
I wouldn't go there again
My day is an eveningness
