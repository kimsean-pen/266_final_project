Ain't it sad when you miss a closing door
Turn around, have to wait for something more
Dum da da da da dum

Gets me mad that I left it all to late
Swept in the breeze, now I watch it drift away
Dum da da da dum

So you can find me, in the tallest building in the tallest city
And I'll build a ladder to the rooftops
I'm screaming from my lungs
I'm sorry, I messed up

So darling won't you stay here?
I promise I can change
And darling if you stay here
It won't be a mistake
I know every conversation
It always ends the same
So darling if you stay here
I'll find the words I couldn't say
But only if you stay
Truth been told, I'm a mess when you're away

And I'm afraid you make me pay for my mistakes
Dum dada dada dadum
See you can find me
The tallest building in the tallest city
And I will build a ladder to the rooftops
Screaming from my lungs
I'm sorry, I messed up
So darling won't you stay here?
I promise I can change
And darling if you stay here
It won't be a mistake
And we can hide under the duvet
And time will have to wait
And you can wear my favorite t-shirt
And we can waste away the days
But only if you stay

Cutting ties and moments just fade away
(Only if you stay)
Just miles forever we might fade away
(Only if you stay here)
Still, hope to live for another day
(Oh baby please just stay here)
But I'll stay asking for you to stay
(I'm asking you to stay)
Cutting ties and moments just fade away
(I'm asking you to stay)
Just miles forever we might fade away
(Oh and darling won't you stay?)
Still, hope to live for another day
(And tell me that you'll stay)
But I'll stay asking for you to stay
So darling won't you stay here?
I'm asking you to wait
And darling if you stay here
I promise I can change
