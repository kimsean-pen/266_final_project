Dear darkness, dear darkness
Won't you cover, cover me again
Dear darkness, dear
I've been your friend for many years

Won't you do this for me, dearest darkness
And cover me from the sun
And though the words tightening
The words are tightening around my throat and, and

Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening
Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening

Dear darkness, dear darkness
Now it's your time to look after us
'Cause we kept your clothes, we kept your business
When everyone else was having good luck

So now it's your time, time to pay
To pay me and the one I love
With the wordly goods you stashed away
With all the things you took from us
