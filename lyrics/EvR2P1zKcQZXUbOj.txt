Since it means so much to you...

Yeah...
Yeah...

Hollywood Hills, pocket full of shells
Sunset drag and I haven't even slept all day
Zone in, something's gotta give
Might as well live it up until the fat lady sings

You want it, you got it
It's everything you dreamed

Cause I just wanna be famous
Be so fuckin jaded
Cause all the Playboy bunnies take my money from me
Show up at the Oscars
Smoke out Dennis Hopper
The money is for nothing and the chicks are for free
Yeah, I wanna be
fa fa fa famous

We sleep all day, and still get paid
When the sun goes down, we'll do it all over again
Cause when you're on a roll, they gotta let you go
Right through the back door
Let the games begin

You want it, you got it
It's everything you dreamed

Cause I just wanna be famous
Be so fuckin jaded
Cause all the Playboy bunnies take my money from me
Show up at the Oscars
Smoke out Dennis Hopper
The money is for nothing and the chicks are for free
Yeah, I wanna be
fa fa fa famous

I hope that it's everything that you dreamed about
Be careful what you wish for
Hope that it's everything that you dreamed
When everything's falling apart at the seams
And I know that you never believed in me
Don't ever let 'em fuck with your dreams, yeah...

(Since it means so much to you...)
You want it, you got it
It's everything you dreamed

Cause I just wanna be famous
Be so fuckin' jaded
Cause all the Playboy bunnies take my money from me
Show up at the Oscars
Smoke out Dennis Hopper
The money is for nothing and the chicks are for free
I just wanna be famous
Cause fame is contagious
Now all the playboy bunnies want more money from me
Show up at the Grammys
So loaded they ban me
The money is for nothing and the chicks are for free
Yeah... I wanna be... fa fa fa Famous
Yeah... I wanna be... fa fa fa Famous
