It feels like better days have passed
And I'm not betting being better or the best
Would bring us back

How long have we been in this hold?
We were gonna grow old together
But now we're just growing old

I tried, I tried
Yeah
I tried, I tried

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Love
We try and we try
So hard, always
And we try, we try
So

It feels like better days have passed
We turned and we burned everything that we had from a blaze to an ash
Why can't we go back?

I tried, I tried
Yeah
I tried, I tried

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Love
We try and we try
So hard, always
And we try, we try
So hard
Hard

We tried so hard
We tried so hard

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still hurting
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love
With you
