Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
'Cause I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love her until eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us, her heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Hey Cupid, Cupid, Cupid
