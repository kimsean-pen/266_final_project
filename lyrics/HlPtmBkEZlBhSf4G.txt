We live our lives while others die
Our hands are clean while conscience cries
Illuminate these shadowed lives

This is the end of reason
This is the fall of all I know
And if this is the end then let me speak before I go
No angels, no savior. Your pain will last forevermore.
So here we stand, knowing who we are

Ohhh Ohhh
These dreams will last forever/Tell them

We live on the edge of meaning
Between. But now we've gone too far.
And if this what we are then let them know the truth.
No angels, no savior, no one to fight each other for.
So here we stand, knowing who we are.

Ohhh Ohh
These dreams will last forever/Tell them
We march
