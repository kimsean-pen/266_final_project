Baby, I been wantin' more
of that love you give
ooh it hurts to be wrong
And
Baby, I'm gonna need the doctors care
to help me through the night
Look what you done

I don't know but i been told
the world outside is oh so cold
late at night when you're alone
do you think about me now that i'm gone
when i'm on the road I often dream and think of you girl
I hope that you do too

We don't gotta work it out
cause no one gonna tell you where to find me
when you, you come looking for me
cause i'll be walkin' on the door before you know it
and you better believe

Baby I'm gonna even the score
cause you been givin' that love

And

to get you through the night oh

I don't know but i been told
the world outside is oh so cold
late at night when you're alone
do you think about me now that i'm gone
when i'm on the road I often dream and think of you girl
I hope that you do too

We don't gotta work it out
cause no one gonna tell you where to find me
when you, you come looking for me
cause i'll be walkin' on the door before you know it
and you better believe

We don't gotta work it out
