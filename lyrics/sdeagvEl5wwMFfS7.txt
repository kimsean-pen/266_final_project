If you ever wanna call me from LA,
i will simply tell you that i'm on my way.
I can't handle hearing from you everyday.
I'm just glad your lovers trying to be ok.
ahh ahh
you will never call me 'cos your never there,
I can finally see that you where never there.
If you ever call again, I'll have to tell you, I can't be your friend.
ahh ahh
ohhhhhhh ohhhh ohh oh
Driving 'round for hours, seaching for a clue.
waiting to tell you i can't ever be with you.
so run back to her love, because it's over now.
Safe to say baby never comes around.
