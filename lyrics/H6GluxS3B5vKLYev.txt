I see you lying there in my bed
just looking at you make me
go out of my head
I know that it's the last time
god, I wish that I could make you mine
and I'm thinking it's you inside of me

I see you lying there in my bed
you kiss my cheek and
you scratch my leg
you might have the softest skink on earth
I want to touch you so take of your shirt
and I'm thinking it's you inside if me

it's you inside of me
