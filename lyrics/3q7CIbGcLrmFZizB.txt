She's got her own trajectory
She leaves my heart eleven degrees
I see her eyes reflecting me
I see her lifestyle affecting me

When I go 'round
I lose a night
She tends to obfuscate
When it's black and white
It's like she puts love to the back of her mind
Then rips it out again
When she's back at mine

She says "oxygen's overrated
I don't even need to breathe"
She's got a tank full of highs and a mind that never sleeps

I loved you then
I love you now
So make me laugh
For an hour
Then rip me off
High as a cloud
And leave that taste
In my mouth

She says "oxygen's overrated
I don't even need to breathe"
She's got a tank full of highs
And a mind that never sleeps
"Oxygen's overrated
I don't even need to breathe"
She's got a tank full of highs
And a mind
That never
Sleeps

She says "oxygen's overrated
I don't even need to breathe"
I've got a tank full of highs
And a mind that never sleeps"
"Oxygen's overrated
I don't even need to breathe"
She's got a tank full of highs
And a mind that never sleeps
