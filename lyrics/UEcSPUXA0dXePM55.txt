what would it mean to live a life that wasn't like this? (thats the question)
look at a picture of my father and i look just like him (thats what i'm asking)
to think about my home and not just feel the sting of a history thats brewed in a soul
what would it mean to live a life that wasn't like this?
when i was 5 what was happening in my life?
and who's to pry, when everyone(s) talking/stands up and no-ones crying, now i weep
for every s__, what was happening in my life
and now i know, i was happy then, happy just helping my folks survive
but in my sight, my sight, my sight
ohh whats happening?
every day to feel your grave
ohh whats happening?
every day to see your pride
ohh whats happening?
everyday that i was insane
when i think about it
you should pay for what you did
but i really cant commit to... the
living with the stress
character
and you â€” have a baby
and you seem to be too busy
maybe
when i think about it
its like theres just this weight down on my chest
and its like theres no air
no air, no air
we're wanted every day
and i wait
for snow
they're waiting for you to sow my fate to shore
you gotta show me
that i wasn't in any pain and my plans were flawed
air, no air, no air
we're wanted every day
and i wait
for snow
they're waiting for you to sow my fate to shore
you gotta show me
that i wasn't in any pain and my plans were flawed
