I don't wanna argue
Please baby not tonight
With you in that dress
And me in this mess

You look beautiful tonight
And the music is alright
I'm sorry i was late
Please baby won't you stay

One Night, One Night
One Night i'll be dancing by myself

I came here to ask you
If you really like this song
I wanna have this dance
Start a new romance

You know what I'm saying'
When i don't even say a word
You do it all the time
Know how to blow my mind

One Night,
We'll be together
One Night
We'll last forever
One night i'll be dancing by myself
