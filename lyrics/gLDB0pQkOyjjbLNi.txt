Drop dead legs, pretty smile
Hurts my head, gets me wild
Dig that steam, giant butt
Makes me scream, I get nuh-nuh-nothing
but the shakes over you (drop dead)
And nothing else could ever do

Baby
(You know that you want it)
I know what you need
(You know that you want it)
Baby
(When the night is through, will I still be loving you)

Dig those moves, vampire
Set me loose, get it higher
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop
Nice white teeth, Betty Boop
Set it cool, real heavy
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready

Baby
(You know that you want it)
I know what you need
(You know that you want it)
Baby
(When the night is through, will I still be loving you)
