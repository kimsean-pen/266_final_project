I sit and wait for you cause' this was never over
I hear the talk in codes
If you want me then come get me
You want me so come get me
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' arms to strangers
Watch them shoot ya down

There aint nothin' I will say to you
But I know your eyes are fearin'
I watch as you creep by
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'll find my way, wont let go
I'm standing with my allies
Sellin' guns to strangers
Still dont let me sin
