Late this afternoon I heard your voice
It was the first time in what felt like years
It was a whisper in my ears and then the wind in the trees
It was the shaking of leaves that shook the streets while shaking me

Late this afternoon I heard your voice
I got hit for the first time in what felt like years
It struck me down a harmless jab at you while you rang loud and clear
You tore down the walls
Just as quickly you were gone

The New Haven expose
Must've heard me call us off
Must've heard my brief applause
Must've heard my disbelief

The New Haven expose
Confirmed they caught a killer
Well I caught a chill
When the newsprint said the gunman was nineteen

Late this afternoon I heard your voice
It was the first time in what felt like years
