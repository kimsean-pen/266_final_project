I have to forget, push things from my head
I've got to leave that past of blood 'nd tears
My brain... injected, information... infected
I'm absorbed lost in my storm
I've got to stop and clear my conscience
I've got to look for another direction
My arms... out stretched, my hands... touch nothing
I'm absorbed by the fog of my lies
You're out there... somewhere
Outside getting on with life
I'm in here... nowhere
Inside looking for a key
So what can I do to find myself
Which way is right, which way is left
Direction undiscovered, my body exhausted
I'm absorbed totally confused
