It's alright to cry
It's alright to lean on everyone
It's alright to lie in the bed you've made for everyone

And anytime you need someone,
Anytime you heed someone
Anytime you need me babe, I will be there.

It's alright to die
It's alright to bleed on everyone
It's alright this time
It's all life, you learn from everyone

With every single time you go
...And every single line you blow
Anytime you need it man, I won't be there

(inside the picture of the huge, sterile black and white diner on a rainy Sunday afternoon in chinatown)

It's all going away now
...All going away now
Going, going... gone
Going, going... gone

It's alright to cry
It's alright to feed on everyone
It's alright to hide,
In your cozy bed from everyone

So if you ever you need it man,
Get inside and be it man...
Anytime you call,
Suffer!
