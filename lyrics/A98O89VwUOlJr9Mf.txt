The taste of it sits on my lips
Triggering flashes from when I was a kid
Of the smells of things that scared me
In my bed at night
Sister asked you to stop smoking
Six years went by

Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking

I lost something in my parent's house
Some old stranger wanders through my bedroom at night
Wishing something, nice things
Anything now I'll get over
Think about how I'm scared of growing

Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
Now she's smoking
Now I'm smoking
