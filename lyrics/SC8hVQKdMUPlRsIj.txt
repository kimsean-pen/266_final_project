Sink or swim, hold your breath and just dive right in
Ride the wave, just ride the wave far from where we came
Don't be scared, who cares if we lose again?
Let it out; don't let doubt ever have its day
Down and out, don't throw the towel we can win this race

Don't be scared, who cares if we lose again?
I'll be there; I'll be there with you till the end

I know I'll be holding onto you for dear life
Holding onto you for dear life I will
You know, I'll be holding onto you for dear life
Holding onto you for dear life I will

Sing to me; make me feel like the only one
Bring to me, and I'll bring to you everything you want

Don't be scared, no who cares if we lose again
I'll be there no, I'll be there with you till the end

And I know I'll be holding onto you for dear life
Holding onto you for dear life I will
And I know I'll be holding onto you for dear life
Holding onto you for dear life I will
I know you'll be holding onto me for dear life
Holding onto me for dear life I know
You'll be holding onto me for dear life
Holding onto me for dear life I know
Sink or swim, hold your breath and just dive right in
