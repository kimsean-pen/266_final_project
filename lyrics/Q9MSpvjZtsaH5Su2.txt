With each breath, with each step
I fall a little further from the plans that I have laid
With each breath, with each step
I feel a little smaller in the bed that I have made

People will hate you shake you break you
Standing firm will make you
Unstoppable!

When we stumble when we fall
When there's nothing left at all
We get up, we get up, we get up again
We get up, we get up, we get up again

With each breath, with each step
I fly a little closer to the ledge from where I fled
With each breath, with each step
I feel a little closure from the life that I have led

People will hate you shake you break you
Standing firm will make you
Unstoppable!

When we stumble when we fall
When there's nothing left at all
We get up, we get up, we get up again
We get up, we get up, we get up again

When the world is caving in
When your skin is wearing thin
We get up, we get up, we get up again
We get up, we get up, we get up again

And now I know how much I can take
How my bones bend and crack before they break
How long the night lasts before the day
How far I need to walk around the world
Before I start back again!

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
And you won't fear death any longer
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
And you won't fear death any longer

People will hate you shake you break you
Standing firm will make you
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!

When we stumble when we fall
When there's nothing left at all
We get up, we get up, we get up again
We get up, we get up, we get up again

When the world is caving in
When your skin is wearing thin
We get up, we get up, we get up again
We get up, we get up, we get up again
