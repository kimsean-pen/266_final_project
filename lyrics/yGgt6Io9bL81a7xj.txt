I'm already looking back
I'm already looking 'round
Where did we get off the track
What was it that brought us down

I'm already waking up
Have I been asleep too long
Losing you was hard enough
Not knowing anything was wrong

Changes come but where they go?
You'll never know

Just another day like any other
Nothing in the sky said run for cover
Just another reason never thought it would end this way
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No song to sing along the way
There was no parade

Thought it were supposed to last
You were never supposed to be
Just somebody in the past
Somebody I used to see

Trouble crept up on us
Warning never came a time
Before I knew it we were dust
Just left behind, left behind

Changes come but where they go?
You'll never know

Just another day like any other
Nothing in the sky said run for cover
Just another reason never thought it would end this way
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No song to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around for days
There was no parade

And after all the noise I never heard our last goodbye
It was sudden as a butterfly
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No song to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around for days
There was no parade
