I woke up with your dress on
We had too much fun last night
It's the first time in a very long time
That a beautiful thought comes to mind

I put a blanket over my face
I put a blanket over my face

Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

Six dollars and cheap vodka
Was that all it took to unlock
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets

Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets

When I was fifteen years old
I would dream of someone who looked like you
Ten years of secrets
And smelled like you
Ten years of secrets
And talked like you
Ten years of secrets

I put a blanket over my face
I put a blanket over my face

Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face
Shoot the sun down
I put a blanket over my face

Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
Ten years of secrets
