We're wasting precious time!
The clock is ticking
Can you hear the countdown?

With every hour
Give me the power!
I need the strength to carry on
On and on!

No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!
Born to die!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!

Never before, never again!
Behold this travesty!
Never before, never again!
Behold adversary!

Never before, never again!
Behold this travesty!
Never before, never again!
Behold adversary!

Befriend my enemies!
My pulse is racing
I can hear my heartbeat!

Is this the last time
You get to be mine?
I lack the will to carry on
On and on!

No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!
Born to die!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!

Never before, never again!
Behold this travesty!
Never before, never again!
Behold adversary!

Never before, never again!
Behold this travesty!
Never before, never again!

Behold adversary!
No more sorrow, no tomorrow!

I never felt alive before!
Yeah!
With every hour
Give me the power!
I need the strength to carry on

On and on!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!
Born to die!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!
Born to die!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
We're all born to die!
Born to die!
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die!
To die!
To die!
To DIE!
OHH!!
