There, out in the darkness,
a fugitive running.
Fallen from God.
Fallen from Grace,
God be my witness.
I never shall yield
'Till we come face to face,
'Till we come face to face.

He knows his way in the dark.
Mine is the way of the Lord.
Those who follow the path of the righteous
shall have their reward.
And if they fall as Lucifer fell,
The flames
The sword!

Stars,
In your multitudes,
scarce to be counted;
Filling the darkness
with order and light!
You are the sentinels.
Silent and sure,
keeping watch in the night,
keeping watch in the night.

You know your place in the sky.
You hold your course and your aim,
and each in your season
returns and returns,
and is always the same.
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame!

And so it must be, for so it is written,
on the doorway to paradise,
that those who falter and those who fall
must pay the price!

Lord, let me find him,
that I may see him
safe behind bars!
I will never rest
till then,
this I swear!
This I swear by the stars!
