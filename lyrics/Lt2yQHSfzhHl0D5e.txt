Understand, you'll never be
What they expect
It's out of reach
You're not the kind
To reach that high
It's nothing like you had in mind

Another act
Another show you play
Realize, it will not make your problems go away
You cannot act your way out of your daily demise
Get real today
To hell, just go away
Go away

Understand, the road ahead
Is full of gaps
Gets harder yet
You're not the kind
To lead us blind
It's nothing like you had in mind

Another act
Another show you play
Realize, it will not make your problems go away
You cannot act your way out of your daily demise
Get real today
To hell, just go away

Another act
Another show you play
Realize, it will not make your problems go away
You cannot act your way out of your daily demise
Get real today
To hell, just go away
Go away
