What good is a bullet with no gun?
What good is a flower without no sun?
Oh, but I wanna feel something real
What good is a light with no dark?
What good is a king without a cross?
Oh, but I wanna feel something real

Is that river wide, is that river deep?
Let me sanctify, let me sanctify you, baby
Is there a right when all is wrong?
Is there a partner when left all alone?
Oh, but I wanna feel something real

Oh, let me sanctify
Oh, I wanna, I wanna sanctify

Is that river deep, is it deep, oh, is it deep?
