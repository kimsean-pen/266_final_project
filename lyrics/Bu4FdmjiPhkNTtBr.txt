The cold reality of this
Is the safety bar just slipped
But still we held on
While the panic settled in

You've got your demons
You've got your daggers
I've got a feeling
It doesn't matter (It doesn't matter)
We both know how this goes

Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost

I can see where you call the end
Over and over
'Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off

I sold my soul to write this rhyme
In a frantic state of mind
Took you for granted
Left you on the sidelines
I'm not a saint
You're not either
You're the pain
You're the fever (you're the fever)
We both know how this goes

Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost

I can see where you call the end
Over and over
'Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off

It's not what we pictured
Not what we planned
There weren't no exceptions
So lets start it over

I can't protect you
If you're jumping ship
But we were perfection
Lets start all over again

Lets start all over again

Up and down again
Like a rollercoaster
I would love to show you
Not all hope is lost

I can see where you call the end
Over and over
'Cause the best part of me
Is when you get off

You're the best part of me
