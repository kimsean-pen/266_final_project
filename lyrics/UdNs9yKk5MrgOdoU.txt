Words fail me all the time
I don't even feel like talking
still I go on and on
I'm dying here and you keep walking

why are you asking me this?
can't you see I'm trying?
I don't like it like this
no I think I'm dying

I can't calm down at all
panic is what panic feels like
can't we just stay silent?
speaking now seems far too violent

why are you asking me this?
can't you see I'm trying?
I don't like it like this
no I think I'm dying
