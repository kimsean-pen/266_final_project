Look into my eyes, let them hypnotize
These eyes long to make you a perfect work of art

Fall in love with me only then you'll see
What these eyes have been planning for you

You lift my heart when I fly, good morning, good night
It's a brave new world calling, a lover's fantasy

Look into my eyes, fall in love with me
And we'll both watch the sun kiss the sea

Fall in love with he, cross the golden sand
There's a road winding up into sun rays
There's a staircase winding down

Think of all the heavens that you've found
May our love be so bright and so true
May our love be so brave and so true.
