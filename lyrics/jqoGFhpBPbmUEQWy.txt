When I see you again
I'll never let you go
When I see you again
Tell me what you know

I have been waiting for months
To hear your voice once more
God only knows
What you left us for (what you left us for)

And oh I got caught in the memories of us
Every simple heart would trust
And our words are drenched in dust

Oh and my walls are covered in your name
Every breath is taken in pain
And I'll never hear you speak again (speak again)

I should have been
your protection oh protection oh
I should have seen
your direction oh direction oh

you didn't have to disappear
I know how much it hurts
with everything, we could have been
and everything we were

and I should have been
your protection oh protection oh

I keep thinking of you
Without you I am bare
You're the reason I'm still here
And now you're gone
I can't move on
Things just don't seem clear
