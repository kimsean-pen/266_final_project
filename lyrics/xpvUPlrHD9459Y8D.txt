The common tribulation when the darling will reveal the truth
You found your congregation but your proselyte deserted you
Preaching for atonement and redeeming for the agony
Fickle siren's song was misleading us in vanity

Desolate the wasteland your kingdom has abandoned you
Praying for the ashes to mediate between us two
Inner admiration of a living the unearthly
