Tell her a story
Tell her the honest truth
You treat her better
Make sure to see it through
Don't be just everything she wants
Be everything she needs

When she says she loves you
Tell her you love her too

Give her a reason
A reason to love all you do
She'll tell you secrets
You'll tell her secrets too
She'll tell you all her hopes and dreams
You'll tell them too

When she says she loves you
Tell her you love her too
Tell her you love her too
But don't you run away, run away
When you get tired
'Cause this will slip away, slip away
And start a fire
That can never be put out
Oh, hurry time is running out

But don't you run away, run away
Before you tell her you love her
When she says she needs you
Tell her you need her too
You tell her clearly
Speak what your heart wants you to
Tell her she's lovely
Always tell her the truth

When she says she loves you
Tell her you love her too
But don't you run away, run away
When you get tired
'Cause this will slip away, slip away
And start a fire
That can never be put out
Oh, hurry time is running out
But don't you run away, run away
Before you tell her you love her
