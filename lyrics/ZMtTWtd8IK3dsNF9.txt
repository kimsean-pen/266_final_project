Felonius my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that you're here again
For one more time
Let your madness run with mine
Streets still unseen we'll find somehow
No time is better than now

Tell me where are driving
Midnite cruiser
Where is your bounty
Of fortune and fame
I am another
Gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlen
Or somewhere the same

The world that we used to know
People tell me it don't turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that aint smilin'
Like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear we've been waitin' too long

Tell me where are driving
Midnite cruiser
Where is your bounty
Of fortune and fame
I am another
Gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlen
Or somewhere the same

Tell me where are driving
Midnite cruiser
Where is your bounty
Of fortune and fame
I am another
Gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlen
Or somewhere the same

Tell me where are driving
Midnite cruiser
Where is your bounty
Of fortune and fame
I am another
Gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlen
Or somewhere the same
