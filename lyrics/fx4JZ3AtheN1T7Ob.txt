No longer feel you
No longer fear you
I've worked overtime
In your cancer factories
Lived with those lies
To make those loose ends meet
I've taken all my chances
And still I'm missing steps
Another losing battle
For those left for dead

I've fed their rabid feast
Yet still pick from my own bones
I've ripped out my own heart
Trying to keep you whole
I've lived like true angels
I've only learned to fall
I've sold myself to death
For nothing at all
No longer feel anyone
No longer fear anything
I've hung my sorrow
On your promised apologies
I've left the nest
With broken wings
The blood in my eyes
Has taught me to defeat
The beasts at the feet
Of saint obscurity
No longer feel
No longer fear
