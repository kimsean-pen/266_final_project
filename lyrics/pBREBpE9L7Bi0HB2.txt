Come beg for the night
Feel a bit warm
Don't cry on the dark
Just walk through the door

I ran out of words
Some from your lips
I know it's absurd
To shake when we kiss
Here it goes, here it goes

(Pre-Chorus)
Here comes your love
Belongs to you
Here comes your soul burn
I have to be with you

When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again
You'll be all on your own
When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
If you need me again
Let me know

I'm in love with the light
Just show it more
I'll wait for the night
If you walk through the door

I want every word up
On your lips
I know it's absurd
Just cherish every kiss
Here it goes

(Pre-Chorus)
Here comes your love
Belongs to you
Here comes your soul burn
I have to be with you

When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again
You'll be all on your own
When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
If you need me again
Let me know

When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again
You'll be all on your own
When this lost arts
Won't hurt anymore
If you need me again
Let me know
