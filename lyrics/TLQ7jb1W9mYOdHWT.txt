Dry those eyes, they're so telling of age
Fleeting, their lights start to fade
as a final glimmer of life withers away

Dreams of scattered fate displayed, break and shatter in dismay
Like candles to a flame, we melt our lives away

Aeternum Vale
Now remember the days when we were younger and coming of age
Speak no more, Be at peace
My requiem is yours to keep

Tempus edax rerum
Obitus
Rigor Mortis

Tempus edax rerum, Aeternum Vale

Eyes bone dry, a sure telling of age
cheating your life of it's days,
as it's final glimmer of light withers away

Turn the pages, their shadows overtake us
It burns my eyes
stillness in patience, never to awaken
Aeternum Vale

Aeternum Vale
Now remember the days, when we were younger and coming of age
Speak no more, Be at peace
My requiem is yours to keep

These lights have faded, I'm wasting away
Too long i've waited, I've wasted away

Tempus edax rerum. Aeternum Vale

On and on
Through my buried bones, my song lives on
Through my buried bones, my song lives on
