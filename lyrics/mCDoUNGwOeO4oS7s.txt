Adrift, the sleep made us liars
It kept us close and convinced us
we'd be fine when the summer would arrive
But summer never came back and winter took time to pass
A newfound dawn, a newborn wind
And winter left before the welcomed spring

Through years of resistance
Where I rarely felt whole
Long distance calls from my soul were never answered
When the darkest horizon once gave way for the sun
It gave me the courage to end the silence

A mirrors reflections in broken glass
Made two pieces fit at last
The wind was rare its victims blind
We couldn't stop, could not rewind
We became victims of the quietness
Led astray by intent
Our wishes similar but not the same and with sunrise the reason came

Through years of resistance
Where I rarely felt whole
Long distance calls from my soul were never answered
When the darkest horizon once gave way for the sun
It gave me the courage to end the silence
At the Atlantic edge awaits the end of silence
