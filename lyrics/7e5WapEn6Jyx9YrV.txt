Get up, get out
This is your wake up call
We run this town and you can't fight us all
We keep 'em coming back for more
Don't think you can hold us down
We'll tear this building down
Try to be careful what you say

Give it up, your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us with some peace of mind
You do this every time

So here's to another better year
We've crossed that thin line
Don't try to hold us here
If for just this once you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

Get up, get out
Who's gonna break your fall
When we don't back down, you're gonna seem so small
We keep 'em running for the door
Just wait, things will come back around
It's too late for them, they're headed straight for a melt down
I'm not a part of your cliche

Give it up, your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us with some peace of mind
You do this every time

So here's to another better year
We've crossed that thin line
Don't try to hold us here
If for just this once you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

So here's to another better year
We've crossed that thin line
Don't try to hold us here
If for just this once you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

Just think about, just think about everything
Be careful now, be careful what you say
While I'm away.

This is the life we chose
This is the life I lead
They can never take this from me

This is the life we chose
This is the life I lead
They can never take this from me

So here's to another better year

If for just this once you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself
So here's to another better year
We've crossed that thin line

If for just this once you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself
So here's to another better year
I hope you're happy with yourself
