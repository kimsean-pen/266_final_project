Watch as we start again
A different chapter now
So welcome to our fight
There will be blood
There will be blood

No one can take this from us
I taste the end it's so close

There will be blood
There will be blood on our hands

We are the promised ones
And nothing's in our way
They can try
But they'll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
We're ready for the war
We've been here and we'll never die
Now they have nowhere to go

And now we've come too far
To give it all away
So welcome to our lives
There will be blood
There will be blood

We'll brave this storm together
I taste the end it's so close

There will be blood
There will be blood on our hands
There will be blood (you are nothing)
There will be blood on our hands (you are nothing like us)

We are the promised ones
And nothing's in our way
They can try
But they'll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
We're ready for the war
We've been here and we'll never die
Now they have nowhere to go

We'll meet you on the front lines
We have nothing to lose
We'll meet you on the front lines
We have nothing to lose

Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose

We are the promised ones
And nothing's in our way
They can try
But they'll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
We're ready for the war
We've been here and we'll never die

We'll never die
