Layin' 'round with my baby girl
I never wanna let her go
Some of you, yeah, you freak me out
I never wanna leave my home
'Cause when I do you stare me down
Staring at the way that I walk
Most of you, yeah, you bum me out
It kills me just to hear you talk
There's always shit
I don't wanna deal with
There's always places
I don't wanna go
But there's gonna be things in life
That you'd never ask for
So what else am I supposed to do?
But fuck it all 'cause it's all for you
Layin' 'round with my baby girl
I never wanna let her go
Some of you, yeah, you freak me out
I never wanna leave my home
You'll never get it, so just forget it
I keep on walking on by
Hard to admit it but fuck the critics
None of you are worth my time
There's always shit
I don't wanna deal with
There's always places
I don't wanna go
But there's gonna be things in life
That you'd never ask for
So what else am I supposed to do?
But fuck it all 'cause it's all came true
There's always shit
I don't wanna deal with
There's always places
I don't wanna go
But there's gonna be things in life
That you'd never ask for
So what else am I supposed to do?
But write a simple song for you
