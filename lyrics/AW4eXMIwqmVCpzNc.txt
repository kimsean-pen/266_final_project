Something in the water
A bottomless well of anger
A terrible light show
Reflecting in the snow

Give in to your master
He knows just what you're after
A beautiful tomorrow
Then he'll never let you go

We're just broken down satellites
We're stuck in another endless night

Poison in the water
We're all feeling better
We'll be led tomorrow
Where we don't want to go

Married to your master
Happily ever after
Shut your eyes don't let it show
Just shower it, let it grow

We're but hovering satellites
We're struck and high on some blinding lights

Something in the water
We all know it's a matter
Of time and letting go
Some cracks just never show

Gave in to a master
Turned into a liar
I'll bet on tomorrow
I won't miss you when I go

We're just broken down satellites
We're stuck in another endless night
We're but hovering satellites
We're struck and high on some blinding lights
