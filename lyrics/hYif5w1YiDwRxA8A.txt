Once upon a waste of time
All I had was never mine
Until you
From every heart, blood ran cold
Nights moved fast, and days moved slow
Until you

I was looking for an ending when I fell into you
You were like a dream, cause you never came true
You said it all meant nothing to you

Now you turn around and tear me just for something to do
You like to make it bleed, but you never cut through
You say it all means nothing to you

A bed of nails beneath these sheets
Conversations in my sleep
Until you
The lowest thoughts so close to me
Reaching out from underneath
Until you

I was looking for an ending when I fell into you
You were like a dream, cause you never came true
You said it all meant nothing to you

Now you turn around and tear me just for something to do
You like to make it bleed, but you never cut through
You say it all means nothing to you
