"Ms. Third Ward, your first question
What is your aspiration in life?"
"Oh, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy"

Mama said, "you're a pretty girl"
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says, "bigger is better"
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says, "thinner is better"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)

Pretty hurts (pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Ain't no doctor, or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors
And the shards of a beautiful past

Pretty hurts (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst (pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)

Pretty hurts (pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
You're tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see (pretty hurts)
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
When you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?

Stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?

Yeah, yes
Ah, ah
