To all the ones who have helped me along the way
I owe a debt I could never repay

Carried on the shoulders of strangers
No room for doubt, lead by faith, never failure
You paved the way but to my dismay
The great unknown could be an early grave

On a long road with the end in our sights
Tragedy takes it away like a thief in the night
I pray it's not over
Won't remain broken, I'm looking for closure
I'm scared, didn't think it'd come with a cost
That people would change, that lives could be lost
I'm having nightmares where fate leaves us for dead
Never imagined a price on our heads

I woke up screaming
I felt my heart sink in
I miss the days when I felt indestructible, indestructible
We're veering over lines that shake me every time
I miss the days when I felt indestructible, indestructible

It wasn't supposed to be like this
I lived in a world where darkness didn't exist
Mortality is a beautiful thing
Embrace it, don't waste it
You're the one who pulls the strings

Heavy win, heavy loss
I'm moving forward (Moving forward)
No matter what the cost

I woke up screaming
I felt my heart sink in
I miss the days when I felt indestructible, indestructible
We're veering over lines that shake me every time
I miss the days when I felt indestructible, indestructible

Indestructible, indestructible
I still carry you with me

I woke up screaming
I felt my heart sink in
I miss the days when I felt indestructible, indestructible
So write this on my stone if I don't make it home
I tried my best but I'm not indestructible, indestructible

Even through the darkest nights
All hope is not lost
All hope is not lost
