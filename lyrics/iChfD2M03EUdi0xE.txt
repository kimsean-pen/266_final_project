If we close our eyes
And slowly hold our breath
Can we make the time stop from
Running out?

There is a new day rising.
Keep holding on. Keep holding on.

I know I'll be OK; I know there's hope

Time after time I have walked this streets
But the death in our eyes has stared us blind
But I believe that we can find our way back to
The ground.

I am not afraid to live.
I will not give it in
To the demons that dwell inside.
I simply will not die.

We were the youth that always believed that
Our days would never end.
The sun would go up, be warm and to stay
Forever and a day.
But I hope you know that there's a fire burning
Deep in all of us.
Forever and a day.

There is a new dawn breaking.
I can feel the breath of change
Lift me up from the dark and shine
a light of hope on me.

Arm the masses
We need to break free from these chains.
Arm the masses
Until the day we start believe.

We were the youth that always believed that
Our days would never end.
The sun would go up, be warm and to stay
Forever and a day.
But I hope you know that there's a fire burn-
Ing deep in all of us.
Forever and a day.

We are the voice of the youth.

Spread your wings
Across these acres of death
And take a leap of faith because our time's
Running out.

If this is life – Silence the world
If this is life – Silence the world.
