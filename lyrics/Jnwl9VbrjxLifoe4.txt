Nothin' really matters, when you want it stop
Sinkhole swallowed gold, on your way to the top
And I've been drownin', you've been laughing
Sinkhole swallowed gold, on your way back in

And I, I...
Was wrong about you
Was wrong about you

Illuminate the fractures, from your sideways bends
Follow your way back down, slip on the grave again
And I've been drowning, you've been laughing
Sinkhole swallowed gold, on your way back in

And I, I...
Was wrong about you
Was wrong about you
