Why do we
Keep pretending like there's nothing in between us
We both know
That the chemistry that we feel is so damn obvious, oh

'Cause we get drunk on the weekend
Kissing at the back of the party
It ain't a lot
But waking up in the morning
Sayin' we're sorry
What do we
Keep pretending like there's nothing in between us

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
I got too many friends, too many friends

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers
Too many friends

They say
That we're just two people looking for a letdown
It's too late
Once we cross the line, there ain't no turning back, no

'Cause we get drunk on the weekend
Kissing in the back at the party
It ain't a lot
But waking up in the morning
Sayin' we're sorry

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers
Too many friends

Too many friends
Too many friends

Not enough lovers
Not enough lovers

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers

Baby, I got too many friends, not enough lovers
Stone in my bed, under my covers
Too many friends, not enough lovers
Too many friends

Oh, it's not that fancy

Too many friends, not enough lovers
Too many friends
