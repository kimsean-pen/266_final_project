Everybody knows time's running
Even you start fading away
Just for the day

People hoping the time's coming
When the world feels peace for the day
Just for the day

They'll say that you're wrong
Crazy, stoned and gone
Go-o-one
Go-o-one!

You had all control
Of your mind
Of your mind and soul

Everybody knows
Lies come in
When the truth gets buried away
Done for the day

Listening to all you're saying
Now I think I'll go my own way
Go my own way

They say that you're gone
Crazy, stoned and gone
Go-o-one
Go-o-one!

You had all control
Of your mind
Of your mind and soul
