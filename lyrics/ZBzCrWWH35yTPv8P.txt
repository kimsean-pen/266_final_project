When I was younger, man
I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair

You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life

Ooh, babe, you got what it takes
So I made you my wife

Since then I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, oooh, I love you

You came along
From far away
And found me here

I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer

You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile

You said, you're much too young
Your life ain't begun
let's walk for awhile

And as my head was spinning around
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh, I want you

Thank you, babe, for being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, oooh, I need you

As my head was coming around
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh, I want you
Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, oooh, I need you
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
Oooh, I got you
If ever a man had it all
It would have to be me
And, oooh, I love you
