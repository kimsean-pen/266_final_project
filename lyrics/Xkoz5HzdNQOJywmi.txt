Will the angels sing tonight
Or will they perish in the shadows of this newborn light
Will we crumble into dust
Will we blow away
Like the ravens did yesterday
Can we mend this broken reed
Seal the doom of this house of cards
I only want to hear the angels laugh
Are they sleeping on the edge of the sky?
Will the candles burn all night
Or will the darkness engulf us and swallow our sight
Can we go to the same ground if the nightengale sings
Gather round the fountain as the churchbells ring
I only want to hear the angels laugh
Are they sleeping on the edge of the sky?
I only want to listen to the angels sing
Are they crying on the glimpse of mine eyes?
I only want to hear the angels laugh
Are they sleeping on the edge of the sky?
I only want to listen to the angels sing
Are they crying on the glimpse of mine eyes?
I only want to hear the angels laugh
Are they sleeping on the edge of the sky?
I only want to listen to the angels sing
Are they crying on the glimpse of mine eyes?
