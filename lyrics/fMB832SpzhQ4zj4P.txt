I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
I'm a fool for your belly
I'm a fool for you love

I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands

Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Caught like a fool without a line
We're in a natural spring
with this gentle sting between us

I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands

Oooh, stay open
Oooh, stay open

Stay open
Stay open

I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I wanna make this plain
Ooh, i know your faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
Stay open
Stay open
Stay open
Ooh, stay open
