Surrounded by the city lights
Dancing shadows on the streets tonight
That's the only world we know
Somewhere outside there's somethin' beautiful

Everyday we have been tryin' not to pretend
We are close to the end
Must this be over, don't say it's over

How do I keep this pain away?
What can I do to make you stay?
How do I find the words to say don't just
Walk away, walk away

It's always a price we gotta pay
Sometimes you gotta lose if you wanna gain
How do I find the words to say

Don't just
Walk away, walk away
Now, walk away, walk away
Don't you just
Walk away, walk away

Don't you just
Walk away, walk away
Don't you just
Walk away, walk away now

We got lost along the way
We think we're movin' but still nothing's changed
I take it in but leave out
'Cause it's easy not to think about

But let's talk it over
Don't say it's over
Everyday we have been tryin' not to pretend
We are close to the end

I know you hate it, you know I hate it
Oh, oh, we hate it

Don't walk away, no, no
Walk away, walk away
Don't you just
Walk away, walk away

Don't you just
Walk away, walk away
Don't you just
Walk away, walk away now

Just walk away
