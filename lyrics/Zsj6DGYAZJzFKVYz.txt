Lost in a shadow
The planet rolls like a ball
Darkness will follow
And soon the whole thing will fall
Coz now I'm able
To see the little light
Coz now I'm able
To know what's in the sky
Ground is shaking
And it's still far away
Sure it's coming
The drama is on its way
Coz this is much faster
Than a runaway star
Too brilliant
To watch it with my eyes
Radical abortion
Impulsive conclusion
All things good
Get their end
Even vast, no man's land
Too many reasons
Too much oppression
My mind's mutation
With my psychic power
Imploring the quasar
There is no freedom
No satisfaction
I want some action
With my psychic power
Everything is over
That's why I do that
That's why it's a fact
Why do I regret
Nothing better yet
Sky is red and nature
Falls in disgrace
Space is dread
There's no place to be safe
The quasar is coming
Ordered by my mind
Spreading X-rays
Making the system blind
Astral rotation
Turning the wrong way
Solar collision
Causing the end of this age
Comets flying
Emanating a gas
Intoxicating every form of life
For a lost dimension
Have a wise solution
Better now than never
Don't need more, you neither

(chorus)
The final process
Hard and so complex
Reverse the motion
Adding some tension
Setting the machine
Awaiting to leave
My bones and my soul
On my way back home
Have a look behind
Nothing more to find...
