Don't let the chain break
This won't be easier or on your own
I've come too far and can't get home
Don't say i'm too late
I clenched the things that i'm still unsure
The chances that you'll never know

If you slip and slide trip or fall
You're not the only one
Wish you'd never played with guns
Don't sleep and slide
Trip or fall
You knew when this'd be gone
Wish you'd never played with guns

You know down the line
I still see me stood next to you the flowers growing leving all behind
Tell me you'll be fine
And after everything we'll be standing strong
Just take a breath and move along

If you slip and slide trip or fall
You're not the only one
Wish you'd never played with guns
Don't sleep and slide
Trip or fall
You knew when this'd be gone
Wish you'd never played with guns
