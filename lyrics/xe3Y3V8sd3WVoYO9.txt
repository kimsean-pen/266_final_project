Well I'm a gangster in 1934
Junkies, winos, pimps, and whores
and all you men, women and kids, best stay out the way

I just left your town, took all your loot
Wore a pink carnation and a pinstripe suit
A hopped up V8 Ford, and some two-tone shoes

And I'm already gone
I left a pool of blood and sorrow
I've got the machine gun blues

I'll be out of here before the break of dawn
Hit the highway, smoke a big cigar
Gonna stop and bury the cash, then get some more

There's only one thing on my mind that's makin' across that ol' state line
Amid a hail of avenging bullets that are meant for me

And I'm already gone
I left a path of pure destruction
I've got the machine gun blues

Already done, my life will soon be though
I've got the machine gun blues

I'm public enemy number one
I'm sorry for all the things that I've done
If indeed we do cross paths, it's nothing personal
And I'm already gone
I left a trail of devastation
I've got the machine gun blues
Already gone, my life will soon be though
I've got the machine gun blues
