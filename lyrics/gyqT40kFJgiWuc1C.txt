There is no time for despair
Entering the void
Of your worst nightmares
As the spirit leaves
The body will decay
Watching as your life blood
Slowly slips away

In a second all turns black
Mind is numbed
With pain and torment
Alone the only witness
As you bleed
Departure of your soul
Will finally concede

Abandoned
In the last attack
Death no glory
Last stand of humanity

Descending
No way back
Death at the point of victory
Last stand of humanity

Attaining
Pride at last
With new found hope
There still could be victory
