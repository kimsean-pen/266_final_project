here it goes and this wont take long
just let me dedicate a song
to a girl who turned this boy to stone
and you know who you are
heres a hint, she doesnt have a car
or the time to be in love with me

Why did you say
this feeling has to stay
left me to wait for so long

you dont have to stay
but i hoped you would anyway
all you did was up and go

Excuse me, but this wont take long
im sorry for writing you this song
but just what do you think you deserve

because when you had the chance for romance
you burnt it at both ends
i guess im not sorry in the least

What made you say
this feeling has to stay
breaking us up for so long

you dont have to stay
but i hope you would anyway
all you did was up and go

you dont have to go
what makes you stay we'll never know
all you do is up and go

up and go

up and go

what would make you stay
up and go

what would make you stay
i guess we'll never know
i guess we'll never know
i guess we'll never
(up and go)

you dont have to stay
but i hoped you would anyway
all you do is up and go
(up and go)

you dont have to go
what makes you stay
we'll never know
(up and go)
all you do is up and go

you didnt have to stay
so you did it
up'ed and went away
(up and go)
all you do is up and go

up and go...

i guess we'll never know (5X)
