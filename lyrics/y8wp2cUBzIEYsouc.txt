Oh, hey

Rollerskates, them lines
Have sun and clear blue skies
The waves are crashing by
And when she passed me by
And gave a wink and smile
And I was on cloud nine
Lord

The way you move your hips and lick your lips
The way you dip, you got me up so high (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body with them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

And gravity defied
I can't believe my eyes
That thing can bring the tides, hey
And round and round clockwise
Like come here, we go right
I wanna go all night, yes

The way you move your hips and lick your lips
The way you dip, you got me up so high (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body with them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
