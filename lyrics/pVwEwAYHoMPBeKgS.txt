Hey, time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day

Ooh, time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day
She was sleeping at the bus stop
Ebbing away
But her magic in her blue eyes
Told me she had left a her daze
(Left a daze)

So I have to check her wisdom
And there was no doubt
I told her I was sitting alone and on the crestfall
Future's gonna catch me out
She said, "Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up, take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied"
"And love won't change you, boy, it's true

I can tell you till my face is blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
Ooh, 'cause you just can't stop the clock"
On a brick wall I was banging over my head
But the sweet rings on my feet now
Where once they were made of lead
(Sweet rings on my feet now)
Do you hear the message in the music, I hear it too
You know, you got your history in the making

Slowing down won't get you through, no, no
Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up, take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
And love won't change you, boy, it's true
I can tell you till my face is blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
'Cause you just can't stop the clock
Time won't wait for you

Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day
Time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day
It keeps on

(It keeps on)
You know that it keeps on
You know that it keeps on
(It keeps on)

It keeps on ticking, yeah
It keeps on
(It keeps on)
You know that it keeps on

You know it keeps on
Keeps on ticking, baby
Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
You better hurry up hey take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
Love won't change you, boy, it's true
I can tell you till my face is blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
Oh, 'cause you just can't stop the clock

You know that it keeps on ticking away
Keeps on ticking away
(Time won't wait for you)
Time it keeps on ticking away
Keeps on ticking away
Time won't wait for you
Won't wait for you
Oh, won't wait for you, no
Can't stop
