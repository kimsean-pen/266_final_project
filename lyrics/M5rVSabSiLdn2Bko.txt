(It's sabotage now)
I keep praying she'll leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
But she keeps waiting outside of my home
I got an angel on the left sayin'
Dont give in
But the devil on the right's sayin'
Let her in
She wont stop kicking down my door (ah no ah no)

(Chorus)
But each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl
But she's here to stay
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(and now my heart is)
Broken all over again
(It's sabotage now)

I cant hold onto guys that I like
(no no no)
She keeps lookin' with wandering eyes
I got an angel on the left screaming
Get away
But the devil on the right's saying
Time to play (ooh)
And I cant take it anymore
It's sabotage now

(Chorus)
Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl
But she's here to stay
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(and now my heart is)
Broken all over again
(It's sabotage now)

When I fall in love I
cause myself so much pain
I sabotage my heart and
and I dont know how to change

It doesnt matter what I say
or what I do
'Cuz in the end she always wins i always loose
I need to get her out of my life

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl
But she's here to stay
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(and now my heart is)
Broken all over again
(It's sabotage now)

Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(It's sabotage now)
Over and over again
(and now my heart is)
Broken all over again
(It's sabotage now)
