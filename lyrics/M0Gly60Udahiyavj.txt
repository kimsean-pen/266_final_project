I've said I'll make it to the party
But I've got a lot going on
The lioness gave a feast for forty of her body
Then slept on the ground till a flower grew out
Yeah

I'd said we'd walk around the city
And catch a cab at exactly dawn
I've promised with my eyes and I know that
A peach tree skipped to you, Fruity
And the next spring dropped her flowers on the ground

La la la la la la la la la la la la
Let's not wait or let's wait
No hurry to fall in love
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Let's not wait or let's wait
No hurry we're all in love

I let you sip from my lemon tree
And bask in the roots and the sunbeams
I let you wrap your body into mine until we're one thing
Until we're one thing
I promised that we'd swim in rivers
On mountains with nobody on em
I gazed at your face for too long until my own was gone
I promised that we'd ride the golden blanket to heaven
I'm sorry, Fruity, I must just find the earth again
Again, again, again

La la la la la la la la la la la la
Let's not wait or let's wait
No hurry to fall in love
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Let's not wait or let's wait
No hurry we're all in love

I've said I'll make it to the party
But I've got a lot going on
The lioness gave a feast for forty of her body
Then slept on the ground till a flower grew out
Yeah

I'd said we'd walk around the city
And catch a cab at exactly dawn
I've promised with my eyes and I know that
A peach tree skipped to you, Fruity
And the next spring dropped her flowers on the ground
