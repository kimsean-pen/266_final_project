Revel in Your Time

Save your breath, I'll move closer to you
You slide your arms around my neck, closer to you.
Can you feel it? I can feel it too.
(We'll buy back in with a lucky hand, get lucky this time)
Feel the warmth of the glow of the silver screen.
There's a monster, and nothing in between.

Can you feel it? I can feel it too.
(We'll buy back in with a lucky hand, get lucky this time)

I would kill to be with you. We can make it thunder.
I would kill to be with you. We will make it through.

The time has come to fold. Chaos spreads the room.
We lock in eye to eye as he rips us apart.
Can you feel it? I can feel it too.
(We'll buy back in with a lucky hand, get lucky this time)

I would kill to be with you. We can make it thunder.
I would kill to be with you. We will make it through.

You pull over and point to the sky.
You shut the lights off, they'll fly right by.
The black sun, it sinks to the earth
You said let's revel in our time.
Can you feel it? I can feel it too. Can you feel it?

I would kill to be with you. We can make it thunder.
I would kill to be with you. We will make it through.
