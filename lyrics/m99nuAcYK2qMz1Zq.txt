Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash

Ask your main bitch she know who I am (Sosa Baby)
Rob him for his taxes if he's a son of Sam
Who gives a fuck, we don't care bout nothin' Fam!
Got money for a verse, send it through money gram
I'mma drop the top when I buy me a Phantom
Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom
And if his mouth moving, my gun dance some
I pull up in that Porsche, they like "Damn, son!"

Fake ass niggas that's a shit I don't like

All these fucking games, that's the shit I don't play
2 door Murcielago and its smoke grey
Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy
It will open up a nigga like some candy (BOOM)
In the barrel, look like a Cambell's soup can
Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand (HAHA)
Talkin 36 O's and im the OG
One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key
Muzzle on the rock, while it flash it go bang
Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain
Got em pitchin wild 100's, keep it 300
Man that head so good bought her a 300
Understand me
