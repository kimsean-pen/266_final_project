Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well, I used to know a girl
And I could have sworn
That her name was Veronica
Well, she used to have
A carefree mind of her own
And a delicate look in her eye
These days, I'm afraid
She's not even sure
If her name is Veronica

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Veronica, Veronica

Did her days drag by, did the favors wane?
Did he roam down the town all the while?
Will you wake from your dream
With a wolf at the door
Reaching out for Veronica?
Well, it was all of 65 years ago
When the world was the street
Where she lived
And a young man sailed
On a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica

On the Empress of India
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
And picked upon the bones of last week's news
She spoke his name out loud again

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Veronica, Veronica

Veronica sits in the favorite chair
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name
That they never get right
And if they don't, then nobody else will
But she used to have
A carefree mind of her own
With devilish look in her eye
Saying, "You can call me
Anything you like
But my name is Veronica"

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Oh, oh
Veronica
