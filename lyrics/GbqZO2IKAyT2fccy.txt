Darker skies fall one last time
Upon the righteous and the vile
Heaven sheds no light
Towards our darkest hour
Atonement for our sins and crimes
Judgement day brings endless nights
We fade to black, the ashes fall
Upon our souls tonight

All our hearts will turn to stone
All our dreams die one by one
All our fears were never meant to be
We burn forever

We fall apart (We fall apart, never lift this sorrow)
We chase the clouds (Chase the clouds to live tomorrow)
All for tonight (All for tonight)
We live, beneath a blackened sky
(Skyfall awaits tomorrow)
I end this life (End this life to end my sorrow)
'Cause we all die (In darkness we all die)
Alone, beneath a blackened sky

One by one into the void
Idols, heroes left destroyed
Man-made gods won't save
Our hearts, so let them break
The rain comes down, a heavy crown
A shroud for kings and queens of old
The chaos reigns, our prophecy
Fulfilled in fire tonight

All our hearts will turn to stone
All our dreams die one by one
All our fears were never meant to be
We burn forevermore

We fall apart (We fall apart, never lift this sorrow)
We chase the clouds (Chase the clouds to live tomorrow)
All for tonight (All for tonight)
We live, beneath a blackened sky
(Skyfall awaits tomorrow)
I end this life (End this life to end my sorrow)
'Cause we all die (In darkness we all die)
Alone, beneath a blackened sky

We fall apart (We fall apart, never lift this sorrow)
We chase the clouds (Chase the clouds to live tomorrow)
All for tonight (All for tonight)
We live, beneath a blackened sky
(Skyfall awaits tomorrow)
I end this life (End this life to end my sorrow)
'Cause we all die (In darkness we all die)
Alone, beneath a blackened sky

(Never lift this sorrow)
I end this life (Chase the clouds to live tomorrow)
'Cause we all die (All for tonight)
Alone, beneath a blackened sky
