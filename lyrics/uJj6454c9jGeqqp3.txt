When I crossed the tracks
not a soul was around
there was no anything outside

When I raised an eye
to catch some sign
I realized what had been done

And need I fell to sleep
but did not get to be
anywhere that I had been before

And when I rise
it was but with these eyes
and they don't see anything
when I look into the sky

Now when I fall to earth
I hear applause
I love to hear applause

When I take the train into town
I know everything
and I may take everything that I know

Get back in your home
I won't see you anymore
my days of seeing you are done

I am the new gods
you've seen my face around the block
but now I'm here
my time has come
