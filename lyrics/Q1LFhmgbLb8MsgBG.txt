I'm obnoxious, motherfucker can't you tell?

Run through Little Havana yelling "Viva Fidel!"
Jerking off with the sheets, when I stay at hotels
Drinking Bacardi at AA meetings, smoking an L
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl? Bitch get over here, give me some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers, that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss
A fucking hypocrite draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me nigga, cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Send a death fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way

Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it

Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said hip hop was dead, but I invoking the spirit
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter

A raging alcoholic like the President's daughters

Disgusting flows like third world country tap-water

But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
Cause I'm a prank call, Cop-Shot, just for kicks
Pay back, for everytime that they called me a spic
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco (crazy)
And Dominican women call me the rompe toto (pussy destroyer)
They call me ocioso (lazy), I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
You coffee shop revolutionary son-of-a-bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Disrespected, niggaz don't "show no love"
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire

Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You're eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick

Niggas said hip hop was dead but I awoken the spirit
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage

Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she think you a phony
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Cause you like, all of the rest man
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick, if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck ya'll niggas!
Piece to the strong hold, EO dub
Word-A-Mouf, Forbidden Chapters
IAK niggas, westpoe killing you slow
The plague; I murder a show, you don't even know
Yeah, foul play nigga
Harlem!
