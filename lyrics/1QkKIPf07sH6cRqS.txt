Stumbling through narrow paths.
Afraid of what will come next.
As the darkness closes in I start to run.
What have I done to deserve this neverending hunt?
I will never be able to return home.
My existence is shattered.

As I stop to gasp for air, I wonder...
Wonder when my final call might come.
And if its really worth escaping from.
Im so tired...

Between trees and stones.
On stale paths, beneath my reality.
It's like I lost the key to my mind.
I can no longer control myself.
No more running!
I will fight my demons right here.

Dear child, through horrors and fright you willfade.
Fade to distant worlds and distant lives.
As you lose your suffering, theres nothing more to believe in.
Your belief to this day has been life.
Now my belief will fill your soul with death.

I no longer run, I stand my ground and wait, I wait.
