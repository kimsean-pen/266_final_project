If you go I wanna go with you
If you run I wanna run with you
If you cry I wanna cry with you
If you go I'm going too

I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
And I'd go anywhere
I'd go anywhere with you
Even to the end of
Even to the end of the world

If you go I wanna follow you
If you smile I wanna smile with you
When you ride I wanna ride with you

I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
And I'd go anywhere
I'd go anywhere with you
Even to the end of
Even to the end of the world

And if you die I wanna die with you
And in the ground I wanna lie with you
And when you fly to heaven I wanna fly with you

I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
I'd do anything
I'd do anything for love
And I'd go anywhere
I'd go anywhere with you
Even to the end of
Even to the end of the world

Even to the end of the world
