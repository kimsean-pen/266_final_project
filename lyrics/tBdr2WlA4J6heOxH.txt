I Immaterialize
And Slowly Drift
Into the Unknown

With the Cold Winds with Soul
The Wintery Plains Lie Untouched
I Ride on My Elements
Towards the Stars Unseen

A Quest For Knowledge
In the Astral

Luminous Stench Intensifies
As I Near a Spectral Sphere
After a Hundred Men's Lifetime
In Analyzing I learn

To Consume The Sphere
Of Immense Power
And To Become Immortal

Darkness Hate and Winter
Rules the Earth when I Return
War Between Races
A Goal Is Reached
Chaos, Hate
