Uh, na na na na

Mystery to me is something I can't see
But I see you very well
You slinky, cool, nobody's fool
But there's something inside I can tell

I know a poor man, a rich man
I know I can talk to a king
But nobody here is gonna tell me
I can't find out one thing

I see your glow around you
Open your arms
'Cause I'm walking to you, coming straight or through
Maybe I'm wrong but I know it won't take long to see

Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
When you're making love? Yeah, yeah
Making sweet love to me, yeah

The logical trend is that I'll know in the end
The things that make you smile
To right from the start, I'll take an aim at your heart
And know that all the while

I know a rich man, a poor man
I know I can talk to a king, yeah
So nobody here is gonna make me believe
I can't find out one thing

I see your glow around you
Open your arms
'Cause I'm coming, running, straight or through
I could be wrong but I know it won't take long to see

Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
When you're making love?
Yeah

Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes, I've gotta know
Do you close your eyes
When you're making love?
