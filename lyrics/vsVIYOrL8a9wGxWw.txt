Every day that you pass my way, I wonder, I wonder about your life
What is your age, are you connected if so, does she treat you right
Now please, excuse me for being so forward
Bur I couldn't let this chance go by without lettin' you know I

Chorus
I wonder, I wonder if you really knew, that I see God in you
And I wonder if you can see, how much you mean to me
I know you cannot read my mind, but I hope you feel my vibe
I think it's time I let you know that, I see the God in you

Every time that I see your face, I wonder, what lies beneath your smile
What are your dreams, what are your fears, what does your heart hold dear
I know, that you don't know me at all
But if you know yourself, well then you know me very well

Chorus
I wonder, I wonder if you really knew, that I see God in you
And I wonder if you can see, how much you mean to me
I know you cannot read my mind, but I hope you feel my vibe
I think it's time I let you know that, I see the God in you

Chorus
I wonder, I wonder if you really knew, that I see God in you
And I wonder if you can see, how much you mean to me
I know you cannot read my mind, but I hope you feel my vibe
I think it's time I let you know that, I see the God in you
