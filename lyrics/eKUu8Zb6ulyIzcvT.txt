The journey was long and steep
Sweat turns black and runs with dust
Here I seek the edge of the world
The secrets that lie behind the veil
The rapture of the universe
As the sun pours down like honey
Three sentries loom in the skyline
Our sun of eternity shrines bright
Many souls slumber
On the mountainside below
Dressed in royal robes of green and red

My left hand points to the earth
My right towards the starry sky
Writhing serpent belt of eternity
Wrapped round my waist
Black banner blows in the wind
Emblazoned with the white rose of death

Under cover of night, by fire light
Wood smoke in my lungs
Moss and blood in my hair
Ash in my eyes, I grip the torch

My light illuminates her ritual
Lost sigil burns in the dark
Her ecstasy shakes the canyon
The future now glows with a blue brilliance
In my mind's eye I can see a stronghold
With a moat of pure spring water
Spires of cedar and fir
