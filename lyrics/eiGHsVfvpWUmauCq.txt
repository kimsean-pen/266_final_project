Alexandra girl I know what you like
(Bad boys, bad boys...)

Oh, oh
Hey, yeah

Some people call them players
But I'm far from terrified
'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life
It feels my heart's divided
Halfway between wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't mind

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wah)
O-o-o-ooh, bad boys

Some think it's complicated
But they're straight up fun for me (o-oh)
I don't need no explanation
It's nothing more than what you see (here)
My heart still feels divided
Halfway between wrong and right (wrong and right)
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't mind (o-o-oh)

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wah)

I know you want me shawty 'cause I'm a (bad boy)
Hey s-shawty can't help it she so so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet she only sings the crooked letters
Let mama take all the risks
For that chemistry she like them tougher than leather
Not even the paws, it's more like a mama bee
Out lost that's on the reg'lar

By any means necessary girl
She likes them ruthless, that's my world
It's not the news it's what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It's not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You'll have them shawty don't worry you fly

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
Yeah the bad boys are always spinning my mind (hey)
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
I said the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wah)
Bad boys (bad boys)
