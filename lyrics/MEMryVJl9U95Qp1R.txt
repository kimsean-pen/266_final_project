I'm sitting in this cell for something I didn't do
And all I can think of is baby I think of you
Don't worry baby coming back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout

Now I've got the chance I don't care about what I do
When I done them things I done them just for you
And now I'm getting out coming back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout

Well now I'm over the wall I'm nearly home
I'm coming through that door coming back to you
Now I'm nearly home nearly back for you

There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
There's gonna be a borstal breakout
