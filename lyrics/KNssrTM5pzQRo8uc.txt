I started a joke, which started the whole world crying,
oh but I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no.

and I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing,
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.

and I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,
and I fell out of bed, curseing my head from things that I'd said.

Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.

and I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,
and I fell out of bed, cursing my head from things that I'd said.

'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,
oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was one me.
