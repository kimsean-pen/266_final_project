I scream into your face
I scream into your face until
My veins are bursting through
Prisoners now live with no excuse

They call out my name
Anger takes it's hold
It's hold but it won't stop
'Cause I have no control
I have no control

It calls, calls out my name
It holds, it holds, it holds me down

I stare into your eyes
I stare into your eyes until
The tears start to fall
With a sound to which I can't ignore

It calls out my name
Anger takes it's hold
It's hold but it wont stop
'Cause I have no control
I have no control

It calls, calls out my name
It holds, it holds, it holds me down
It calls, calls out my name
It holds, it holds, it holds me down

You say, your way
Was the only way to be
You say, your way
Was the only way to be
The only way to be
It calls out, calls out my name
It holds, it holds, it holds me down
It calls out, calls out my name
It holds, it holds, it holds me down
I have no control
I have no control
