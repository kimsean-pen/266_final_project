We pick up in New YorkExplain City
Try to find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed

The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complainin'

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Every night around this time
My friends and I retreated like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place

Barkin' on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
"Hey world, you ain't seen nothin' left"
Great, now it's rainin'

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dream somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
