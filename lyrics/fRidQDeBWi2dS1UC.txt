Mother, I'm tired
Come surrender my son
Time has ravaged on my soul
No plans to leave, but still I go
Falling with the leaves
Falling out of sleep
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?

Mother, I've tried
Wasting my life
I haven't given up, I lie
To make you so proud in my eyes
Falling out of sleep
Crawling over me
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?

Tuesday's come and gone
Restless, still I drive
Try to leave it all behind
Falling, falling out of sleep
Falling, falling with the leaves
I go crawling, crawling over me

Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
I went falling
I went falling

Mother, I hope you know
That I miss you so
Time has ravaged on my soul
To wipe a mother's tears grown cold
