"All I perceive is wasted and broken
Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
Slam into me and into the ditch of debris.
And you smoke in the park, you sleep in the greenery,
Everyone barks but all still believing
To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me,

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
Tear into me and the scent of you sweating
Smells good to me, as long as we keep in our clothes
And out in the dark, the world is still rolling,
Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
And all that they are, just reeks with the sweetest belief.

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

All I could want is silver and spinning
Out from your arms and into the pretty
Pit of your heart - so simply and softly we'd flow.

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

Into you I will glow.
Into you."
