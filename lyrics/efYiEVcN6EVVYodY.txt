It's a long way home
I'm not even counting the miles
All my fears
Like yesterday, are so far gone
Fallen through the surface of the sun

Now here I am
Blinded by the endless sand
Cause I cannot survive
The distant blue of life
I knew I had to get away

And I was searching for the moonlight
But I'm much better now
I'm not waiting for
I'm not waiting for the moonlight
Cause I'm hoping to find
What's on the other side
Across the borderline
Where emptiness resides

It's a long time now
Since I gave up and left paradise
And all those dreams are memories
They're so far gone
Fallen through the surface of the sun

The stars are lines
They draw me up into the night
Sequin silver, polar white
My sacrifice is this divide
As deep as Heaven's appetite

And I was searching for the moonlight
But I'm much better now
I'm not waiting for
I'm not waiting for the moonlight
Cause I'm hoping to find
What's on the other side
Across the borderline

Where emptiness
Where emptiness resides
Moonlight
Moonlight
But I'm much better now
I'm not waiting for
I'm not waiting for the moonlight
Cause I'm hoping to find
What's on the other side

And I was searching for the moonlight
But I'm much better now
I'm not waiting for
I'm not waiting for the moonlight
Cause I'm hoping to find
What's on the other side
Across the borderline
Where emptiness
Where emptiness resides
Moonlight
