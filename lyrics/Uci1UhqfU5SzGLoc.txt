I don't believe you
And I never will,
Oh I can't live by your side
with the lies you've tried to instil,
I can't take anymore,
I don't have to give you a reason
For leaving this time
Cos this is my last goodbye

It's like I hardly know you
but maybe I never did.
It's like every emotion you showed me
you kept well hid,
and every true word that you ever spoke
was really decieving.
Now I'm leaving this time
cos this is my last goodbye

I've gotta turn and walk away,
I don't have anything left to say
I haven't already said before
and I've grown tired of being used,
and I'm sick and tired of being accused.
Now I'm walking away from you,
and I'm not coming back
