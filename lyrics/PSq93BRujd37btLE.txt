You pushed my head under the water
I lost my breath, but the skyline called my name

The wilds the wilds the wilds they pull you in
These miles we've walked and miles we talked have been
The first time I am not alone in my head
By itself, oneself, can't find where it began

The dust you'll find beneath my feet
Reminds me of the simpler things
When it was only you and me
But now I see, now I see

So we all fall asleep
So we laugh and play
So we drink and eat

So we count our time
So we know our keep
But it floats away,
Nothing seems to stay these days
Fragile and weak
It's been years and now
I get a moment to speak

And all I think about
Is what to say
When you're face to face with nothing
And nothing will escape your lips

The clouds, the clouds, the clouds
They take their shape
We dream that in their billows
Are answers to this place
You ask me to surrender
You're sure it's what I'll take
We broke our bread together
And cursed it at the gates

I'm a son of a father
My mother's oldest one
You make your trade with your brothers
Sister you're not the only one

Head to toe I'm drowning
I told you not to speak
Frail and fragile weak dim
The light down on the street.

But the light still lingers

In my eyes

I'm a son of a father
My mother's oldest one
You make your trade with your brothers
Sister you're not the only one
