Don't go to Gibsom cross the river
The devil is hungry, the devil is sweet
If you are soft then you will shiver

They hang the alley cats on Gibsom street
They hang the alley cats on Gibsom street
Gibsom, Gibsom street

I wish my baby were forbidden
I wish that my world be struck by sleet
I wish to keep my mirror hidden

To hide the eyes that looked on Gibsom street
To hide the eyes that looked on Gibsom street
Gibsom, Gibsom street

In my sorrow oh my morning
In my sorrow oh my morning
In my sorrow oh my morning

There is a man he knows where I'm going
He gave me a strawberry to eat
I sucked its juices never knowing
That I would sleep that night on Gibsom street
