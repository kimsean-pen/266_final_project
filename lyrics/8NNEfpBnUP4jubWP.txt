We had, we had, we had
A good thing, good thing,
Good thing
Don't know nobody
Else that has what
We had, we had, we had

I know, I know, I know
You had, you had to go
I don't, I don't, I don't
Know where, but
I know you had to go

I remember when your dad
Called me a hippie
Because I wasn't like the ones
You brought home before
These days I try to stay
Out of the city
'Cause I see your
Photograph in every store

But we had, we had, we had
A good thing, good thing,
Good thing
Don't know nobody else
That has what
We had, we had, we had

But I ain't ever sad that it's over
I'm just glad that it
Happened at all
Maybe I'll see you again
When I'm older, baby
But until then, I'll be sitting,
Writing songs

(About what) we had, we had, we had
(Oh, such a) good thing,
Good thing, good thing
Don't know nobody else that
Gas what (no, no-no-no, nobody else)
We had, we had, we had (we had)

What we had, we had, we had
A good thing, good thing, good thing
Don't know nobody else that has what
We had, we had, we had
