That day will come, when they will try to escape and there will be nowhere to run
That day will come, when I shall see, they hand in all the bombs and bayonnettes and bullets and gun
That day will come, when Emperor Selassie I shall rise di whole a di ghetto yute dem from outta di slum

And the day I would love to see their face
For the all those evil they do to the human race
And try to take things out of place
Run away to space, true dem inna...

That day will come, when they will try to escape and there will be nowhere to run
That day will come, when I shall see, they hand in all the bombs and bayonnettes and bullets and gun
That day will come, when Emperor Selassie I shall ride out pon di wings of the heavens inna di sun

I will remain the same
Hailing Rastafari name
And watch dem going up in flames
For all the innocent going down the drain
You have to pay for the shackles and chains
And pay for these washing of the brain
And pay for these guns and cocaine
The sick and the lame, alright

That day will come, when I shall stand and see all those wicked men and the fiyah gettin bun
That day will come, when they will try to escape and there will be nowhere to run
That day will come, when I shall see, they hand in all the bombs and bayonnettes and bullets and gun
That day will come, well blaze up the fire, right a now me ready
Fi blaze down Sodom! Da one ya name, yoow!
What a day it will be...
