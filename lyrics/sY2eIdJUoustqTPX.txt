Well, let me bend your ear
'Cause I'm never really there
When shadows turn to light
And hope into despair

There was an only one
But the broody skies above
Brought down a shameful stain
And not a single drop of cleaning rain

Well, let me say
Oh whoa, well, there's no place left to hide
Oh whoa, from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through
With bloody good intentions
And missing you is like kissing cyanide

Well, in this world of things
One of them is lost
I've been it in my dreams
But not without a cost

Down a lonely street
It was our destiny to meet
Nobody asked you twice
We found purchase then
With no requite, nothing nice

Oh whoa, well, there's no place left to hide
Oh whoa, from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through
With bloody good intentions
And missing you is like kissing cyanide

Would you believe in something good
That's so wrong?
And have you worshiped our invention?

Well, I've paid my debt in coin and sweat
With trifling hesitation
Because the road to you is paved
With good intentions

Oh whoa, well, there's no place left to hide
Oh whoa, from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through
With bloody good intentions
And missing you is like kissing cyanide

Cyanide, cyanide, cyanide
Cyanide, cyanide, cyanide, cyanide
