I've been cast out, sequestered.
Pushed the fuck around.
Blindsided, beaten, locked up and bound.
Always thought I was human, but maybe I was wrong.
I've been treated like an animal since the day I was born.

The wounds that I wear like the crown upon a king.
So heavy they lie, with all the pain that they bring.
My life is full of longing, but for what I'll never know.
I've been drawn in to the fire as I reap what I sow.

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me insecurity releases
And I'll be the one that's to blame
So I'll sell my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame.
(Like a moth to a flame)

The ruler of the kingdom that ends up the pawn
So tired of thinking of where it all went wrong
Friendships they come and go and sometimes they end
Wouldn't dream in a million year that this would be one of them.

Faith in the life, belief to the end
Failures not an option, but the options exist
I gave up my everything, I give till I bleed
Take it all, take everything just take it from me

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me insecurity releases
And I'll be the one that's to blame
So I'll sell my soul to blaze

You're pushing me, I'm pushing back
Falling down my heart attacks
Compassion is lost
No more hope, no more trust
I tore it down and burnt it up
All faith is gone.

Respect
Devotion
Dead

Disgust
Hate
Lies

I'm not a hero, or a villain
Not a god, I'm just a man
Staring through the hourglass
At the footprints in the sand
I'm stripping off my armor
My battles here are done
Wave my white flag to surrender
And fly into the sun.

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me insecurity releases
And I'll be the one that's to blame
So I'll sell my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame.
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
