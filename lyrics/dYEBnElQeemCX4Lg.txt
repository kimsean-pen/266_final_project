Everyday I wake up and it's sunday
Whatever's in my eye won't go away
The radio is playing all the usual
And what's a wonderwall anyway

Because my inside is outside
My right side is on the left side
Cause I writing to reach you now but
I might never reach you
Only want to teach you
About you
But that's not you

It's good to know that you are home from christmas
It's good to know that you are doing well
It's good to know that you all know I'm hurting
It's good to know I'm feeling not so well

Because my inside is outside
My right side is on the left side
Cause I'm writing to reach you now but
I might never reach you
Only want to teach you
About you
But that's not you
You know it's true
But that won't do

Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday
And whatever's in my eye should go away
But still the radio keeps playing all the usual

And what's a wonderwall anyway
Because my inside is outside
My right side is on the left side
Cause I'm writing to reach you now but
I might never reach you
Only want to teach you
About you
But that's not you
You know it's true
But that won't do
And you know it's you
I'm talking to...
