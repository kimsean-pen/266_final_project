(Verse I)
You walked into the world,
as a super human boy and girl (ooh)
In the blinking of your eyes
i was born and sold,
by your manifesto

(spoken by Women)
It's cruel world
for small things
but with the lies an luxuries
and in in-between
you can be happy

(Verse II)
You put me in a cage,
in the daily maze of flesh and rage (ooh)
That I will follow every truth
I won't let you go,
I want every tomorrow.

(spoken by Women)
It's cruel world
for small things
but with the lies an luxuries
and in in-between
you can be happy

(Verse III)
And now I am afraid
You will blossom soon
and grow and change
There is so much I can't take
but I will understand
I will open my hand

(Bridge)
you can be happy
you can be happy
you can be happy
you can be happy (It's cruel world for small things...)
you can be happy (... but with the lies an luxuries...)
you can be happy (... and in in-between...)
you can be happy (... you can be happy...)

(3x)
you can be happy
(ooh)

(Outro)
there's an open window
and i can go through
to the life of others
there's nothing i can't do

there's an open window
and i can go trough
to the life of others
there's nothing i can't do (fight)

there's an open window (fight)
and i can go trough (fight)
to the life of other's (fight)
there's nothing i can't do (fight)

there's an open window (fight/you can be happy)
and i can go trough (fight/you can be happy)
to the life of other's (fight/you can be happy)
there's nothing i can't do (fight/you can be happy)

fight/you can be happy
fight/you can be happy
fight/you can be happy
fight/you can be happy

you can be happy
(ooh)
