Welcome to my world of steel
master of my domain
cower as the pain's unsealed
disasters where ill reign

Father of Sin
ill drag you all in
Bown down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Icon to the fall of man
Worshipped like a king
fearless as I now condemn
every living thing

Father of Sin
ill drag you all in
Bown down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Father of Sin
ill drag you all in
Bown down as I petrify

Relish the blaze
Left all in a daze
He came and consumed and let fly

Fire in the sky
paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Fire in the sky
paralysed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near
