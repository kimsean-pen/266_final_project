We had so much fun
She gave me an eskimo kiss
We put a record on
It said the same to us, they sung
"Oh, it's so much fun!"

She's like a rose without the thorns
She's like a sunflower that
Never looks back at the sun
She see's me running
She's like a diamond in the rough
She's like the first girl on earth you wanted to touch
She see's me running

We went back to her place
I thought I said id had the wrong face
I put another one on
we set sail, as the night gets long
Oh, it's so much fun!

She's like a rose without the thorns
She's like a sunflower that
Never looks back at the sun
She see's me running
She's like a diamond in the rough
She's like the first girl on earth you wanted to touch
She's touching touch

Oh, lonely bones
Well, I'm coming through the sun
And our lives have just begun
but oh, lonely bones
Well, I'm coming through the sun
And our lives had just begun and it goes...
La la la la la
La La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Did you ever wonder why
This old world will make you cry
And it goes ...
La la la la la
Did you ever wonder why
This old world will make you cry
