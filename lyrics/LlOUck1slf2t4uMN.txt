Damn boy, why you make it so hard?
Stop puttin' your foot on my heart
I know I did my wrong, I know I did my dirt
Didn't know how bad I would hurt

Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame

I'm beggin' and pleadin'
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Forgive me
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Forgive me
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame
Good God almighty

Damn boy, why you make it so hard?
Stop puttin' your foot on my heart
Know I cussed and I screamed, even took your keys
Got so bad, yeah I stopped wearin' my ring

Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame

I'm beggin' and pleadin'
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Forgive me
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Forgive me
Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame
Good God almighty

Wave me back, wave me back

Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change
