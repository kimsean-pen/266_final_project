Hate casts a long shadow
I know that I lie in it
And let it rule my mind from time to time
Escaping an old battle
Clings on like a vine to me
Whispers dirty lies in my ear (ahh-I)
We didn't start this fight
And I won't let it rule my heart tonight

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

Tracing an old pattern
Drawing the lines from where I am, and from where I wanna be
Forget that old adage
The history continues to keep us from the world we wanna see
I am scared that I won't get it right
But fear won't rule my heart tonight

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change

I can change
I can change
I can still change
I can still change
