The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad day light
Zombie he done lost his soul
Zombie he don't ever get old

Lord of darkness king of light
Come, come here on this stormy night
There is no star in the sky
I see fire in the dead man's eye

Touch me, touch me, fix my hand
Let me see what's in the sand
Man is boy, and boy is man
There ain't no boss there ain't no man

I'll spit my spit in your spit
Then let seven snakes come up from the pit
I'll stand under this mango tree
till you come, come to me

A spider crawled across my face
Spreading its web on the human race
Jingo, Jingo he ain't dead
He can see from the back of his head

They tied ten onions 'round my naval string
Then they cut it and they baked it and made it into a ring
Come on Shango, Satan come to me
Let me speak what I can't see

Chorus
Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye
