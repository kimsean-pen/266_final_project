My love took me down to the river to silence me
And when he left I could not speak
I lay on the ground
I tried to scream
But no sound did come out
I could only bleed, oooh

I waited for him til the frost did come
My skin, it turned blue and my body was numb
But my heart it burned out til it was no more
Still I wait on the ground
I don't know what for

There, there is a heart in here
Where, where is the heart in here

This love's killing me but I want it to
So long you're gone
Just like I always knew
But I'm still here waiting for you
Here waiting for you

My love took me down to the river to silence me
And when he left I could not speak
And what he said to me I can never say
Because it's breaking my heart til this very day

There, there is a heart in here
Where, where is the heart in here

This love's killing me but I want it to
So long you're gone
Just like I always knew
But I'm still here waiting for you
Here waiting for you
My love took me down to the river to silence me
