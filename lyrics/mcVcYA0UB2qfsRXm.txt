Is there anything that can make you happy?
I don't know what to say to make it better
Seeing you like this, down and hurt so badly, when you have
been so kept together
What's this
All this time I thought you didn't need me
Now I've gone from you and now you tell me

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy why couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you're telling me

You were nonchalant, strong and unaffected, and you never
wanted me to be there
I never saw your heart, that's how close you kept it
So right now I'm so unsure how to care
What's this
All this time I thought you didn't need me
Now I've gone from you and now you tell me

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy I couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you tell me
You were nonchalant, strong and unaffected and you never
wanted me to be there
I never saw your heart that's how close you kept it
So right now I'm so unsure how to care
what's this?

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy why couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you tell me

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy why couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you tell me

No attention was given
no affection from you to heal the hurt
I was hoping
I was wishing just to listen and to hear those words.

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy why couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you tell me

You're in love but that was not what it was
All those times that pass by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me boy why couldn't I see and my heart don't
agree with what you tell me
