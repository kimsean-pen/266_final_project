Your love's a bonnie snare
Traps me in the evening
Got me hanging in mid-air
Now I'm swinging from the ceiling

But it's me that's looking now
It's me that's seeking something
When you're nowhere to be found
Must I keep on looking

I'll be you, be me and I'll be you
I'll take your truth, your lies, your secrets
How about you be me and I'll be you
I love your strength, your pride, your weakness

My love's an androgen
She writes when I'm in slumber
My lover is all good things
And I'm the fool whose spell she's under

She laid a silken thread
A warm scent in the evening
If you follow the trail of dead
You'll come upon the place she's sleeping

I'll be you, be me and I'll be you
And we won't say no more about it
How about you be me and I'll be you
And we'll just leave it where we found it

I'll be you, be me and I'll be you
And we won't say no more about it
How about you be you and I'll be me
And we'll just leave it where we found it
