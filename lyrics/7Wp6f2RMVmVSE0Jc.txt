The music's slowly dying,
and I'm jumping outta my jeans
I jump into the bed,
you're there already waiting for me

Ain't this a perfect way, to spend the nite
there ain't no better way, of killing time,
than loving you, cos your my girl

It's reached top speed, and I'm getting inside of you
this is hot stuff Mamma, taste it, It sure tastes good
yes it does

It's maybe cold outside, but in you the fire is burning
and when you bite me woman, love is hurting

Oh Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony on the radio
first a little bit too fast, and then a little bit much too slow
Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony I heard today
first a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow
for me

I wake up in the morning and I feel,
the pain in my head
if it's rest I need I'd rather be dead,
no destination in this life I live
no expectations I just drift and drift,
and drift

Life is like Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony on the radio
first a little bit too fast, and then a little bit much too slow
Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony I heard today
first a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow
For me For me

Life is like Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony on the radio
first a little bit too fast, and then a little bit much too slow
Tragedy life reminds me bout, a symphony I heard today
first a little bit too fast and then a little bit much too slow
For me For me
