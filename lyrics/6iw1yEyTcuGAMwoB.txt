I think it's finally sinking in
I am nothing but a product of your sin
Hoping for the best but now I'm standing watching hands of time
Oh, moving like a guillotine and swiftly counting down my life
And it goes on and on and on

We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down
Even if the world was ending now
We are the broken, but don't cry for me

I think I finally understand
The world is spinning off its course, all part of the plan
But like phoenix from the ashes I have risen from the deepest cliff
And the only thing I love is the only thing that keeps my pain
And it goes on and on and on

We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down
Even if the world was ending now
We are the broken, but don't cry for me

We are the revolution
We are the ending
And we will never give up
Never let go
So what's the resolution?
Never let go (Resolution)

And even if the sky comes crashing down
Even if the world was ending now
It goes on and on and on!

We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down
Even if the world was ending now
We are the broken generation, it goes on and on and on
