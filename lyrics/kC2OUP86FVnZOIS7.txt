In the moonlight walk the shapes
That you never see
To the dawn, the supreme rage burn
Of unholy spirits
They hunger for your life
Which doesn't really exist
Because their will
Is to see you suffer

They... hunger... for your... life

Only true believers
Will find their strength
When Satan's power
Show It's real face
The demons beneath the dark throne gathers
And they will bring you
Mental funeral

They... hunger... for your... life
