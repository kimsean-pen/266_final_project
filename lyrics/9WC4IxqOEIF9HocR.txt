I should have seen dad more
I should have been around
And all those conversations we had before I found out

I remember missing all your calls
And how they went round and around
And that time you told me you loved me
And couldn't feel more proud

That tattoo of your name
The number of your age
I don't know what to say, I still think about you
And those pictures in mum's house
That I touch when I'm around

And that ring you wore
I kept it by my side
I promise that I'll keep it forever and I'll treasure it
Because it's all I have

I remember missing all your calls
And how they went round and around
And that time you told me you loved me
And couldn't feel more proud

That tattoo of your name
The number of your age
I don't know what to say, I still think about you
And those pictures in mum's house
That I touch when I'm around
