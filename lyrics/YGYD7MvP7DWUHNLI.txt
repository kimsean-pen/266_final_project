Get out while you can,
There's only one door
I met you here the last time
And you're back again for more
I don't know what to say to you,
You never take commands
You're better than I thought you were,
My fate is in your hand

Oh, from the belly of the beast
From the famine to the feast
And when you fall down to your knees
She's a tropical disease

Oh... Disease... Oh...

Come-a knocking on my door,
I don't like your kind
I didn't like you last time,
Some things are better left behind
You are not welcome here
But this is all you know
You're better than I though you were,
We haven't got a hope

Oh, from the belly of the beast
From the famine to the feast
And when you fall down to your knees
She's a tropical disease

Oh, from the belly of the beast
From the famine to the feast
And when you fall down to your knees
She's a tropical disease

Oh... Disease... Oh... Disease... Oh... Disease... Oh...

Oh, from the belly of the beast
From the famine to the feast
And when you fall down to your knees
She's a tropical disease

Oh, from the belly of the beast
From the famine to the feast
And when you fall down to your knees
She's a tropical...
A tropical...
A tropical...
A tropical...
A tropical disease
