Don't give it to me, don't give it to me
I can't help but make it break
Grinding my teeth, grinding my teeth
A feeling I cannot shake

You're the glass in my hands
You're the pain in advance
I don't know how to keep
My heart on my sleeve
You're the car crash and burn
You're the scars, never learn
I guess that I can't keep
Nice things around me

I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I can't have nice things
I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I can't have nice things

Say what you need, say what you need
I know that it's getting old
But I can't breath
But I can't breathe, yeah
Knowing I let you go

You're the glass in my hands
You're the pain in advance
I don't know how to keep
My heart on my sleeve
You're the car crash and burn
You're the scars, never learn
I guess that I can't keep
Nice things around me

I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I, I, can't
I can't have nice things

I warned you now to give
Me things I can easily break
I heard it smash when
I looked deep into your pretty face
Wish I could stay with you
And love you in so many ways

I, I, can't
I can't have nice things
I warned you now to give
Me things I can easily break
I heard it smash when
I looked deep into your pretty face
Wish I could stay with you and
Love you in so many ways
(Love you, love you)
I, I can't
I can't have nice things
I warned you now to give
Me things I can easily break
I heard it smash when
I looked deep into your pretty face
Wish I could stay with you and
Love you in so many ways
(Love you, love you)
I, I can't
'Cause I break all my things
