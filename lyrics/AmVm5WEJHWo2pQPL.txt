My skins got spots and they shine in the spotlights
Hair so soft under certain hot light
Teeth can bite but they not so white
I'm pretty 'cause I've got awesome looks

Sometimes I'm insecure
At least I'm sure 'bout that
But does it really matter?
When I know it ain't all 'bout that
You can go feel my energy
It's nothing but good vibes
Nothing really matters
No I ain't gotta hide

Watch me be my own type of pretty
I don't need to be hyped to feel me
Sitting in my bed alone, dressed in jams, in my zone
Watch me be my own type of pretty

My lips are chapped 'cause I keep on stressing
I hope my flaws don't need addressing
I gotta say it's quite depressing
That people don't see these things are blessings

Sometimes I'm insecure
At least I'm sure 'bout that
But does it really matter?
When I know it ain't all 'bout that
You can go feel my energy
It's nothing but good vibes
Nothing really matters
No I ain't gotta hide

Watch me be my own type of pretty
I don't need to be hyped to feel me
Sitting in my bed alone, dressed in jams, in my zone
Watch me be my own type of pretty

Mum, I got hair on my arms
Mum, I got hair everywhere
The kids in school said I'm not too pretty
And they laughed out loud but it's not so witty to me
Do you think that I'm ugly? Do you think that I'm not?
If they say I'm different is it a good thing? Is it not?
So I told 'em so honestly, so perfectly, so pretty damn nicely

To watch me be my own type of pretty
I don't need to be hyped to feel me
Sitting in my bed alone, dressed in jams, in my zone
Watch me be my own type of pretty
