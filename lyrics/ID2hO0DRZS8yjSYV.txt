Hang on to me my love
We've only got 100 years
And then it's time to face the truth
Naked judge and naked flesh

We'll build memories of us
Lavish plots and little time
We'll believe in what we trust
But we don't know what we don't know

Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)
Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)

Hang on to me my love
We only have what we design
And all the angst and all concern
Leave them here and watch them burn

Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)
Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)

And the truth, it came
The truth, it went away
And the truth it came
And went away

And the truth, it came
The truth, it went away
And the truth it went away

Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)
Tell me now, who are you listening to? (ooh)
Tell me now, why not me? (ooh ooh)
