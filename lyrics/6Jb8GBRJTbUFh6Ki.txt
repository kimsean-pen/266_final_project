While you were sleeping
I thought of you
Oceans and distance
And time went on
As we were dreaming
Praying the answers
Will come in time
To see us through

Summer's almost gone
And you're not coming home
You're not coming home
But I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone

Now that we're apart
I
I realize
I missed the moon
Looking at the stars

Summer's almost gone
And you're not coming home
You're not coming home
But I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone

And I can't stand tall
No I can't stand tall
When I lift my head
Everything just falls

I can't stand tall
No I can't stand tall
When I raise my head
My knees make me crawl

Summer's almost gone
And you're not coming home
And I heard that you moved on
But I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone
I'm still left alone
