If this is the way it's going to be
Then I am so sure
That life is lost
It's only thrill and it's tomorrow

I can't see your face
'Cause I'm a looking at
I can't see your face
'Cause I'm a looking at you

The way you walk
The way you step on through
The way you do
All the things you do
The way you walk
The way you step on through
I can't tell truth

My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow is stuck

My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow is stuck

It's like the darkness
All you ever seem to be
And nightmares only
Nake you a memory

I can't see your face
'Cause I'm a looking at
I can't see your face
'Cause I'm a looking at you

The way you walk
The way you step on through
The way you do
All the things you do
The way you walk
The way you step on through
I can't tell truth

My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow is stuck

My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow
My shadow is stuck

I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well
And I don't really care
'Cause I don't feel too well
'Cause I'm a looking at you
