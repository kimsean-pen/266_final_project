I can show you the way down
Let you see if you want to
There's no other way around
To feel inside you
And all I ever wanted
Was for you to come unglued
And all I confronted
Never seemed to come true

I can't feel no more
It feels like I'm walking in reverse
With no one behind me
I can't see no more
I'm blinded by what's become of us
I fight the future

Now I'm hanging on the wall
No knife to cut down
You could follow my call
But you end up knocked down
I've seen it all before
I know my way around
I can't beat the score
With my feet pinned down

I fight the future

I can't feel no more
It feels like I'm walking in reverse
With no one behind me
I can't see no more
I'm blinded by what's become of us
I fight the future
I fight the future
