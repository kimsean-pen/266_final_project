All around this town
People stop and stare
I can feel their eyes
Upon me
See it in the face
There's no body there
I've felt that look before
They don't want me here

They don't want me
They don't want me here
(repeats)

Love got up and left
You won't find it here
Sorrow is the king
Long live him
Empathy's a child
Lost amongst the crowd
And theatres star a man
If he's dyin'
All the greener leaves
Turn a shade of grey
And are trodden in the path
Of the many
Said: I'm looking for love
They don't want me here
They don't want me
They don't want me here
(repeats)
