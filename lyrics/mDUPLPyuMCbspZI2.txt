Sat on the rooftop
Watching the birds flying free
Watching the clouds walk
And watching the rain become the sea
Hearing my love talk
Every breath she ever breathes
Like it was always supposed to be like that

But then we broke up
And she went west and I went east
She got a new boyfriend
A little too soon if you're asking me
I heard that she loves him
A little bit more than she'll ever love me
And it was always supposed to be like that

I look to the skyline
And said how many falls until I fly
Look to the old times and said
How many roads until I find
And oh it's tough now
Cause love always, love always is unkind

I sat on the rooftop
And I watched the birds flying free
I watched the clouds walk
And I watched the rain become the sea
And just for a moment, just for a moment
I felt so free from all I'm supposed to be

I look to the skyline and said
How many falls until I fly
Look to the old times I said
How many roads until I find
And oh it's tough now
Cause love always, love always is unkind
