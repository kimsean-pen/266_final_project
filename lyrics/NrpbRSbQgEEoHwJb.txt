We were standing all alone
You were leaning in to speak to me
Acting like a mover, shaker
Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me
And I think about it all the time
Sweet temptation rush all over me
And I think about it all the time

Passion, desire so intense, I can't take anymore because
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe

I've gotta be chained to you
And when you look into my eyes
Felt a sudden sense of urgency
Fascination casts a spell and
You became more than just a mystery
And I think about you all the time

Is this fate, is it my destiny
And I think about you all the time
I'm no longer pretend to have my hands on the wheel because
I feel the magic all around you

It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
(I feel the magic, movin' around you)

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe

I've gotta be chained to you
And I think about you all the time
Yeah, I think about it all the time
(Tell me it's madness, I barely know you)

We were standing all alone
You were leaning in to speak to me
(Ten steps back, you're still a mystery)
Acting like a mover, shaker

Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me
I can't take anymore because
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe

I've gotta be chained to you
(I feel the magic, movin' around you)
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
(Tell me it's madness, I barely know you)
I feel the magic all around you
(Oh you, you)
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe
(Oh yeah)
I've gotta be chained to you
(I feel the magic, movin' around you)
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like I wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
(You you you, you, you, you)
(Tell me it's madness, I barely know you)
I feel the magic all around you
It's all around you brining me to my knees
(Like a wanna be)
Wanna feel, gotta feel
(I've gotta be chained to you)
Wanna be, wanna be, gotta be
Wanna be, gotta be, wanna be, gotta be
