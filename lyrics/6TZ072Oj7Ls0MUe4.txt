It'ss up for discussion, up for reprise
Slowly re-thinking if
current disguise deceives me

The shattered ring
I can see it in your eyes
Ready or not, loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of

I know you'd rather just disappear

Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather
Giddy up Goldilocks, you took to long to save me
Bumping that Jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
Open my candy box, for you sir, sugar daddy
Look at how drunk we are, spent the night, dancing
(spent the night, dancing)
Ready or not, loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather
Take me up x2
I wanna live through you. I love you
Ready or not
Take me up take me up x2, in your hot love balloon
Take me up x2
I wanna live through you. I love you
Ready or not take me up (take me up x2)
