(verse)
When i woke up
was so proud to see you lying naked next to me
and the clothes you wore,
the night before
were lying on my bedroom floor and,

(bridge)
this is, how i, want it to be
you know it
i want it that way

(chorus)
baby, i don't no what to say
its like that everyday
i've never felt this way
yeah, yeah
i just, don't no what to do
if i can't be with you, girl you no its true
i love that thing you do.

(verse)
Seen everything
i dreamt it all
last night we did it in the waterfall
then you turned round
all i could see
was beautiful simplicity

(bridge)
this is, how i, want it to be
you know it
i want it that way

(chorus)
baby, i don't no what to say
its like that everyday
i've never felt this way
yeah, yeah
i just, don't no what to do
if i can't be with you, girl you no its true
i love that thing you do (x4)
coz i love that thing you do yeah!

(chorus)
baby i dont no what to say
its like that everyday
i've never felt this way
yeah yeah

if i can't be with you, girl you no its true
