Well a cursed had brought on me
Drives me complete insane
It fux me up tears up my kind
it's eatin up my brain...
I'm a walkin talkin nightmare
the kind you don't like to meet
I wear the mark right after dark
and hide behind the tree...

Damned that bitch put a cursed on...
She put that evil cursed on me
Damned that bitch put a cursed on...
Evil cursed on me
Evil cursed on me yeah
Ratttatatatatata... Cursed

Well i'm followin that death trail
untill they lock me up
cruising down the country side with
bodies in my trunk
So don't ya cross my path
make sure ya stay away...
Or they'll put ya picture on the wall
askin have ya seen me?

Damned that bitch put a cursed on...
