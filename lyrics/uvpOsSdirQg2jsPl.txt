D, I got the dope

You put your body on me
Feel, feeling different lately
From your head to your toes
To the way you put on
You're my midnight lover
Baby, hands round your neck
Love it best when you're wet
Baby, under the covers

When I think about you
When I think about you
When I think about you, yeah
When I think about you, you, you, you

Girl, get your body on me
Girl, everything you got I need
From your head to your toes
To the way you put on
You're my midnight lover
Baby, hands round your neck
Love it best when you're wet
Baby, under the covers

When I think about you
When I think about you
When I think about you, yeah
When I think about you, you, you, you

When I think about you
When I think about you, sweat

When I think about you
When I think about you
When I think about you, yeah
When I think about you, you, you, you

Oh, oh, sweat, sweat, sweat
Oh, oh, sweat, sweat, sweat
