Tell me what's wrong with you now, tell me why i
never seem to make you happy though heaven knows i try
what does it take to please you? tell me just how
i can satisfy you woman, you're drivin' me wild
(chorus)
break up to make up, that's all we do
first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.
break up to make up that's all we do,
first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.
When i come home from workin', you're on the phone
talkin' about how bad i treat you, now tell me i'm wrong
you say it's me who argues, i'll say it's you
we have got to get together or baby, we're through.
(chorus)
break up to make up, that's all we do
first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.
break up to make up, that's all we do
yeah, first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.


break up to make up, that's all we do
yeah, first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.
Break up to make up, that's all we do,
first you love me then you hate me, that's a game for fools.
