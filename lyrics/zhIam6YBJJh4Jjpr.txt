Ayy, we up, ayy
Max c'mon we gotta do one take and shit
I don't wanna even need no lean so pump it up

New nigga on the block, yeah I got my Glocky
Look like I've been locked up, arms kinda stocky
Wrist on rocky, wish a nigga tried to stop me
Usain Bolt with the glizzy it's a track meet
Make him take off like Migos
In the kitchen whippin'
Up the bricks, servin' kilos
If I gotta get in your door I pick the key-hole
Full of shit, bitches, boy these hoes like A-holes
Every day I wake up, thinkin' 'bout the Pesos
Gettin' bankrolls, sayin' RIP to Bankroll
Keep the dank rolled
Codeine in the double cup I'm sippin', ayy
Stevie Wonder, it's gonna take away my vision, ayy
Double 07, with that Glock, I got precision, ayy
You be talkin' 'bout the shit, when I been did it, ayy
Free my niggas in that jam (Yeah)
I don't give a shit, and I don't give a Hoover damn
Last bitch said I wasn't shit
You wanna let me cram (Bitch)
Hit it from the back, oh yes, ah yeah
Chopper make your brains turn to eggs, Sam-I-Am
I had a feelin' they was gon' switch up, Will I Am
Two pints of Wockhardt, sealed up, in my hand
Clean nigga, but I'm sippin' 'til I do the muddy dance

Broke nigga, I got rich and now I do the money dance

Feel like Hugh Hefner
These bitches finna do the bunny dance
On the dick, for a trick

Then after that she fucked her friend
I ain't gonna trick off no bitch, I don't pay, I just get in

I ain't really usually the one to be talking my shit, but
I think I'm finna talk my shit one time for the one time
Two times, maybe a few times
Ruinin' careers, man this shit easy
What my nigga Davis say, this shit beyond me, yo, ayy
Okay I'm back in, getting it crackin', with ya broad

After she helped me get my rocks off
She fucked the squad
They think I'm a bitch because they

Heard the sad songs, that's a fa√ßade
I'm on them niggas that'll have
An atheist screamin' out to God
I don't want no problems, really
I'm just tryna get my sack up
But if it's a problem, bruh gon' come
And shoot you from the neck up
That bitch a lil' giraffe the way
She bend over and neck us
Got killers, Texas silver black berettas
If they disrespect us
Way, way, way, way, way, way
Out my way, way, way, way (Fuck out my way)
Way, way, way, way, way, way (Bitch, way)
Out my way, way, way, way (Get the fuck out my way)
Way, way, way, way, way, way (Bitch, way)
Out my way, way, way, way (Get the fuck out my way)
Way, way, way, way, way, way (C'mon)
Out my way, way, way, way (Get the fuck out my way)
