I cant forget the day you left me
Nights of love, the nights of fear
You made me feel Im your desire
Could I feel this flame again?

Chorus:

Anywhere tonight
Walking side by side
I wanna hear your voice
I wanna see your eyes
Anywhere tonight (night-tonight)
Walking side by side (side by side)
I wanna feel your breath
Hold me tonight

My days are turning into darkness
I lost the chance, I lost my dreams
In empty streets I walk to find you
Only the wind can hear my cry

Chorus

You set my heart on fire
You are my own desire
I wanna see your eyes
Hold me tonight

Chorus
