I don't want to grow up
I don't want to grow up

If growing up means being like you
Then I don't want to be like you
Recycled trash
It's deja vu

I don't want to grow up
I don't want to grow up

You're grown up told what to do
Your suit can't hide the truth
You're a fool
And I refuse to be like you

I don't want to grow up
