Ever since we happened on a glance in Khyber's Caf√©
I will always thank God for the chance He gave us that day
Pleasant conversation on a break, a break from the band
You were then and have always been a perfect gentleman

You love me
Nobody else would do it
You hear me
Nobody else would listen
You see me
Nobody else would notice
I'm special in your life

Going to bed each evening with a dream of having a child
Starting all our mornings with a kiss, a hug and a smile
Sharing all our feelings with a friend, the good and the bad
'Cause you're the very best friend that I've ever had!

You love me
Nobody else would do it
You hear me
Nobody else would listen
You see me
Nobody else would notice
I'm special in your life

I love you, I need you, oh so desperately
I can't, can't live without you
Take my hand, take my heart
You're the man that I want
Here I am
You can have it all because

You love me
Nobody else would do it
You hear me
Nobody else would listen
You see me
Nobody else would notice
I'm special in your life
