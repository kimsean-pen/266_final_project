Tell me exactly what you want
And then tell me what to say
'Cause I can't keep it straight
They keep changing all the rules
And I don't know how to play these games

I'm staying in
My hair's not right
And if I go out
Somebody might
Take me for a functioning
Human being

I can't control my face
I try to keep it neutral
But sometimes it moves and it betrays
Some inner wiring
That makes you want to look away

I'm staying in
My hair's not right
And if I go out
Somebody might
Take me for a functioning
Human being

I'm up with the birds
Breakfast in the dark
Then violently tired
Fall back into bed
Sleep right through the light
Something's wrong inside
Systems are not unified

Staying in
My hair's not right
And if I go out
Somebody might
Take me for a functioning
Human being
