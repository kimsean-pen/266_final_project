It started out as any other story
Then the words begin to fade away
All your smile used to make me smile
But lately I don't feel that way
Try to remember what brought us together
And to forget what's driving us apart
You know we can't wait here forever

Just making time and going no where
Is this our last dance
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still
Are we wasting time chasing dreams
Not yours or mine
Care for you

I always will
We can try to keep the love from fading
Cuz' all we have a reasons to be gone
Remember when you used to make me smile
But lately I don't feel the same
Look up and I see your face
I can see you looking back at me
Every time I think it's getting better

Just making time and going no where
Is this our last dance
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still
Are we wasting time chasing dreams
Not yours or mine
Care for you

I always will
You know I always will

But there's no looking back
And no more need to cry
No more need to cry

No more need to cry
Is this all we have

Should we walk away at last
To be alone together still
Are we wasting time chasing dreams
Not yours or mine
Care for you
I always will
You know I always will
