Chains of despair cloaked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries, the dying world

[chorus:]
Madness in its sweetest form, what shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth and melancholy grew

Anticipation mender through madness, condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds, how sharp the awakening
Pale as disease.Mocking... Maddening...
Give up the ghost, cease the gloomy awakening

History foretold, the hidden stigmata
Totally annihilating the ecstasis innumerable, materialize the vision
Give up the ghost, cease the gloomy awakening
