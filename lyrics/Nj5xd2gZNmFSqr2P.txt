Trapped in heaven life style (Locked in Long Kesh)
You're looking out for pleasure (H-block torture)
It's at the end of the rainbow (White noise in)
The happy ever after (A white room)

Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
It's at the end of the rainbow

Dig at the root of the problem (Fly the flag on foreign soil)
It breaks your new dreams daily (H-block Long Kesh)
Father's contradictions (Censor six counties' news)
And breaks your new dreams daily (Each day more deaths)

White noise in a white room
