Left alone
Your pale skin is a razor sharp wire
So I place these scales over my eyes
Don't touch me, I'm sick.
You whisper, but I hear only what I choose

Hello my good old friend.
Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare
And wonder if she is way back there?
But afterwards my mouth
Will be filled with gravel
And I'm left alone

You know that feeling of fear
And desperation in the pit
Of your stomach making you nauseous
Excitement, apprehension,
You wish you could lose it all
Hello my good old friend.

Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare
And wonder if she is way back there?
But afterwards my mouth
Will be filled with gravel
And I'm left alone

The fear of dealing with this is
stronger than the fear of just forgetting this
And future, I am scared of you
Left alone

Hello my good old friend.
Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare And wonder
if she's way back there?

I swear I will find my way back
I swear I will find my way back to the light
I swear, I swear
Now that I'm left alone.
I'm left alone.
