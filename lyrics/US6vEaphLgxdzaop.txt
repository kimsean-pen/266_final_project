Heads high
Throw me the dice
Gonna break the odds
Make you feel alive
And the game is on

Midnight, million lights
It our time to shine
Get your dark side out
Well you're free to try - You will feel alive
If you can prove us right - With the dark side out

Can't stop now
Can't give up, it's too late for us
Believe us
The field is our battleground

You can try to defeat me, you won't win
You won't beat me on the field
My fortitude beyond unreal
If you dare interfere me
Slow me down or impede me
I guarantee
My vengeance will be so unreal

Half time
Live to win
Going to reach the stars
Never give it in
Well the fight goes on - Well the fight goes on
Until the war is won - Until the war is won

Step up break the ice
Gonna knock them down
It's my time to shine - In this world of sin
And my time is now - We are here to win

Can't stop now
Can't give up it's too late for ups
Can't hide what
I feel inside, you won't deny
Can't feel that
I should step down, I won't allow it
Believe us
The field is our battleground

You can try to defeat me, you won't win
You won't beat me on the field
My fortitude beyond unreal
If you dare interfere me
Slow me down or impede me
I guarantee
My vengeance will be so unreal

Can't stop now
Can't give up it's too late for ups
Believe us
The field is our battleground

You can try to defeat me, you won't win
You won't beat me on the field
My fortitude beyond unreal
If you dare interfere me
Slow me down or impede me
I guarantee
My vengeance will be so unreal
