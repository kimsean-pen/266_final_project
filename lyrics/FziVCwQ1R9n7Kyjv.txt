For millions of years, in millions of homes
A man loved a woman, a child it was born
It learned how to hurt and it learned how to cry
Like Humans Do

I'm breathin' in
I'm breathin' out
So slip inside this funky house
Dishes in the sink
TV's in repair
Don't look at the floor
Don't go up the stairs

I'm achin'
I'm shakin'
I'm breakin'
Like Humans Do

I work & I sleep & I dance & I'm dead
I'm eatin', I'm laughin', I'm lovin' myself
I never watch TV except when I'm stoned
Like Humans Do

I'm breathin' in
I'm breathin' out
So slip inside this funky house
Dishes in the sink
TV's in repair
Don't look at the floor
Don't go up the stairs

I'm achin'
I'm shakin'
I'm breakin'
Like Humans Do

I'm breathin' in
I'm breathin' out
So slip inside this funky house
Wiggle while you work
Anybody can
The rain is pourin' in on a woman & a man

I'm achin'
I'm shakin'
I'm breakin'
Like Humans Do
I'm breathin in'
I'm breathin' out

Ohhh
