A man is hunting me,
This figure stalking me in starlight.
I'm running out of time.
The darkness hides my trail,
He knows not by which way I travel.
The golden path of my desire.

By way of kingdom,
By way of force,
By way of empire,
By way of time,
The strong survive.

And when the morning comes,
I see the morning star above me.
A symbol of my destiny.
To meet my enemy,
To know you don't think the way that I do,
That you will die and I survive.

By way of kingdom,
By way of force,
By way of empire,
By way of time,
The strong survive.
