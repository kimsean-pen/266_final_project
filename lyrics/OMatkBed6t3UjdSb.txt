The warnings lined the edges between us
We were holding out
Escape in time to play down what leaves us
We were holding out

(No hiding what seized us)
In the climb, I was there for the deep
Thought you'd see and let go
(No hiding what seized us)
Now your desert was comforting me
But the burn wanted more
(No hiding what seized us)
When you clawed into me
Did you see that the wild was the road?
(No hiding what seized us)
Fall into me
Let the fires just reach and let go

Why'd you lie in the carnage with me?
Why'd you gift me your fallout?
You were right, it was on us to see
We were holding out

(No hiding what seized us)
In the climb, I was there for the deep
Thought you'd see and let go
(No hiding what seized us)
Now your desert was comforting me
But the burn wanted more
(No hiding what seized us)
When you clawed into me
Did you see that the wild was the road?
(No hiding what seized us)
Fall into me
Let the fires just reach and let go

I want to keep your head up,
I know it's time
Feel a little lighter,
I want to see the skies war,
I know it's time
Bleed out in the mire,
I fill you with the fight,
For I know it's time
Getaways get wilder,
I seal you with a cry, you

In the climb, I was there for the deep
Thought you'd see and let go
(No hiding what seized us)
Now your desert was comforting me
But the burn wanted more
(No hiding what seized us)
When you clawed into me
Did you see that the wild was the road?
(No hiding what seized us)
Fall into me
Let the fires just reach and let go
(No hiding what seized us)

Sign the night in me, once you feel it,
Let go
(No hiding what seized us)
Hide it, darling, bleed on the leaves,
Let me go
(No hiding what seized us)
I'm wide awake, the forest,
The blundering cold
(No hiding what seized us)
I'm awake when the dark is asleep,
Won't you feel it? Let go
(No hiding what seized us)
I'm awake when the dark is asleep,
Won't you feel it? Let go
(No hiding what seized us)
I'm awake when the dark is asleep,
Won't you feel it? Let go
