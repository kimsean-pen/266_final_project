I suppose one, one, one who hasn't seen
The earlier frames
Could say I am advancing up this road
I am advancing

Pale as a banshee sun
Think I should stop checking myself out
In the windows of cars
When I could see my future in her pictures of relatives

How simple my heart can be
How simple my heart can be
Frightens me

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Your hand was on me
It seemed like you were being sweet
Here I am again at the reserve to drink

It's not that I thought
Like all of a sudden you change
We were covered in each other's snot
In my childhood bed
It seemed like we were being sweet
Her pictures of relatives

How simple my heart can be
How simple my heart can be
Frightens me

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

Don't worry
We will both find out
Just not together

We will find out
Here I am again at the reserve to drink
