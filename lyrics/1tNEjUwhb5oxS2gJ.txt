Waiting for the axe to fall

Sun is sinking, clouds collecting

I'm in a race to
Stop the bleeding me

My will is leaving darkness falling

Need to finally cut
Me from you

I need to learn to love me

I need to stop this suicide
Machine

I need to learn to love me

I need to stop this destruction

I need
To learn to love me
