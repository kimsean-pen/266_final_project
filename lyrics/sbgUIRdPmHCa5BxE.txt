Strain, living with a name
They get the best of me
But I'm no walker away
I don't complain, I got much to gain
So they keep testing me
And I keep feeding their face
But they could go
Off and hit the road
And what would I care
I like going nowhere
I got the reigns
And courage I was made of
And they've got fake love
So I know I must show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

Pearl, necklaces and girls
And all the pretty things
I ain't seeking to have
It's safe to say if I don't get this out of me
I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad
Cross my t's
Try to dot my i's
But that's just blinding me
I ain't living that way
I roll my sleeves and make a better man of me
Or I might easily
Just give up on this show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my show

I must show
It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

And my show
It's my show
