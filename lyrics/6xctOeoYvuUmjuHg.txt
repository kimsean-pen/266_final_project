You know what I see?
I see everyday
The face I love so much
With smiles and a laugh

Sometimes you seem so sad, darling
But, I see you're dreaming of something
And I dreamed of you

We needed each other more than a sleep or eat
We think about the same thing all day
That's what we call love

You know what I see?
I see everyday
Your eyes I love so much
Filled with hopes and me

Sometimes you seem so happy
That's because of me
Please, say so, that you dreamed of me

We needed each other more than a sleep or eat
We think about the same thing all day
That's what we call love

You know what I see?
I see everyday
