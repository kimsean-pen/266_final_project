Whoa, I woke up and I saw the face of a guy
I don't know who he was, he had no eyes

His presence made me feel elated
His presence made me feel, all elated oh, oh

It's on the final hour, it's on the final hour
Of myself, of myself

God I wanna get rid of it
God I wanna get, get rid of it, yeah, yeah
Get rid of it

My house, my bed, my husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands

We're standing here all alone
When my heart was close and my mouth went numb
Does he know me very well?

When you talk in the dark will I see him again?
Will I see him again?

It's on the final hour, it's on the final hour
Of myself, of myself

God I wanna get rid of it
God I wanna get, get rid of it, yeah, yeah
Get rid of it

My house, my bed, my husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands
My room, my life
My husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands
