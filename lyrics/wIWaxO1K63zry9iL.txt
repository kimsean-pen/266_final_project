I wish that we were on TV
Just like in Pokemon
You'd be a Pika-girl, In the Poke world
Yes, life would be so fun
I'd be a trainer boy, and I would make the choice
To go and search for you
I'd throw my pokeball, and I would catch them all
You'd be my Pikachu
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Oh, I won the gym badge, but you won my heart (pika!)
Pika girl, In the poke world
And now that I've got you, we can never part (chu)
The pokeball in my life's open for you (pika!)
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Just like in Pokemon
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Oh, I won the gym badge, but you won my heart (pika!)
Pika girl, In the poke world
And now that I've got you, we can never part (chu)
The pokeball in my life's open for you (pika!)
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Just like in Pokemon
I'd bring you sweets, like rare candy's
Level up your love to give
And then you'd use right then, a sweet kiss TM
Super effective
Not even the Elite Four could stop us ever more
Together we can't fall
Our bond would never break, and there'd be no mistake
Our love would conquer all
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Oh, I won the gym badge, but you won my heart (pika!)
Pika girl, In the poke world
And now that I've got you, we can never part (chu)
The pokeball in my life's open for you (pika!)
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Just like in Pokemon
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Oh, I won the gym badge, but you won my heart (pika!)
Pika girl, In the poke world
And now that I've got you, we can never part (chu)
The pokeball in my life's open for you (pika!)
You're my pika girl, In the poke world
Just like in Pokemon
