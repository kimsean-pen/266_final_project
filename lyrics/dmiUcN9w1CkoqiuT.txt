I see trouble coming,
Trying to change my ways.
Take a little piece of me,
And squeeze what blood remains.
Joke and jive, and fool you,
Slip that sugar past your nose.
Hope when all is said and done,
You'll slip on an overdose.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Who is it that they're fooling?
Not this mothers son.
I'm screaming out for someone,
Whose life ain't on the run.
I know what you're looking for,
Just can't get enough.
Trapped inside a caged mind,
Playing it ready, and rough.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
You better run, run, run.
You better run, run, run.
You better run.
Yes you have my loving,
All your dirty tricks.
When you proved, you left a scar,
And now I want my licks.
You're a victim of blind disease.
All the tears won't help you,
Cause I want you on your knees.
Run for you life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run...
RUN
FOR
YOUR
LIFE!
