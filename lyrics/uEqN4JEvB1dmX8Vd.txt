What are we to ever do, my mind is lead and you're a wall
The lion's den of I'm akin, to sleeping late and eating wrong
Well if I ever got it straight, I think I'd bend at every pause
The action leaking out my face, from breathing paint to missing calls

Well I'm the sugar-coated tooth, and I have come to ruin your mood
While staring at the frozen foot, I realized I'm stupid too
Well farming isn't fun at all, and I will build a thousand malls
And eat the food court's flesh, from every single city

Before you ask what you think you want to know
Take a look at my face and how far you think I'll go
'Cause I've had it up to here for the 37th time this year
And I've kept it bottled down
But not this time, not here

'Cause I'm fucking on one (on one)
Shave it out, you need a break from hair
Coming out bald, I'm the eagle in the air
With the big ass braids and the folding chair
Just shave it out, you need a break from hair

I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over

I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over

Set it up, cover the plans, record everyone, make demands
Positional strategy, split was disastrous, flanking the siege

You've seen me arrive, shed my disguise
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
Keep it alive, fight to survive
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to

You've seen me arrive, shed my disguise (Bit by bit, I recover from this)
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to (Cleanse my palette and validate my gifts)
Keep it alive, fight to survive (Little by little, remove myself from the middle)
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to (Stick it to the man till they bones is brittle, aware?)
