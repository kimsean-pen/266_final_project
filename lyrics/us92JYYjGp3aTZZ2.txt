Daylight has finally reached it's end
as evenfall strikes unto the sky
Far away in the dark glimpsing moonlight
sickening souls cry out in pain

Whispering voices, summoning screams
Waitin for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
possesed by the search of utter darkness

Hear the cries from Mourning Palace
Feel the gloom of restless spirits
Hear the screams from the Mourning Palace
Feel the doom of hauntin gchants

Eternal is their lives in misery
Eternal is their lives in grief
Abandoned in a void of nothingness
A chain of anger, a fetter of despair

In the garden of depraved beings
this unsacred place of helpless ones
Satan blessed the creatures
inwathed them in endless night
Whispering voices, summoning screams
Waitin for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
possesed by the search of utter darkness
