Would you love me
If you found out I never had
No clothes, cars, money?
No clothes, cars, money

Would you still want me
If I told ya I was not a somebody?
Nothing special, nobody

Yeah, I've been lying
Fantasizing that I had it all
I wanna give you more
Than just the person that I was

I wish I was strong
I wish I was everything
I'm feeling it inside my head
Don't let me wake up
The truth is my enemy
Just tell me you're still here

If I was God, what would I change?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Should we keep on
Or should we throw me away?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

I hate to tell ya
But it's all an illusion from the
Hair, lashes, nails, body
Hair, lashes, nails, body

I'm scared to disappoint ya
All I really got is just a
Heartbeat, soul, honest
Heartbeat, soul, honest

It's a secret me
I never showed nobody, no
That everything I wanted
Isn't pathological

I wish it was real
I wish I had everything
I dream of while I'm in bed
Don't let me wake up
The fear of the emptiness
Just let me believe it

If I was God, what would I change?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Should we keep on
Or should we throw me away?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

I don't really wanna leave like nothing's wrong
I don't really wanna give up on our love
I don't really wanna leave like nothing's wrong
I don't really wanna give up on our love, babe

If I was God, what would I change?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Should we keep on
Or should we throw me away?
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money
Love, war, lies, money

If I was God, what would I change?
(Would you still love me, reality?)
(If I wasn't everything you thought I was, illusion)

Should we keep on
(It's not a lie)
Or should we throw me away?
(I just want to give you the best version of me, fantasy)

Ideology, dishonesty
I just wanna protect you from disappointment
Is it really that wrong?
Am I really that wrong?
