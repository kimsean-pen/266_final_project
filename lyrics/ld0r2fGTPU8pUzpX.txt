Don't worry, I won't hurt U...
I only want U 2 have some fun

(I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray)
But when I woke up this morning
I could have sworn it was judgment day

(The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere)
Tryin' to run from the destruction
And you know I didn't even care

'Cuz they say...
2000 zero zero party over oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last

War is all around us
My mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight

'Cuz they say...
2000 zero zero party over oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

(Lemme tell ya somethin'...)
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar

Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away

'Cuz they say...
2000 zero zero party over oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time
So tonight we gonna, we gonna...
(Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

(Say it 1 more time)
2000 zero zero party over oops out of time
No, no
So tonight we gonna, we gonna...
(Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

Alright, it's 1999
You say it, 1999
1999
1999 don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time

2000 zero zero party over oops out of time
Yeah, Yeah
So tonight we gonna, we gonna
(Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

Yeah, 1999
Don'tcha wanna go
Don'tcha wanna go
We could all die any day
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away
Listen 2 what I'm tryin' 2 say...
Everybody, everybody say party
C'mon now, U say party
That's right, everybody say (Party)
Can't run from the revelation, no (Party)
Sing it 4 your nation y'all (Party)
Tell me what you're singin', baby say (Party)
Telephone's a-ringin', mama (Party)
C'mon, c'mon, U say (Party)
Everybody, [two times] (Party)
Work it down 2 the ground, say (Party)
(Party)
Come on, take my body, baby (Party)
That's right, c'mon, sing the song (Party)
(Party)
That's right (Party)
Got a lion in my pocket mama, say (Party)
Oh, and he's ready 2 roar (Party)

Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
