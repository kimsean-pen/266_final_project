Looking for another change
Somewhere else to be
Looking for another place
To ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Where everything seems so pretty
When you're tired and sick of the city
Remember it's a flower made out of clay
To the city
Where everything seems so ugly
When your sitting at home in self pity
Remember you're just one more person
Who's there
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
