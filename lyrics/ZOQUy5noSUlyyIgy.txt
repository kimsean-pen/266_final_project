Come here sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip
About that new breed babe
He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag

Come here mama
And dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy
But his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag

He's doing the Jerk
He's doing the Fly
Don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing the Monkey
The Mashed Potatoes

Jump back Jack
See you later, alligator

Come here sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now

But I can dig that new breed babe
He ain't no drag
He's got a brand new bag

Oh papa! He's doing the Jerk
Papa! He's doing the Jerk
He's doing the twist, just like this
He's doing the Fly
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night
The thing
Like the Boomerang
Hey! Come on
Hey! Hey! Come on
Hey! Hey!
Says he's uptight, out of sight
Come on
See whatcha know
Come on
See whatcha know
