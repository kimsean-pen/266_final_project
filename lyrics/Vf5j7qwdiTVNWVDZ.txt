Where's the muses cave the isle of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone so is the sun
Tired and confused I sail into the night
With the Devil at my shoulder I'll be fine

I ride the straits of darkness everyday
No light will lead my way from my pain
Drowned in tideless pools no haven for my mind
In grief I meet the storm eye to eye

On the ebony throne
Lies the diagonstone
My voyage to vanity
Oh, take me there
To the ebony throne
I followed the sirensong
No enlightened society
Can bring me back

In the maelstrom of minds
Like a will-o-the-wisp
I sail on...

I sail the depths of apathy alone
The world is fading I'm a long way from home
Where's the muses cave the isle of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone so is the sun

On the ebony throne
Lies the diagonstone
My voyage to vanity
Oh, take me there
To the ebony throne
I followed the sirensong
No progressive technology
Can bring me back
