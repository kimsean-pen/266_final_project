It's a big big world
And you can do what you like
You can do anything you want
Because darling, it's your life
But don't go back to Dalston
Don't go up the junction
Don't go round the houses

But just come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

It's a big big world
And you can do take your time
You've got your friends
And I've got mine

Don't go back to Dalston
And no, don't go up the junction
Don't go round the houses

But just come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

Come back, come back, come back
Come back, come back, come back
