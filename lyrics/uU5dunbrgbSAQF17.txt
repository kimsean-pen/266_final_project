Sleeping volcanoes under
This heathen Shambala
Ready to blow molten shell any minute

Help me Armageddon
Help me Armageddon
Help me to be calm
Help me Armageddon
Help me Armageddon
And I'll help you with your song

We're the refugees
Drifting through your trees
A shadow never sleeps
We're all over the world
We're all over the world
We're all over the world
Little boys and girls
Don't forget the old ones too
Someday that might be you
All over the world

Thank you to the authentic fake
A true enigmatic uncle
Welcome to Coo-Coo Land
Home of the fake

Help us Armageddon
Help us Armageddon
Help us every day (Oh won't you too)
Help us Armageddon
Help us Armageddon
We'll help you in every way

In Babylon
Though you wake up and find us gone
Our beat goes on and on
We're all over the world
All over the world
We're all over the world
Don't forget the elders
Someday they might be helter-skelter
All over the world
All over the world
Until the next world
The third world or the next world war
Class war all over this world
We're all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world
We're all over the world
We're over the world
