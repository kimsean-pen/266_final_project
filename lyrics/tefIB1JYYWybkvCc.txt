Take me away, I have no use for a bed
While you change everything
Falling to your knees, I can't feel sorry for you
Cause it's true, you're never there
Everything we are, starting to change before us
As you turn away, posture and grace, I love to watch you crawl

Keep me conjuring, cause you should be alive
You'll be out of it cause you live a lie
Alone

Sovereign circle around the end delay
We live in servitude and can't forgive ourselves
We took the Antabuse, I feel nothing, who's to know?

Take what you want, I have no use for a mirror
Cause it's clear, you never see
Reflections of light deep in the night
Are you sure? Cause you swore you never would
As you turn away, posture and grace, I love to watch you crawl

Sovereign circle around the end delay
We live in servitude and can't forgive ourselves
We took the Antabuse, I feel nothing, who's to know?

Let it shake, let it shake
Let it change, let it change
