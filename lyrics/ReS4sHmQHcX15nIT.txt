twilight fades
through blistered avalon
the sky's cruel torch
on arching autobahn
into the uncertain divine
we scream into the last divine
you make me real
you make me real
strong as i feel
you make me real

sheila rides on crashing nightingale
intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
with blushing brilliance alive
because it's time to arrive

you make me real
you make me real
strong as i feel
you make me real

lately I just can't seem to believe
discard my friends to change the scenery
it meant the world to hold a bruising faith
but now it's just a matter of grace

a summer storm graces all of me
highway warm sing silent poetry
I could bring you the light
and take you home into the night

you make me real
lately I just can't seem to believe
you make me real
discard my friends to change the scenery
strong as i feel
it meant the world to hold a bruising faith
you make me real
but now it's just a matter of grace
