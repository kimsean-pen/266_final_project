Speak
I am listening
Cry
Watch me weep
Wail
Hear me howl
Play
I'll sing for you

You're lucky to be young
Oh, with future in your form
In every season songs
Fill up your lungs

With violence through labour
Delivery
(And all the melodies)

Speak
I will listen

(Speak love, speak love, speak love, speak)
(Speak love, speak love, speak love, speak)

Oh, you're lucky to be young
With future in your form
In every season songs
Fill up your lungs

From violence through labour
Delivery
(And all the melodies)

Speak
I am listening
Cry
And watch me weep
How I wail
Howl and hear me howl
And play
And I will sing for you

You're lucky to be young
With future in your form
In every season songs
Fill up your lungs

From violence and labour
Delivery

Unlucky to be young
To start so near the end
From sleeping in the waters
To waking in the flames
Oh, delivery
