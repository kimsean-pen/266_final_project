Here he come pa-rappa-pom-pom
Look at that boy ba-banging that drum
Keeping that beat and sucking his thumb

Better better not forget where he from
When he grow up so big and so tall
Gonna be a boss in charge of them all
Started from the bottom to be the best

Everything changes when he put on that dress

Tip ya hat
'Cause she coming through
Love the sass
That she giving you
Be a man
What you trying to say?
Woman it up, she's a real lady
Holidays
Are for everyone
'Tis the season
For having fun
Takes the throne
Every year
Miss Winter is here

She saw that crown, she took it over

She is the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

So drop it low, now drop it lower

She's the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

All!
Hail the Christmas queen
Hail the Christmas queen

Now she here, December 25th
A star is born and she looking so sick
Got three wise men bringing her gifts

Come on death drop, come on come on high kicks

All you big bitches better bow down
Yes, Miss Royalty rocking this town

Pomp and circumstance, trumpets gonna sound

The tea of the season has truly been found

Tip ya hat
'Cause she coming through
Love the sass
That she giving you
Be a man
What you trying to say?
Woman it up, she's a real lady
Holidays
Are for everyone
'Tis the season
For having fun
Takes the throne
Every year
Miss Winter is here

She saw that crown, she took it over

She is the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

So drop it low, now drop it lower
She's the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

All!
Hail the Christmas queen
Hail the Christmas queen
All hail the Christmas queen, hail

Little drummer boy to a queen
That's the new nativity scene
She and you and me
Making everything better and better and better
Little drummer boy to a queen
That's the new nativity scene
She and you and me
Making everything better and better and better

She saw that crown, she took it over
She is the Christmas queen, Christmas queen
So drop it low, now drop it lower
She's the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

She saw that crown, she took it over
She is the Christmas queen, Christmas queen
So drop it low, now drop it lower
She's the Christmas queen, Christmas queen

All!
Hail the Christmas queen
Hail the Christmas queen
