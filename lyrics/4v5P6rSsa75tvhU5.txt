I guess we're all in trouble, huh?
Black clouds are upon us
And it's doomsday on the other side of town
That boy survived a severed head
When most would just give up for dead
So I said: "Al B. don't get so upset."
We all get scared of sticking out our necks
It's expected
So panic

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo

So panic

Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)

(Come on, come on)
It's time to lose control!
(Come on, come on)
Turn off your radio!
(Come on, come on)
You're gonna feel alright!
Let's do the panic tonight!

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo
Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)

This place is turning upside down,
And shaking all of our change out,
And Charlotte's tossing her hair to the hounds -
But it's her head they want on the wall
Right next to the screeching owl,
And I don't like this party
Or the sound
Of people walking across you when you're down
And that's it
So panic

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo

Its satanic

Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)

(Come on, come on)
It's time to lose control!
(Come on, come on)
Turn up your radio!
(Come on, come on)
Yeah you can bring your friends!
So we all do the panic again!

Put your left foot in
Now put your other left foot in
Are you having trouble getting it down?

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo
Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)

(Come on, come on)
It's time to lose control!
(Come on, come on)
Turn off your radio!
(Come on, come on)
You're gonna feel alright!
Let's do the panic tonight!

(Come on, come on)
It's time to lose control!
(Come on, come on)
Turn up your radio!
(Come on, come on)
Yeah you can bring your friends!
So we all do the panic again!

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo
Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)

Well come on

(Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo-bee-doo
Bop bop bop
Bop bop sha-doo)
