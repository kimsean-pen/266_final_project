Mysterious be enough

Aaa, haa, haa, haa haa
Ooo

They lived in peace
Not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Had made them realize
That the promises were lies, ohh

The white man's greed
In search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears

They were driven hard
Across the plains
And walked for many moons
'Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize
That the promises were lies

So much to bear
An' all that pain
Left them in despair
They have lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Ohh
Yea yea yaa

Aaa, haa, haa, haa haa
Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Ohh, Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Cherokee
Oh, marchin' on the trail of tears
Ohh
