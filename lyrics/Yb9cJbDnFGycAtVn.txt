We followed the symbol of sad
Held each other to the breaking day
And fall through loop like I never glared
You showed me how to love again

You're caught off half to my heart land
You sailed along far and away
All the the winds have changed you now, flavor
Cross the ocean away

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

Drawing pictures without eyes
Watching wonder, I still come alive
A character's come out friends
As the end up begins to rise

The sun regains it's blaze now
Off the fluorescent, washed away
Just love someone more than yourself
Give yourself away

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

History begins with you and I
Love to be right by your side
Love to lie with you
This will fill our lives

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love

We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
