I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again

I guess you never really know yourself
Because I've never been the kind to ask for help
I'm begging for this, I'm begging for this
Alleviation from all of the ugly shit

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up

There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again
There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again

Yeah, come on

I feel the filth, yeah, the dirt on my skin
Everyone can see it, and they know where I've been
God as my witness, the Devil as my friend
I swear that this is the sound of the end

Now I'm swallowed by sin
This is the sound of the end
Now I'm swallowed by sin
This is the sound of the

Thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again
There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
This is the sound of, this is the sound of the end
This is the sound of, this is the sound of the end

There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again
There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again

This is the sound of the end
I wanna feel love again
