Speaking in riddles
Cutting the light
Outta my eyes
Caught in the middle
What did you find
Buried alive
Deep in the temple?
What did you find?
Was it a sign?
Was it a symbol?
What did you find, find?

It's slipping through my fingers
I barely remember
The secrets that you whispered, whispered

Lay back
The world is spinning on
Right now
It's slipping off my tongue
Lay down
Who cares what's going on
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

Send me a signal
Show me the light
Let it be mine
Come to my window
'Cause I'm losing sight
I'm outta my mind
I'm lost in the riddle
Tell me I'm right
Tell me I'm fine
Tell me it's simple
Where do you hide, hide?

It's slipping through my fingers
I barely remember
The secrets we were keeping, keeping

Lay back
The world is spinning on
Right now
It's slipping off my tongue
Lay down
Who cares what's going on
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

I don't wanna go outside
But I don't wanna be inside
I don't wanna go outside
I think, I think I'm losing my mind

I don't wanna go outside
But I don't wanna be inside
I don't wanna go outside
I think, I think I'm losing my mind

Lay back
The world is spinning on
Right now
It's slipping off my tongue
Lay down
Who cares what's going on
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone
Lay back
Lay back
Lay back till it's gone

Gone, gone, lay back till it's gone
Gone, gone, lay back till it's gone
