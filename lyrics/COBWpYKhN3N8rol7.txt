The fool came.
With his song, and his smile.

And we rose merrily forward
And we rose merrily down.

There it was,

Its time had come.

And then the sage,
He gave his wise reply
And I looked down

And we rose merrily forward
And we rose merrily down
And we rose merrily forward
And we rose merrily down
