So what am I gon' do bout you?
Can honesty bless me the way I want it to?
I'm suspicious
So I got to tell you
Yeah, I got to tell you
Something tonight makes me ambitious

'Cause I've known you
For the longest time
And yes, I have doubt if I should cross that line

He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
This is all I see now
Watching his
He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
That is all I see now
Watching his mouth

See I've been taped here round the chest
And I've been tentative to test how far I have to breaking point
But I've got to tell you
Yeah, I've got to tell you
Something tonight makes me ambitious

'Cause I've known you
For the longest time
And yes, I want to cross that line

He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
This is all I see now
Watching his
He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
That is all I see now
Watching his mouth

He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
This is all I see now
Watching his
He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
That is all I see now
Watching his mouth

Blue visions crash up the higher places
My witness says I'm not meant to face it
I've known you so long long last
And the long lines that hide me are fading soft

He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
This is all I see now
Watching his
He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
That is all I see now
Watching his mouth

He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
This is all I need now
Watching his
He's on my couch
I'm watching his mouth
That is all I see now
Watching his mouth
