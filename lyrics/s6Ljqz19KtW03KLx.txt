All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then, there's no gettin' over
No gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you

Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again, there's no gettin' over
There's no gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you

No no

Bring it back

Hey hey, I can't forget you, baby
I think about you e'e'y day
I tried to masqurade the pain

That's why I'm next to the booth
D-d-d-dancing to the groove
But-but there is no-
There is no-

Just no gettin' over you

Baby, it feels so right
To dance to the beat of night
That heat between you and I
Freak-freak to the morning light

We like to live life fast
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no-
There is no-

Just no gettin' over you

Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and
party and party and party
(Hey come get me)

Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and

All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then, there's no gettin' over
No gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you

Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again, there's no gettin' over
There's no gettin' over, there's just no getting over you

Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and
party and party and party
(Hey come get me)
Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and
party and party and party
(Hey come get me)
Imma party and party and party

Bring it back

People in the place,
If you've ever fell in love,
Then you know,
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about
There's no gettin' over...

Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and
party and party and party
(Hey come get me)
Imma party and party and party
And par- and par- and
party and party and party

Just no gettin' over you
