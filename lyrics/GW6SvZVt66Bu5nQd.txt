Life is no garden of roses
More like a thistle in time
Sailing passed
Waiting for no one is time
Sailing fast
Waiting for no one this time

Now that you've killed me with your eyes
Why did you push me away?
How will I make it without you?
How will I go on my way?

Everything feels cold in the winter, everything feels cold
Everything feels cold in the winter, everything feels cold

Oh-oh, life is a garden of roses
Roses just wither and die
Now that you've killed me with your eyes
Why did you push me away?
How will I make it without you?
How will I go on my way?
Life is a garden of roses
Roses just wither and die
