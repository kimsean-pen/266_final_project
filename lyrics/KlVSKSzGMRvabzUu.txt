Get-get-get in line and settle down
Get-get-get in line and settle down
What's your twenty? (Do you copy?)
Where's your brain? (Do you copy?)
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Copy that (Do you copy?)
You're acting strange (Do you copy?)
So tell me what is going on
So heavy, I bet
I'm fine (nothin's gonna knock this girl down)
I'm hella positive for real
I'm all good, no
I'm fine (nothin's gonna knock this girl down)
It's kind of complicated
That's for sure
But you can see it my eyes
You can read it on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get-get-get in line and settle down
Get in line and settle down
No big deal (I can handle it)
It'll bounce off me (I can handle it)
Been around the block before
Doesn't matter anymore
Here we go again (Are you kidding me?)
Are you insane? (Are you kidding me?)
Underneath the avalanche, so heavy again
I'm fine (nothin's gonna knock this girl down)
I'm hella positive for real
I'm all good, no
I'm fine (nothin's gonna knock this girl down)
It's kind of complicated
That's for sure
But you can see it my eyes
You can read it on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get-get-get in line and settle down
Get in line and settle down
Gotcha, 10-4 ...
Gotcha, 10-4 ...
Gotcha, 10-4 ...
Gotcha, 10-4 ...
I'm a rough-and-tough
I'm a rough-and-tough
Nothin's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough-and-tough
I'm a rough-and-tough
Nothin's gonna knock this girl down
But you can see it my eyes
You can read it on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Gotta get a hold on this
Trying to get a hold on this
Get-get-get in line and settle down
Get in line and settle down
