Oh this broken dawn light
When my shooting feels right
There's just one final thing on my mind

Oh the mist of this dawn
The mist of a different dawn
The final thing on my mind?

Every waking dawn it's you I see
Coming back to me
Everything you did is a part of me
Ripped apart from me

How did we get to be this cold?
How did I let you get so far from me?
We got it so wrong, so wrong
How did we let it get this cold?

Every waking dawn it's you I see
Coming back to me
Everything you did was a part to me
Ripped apart from me

How did we get to be this cold?
How did I let you get so far from me?
We got it so wrong, so wrong
How did we let it get this cold?

How did we get to be this cold?
How did I let you get so far from me?
We got it so wrong, so wrong
How did we let it get this cold?
