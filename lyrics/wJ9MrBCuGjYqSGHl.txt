In her place one hundred candles burning
As salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel
What they're saying, swaying

They say the beast inside of me
Is gonna get ya, get ya, get

Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips smooth, yeah
I can feel what you're saying, praying

They say the beast inside of me
Is gonna get ya, get ya, get

I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove I mean
What I'm saying, begging?

I say the beast inside of me
Is gonna get ya, get ya, get

Let me love you too
Let me love you to death
To death

Let me love you too
Let me love you to death
To death
Hey, am I good enough for you?
Hey, am I good enough for you?
Am I? For you
Am I? For you
Am I good enough for you?
