Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin'
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashin'

Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin'
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'

Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Starry-eyed and laughin', as I recall when we were caught
Kept by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed till the tollin' ended

Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
