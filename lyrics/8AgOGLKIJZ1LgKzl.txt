I can see a body drop right now
I laugh at a nigga right now
In the Hellcat, I'm switching them out
Ridin' round with your bih givin' mouth
I'm in her tonsils right now
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
Fridays, I'ma Pinky, nigga
Heavy D, I'm smoking cookie, nigga
Ice Cube, beat the shit out you nigga
And I send a shot like Big Worm
Smoking your pack like I'm Smokey, nigga
Big dog, I done fuck with Felicia
Deebo, I mistreat 'em

You a cartoon, washed out
Helmet down, not a lot of rounds
Come around, strip a nigga down
Pants down, money giving out
Itch now, took your chain nigga, Deebo
Slimeball with a ego, turn a nigga subzero
It's cold outchea'...
Imma go hard in this motherfucker
Don't trust me? I work you out
You got the bricks and you got the bags
I'll send some young niggas in your house
I don't care what you talk about
I got guns and I got shooters
You got guns, you got shooters
Well show me what you talk about?
I'm in the real one, on the block with the real ones
Hang in the block with them niggas that pull up and kill you
It's nothing to me
Shit, it's nothing to me
Get a nigga wet for a couple racks,
shit, that shit ain't nothing to me

I can see your body drop right now
I laugh at a nigga right now
In the hellcat, I'm switching them out
Ridin' round with your big and her ma
I'm in a Tesla right now
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
Friday's on my pinky, nigga
Heavy D, I'm smoking cookie, nigga
Ice Cube, beat the shit out you nigga
And I send a shot like Big Worm
Smoking your pack like I'm Smokey, nigga
Big dog, I done fucked with Felicia
Deebo, I mistreat 'em

150, bitches is hidden
Counting this green, get in between
Lets have a party, percocet machine
Fucking these bitches and selling hoes a dream
I just be selling white cream
Ice cream call me snowman
Getting money, no broke man
False claiming you a hoe man
Yeah, you not gang
You not 4L gang, you ain't bout that
Yeah, you not a shooter, you not a robber, you ain't bout that, ugh
Yeah, you not a gangster,
You not a killer, OG, I'm bout that
Slime, I'm good in my hood,
I'm good in your hood
And y'all niggas ain't that
Real like me, realer than realer, real big dog, nigga real killer
Niggas be talkin' bout none of these niggas
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas

I can see your body drop right now
I laugh at a nigga right now
In the hellcat, I'm switching them out
Ridin' round with your big and her ma
I'm in a Tesla right now
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
