We were born from light before there even was a dawn
So pure, so bright
Falling from the skies above into our darkened fate
The time has come
Walking through this world we bear the secret of our lives
The light we share
Caught in destiny we shine for we are meant to be
The Star Guardians!

Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away it's time to shine

Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Running out of time, we're chasing the light

Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away, it's time to shine!

Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Piercing through the dawn, we burn on and on, and on

The thought of us stuck in my mind
I long for the days when we were young
The song in my heart, the light in your eyes
But now I drown in tears I've cried
Yelling your name into the rain
Don't push me away, let's head for the sky!

Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away, it's time to shine!

Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Running out of time, we're chasing the light

Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Piercing through the dawn, we burn on and on, and on
