Hunter, I'm laid out on the forest floor
Arrows in my back and sides
Down among the leaves and stones
You can wear my skin as armor
You can eat my flesh and bones
Leave nothing that is needed
All I have is yours
And I'll give myself up to your sharpened edges
I no longer cling to my life
Yes, I'm finally giving in
Teeth and hate end our relationship
Of course it's said, but that's the way it is
Your violence always wins the day
Yes,
Your violence wins
And I'll give myself up to your sharpened edges
I no longer cling to my life
Yes, I'm finally giving in
Oh, and you watch as the animals
Lay themselves
Down at your feet
A thousand bared teeth
A thousand bowed heads
Yes, they're begging you for
Death
The Hunter does us all a great service
And we've done so much to deserve it.
