Ashes to the ground
Fall the wrong way round
World upside down
I know I know

Home a distant time
Smoke ore clearer skies
Everybody lies
I know I know

In every way you do
More than I could say you knew
And life is so strange it's true
But so are you

I will play the game
I will take the blame
I will break the same
I know I know

In every way you do
More than I could say you knew
And life is so strange it's true
But so are you

Ashes to the ground
Fall the wrong way round
I will let you down
I know I know

In every pause you knew
Take my breath away, you do
And life is so strange it's true
But so are you
