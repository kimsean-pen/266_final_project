Pretend that they disappointed of the outcome
But secretly everything is how I planned
I never thought you and I would have this closure
It couldn't be and suddenly it's ours

I can tell you were
You must be low to find me
They wanted us to be afraid
They wanted us to be afraid
They wanted
I see myself
I see myself
I see exactly what you wanted

I never thought that you and I would have this closure
I put it in my head
But it just drifts away
(Way down)
And that's [?]
And the [?] miles apart
I never thought that simple was
Easy as it sound

I can tell you were
You must be low to find me
They wanted us to be afraid
They wanted us to be afraid
The day there to show
That no one is divided by the vision in the snow
(Impersonate yourself)
The days is there to show
That no one is divided by the vision in the snow
You never wanted

In my mind
A single thread
It holds resentment
The way that it was
Bring you down
Maybe who you are
Could be the last thing that you need
Never wanted
You never wanted

And I know who you are
And I know why you're afraid
And I know who you are
And I know why you're afraid

I see myself
I see myself
I see exactly what you wanted
