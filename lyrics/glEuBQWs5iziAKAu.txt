When you don't know what you're running from,
But there's a dark place in the back of your mind,
Just waiting to shine, searching to find the courage and mind hidden inside.
I'm the reason that it feel apart,
If I could take it back I would but I can't,
Finding a way, selfish escape,
Trying to wait but I just can't take it back to when were distant lovers.

All my life, I've been searching,
Unravelling the pieces for the truth.
All my life, I've been waiting,
Fighting for the day when I'm with you, all my life.

I've been the writing of the wall,
Shredding the light just to see if I fall,
If I was the one giving the call, I'd try to forget it happened before.
I've been searching for a paradise,
Giving the choice I would make it alive,
Trying to hold on but always give in, try to be strong but I'm running once again, we're still distance lovers.

All my life, I've been searching,
Unravelling the pieces for the truth.
All my life, I've been waiting,
Fighting for the day when I'm with you,
Cause I'm alive, I'm on fire,
And I'm going to find the broken pieces of you,
Cause you're my life and you're on fire,
And I'm going to fix the broken pieces of you all my life.
When you don't know what you're running from...
All my life...

Cause I'm alive, I'm on fire,
And I'm going to find the broken pieces of you,
Cause you're my life and you're on fire,
And I'm going to fix the broken pieces of you all my life.
