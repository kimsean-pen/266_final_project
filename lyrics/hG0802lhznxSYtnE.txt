Just got back from the downtown palais
Where the music was so sweet
It knocked me right back in the alley
I'm ready
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm ready
And I'm really gonna rock tonight

Sweet little lady sings like a songbird
And she sings the opera like you ain't never heard
But she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
And she ain't gonna rock and roll

She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room

Come on, I'll show you how to sing the blues
Now baby, come on over, you got nothin' to lose
Are you ready?
Hey, hey, hey, are you ready?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, are you ready?
I wanna show you how to rock and roll

"Now listen here, baby," she said to me
"Just meet me at the opera house at quarter to three
'Cause I'm ready
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Woo, hoo, hoo, I'm ready
I'm gonna show you how to sing the blues"

She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room

Oh, far, far away
The music is playin'

Well, we were reelin' and rockin' all through the night
Yeah, we were rockin' at the opera house until the break of light
And the orchestra was playin' all Chuck Berry's greatest tunes
And the singers in the chorus all got off on them singin' blues
And as the night grew older everybody was as one
The people on the streets came runnin' in to join in song
Just to hearing the opera singers singing rock and roll so pure
I thought I saw the mayor there
But I wasn't really sure
But it's alright
