Born on the wrong side of the ocean
With all the tides against you
You never thought you'd be much good for anyone
But that's so far from the truth
I know there's pain in your heart
And you're covered in scars
Wish you could see what I do

'Cause baby, everything you want
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need

You can say I'm wrong
You can turn your back against me
But I'm here to stay
(I'm here to stay)
Like the sea
Should keep kissing the shoreline
No matter how many times he pushes her away

'Cause baby, everything you want
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me

And everything happens for a reason
It's started passing in the skies
I used to question who I was
When now I see
The answer's in your heart

'Cause baby, everything you want
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need
