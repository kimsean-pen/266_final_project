(Anderson)

You feel like I do
Like the whole world's forgotten you

And your life is so dull and predictable

Your room seems like a cell
And you don't sleep very well

And your friends only talk to point and to mock
And to ridicule

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer I promise, it's alright

His words don't flatter me
And they're printed for all to see

I don't care, he's not there
It's all history

The future's yours to hold
And you're really not very old

And your life is so white, so clean and so bright
And holds mystery

Morning in the mirror
Things will suddenly seem much clearer I promise it's alright

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

One day things won't seem the same way, I know

One day things won't seem the same way, I know
