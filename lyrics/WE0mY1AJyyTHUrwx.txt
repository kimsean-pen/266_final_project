I suspect the origin
We're just repeating ourselves
And that's the first thing that we want
To see the city explode
If I could guess the outcome I would've never left
You're so impatient your pictures were looking all the same

Blink if you hear a signal
Our hands are red with blood from
clapping when
You hear the bird coming
the sparrow ate our bread trails
go east along the shadowed
mountain side
If you wanna stay alive
