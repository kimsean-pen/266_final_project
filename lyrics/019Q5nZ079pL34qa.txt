Treacherous way of life
For the fool and the wise
Big rewards for the brave
Punishment so they'll behave, behave

Play with me the game of fire
Join the loud and heartfelt choir
This is the sound of joy
Coming from my innermost
Sprung from north, coast to coast

Play with me the game of fire
Join the loud and heartfelt choir
This is the sound of joy
Coming from my innermost
Sprung from north, coast to coast

There were calls and demands
To become one of them
Gave me life on one condition
I owe them this, I owe them vision

Play with me the game of fire
Join the loud and heartfelt choir
This is the sound of joy
Coming from my innermost
Sprung from north, coast to coast

Play with me the game of fire
Join the loud and heartfelt choir
This is the sound of joy
Coming from my innermost
Sprung from north, coast to coast
(Of joy)
(Game of fire)
Coming from your innermost
Sprung from north, coast to coast
