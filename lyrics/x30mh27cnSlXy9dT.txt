What makes gold look like rust
What turns diamonds into dust
Like oxygen to you and me
We need it more than the air we breathe

Too much push and shove
Without enough love to go round

There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love, love, love

What hurts but feels so fine
What turns water into wine
It runs so deep in you and me
From a fountain to a river to the seven seas

Too much push and shove
Without enough love to go round
I finally found

There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love, love, love

There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love

There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love to go 'round the world
There must be enough love
