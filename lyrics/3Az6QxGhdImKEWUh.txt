Desire is a flame alive
When dreams are far away
Open up your inner eye
Let hope save the day
She will follow for you
Make the rain shine anew
We'll make the path for you to take
Till to the end walk you through

Time won't wait
Lead your fate
Never let go

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself go on
No bitter end

Silentlly, misteriously
How gray dwells upon
The kind of way of mistery
For hearts to find home
To be there is all you need
And nothing left to prove
Take a chance, oh, never leave
Know it all starts with you

Time won't wait
Lead your fate
Never let go

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself go on
No bitter end

There's hope for everyone
'Cause every heart's the same
To forgive what you have done
The silent wish for a change

Blackout the sun
Light nowhere
Tell me you don't need it anymore
No bitter end

Hold on, don't run
Forever still yourself go on
No bitter end
