I hear beauty in things
Like the neighbors return to their love and pride
Their day like a wicked ride
But then to belong

And their kids running by given riddles and tales
For their way to be
Little buddies, the mystery of just being around

All that I fear is that all that I have given you
Is a ship out to nowhere that wants to be out of control
But I see the light in oh so many things out here
And a lifetime gently now sits on the stairs to my home

We're running out
But moving on
Into the days of our grace returning

And the dancer just turns
Until they spin fast enough for the biggest show
Take some pics of the afterglow
Then do it again

I see stars in the sky
And I wish they'd return to be in me now
Make up for what I lack somehow
When it's all been too much

All that I fear is that all that I have given you
Is a ship out to nowhere that wants to be out of control
But I see the light in oh so many things out here
And a lifetime so gently now sits on the stairs to my home

We're running out
But moving on
Into the days of our grace returning

I'm curly to the bone
But then you straighten me again
I carry you to bed
Let the hours sweep away
Your day has been hard

I will whisper to heal
And not wake up the listening thoughts in me
Their revealing dark poetry
And this shadow they sell

There is beauty out here
Like peculiar running styles some are wild
And the breath on the other side
Of getting around

All that I fear is that all that I have given you
The ship out to nowhere that wants to be out of control
But I see the light in oh so many things out here
And a lifetime so gently now sits on the stairs to my home

We're running out
But moving on
Into the days of our grace returning

We're running out
But moving on
Into the days of our grace returning
