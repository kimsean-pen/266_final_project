Maybe if I search my mind a little,
I'd come across the reason why you're gone.
Maybe if I searched a little while.

And if I try to reconcile a little,
Then maybe I will know for how long.
This time...

Well here we are,
...ohh... ohh.

in separate rooms.
.ohh... ohh...

I can hear you sighing.
.ohh... ohh... ohh.

Saying "No way out" or so it seems.
...ohh... ohh... ohh...

Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window-oh.
.ohh... ohh... ohh...

Fast changes arriving.
Slow changes moving out.
Here we are.

Now maybe if I took the time a little,
Then maybe I would know for how long.
This time.

Well here we are,
ohh... ohh.

In separate rooms.
.ohh... ohh...

I can hear you sighing.
.ohh... ohh... ohh.

Saying "No way out" or so it seems.
...ohh... ohh... ohh...

Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window-oh.
.ohh... ohh... ohh... fast changes...

Fast changes arriving.
they come around... ...slow changes...

Slow changes moving out
...are moving out...

Here we are...

Fast changes they come around slow changes...
...Fast changes arriving.

Are moving out...
And slow changes are moving out

Here we are.

ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh...

I can hear you crying. Saying "No way out" or so it seems
.ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh...

Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window-oh.
.ohh... ohh... ohh... fast changes...

They come around... ...slow changes... are moving out...
