Buffalo Soldier
Dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America

Stolen from Africa
Brought to America
Fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival

I mean it, when
I analyse the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta

Was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa
Brought to America
Fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Buffalo Soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea

Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland
To the heart of the caribbean

Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
