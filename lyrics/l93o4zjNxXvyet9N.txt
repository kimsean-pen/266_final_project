One last kiss, one only, then I let you go
Hard for you, I've fallen, but you can't break my fall
I'm broken, don't break me, when I hit the ground
Some devil, some angel has got me to the bones

You said, always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said, always and forever, is such a long and lonely time

Too drunk 'n still drinking
It's just the way I feel
It's alright, is what you told me
Cuz what we had was so beautiful
But I feel heavy, like floating, at the bottom of the sea

You said, always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said, always and forever, is such a long, lonely time

Some devil is stuck inside me
Why can't I set it free
I wish I was dead, and you're breathing
Just so that you could know
Some angel is stuck inside me
Why can't I set you free

You said always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said always and forever, such a long, lonely time
Stuck inside of me
