When i'm driving home late at night
I start thinking
Of how it used to be
When you were around
All the fun we used to have
Playing like children in the sand
But now, you're far away
And all I have
Is dreams of yesterday
Memories of you and me
Lihue

We used to stroll along the moonlit beach
And you would whisper
Sweet words in my ears
Promising me baby
that we'd always be together
In this hawaiian paradise alone
But now, you're far away
And I still miss the magic of those days
Memories of you and me
Lihue

Oh, love gets so hard sometimes
When I'm by myself
Oooh baby yeah
And now I feel your arms around me
Strolling hands in hands
Making love upon the sand
But until you come back to me
All I have is sweet memories
Of how we used to be
Lihue

But until you come back to me
All I have is sweet memories
Of how we used to be
Lihue
