Automatons with business suits swinging black boxes
Sequestering the blueprints of daily life
Contented, free of care, they rejoice in morning ritual
As they file like drone ant colonies to their office in the sky

I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations
Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution
If I pierce the complexity I won't find salvation
Just the bald and over truth of the evil and deception

There is an inner logic
And we're taught to stay far from it
It is simple and elegant
But it's cruel antithetic
And there's no effort to reveal it

Graduated mentors stroll in marbled brick porticoes
In sagacious dialog they despise their average ways
Betraying pomp and discipline, they mold their institution
Where they practice exclusion on the masses every day

I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations
Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution
If I pierce the complexity I won't find salvation
Just the bald and over truth of the evil and deception

There is an inner logic
And we're taught to stay far from it
It is simple and elegant
But it's cruel antithetic
And there's no effort to reveal it

Decorated warriors drill harmless kids on pavement
Simulating tyranny under red alert
Protecting the opulent and staging moral standard
They expect redemption of character and self-growth

(There is an inner logic)
I don't ask questions, don't promote demonstrations
(And we're taught to stay far from it)
Don't look for new consensus, don't stray from constitution
(It is simple and elegant)
If I pierce the complexity I won't find salvation
(But it's cruel antithetic)
Just the bald and over truth of the evil and deception
(And there's no effort to reveal it)

No equality, no opportunity
(There is an inner logic)
No tolerance for the progressive alternative
(And we're taught to stay far from it)
No equality, no opportunity
(It is simple and elegant)
No tolerance for the progressive alternative
(But it's cruel antithetic)
(And there's no effort to reveal it)
