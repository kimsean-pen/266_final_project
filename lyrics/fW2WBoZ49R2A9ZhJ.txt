Are you looking for piece of mind?
You won't find it in your life
Are you trying to prove
Who's mountains are you trying to move
I've felt for it too

Whatever keeps you occupied
Whatever gives you contact high
Whatever keeps you busy, baby
Will never make you satisfied

Are you looking for security?
Validation or identity
You won't find in things
The more you got, the less you see
I've felt for it too

Whatever keeps you occupied
Whatever gives you contact high
Whatever keeps you busy, baby
Will never make you satisfied

I've been all over the world, yeah
I've dug for diamonds and I've dove for pearls
The real treasure that we don't see
Is hiding in place of me

Whatever keeps you occupied
Whatever gives you contact high
Whatever keeps you busy, baby
Will never make you satisfied

Whatever keeps you occupied
Whatever gives you contact high
Whatever keeps you busy, baby
Will never make you satisfied

Will never make you satisfied
Will never make you satisfied, whoa
