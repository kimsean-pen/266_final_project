Blessed visionary
Cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire

Deep within this endless void
Searching for a sign

The vessel forged inside of me
Watches over like the death of the moon
Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face

The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn your face is haunting, white ghostly dreams
Weight of worlds is on your shoulders
Hear the voice of gold

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face

Desperate heathens flock to sirens
Guard your heartache well

Mama, don't let them take her
Don't let them take her down
Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one
Her spirit's too strong

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
I can see the pain
You can make it all go away
