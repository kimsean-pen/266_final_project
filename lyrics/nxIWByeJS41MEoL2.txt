Hole in the Middle - Emily Jane White

Everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle
Everybody does a little dance with the devil
And everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle
Everybody does a little dance with the devil

And you know I'm evil now
And you shout it loud and proud
Singing "Born in the USA"
And you know I'm evil now
And you shout it loud and proud
Singing "Born in the USA"

Oh and I play with my voodoo doll
Stick those pins and drive them in
Singing "Born in the USA"
And I play with my voodoo doll
Stick those pins and drive them in
Singing "Born in the USA"

Oh and everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle
Everybody does a little dance with the devil
And everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle
Everybody does a little dance with the devil

And you know I'm evil now
And you shout it loud and proud
Singing "Born in the USA"
And you know I'm evil now
And you shout it loud and proud
Singing "Born in the USA"
