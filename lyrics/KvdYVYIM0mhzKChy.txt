The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

I am a rock with eyes to the sky
My wait for my time to rise
I come to disturb the throne
Drop my [?]

The great chain of being
Will fall to pieces in no time

The great chain of being
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)

I have served the precious stones
I have come to take the throne
I transcend in natural flesh
I will lay your god to rest

The great chain of being
Will be un-linked to start again

The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

I see through your world's facade
I decide to [?]

I climb stairs to push you down
I climb chains to cut you down
I disrupt natural order
