I know I won't change, I have tried
Was feeling so caged, hands tied
I can't find anything feeling so right
It's blinding all
The reaper is close, seen his smile
A matter of time, can't deny
I won't turn around, 'round, 'round
This destiny's mine

The countdown has begun
The walls are falling down
My life is on the line
But freedom is mine

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on, no, we'll never stop
We're going on till our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous

I know it's not sane, close my eyes
I search for the edge of Earth
'Cause that's the only place I'll ever find
That makes me whole
A thief in the night, out of sight
It's out there waiting to ignite
The fever will rise, rise, rise
Taking over my mind

The countdown has begun
The walls are falling down
My life is on the line
The fear is mine

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on, no, we'll never stop
We're going on till our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous

Nothing matters anyhow
It's like I'm floating off the ground
Into the hands of air, I dive
Rays of life flashing by
Like the time is slowing down
When the world is out of sight
All the memories in my mind
Won't leave me behind

It's dangerous, dangerous
It's dangerous, dangerous
It's dangerous

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on, no, we'll never stop
We're going on till our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous
