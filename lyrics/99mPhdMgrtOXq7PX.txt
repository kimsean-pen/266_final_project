Here's where it starts, another night alone in the dark
Hate is running through my veins
Steady now I'm takin' aim
The darkness of day, all the skies are turning to gray

I can't tune the voices out
How'd they get so Goddamn loud?
Cause there's a side, another side of me that can't get out
A darker side that no one knows about

Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
Cause I think I lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down

Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?
This could be my last mistake
Put the gun down, just put the gun down

Here's where it ends
I'm never going back there again
Cause everytime I'm standin' by
The shadows in my line of sight

When does it stop?
Cause I'm livin cold and shut off
Even when I clench my fists, it's slipping through my fingertips
Oh cause there's a piece, there's a piece of me that's missing now
Yeah there's a piece of me that's breakin down

Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
Cause I think i lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?
This could be my last mistake

Put the gun down, just put the gun down
That's when i look myself in the mirror
Now I'm seeing things a little clearer
Honest I can't hide what's inside me
I said I'm tired of pointing the finger
Tired of this hand holding the trigger
Now I'm done with that, I gotta take one step back

Can anybody, Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody see me?
Cause i think i lost my way
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Will anybody watch me?
Is someone gonna stop me?

This could be my last mistake
Put the gun down, just put the gun down
Here's where it starts, another night alone in the dark
Hate is running through my veins
Steady now I'm takin' aim.
