Let me tell a little tale
Maybe you have heard about
Black widow spider is on the wall
Weaving a silken web
Patiently works her thread
Quiet she lies there waiting
For your time to fall

I was fooled by your false adulation
Just another bait that fell into your trap

Stop your whining of victimization
'Cause you know well to differ crap from gold

The black widow's web
She silently waits for a chance
Once you're caught she gets hold of your life
You are mine
Then her poison will make you blind

The black widow's web
She'll be carefully spreading her net
You have nowhere to hide, she will find you
Better run from me
Tempting your worse desires

When I turned on my device of alienation
You were draining out all my identity

You're not obligated, social isolation
And you are trapped by your own vanity

The black widow's web
She silently waits for a chance
Once you're caught she gets hold of your life
Better run from me
Then her poison will make you blind
You can't hide

The black widow's web
She'll be carefully spreading her net
You have nowhere to hide, she will find you
You can't hide
Tempting your worse desires
'Cause you're mine

Your need for attention made your blind
Now your identity is mine

She may look so innocent
You are fooled by charming eyes
Better face the consequence
From her reckless heart

Don't be frightened little one
I never meant to harm you
Trust me now come closer here
And taste my kiss of death

The black widow's web
She silently waits for a chance
Once you're caught she gets hold of your life
Better run from me
Then her poison will make you blind
You can't hide

You better face the fact
That no matter how fast you react
She will always be there to strike you
Enticing your worst desire
'Cause you're mine

Black widow spider is on the wall
Weaving a fragile web
Patiently works her thread
Quiet she lies there waiting
For your time to fall
