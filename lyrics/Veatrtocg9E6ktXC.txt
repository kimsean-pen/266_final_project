Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to
We're coming after you
So don't make a sound

I got this feelin
Could it be there's someone watching over me
Tell me who you are
I close my eyes and count from nine
To try and find some peace of mind
But it's gone too far

You see our faces every time you turn your head around
We'll be watching even when you turn the lights down
We will always be around

No matter where you are

Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to

We're coming after you
So don't make a sound
I'm all alone now in the dark

Just one chance so we can talk
That is all I ask
I close my eyes and then I dream
I always wake up to a scream
Wonder where you are
Don't you know we're always gonna be around you
And there really isn't anything you can do
We will always be around
No matter where you are
Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to
We're coming after you
So don't make a sound
