I see trees of green... red roses too
I see them bloom... for me and for you
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue... and clouds of white
Bright blessed days... dark sacred nights
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.

The colors of a rainbow... so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces... of people going by
I see friends shaking hands... sayin'. how do you do?
They're really sayin'... I love you.

I hear babies cry... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more... than I'll never know
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself... what a wonderful world... oh yeah!
