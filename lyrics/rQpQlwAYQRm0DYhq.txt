Trains passing by
All up in my feelings
All up in yours

Gave it all to take your sadness away
Oh, I would lose my train to stay

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

Trains passing by
I didn't know I was stuck up on us
Fuck it, I'mma give into us one more time

Gave it all to take your sadness away
Oh, I would lose my train to stay

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

This train is taking me somewhere
I don't know where I'm going
Passing you, passing feelings, missing stops

This train is taking me somewhere
I don't know where I'm going
Passing you, passing feelings, missing stops

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave you alone, boy

I'm on my train ride home
Staring at my phone
Don't wanna leave

This train is taking me somewhere
I don't know where I'm going
Passing you, passing feelings, missing stops
