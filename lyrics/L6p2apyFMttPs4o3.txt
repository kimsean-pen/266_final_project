Your sugar, your fear
your touch, your hair
your voice, your whisper
your moan, your prayer.
Your hair, your step
your spin, your care
your voice, your heat, your light
your stare
I don't want to be free, if it means that I'll be
without you, baby
without you, baby
I just want you to see, how much you mean to me
I really love you
I really love you
Your sugar, your fear
your touch, your hair
your voice, your whisper
your moan, your prayer.
Your hair, your step
your spin, your care
your voice, your heat, your light
your stare
I don't want to be free, if it means that I'll be
without you, baby
without you, baby
I just want you to see, how much you mean to me
I really love you
I really love you
Your hair
Your voice, your whisper
your moan, your prayer.
Your hair, your step
your spin, your care.
Your shadow, your heat, your light
your stare
Your sugar, your fear
your touch, your hair.
Your voice, your whisper,
your moan, your prayer.
Your hair, your step,
your spin, your care.
Your shadow, your heat,
your light, you stare.
