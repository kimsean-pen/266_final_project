Heard a lot of talk about the ocean, yeah
Heard a lot of talk about the sea, now
Heard a lot of talk about a lot of things
Never meant that much to me

Heard a lot of talk about my spirit
Heard a lot of talk about my soul
But I decided that anxiety and pain
Were better friends, so I let it go

Did you let it go now?
Did you let it go, our love?
Did you let it go, my friend?
Let's get it back
Let's get it back, together, yeah

Heard a lot of talk about this Jesus
A man of love and a man of strength
But what a man was two thousand years ago
Means nothing at all to me today

He could have been
Telling me about my higher self
But he only lives inside my prayer
So what he was may have been beautiful
But the pain is right now and right here

Let it go, love
Come on, let it go, our love
Let it go, my friend
Let's get it back
Let's get it back together

Let it go, love
Let it go, our love
Let it go, my friend
Let's get it back
Let's get it back together

And let's get it back

Let it go, my friend
Let's get it back
Let's get it back together, oh yeah
