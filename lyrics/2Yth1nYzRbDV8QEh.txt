You know I, I would wait a million years
For this
But don't make no rate, I promise you this
Could be somethin' you like
I promise that this could be somethin' you like

Sweetheart, won't you call my name?
Wouldn't it be so nice if we felt the same?
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try

The day I know I wanted you was the day we met
And I said I'm your little baby, your little baby pet
And you liked it, like that
I promise that you liked it like that

Sweetheart, won't you call my name?
Wouldn't it be so nice if we felt the same?
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try, try, try
I wish you would try
