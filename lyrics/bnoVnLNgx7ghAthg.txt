Electric blue eyes
Where did you come from?
Electric blue eyes
Who sent you?

Electric blue eyes
Always be near me
Electric blue eyes
I need you

Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no

Domine, Domine Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Domine, Domine Deus
Domine, Adiu, Adiuva Me

If you should go
You should know I love you
If you should go
You should know I'm here

Always be near me
Guardian angel
Always be near me
There's no fear

Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no

Domine, Domine Deus
Domine, Adiuva Me
Domine, Domine Deus
Domine, Adiu, Adiuva Me
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
Na, na, no, na, na, no
