If you can't sleep
I'll be there in your dreams
I'll be there in your dreams
If you can't sleep at all

And in your dreams
I'll touch your cheek
And lay my head on your shoulder

Goodbye shadows
Goodbye shadows

You're far away
If you can't see my face
if the world is cold
but the sun shines the same

Shut your eyes
There are bluer skies
for your embrace to my heart

Goodbye shadows
Goodbye shadows

If you can't sleep
I'll be there in your dreams
I'll be there in your dreams
If you can't sleep at all

And in your dreams
I'll touch your cheek
And lay my head on your shoulder
