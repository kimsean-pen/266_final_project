Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
Tear drops feel like showers, there's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours, time stands still around me
Tear drops feel like showers, I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours, with just your broken flowers
