Time could never heal our pain
Quietly loud
Our sadness resounds
Hope could never heal our soul
Tragically lost
Our voices
Were turned to silence

Prayers could never save ourselves
Strangers, we are
To our land... now, a prison
Peace wished to our enemies
Their eyes being shut
Our voices
Were turned to silence

Non-violent way
To misery, has led
All of what we are
Is now hanging
By a thread

All we did was pray
No freedom left to speak
Captive as their prey
Confined within our peaks

How shall we be remembered
Through the course of history?
As strengthless beings..."
Who choose submission
As their way to be...
