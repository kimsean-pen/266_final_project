Hold on tight
We're in for a ride
Vigils of midnight terrorize the world at birth vaccinate the cured
All is drown in the waters of murk
The bomb explodes and scorches the earth
The plot to kill cleansing the state undone
Serpent of a thousand lies, beneath
Askew, disproved we're out of reach
A clinch in the mind of disbelief
Take what you will for its deceit
Hold on tight
We're in for a ride
The elite eye, the blind belief is lost and burn
The gavel down and all of this has lost its worth
The skeleton has made its secrets known
Dominant agendas through the black magic sewn
All is drown in the waters of murk
The bomb explodes and scorches the earth
The plot to kill cleansing the state
A clinch in the mind of disbelief
Take what you will for its deceit
Once we know the waker's will become
Once we understand it comes undone
Serpent of a thousand lies, beneath
Askew, disproved w're out of reach
A clinch in the mind of disbelief
Take what you will for its deceit
The sanctioned annihilation, prepare for devastation
Visual war perversion, death tax to the third world occasion
We see the thousands here to die
Thus proves a sad existence
Cast down the serpent devious, the deformed racist heretic
Mortar off the backs of carrion, a psalm that separates us
We see the thousands here to die
Thus proves a sad existence
A cast black swift of prudence
Among the elitists kill lists
Prejudice!
