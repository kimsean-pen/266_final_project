My pretty head
I think I'm dead
Everyone's dumb
And I'm no better
Ridiculously obscene
Keeping the peace
You could be like me
But I'm no better

Dress my soul up like a girl
Cause after all I'm just a girl
And I'm so happy
Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, right, don
Don't they say
I'm so happy
Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

My pretty head
What did you expect
Of the weaker sex
I should know better
You tell me I'm hot
That's what I want
I've already lost
I should know better

Dress my soul up like a girl
Cause after all I'm just a girl
And I'm so happy
Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Right, right, right
Right, right, right
Right, right
Oh, don't they say
I'm so happy
Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it

I'm so happy, I'm so happy
Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?
