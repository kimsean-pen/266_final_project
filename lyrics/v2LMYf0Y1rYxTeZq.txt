Crossing the eternal night
Under a blood red sky
Savagery in hallucinated eyes
Wet asphalt reflects a diaphanous shine

Prostitution marginates
The walk of phantoms from the day
On the emptiness of these old ways
Home of survivors in the shade
(in the shade)

Is Life criminal
When we dream awake?
It's just a madrigal
Dedicated in vain

In the empty streets we don't have name
And m√≥biles looks hang from the rainy air
Like bats, spiders, flies and rats
We can see clearly in the darkness
(in the darkness)

Is Life criminal
When we dream awake?
It's just a madrigal
Dedicated in vain

On the emptiness of these cold days (4x)
