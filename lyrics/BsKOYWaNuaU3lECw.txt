Less room to face
Less time to drive it no place
Whatever's cool with me
'Cause I got nothin' happenin' that's cool
Just then I catch you under
Junk mind I always wonder
What it is that gets me about you
Those eyes they open wide
And I get psyched
For them to tear right through
I been away since Friday
And you don't know the way, yeah
I been away since Tuesday
And you don't know the way, yeah
I been away
I been away since Tuesday
I'll be the girl you want
And when you wanted
Me to be for you
I fall and fall the window
Is it good time to fly
And hang a brew
And maybe it's too soon
Can I keep it together
Long enough to say my words to you
I been away since Friday
And you don't know the way, yeah
I been away since Tuesday
And you don't know the way, yeah
I can't take it back today
You wouldn't give it anyway
I'm sayin' what I just can't say
It's just not the thing to be
Can't figure out a way to play
It up so that you wanna say
Whatever's cool with me
I been away
I been away since Tuesday
I'll be the girl you want
And when you wanted
Me to be for you
But I can't take it back today
You wouldn't give it anyway
It's just not the thing to be
But I don't think to pace my day
Or figure out if it's okay
Whatever's cool with me
I can't take it back today
I'm sayin' what I just can't say
It's just not the thing to be
Can't figure out a way to play
It up so that you wanna say
Whatever's cool with me
