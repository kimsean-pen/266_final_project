Go 'head and i shit on the floor now
Woof
Girl go 'head and show me how you go down
And i feel my whole body peaking
And i'm fucking anybody with their legs wide
Getting faded with some bitches from the west side
East coast nigga repping north side
Love to waste a hoes time
Bitch i want my own time
Fuck a nigga clothes sign
Always change my number i'm a phone line
Baby girl i don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole life
If they try to see me i go hard i'm a militerial
Counting what i'm allowed like im in the militaria
Lets free up all my niggas coz they been in panateria
Yes i'm always living for the lowlife
Living for the lowlife
Lowlife
