On one whole bottle uplifting
There is no telling what I'll do
Run head first into traffic
A mind set of annihilation

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside of Your head now

Uplift - uplifting

On hallucinogenic uplift
I can step out of my body
Religion is in myself
I'll split my head in two and see you twice

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside of Your head now

Uplift - uplifting

Give me alcohol extremeties
Instead of proofless christianity
Drink deep in a coma state
Critics disgusted, but a smile is on my fucking face

I do anything that I want
I get everything that I ask
And if this message bothers you, you know
Just kiss my fucking asshole

Uplift
