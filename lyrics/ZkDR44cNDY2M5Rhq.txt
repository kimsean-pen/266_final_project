How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why?
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball

Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova

A Champagne Supernova
'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning 'round
We don't know why

Why? Why? Why? Why?
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?

Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me

Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide

In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova

But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning 'round
We don't know why

Why? Why? Why? Why?
How many special people change?

Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
