You didn't close the door
Left a crack open
I couldn't ignore the faint possibility
Of having hope in this insanity
That we still could be
But we're stuck floating in between

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You

Our eyes were closed
With hearts open wide
Dismissed every rule to abide by
Our bodies undressed the layers of shy
Revealing the truth that was buried inside
Filled up feelings
That now are bursting at the seams

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You

Unsure of what are my dreams it seems
You have stolen my slumber and awakened another
Life within me that is better than any other
Reaching endless heights in never ending nights
That can't be seen put to bed this dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You
