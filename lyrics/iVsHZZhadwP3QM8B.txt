Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognise me?
It's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

I wrapped it up and I sent it
With a note saying "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'll fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with fire in his heart
Man undercover but you tore me apart
Ooh baby, I found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
Last Christmas but you tore me apart
You tore me apart
'Cause I gave you my heart
