I found you here right beside me
Saying all the things you've never done
There's no much time and less to say
Oh please, just come away
You could be my lady
And we'll walk the streets
For no reason maybe
Just till you see won't be so lonely
When you're with me you won't ever be so lonely
She's one known to police
'Coz she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
All this love would kill me
But I don't think I might
Blame it on the way
We don't even care
We gonna be alright, alright, yeah
We fall asleep in the morning light
Only when we dream we just might
Find a way to make sense of everything we seen
Tonight, you could be my lady
And we'll walk the streets
For no reason maybe
Just till you see won't be so lonely
When you're with me you won't ever be so lonely
She's one known to police
'Coz she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
All this love would kill me
But I don't think I might
Blame it on the way
We don't even care
We gonna be alright, alright, yeah

Wake up, turn around
You're my girl
If you stick with me
Then you won't ever be so lonely
She's one known to police
'Coz she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
All this love would kill me
But I don't think I might
Blame me on the way
We don't even care
We gonna be alright, alright, yeah.
