Crawling on your
Poison to prepare
Now you're gone I float along
Like embers in the air
How could you understand?

Bring your armies down upon me
March across my back
Now or never, no surrender
'Til the flag goes black
How could you understand?
How could you understand?

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack again

Under all the bricks and mortar

Saints and sinners make good prisoners
Now the king is dead
How could you understand?

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack again

Under attack
Under attack
Under attack

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Crawling on my hands and knees
Under attack
Under attack again

Am I the soldier that you want me to be?
Running from my enemy
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack again...
