My mother loved it so she said
sad eyed pearl and drop lips
glancing pierce through writer man
spoke hushed and frailing hips
her old eyes skim in creasing lids
a tear falls as she describes
approaching death with a yearning heart
with pride and no despise

Hot tears flow as she recounts
her favorite worded token
forgive me please for hurting so
don't go away heartbroken no
don't go away heartbroken no

Just wise owl tones no velvet lies
crush her velvet call
oh Marlene suffer all the fools
who write you on the wall
and hold your tongue about your life
or dead hands will change the plot
will make your loving sound like snakes
like you were never hot

Hot tears flow as she recounts
her favorite worded token
forgive me please for hurting so
My mother loved it so she said
sad eyed pearl and drop lips yeah
glancing pierce through writer man
spoke hushed and frailing lips yeah
old eyes skim in creasing lids
a tear falls as she describes
approaching death with a yearning heart
with pride and no despise

Hot tears flow as she recounts
her favorite worded token
forgive me please for hurting so
