I dont fuck with clowns im wit the scarecrows
Smoking on a Dead rose
Riding in a red ghost
When the night comes dont know where my Head goes
Why u got a Wet phone
I been in the rain bro
Fucka offer im just gonna Say no
I dont wanna waste no time on fucking lameos
I fell from the sky i got a halo
Gotta let the Days go
By, i gotta stay low

Drinking vodka out the bottle
Put a xanny in my water
Weed and pills under my armor
Give a fuck u get Unfollowd
Pictures pay me im a model
Ur a basic i won't bother
Fuck w Blader im a cutter
Im still stuck up in that Summer
Do u want this shit I wonder
Sg we gon fuck u over
Beamer truck i run u over
Ecco pull up in a rover
Pouring codeine in my soda
Pouring codeine in my soda
Havnt seen her i dont know her
Dissapearing out of Nowhere
