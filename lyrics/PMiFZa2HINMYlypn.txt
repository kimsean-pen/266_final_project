We can dance if we want to
We can leave the old friends behind
Cause, your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, their no friends of mine
We can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
We can act like we've come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can go where we want to
The night is young
And so am I
We can dress real neat from our hands to our feet
And suprise 'em with a victory cry
We can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
You can act real rude
And totally remood
And I can act like an imbacil
We can dance
We can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance
We can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody is taking
Taking a chance
We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life in mind
As long a we abuse it
We're never gonna lose it
Everything will turn out right
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Cause, your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine
We can dance
We can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance
We can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody is taking
Taking a chance
The safety dance
