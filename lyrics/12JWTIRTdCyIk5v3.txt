Resplendence, as servants we are hidden in distress
In silence we glare, in light, ablaze
Embraced, aligned in pitch-black mass we rot
And drown into time and space

And we are crawling from abyss, In a sudden flash widespread
Through time and space, as a stream of grace
When we have fallen, down into the void
Esteem the fading, our inner mourning flame

In obedience, in damnation we are damned to obsess
In reticence we shine, in glitter, sparkling bright
Sustained, forgotten, as shivered souls we spoil
And drown into time and space

In a moment of disguise, we descry sombrous rebirth
In a stream of grace descend, as clandestine stars
When we have fallen, dawn beyond all grief
Withstand the burden, we promise our last farewell

Embraced, aligned in pitch-black mass widespread
Extolled our remains, as clandestine stars we rot.
