Another hungry look, In her eyes again.
Pacing the floor, The hunt begins.
Skin-tight leather provides my pleasure.
Wake my fear, surge with the pressure.
Walk away and leave forever,
do I dare?

Raise my eyes, she stands.
Holding out healing hands...
are you happy now?

I walk the Thin Line for you.
Do just what you say to,
With fear as my friend,
I walk the Thin Line one more time for you.

Addictive face pretending, don't speak the Word.
Forbidden sin relenting, I barely heard...
screams of entry blur my vision.
Wake my fear of Divine Intervention
Crawl away and bleed forever, if you dare.

Hand on mouth the game goes on.
Love, our stage to play upon.
Are you happy now?

I walk the Thin Line for you.
Do just what you say to.
With fear as my friend,
I walk the Thin Line one more time for you.

I walk the Thin Line for you.
Do just what you say to.
I walk the Thin Line for you.
Do just what you say to,
With fear as my friend,
I walk the Thin Line one more time for you.
