When the shaking floor of life force
Reveal its chasm underneath
If only one could be two steps ahead

To discover the loneliness
And be too proud to show the wounds
Will forever wander alone through the years

But I won't let you near
Begging, begging for you all to understand
The fear that lives in my soul was another

Read, what is written on the silent mouth
What is written in the soul
For which is written in the shining silence
We all have to read it
What is written on the silent mouth
What is written in the soul
For which is written in the shining silence
We all have to
