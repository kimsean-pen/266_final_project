Duce Po'd up right
Dropped my xanax in my sprite
Slap my main bitch out of spite
Thumbin' through a check all night
Ima smash never solid
All i know its getting rowdy
Stackin paper, flexin guala

Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Nigga, why you talkin, nigga it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter

Flex on they ass
Flex on them boys like I told them
Momma gave birth I was golden
I need the foreign, I need the bitches
Sauce on yo bitch now she with it
Tell me like what you niggas talkin
I need bands no conversation
Main bitch side ho in my vacant
It became a situation
Now these drugs got me contemplating
Two to seven weeks within my nature
Twenty two I put the deuce up to ya maker
Twenty seven lives dying all up in the light
Hella sacred
I done popped a perc
Now I'm kick stand
Pop a xanny finna get my hoop back
Moon walk through the mall like mike jack
Sippin so much sip up, I po up
Four up in my double cup
My momma kicked me out I got it
Right up out the fucking mud
Now I'm on a roll fuckin hoes up in my presence
Fuck they said I wasn't shit
Now im gloed the [?] up

Duce Po'd up right
Dropped my xanax in my sprite
Slap my main bitch out of spite
Thumbin' through a check all night
Ima smash never solid
All i know its getting rowdy
Stackin paper, flexin guala

Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Nigga, why you talkin, nigga it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
Why you talkin nigga, it dont matter
