I don't mind if I am completely lost when I'm with you
I am always somewhat found in the things that we do together
I hope I can be somebody who shows you your heart
The way that it weighs upon my own
If only we could understand each other, I'd happily die
Oh, I don't care if I spend my whole life away
I'm gonna try to give to you all of the love that I've been shown before
Can't wait until tomorrow so that I can know you more
So that I can know you more
So that I can know you more
With all my life, my might
Turn all my dark into light
Take all of the hate in my mind and put it aside
Put it aside
