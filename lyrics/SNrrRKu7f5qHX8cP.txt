close this wound
alight my bones
fall back in
hide your sin

I'm going away for a long time
I'm going away for a long time

bring the night
day comes too soon
dark its embrace
scatters all trace

I'm going away for a long time
I'm going away for a long time

close this wound
alight my bones
fall back in
hide your sin

I'm going away for a long time
I'm going away for a long time
