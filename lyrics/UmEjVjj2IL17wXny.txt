Deathly are my days
Alone in my chamber
Absent is joy when you're not around
The dark has never been so dark
Without you my sweetheart, my sweetheart
The petals are falling
Falling for us

I don't want do go home
I just want to stay
I'll keep my arms open
And wait all my days
The petals are falling
Falling for us
