Long way from home
Lost by an echo, I'd never of known
I've got pictures to prove I was there
But you don't care

Here's me overseas
Across a pond by the Dover peaks
I've smuggled myself into new nationalities
You think you'd be proud of me

There's room to believe
Out of sight, out of mind, out of reach
Start over is no way to begin

Long way from home
Lost by an echo, I'd never of known
I've got pictures to prove I was there
But you don't care

There's room to believe
Out of sight, out of mind, out of reach
Start over, start over is no way to begin

There's room to believe
Out of sight, out of mind, out of reach
Start over, start over is no way to begin
Way to begin, way to begin
