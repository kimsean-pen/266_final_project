I'm just being honest
I need time to think
You said let's take a week
So we can figure out what we should be
I wonder if you want him
I wonder if we're fake
It's like we're trapped in the feedback,
A cycle we can't seem to break
Stuck in contemplation on the interstate

I feel you calling in my pocket but I don't think
You will like what I would say right now
The world, a constant stream of color out my window

If I fell asleep at the wheel
Would you regret all of the things you said?
I'd like to see how it feels with both of
My eyes closed and one foot over the edge
Cause' I need more
Oh, our lives are much too short
And I don't wanna feel this anymore

Oh, do you?

You ever think about how easy it'd be to turn
The steering wheel an inch or two and meet the sea
Oh, I never would though it may be fun to believe
It's just a sick little day dream

If I fell asleep at the wheel,
Would you regret all of the things you said?
I'd like to see how it feels with both of
My eyes closed and one foot over the edge
Cause' I need more
Oh, our lives are much too short
I don't wanna feel this anymore

Take this away, the burden of us
It's heavy to hold
Drifting slowly, closer to dust
Still believing there's only one

Bleeding it out, bleeding it out, bleeding it out
Bleeding it out, bleeding it out
Bleeding it out, bleeding it out, bleeding it out
Bleeding it out, bleeding it out

Still we try to pick up the pieces
You shouldn't have to change yourself to make us work
Well, I just want you to be happy regardless
I will love you even if we're just energy

If I fell asleep at the wheel,
Would you regret all of the things you said?
I'd like to see how it feels with both of my eyes closed
And free fall over the edge
Cause' I need more,
Oh, our lives are much too short
And I don't wanna feel this anymore
