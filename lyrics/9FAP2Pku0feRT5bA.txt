Those scars
All those senseless scars
My worst parts were when you're gone
And the endless screaming dark
Comes in from the suburbs
And makes everything worse
Oh, you know how the truth works
And for whatever it's worth

Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you
Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you

Does it work?
Does it start the things that hurt?
How much and how often?
Do those ocean bedroom floors
Even reach the walls anymore?
Can it really be worth it?
All the stinging and wincing
You said something perfect
With six words and one kiss

Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you
Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you

Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you
Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love you, I love you
