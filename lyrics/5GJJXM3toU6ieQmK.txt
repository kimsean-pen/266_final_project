I'm just a vision on your TV screen
Just something conjured from my dream
Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
The image is no images, it's not what it seems

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being

It's quite plain to see that I'm playing with me
A photo-fit of loose ends, framed in 3-D
Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
The image is no images, it's not what it seems

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being, being, being

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in the breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being

It's not what it seems
The image is no images
It's not what it seems
It's not what it seems
