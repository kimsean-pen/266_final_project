Awake at night you focus
On everyone whose hurt you
Then write a list of targets
Your violent lack of virtue

Leave us alone!
You're on your own!
Go!

We are breathing
While your sleeping go
And leave us alone
The liars cheating
Our hearts beating, go
And now you're on your own.

Here's to your perfect weapon
Crack bones with blind aggression
Like birds whose wings are broken
You live without direction

Leave us alone!
You're on your own!

We are breathing
While your sleeping, go
And leave us alone
The liars cheating
Our hearts beating, go
And now you're on your own.

GO!
GO!
GO!
GO!
And now you're on your own!
GO!
GO!
And leave us alone!

We are breathing,
While your sleeping, go
And leave us alone,
The liars cheating,
Our hearts beating, go
And now you're on your own.
