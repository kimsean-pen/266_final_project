I have a vision, i have high hopes.
it'll be worth it in the grand scope.
things will only get better for us, and i will never leave california.
i'll wait forever for this to work.
you're my best friend and you're my self-worth.
the risk is nothing i can't bare.
Shoveled and dragged, used like a rag.
i'll make this right.
i'll take your advice, this time.
You knew you'd break me, you got what you wanted.
one day i woke up, but i'm still haunted.
i'd like to think i'm stronger for this,
but i'm not sure that i learned my lesson.
it feels like it's my fault, but i know inside:
you were my best friend but you fucked up my life.
the pain is nothing i can't bare.
