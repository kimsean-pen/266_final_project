And back to these cold, shitty days in Portland
Wishing I'd never come across your face
Plauged by the memories of things unspoken
Scared by thoughts of your father

Made me look over the flaws of your nature
Laying on your back became your only escape
You feel so old, used, but not yet broken enough to think you have it all together

I never planned to carry your burdens
But this child was a mistake

I knew from the moment I stepped off that plane,
we had no future
How come your dreams are always so bitter?
And who knows?
Maybe one day
she will know my name

You still return to the same skylines
that leave you broken
Cheap talks with even cheaper company,
keeps the days turning into nights

You lay awake crying because your child
carries my name,
while I regret ever making you apart of my life

Sadly enough, this song's not to hurt you
Just to show the world that I'm free

I knew from the moment I stepped off that plane,
we had no future
How come your dreams are always so bitter?

And who knows?
And maybe one day
she will know my name

She'll know
She will know
