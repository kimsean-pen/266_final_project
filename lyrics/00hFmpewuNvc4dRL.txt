Na nanana na nanana

It's the perfect night
To go out and do it right
One look into your eyes
Sets the emotion
Don't need psychology
With this biology
Our physiology is ever flowing
All I really wanna do is feel love
Get into the rhythm of the two of us
wanna feel your love can't get enough
together

I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
when you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
pulled by your gravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me

The way my body acts
When your body moves like that
It's science in control
And we're defenceless
It's in the D.N.A.
that we feel this way
So let the music play

With least attention

All I really wanna do is feel love
Get into the rhythm of the two of us
wanna feel your love can't get enough
together

I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
when you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
pulled by your gravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me

I feel you touching me

Chemistry

I want you touching me

Chemistry

I feel you touching me
Na nanana na nanana na nanana

I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
when you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
pulled by your gravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me
