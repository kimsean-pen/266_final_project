I can't see another way
We are born into feeling blue
Just tell me I'm burning out
I know every word is true
Older and older
The voice of wasted youth has never been so loud
Over and over
Like powder in the barrel pushing deeper down

Give up, swallow it whole, let go
Swallow it all, come on
Swallow it all

And now rise and now repeat
"We deserve everything we own"
The long road to transience
The tightrope between our bones
Oh, we are golden
Every other step is met with vicious eyes
Strangers and lovers
The sugar-filled assurance in between the lies

Give up, swallow it whole, let go
Swallow it all, come on
Swallow it all

Come on, swallow it whole, come on
Swallow it all, give up
Swallow it whole, let go
Swallow it all, come on
Swallow it all
