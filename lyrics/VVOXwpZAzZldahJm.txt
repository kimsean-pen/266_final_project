The walls are closing in again, oh well
The walls are closing in again, oh well
I seen some thing I thought I never saw
Covered in hair

Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
And my mind is up here on another wave
Covered in hair

She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a monster in your parasol

Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
I seen some things I thought I never saw
Covered in hair

She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow, she won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a monster in your parasol
You've got a hole in you I never saw

In your parasol
In your parasol
In your parasol
