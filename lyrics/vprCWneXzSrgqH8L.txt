Everyone's right
And no one is sorry
That's the start and the end of the story
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning
Everyone's right
And no one is sorry
That's the start and the end of the story
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning
And life is just bets anyway
Look alive
See these bones
What you are now we were once
Try it as they the might
No one is immune to
Misfiring and acting on the wrong clues
And thinking this time to re-do, re-do
I feel rain in the movies
And the talk before the screen lights
I hear strings in the park
I don't like to call or write
Except when it's too late at night
And mostly just think in the dark
Look alive
See these bones
What you are now we were once
Just like we are
You will be dust
Just like we are
Permanent
You look too tired to eat
to hungry too sleep
Just imagine the speed
It's just what you need
Look alive
And see these bones
What you are now
We were once
And just like we are
You'll be dust
Just like we are
Permanent
The lights in the city
Are more or less blinking
This side of the story
Decides what you are thinking
Warm arms and cold faces
we're squinting, we're hurrying
We take inventory
We're digging, we're burying.
Do you remember when the light was low?
Do you remember it fell?
Do you remember when we went through her house?
Remember ringing the bell?
Look alive

Look alive
See these bones
