It's never too late, I heard you say
How can you turn and go away
I'm staking my claim to some degree
Don't bring the secret home to me

Better to live than to know
Better the noise that we love an' hate
Remember the moments we've loved
Whenever I feel like I'm in a state

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can beat it

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
There used to be a way but there ain't no more

How can we be free?
We both need each other like sister and brother
You mean that much to me

Better to live than to know
Better the noise that we love an' hate
Remember the moments we've loved
Whenever I feel like I'm in a state

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can beat it

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
There used to be a way but there ain't no more

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can beat it

I'm never gonna do what you want me to
I'm never gonna do what you want me to
