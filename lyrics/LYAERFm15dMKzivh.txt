You are the same
Just passing miles

They thatched from all the useless lines
From nighttime walks ignoring rain
Does every drug fools the same
Drug fools the same

Moving on
Moving out
Moving on
Moving out
Moving on
Moving out
Moving on
Moving out

You're beaing illogical
This dance is probable
Do you see this is all we see
And set this company

No need to be secretive
See we all have no time
No time to live

We're returning home ocasionally
Forty pound bus for a week
bus for a week

Moving on
Moving out
Moving on
Moving out
Moving on
Moving
Move on
Moving out
Move on
Moving on and out

You're being illogical
This dance is probable
Do you see this is all we see
And set this company

There's no time
No time at all
You're all talk girl
You're all talk

Every mile is one mile more
One long walk girl
One long walk

You're being such a pain
Such a pain
Will you be here some time
Broken braily
Pooring rain
Pooring rain
Coming, coming down on

You're being such a pain
Such a pain
Will you be here some time
Broken brolly
Pooring rain
Pooring rain
Coming, coming down on
