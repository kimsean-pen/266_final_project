Yeah, I did it all on my own, no promo
I got fans gettin' tats of my logo
I remember when nobody came to my shows
But I kept 'em comin' back like a yo-yo
In high school, they would laugh, try to label
Eatin' lunch with nobody at my table
Everyone that used to doubt got a day job
I just made a few stacks off a merch drop

It's about time that they go and take me serious
If you not feelin' this, you probably delirious
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they can never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause

Think it's about time they traded clout for sobriety
I could feel the hate buildin' up, it's inside of me
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they can never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause

Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer

Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer

CDG on my feet when I hop out
Me and J on the beat, it's a bop now
Whole squad goin' dumb like it's summer school
I got hits, got smashers like a drummer do
OMG, now you see me on the TV
Went from sellin' beats, and now I'm sellin' CD's
I know you see me, know you need me, but believe me
I feel like dyin' like my name Lil' Weezy

It's about time that they go and take me serious
If you not feelin' this, you probably delirious
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they can never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause

Think it's about time they traded clout for sobriety
I could feel the hate buildin' up, it's inside of me
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they can never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause
