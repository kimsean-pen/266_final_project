When I close my eyes
I can see your face
And I want to scream
And I want to chase you out of my dreams
But there is no bed where he used to sleep
And it gets so cold where the one as heat
Now only in dreams
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasted away
I found necklace that you used to wear
I found a sweater I still smell you there
Now only in dreams
I want to save you anyway I can I'll steal your rings and make these your hands
Yeah only in dreams
But there's nothing to say at the end of the day.
I'm wasted away
Wasted away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Oh
Oh
Oh
But there's nothing to say
At the end of the day
I'm wasting away
Wasting away
I'd rather waste away
I'd rather waste away
Id rather waste away than see you
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
