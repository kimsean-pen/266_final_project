She used to be a chancer, sparkle in the rain,
told me she needed a friend.
Is she going crazy, baby's on the way,
Seems like the day never ends.

Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah),
Never shines (Never shines),
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going.

Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Bossanova baby, heart is never soul,
Shouting but he's never heard
Eyes all wide and open, streets are paved with gold,
Someone's come back on their word

Everybody needs some affection (Ah, ah, ah),
Never shines (Never shines),
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going.

Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Down and dirty city, feeling outta place,
Maybe you've ran out of time,
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face,
Make up the last of the lines

Everybody needs some attention (Ah, ah, ah),
Never shines (Never shines),
Gotta try (Gotta try), Wherever you're going.

Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Belive me, State of mind)

Hey now look around, pick yourself up off the ground, I said
Hey now look around, pick yourself up off the ground, I said (Never get up)
Hey now look around, pick yourself up off the ground, I said
hey now look around, pick yourself up off the ground, I said (Never Give Up), I said

Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up no, never give it up no),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind (Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times,
gotta believe in the love you find (Never give it up),
Never give up on the good times,
living it up is a state of mind
