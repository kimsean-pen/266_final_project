I used to hide my eyes in the shadows
Stay blind to the light of day
Stop, look away, lock the door, change the channel
In the pretty cage I made
The world outside seemed cold as ice
It's warm here where I wait
But the air gets stale and your breath gets shallow
And you start to suffocate

Soft and slow, it starts to grow
And I know I have to go

Say it's time, say goodbye
Sound the drum, say it's time
Go back to one, close the door
Here's to finding something more
Say it's the end of an age
Say you know
Winds of change will bring you home
Look alive, now take your aim
And fly away

I heard a voice
Felt a stir in the quiet
Saying, "Make your grand escape"
Hum to myself
Tried to kill it with silence
But the silence didn't take
If bars that are build don't keep me safe
What am I afraid to face?
Got a fear of heights, but I see the horizon
And I've got to make a break

Soft and slow, it starts to grow
And I know I have to go

Say it's time, say goodbye
Sound the drum, say it's time
Go back to one, close the door
Here's to finding something more
Say it's the end of an age
Say you know
Winds of change will bring you home
Look alive, now take your aim

Glide on the sky
Tonight I won't look behind, no
Glide on the sky (on the sky)
Maybe tonight I'll close my eyes and say goodbye

Say it's time, say goodbye
Sound the drum, say it's time
Go back to one, close the door
Here's to finding something more
Say it's the end of an age
Say you know
Winds of change will bring you home
Look alive, now take your aim
And fly away
And fly away
