To the edge
Till we all get off
I will take
You away with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
Shower me into the same
Realm

Calculate, I'll embrace
Hold on
(Come with me now)
Right away
Outer space with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
Shower me into the same
Realm

Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
I will lead us to the same
Realm

When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come right away with me
Come on, you'll see
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
Shower me into the same
Realm
Time will lead us to the same
Realm
I will lead us to the same
Realm
