I waited so long
For something sweet like this
It's where I belong
Beside you in blinding bliss

I'm living in a daydream
Nothing that could faze me now
I'm caught up in a daydream
Nothing that could wake me now

What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want

Faded it's gone
The darkness I once knew
What could go wrong?
My heart is safe with you
M-my heart is safe with you

I'm living in a daydream
Nothing that could faze me now
I'm caught up in a daydream
Nothing that could wake me now

What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want

I'm living in a daydream
Nothing that could faze me now
(Nothing that could faze me now)
I'm caught up in a daydream
(I'm caught up in a daydream)
Nothing that could wake me now
(Nothing that could faze me now)

What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want
What more could a girl want
