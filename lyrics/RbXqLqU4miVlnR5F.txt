Oh, iron lung, are you at the house?
Will you be alright, did they throw you out?
I want to know, are they keeping you down?
Are you working now, is it working out?

Now, I suppose you've been under the gun
Is it closing time, do you have to run?
Try this on... you feel perfect now
Did they speak of you until their tongues fell out?

I don't believe you, iron lung
I don't believe in the plow
You kept me young, you were my iron lung
I need you now

Now, iron lung, did they make you sing
When they bent your arm and took your ring?
I can see you now, I can hear your sound
You keep me up, my iron lung

I don't believe you, iron lung
I don't believe in the plow
You kept me young, you were my iron lung
I need you now
