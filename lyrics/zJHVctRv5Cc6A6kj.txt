I need your body
I got to have your body

You whisper my name and I feel my heart
Beat like it's never gonna stop
I lose all self control and feel it start
Your love takes me right to the top

And the wind cries out
Out your name to me
And I feel no shame
Feeling this way

I need your body
I got to have your body
Close to me
Such a temptation
A burning new sensation's
Flowing through me
I want you close to me

You make me feel like we're the only ones
Who've ever been in love before
These feelings burn inside me night and day
You keep me reaching out for more

And the wind cries out
Out your name to me
And I feel no shame
Feeling this way

I need your body
I got to have your body
Close to me
Such a temptation
A burning new sensation
Flowing through me
I need you close to me

And the wind, cries out
Out your name, to me
And I feel, no shame
Feeling this way

I need your body
