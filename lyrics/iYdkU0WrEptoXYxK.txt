How am I supposed to feel?
How am I supposed to feel?

You are the cobble stone
I am the gravel road
I swear I'm not as far as I am close

At least that's how it seems to be
So let's pause

So lets pause for a second
Feel the motion in the breeze
Cause I see you moving
And I'm still like a statue as the wind refuses to touch me
I am a pond. You wanted an ocean
You wanted an ocean

Cleanse my eyes, my legs, my face, everything in between
This place was never meant for me
This place was never meant for me
Cleanse my eyes, my legs, my face, everything in between
This place was never meant for me
This place was never meant for me

At least that's how it seems to be
At least that's how it seems to be
To me

Close the casket make your way to the shoreline
I can taste the salt I can taste the salt
I can taste the birthplace where I evolved

Bring me back
I never wanted to leave
Bring me back
It's all I had
Bring me back
And now I'm suffocating
Bring me back
Is this too much to ask?

Well I'm breaking through
Do these walls seem thick?
Well I'm breaking through
Well I'm breaking through
Do these walls seem thick?
Well I'm breaking through
Breaking through
