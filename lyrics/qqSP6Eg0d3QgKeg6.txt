Oh, it's too late
I got hit by the closing door
And as I watch myself reflect
On the wrong side of

My you've changed
You turned a corner I'll never go
I admit I feel a bit deceived
You're expecting I'd follow

Bandoliers
To fight me dear
Nobody caused the rift
We've just grown apart now

So prepare and take aim
And fire
Prepare and take aim
And fire on me
If that's the way it has to be

I'm fooling myself
Fooling myself into believing you
And all these fictionary tales
You're telling yourself

Selfish
Like a child that's never heard a "no"
I watch this everchanging you
Never find us

Bandoliers
To fight you dear
Nobody caused the rift
Can't become what I'm not
You've always had my heart
So if it must be broken

Prepare and take aim
And fire
Prepare and take aim
And fire

Prepare and take aim
And fire
Prepare and take aim
And fire

Fire away
If you must, but I only came
Just to let you know

This is goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Prepare and take aim
And fire
Prepare and take aim
And fire
'Cause no one can make me fire
No one can make me fire
