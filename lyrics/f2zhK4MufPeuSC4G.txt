It's just another Monday
I'm just another face in a faceless crowd
I'm going down one-way
Caught up in the machine
And I'm spit right out
I'm living in a rat race
I'm looking for my soul in the lost-and-found

I'm sitting in the same spot
Counting every tick-tock
Gotta hit the punch clock
When's it gonna stop-stop?
Another day in black and white

One, two, three, four, five
Another week goes by
I'm half alive
I'm getting sick of faking this
I'm over it
Don't wanna wear no suit and tie
Gotta live before I die
So I'm done, done, done
With this ordinary life

What happened to the someday?
What happened to the dreams of the wide-eyed kid?
Don't tell me that it's too late
Don't tell me that I can't cause you never did

I'm sitting in the same spot
Counting every tick-tock
Gotta hit the punch clock
When's it gonna stop-stop?
Another day in black and white
I gotta quite this ordinary life

One, two, three, four, five
Another week goes by
I'm half alive
I'm getting sick of faking this
I'm over it

Don't wanna wear no suit and tie
Gotta live before I die
So I'm done, done, done
With this ordinary life

I don't wanna wake up
With my best years behind me
I don't wanna wake up
With my best years behind me
I don't wanna wake up
With my best years behind me

I think I better wake up
Before my life's behind me

Whoa

One, two, three, four, five
Another week goes by
I'm half alive
I'm getting sick of faking this
I'm over it

Don't wanna wear no suit and tie
Gotta live before I die
So I'm done, done, done
With this ordinary life

One, two, three, four, five
No more ordinary life

One, two, three, four, five
I gotta wake up, wake up

One, two, three, four, five
No more ordinary life

I'm done, done, done with this ordinary
This whole thing is temporary
Done, done, done with this ordinary life
