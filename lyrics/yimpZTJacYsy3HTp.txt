Hold on
What's the rush? What's the rush?
We're... not done are we?
Cause I don't need to change this...
Atmosphere we made if you can stay one more hour
Can you stay one more hour?
You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch you and, and make you stay

Hold on
I'll be here when it's
All done you know
Cause what's the point in chasing
If I can't enjoy your face and
We can be wrong tonight
Can we be wrong tonight?

You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch you and, and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear, it's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me

And if I was running you'd be the one who I would be running to
And if I was crying you would be lying on the cloud that would pull me through
And if I was scared then I would be glad to tell you and walk away
I am not lying, I am just trying to find my way into you

You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch you and, and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear, it's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me

You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time to catch you and, and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear, it's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have your way with me
And if I was running
And if I was crying
And if I was scared
You know I'm gonna find a way to let you have
Your way with me
