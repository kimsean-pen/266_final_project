A last minute decision
Lay it all on the line
Glasspipe recollections of antichrist
The nominees all on fire

Cash money upfront
We're all part of the scam
Dead stars at the end of the rope
A fake miracle to behold

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

Ninety nine knives inside
Ninety nine, ninety nine
Ninety nine knives inside

Separate the symptoms
From the real disease
A pale ghostlike rendition of consequence
The irony covers the crime

Preeten's giving head in the backroom
A family built on abuse

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

Ninety nine, ninety nine knives
Ninety nine, ninety nine
Ninety nine knives inside

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties
No one gets out alive
Ninety nine, ninety nine
Ninety nine knives inside
Ninety nine, ninety nine
hopeles fucking useless empty ways to die
