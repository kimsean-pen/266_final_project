This is not, this is not
This is not, this is not a motherfuck
A motherfucking game, motherfucker, This is not
This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy?
I'm just saying boy
Yeah

Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the lambo'
Know they told me kill them all, goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo

No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga I just kill em because I can though

I'm as humble as they come, but you're fucking with the wrong one
Boy you're fucking with the wrong one
This that new Pen Griffey watch that nigga get a home run
Watch him hit it, it's a home run
I ain't playin' wit' you nigga's
I'm a true louis Villain
I'm the realest, they acrylic
Fuck them niggas if they doubt it
Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter
I've been getting up, gotta pay my self allowance
And I save it like the bail, I can't take no more L's
The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell
Been putting on a show, just like Dave Chappelle
They ain't make it in the credits, imma tell them oh well

Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel
Niggas gotta get the work, girl unless you gon twerk something
While I lay this verse on em'
Damn this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it, i'm just saying nigga (Young Tiller)

Rambo, they begging for mercy, like the lambo'

No they told me kill them all, goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga I just kill em because I can though

This ain't temporary, I've been out here, letting them know
New cat, years later, best as Sylvester Stallone
I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know
Beat the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them though
She chose me over him, cause he's was so regular, oh
He was so regular, I'm like a butler, getting this dough
I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking predator
Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra
I don't fuck with thotties, I pass them to my partner
All gold everything, bitch I'm Fort Knoxin'

New sports car man
I'm new Porsche coppin', Two door hop in
Girl you know how I spend
And I've been trying to budget my checks with the rest with the money, money
Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds
M.V.P upper deck with the money, money
Don't I make the haters upset with the money
Bitch I'm coming
This is not, this is not
This is not, this is not a motherfuck
A motherfucking game, motherfucker, This is not
This is not, a motherfucking game, why you playin' boy?
I'm just saying boy
Tiller!
