I saw the photograph, an image of you
Things have never looked, looked like this
It's never been like this
I'm swimming in gray
I'm just swimming in gray

Let them all walk away, all walk away
So there's no one to blame
They all feel the same
Let them all walk away, all walk away
I'll be left with the shame

You saw the photograph, an image of me
You'll never see me like this
It's never felt like this
I'm swimming in gray
I'm just swimming in gray

Let them all walk away, all walk away
So there's no one to blame
They all feel same
Let them all walk away, all walk away
I'll be left with the shame
