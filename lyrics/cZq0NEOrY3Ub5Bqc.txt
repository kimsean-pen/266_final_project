You told me i was lucky,
To have my chance with you.
Now last year's summer romance,
Is this year's winter blues.
I treated you so nicely,
To jewelry, and champagne,
But you left me empty handed,
Yeah, you left me feeling,
Play - ay - ayed

Now i hope you are happy with yourself,
'Cause i'm not laughing,
Don't you think is kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When i gave you my heart,
You ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So i wrote you a song,
hope that you sing along
And it goes,
"Merry Christmas, Kiss my ass!"

They say i'm losing my mind,
I thought that for a while,
I tear down decorations
They remind me of your smile.
I hate that mistletoe,
It makes me think of our first kiss,
You bit my lip, you pulled me close,
And then you taught me how to quit.

Now i hope you are happy with your self,
'Cause i'm not laughing,
Don't you think is kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When i gave yoy my heart,
You ripped it apart,
Like wrapping paper trash
So i wrote you a song,
Hope that you sing along,
And it goes,
"Marry Christmas, Kiss my ass!"

So sick of calling,
You won't telephone me,
No, fuck you girl, i'm going out,
I gave you my all,
But our love hit a wall now,
I'm jingle belling,
And everyone's yelling,
We'll drink 'till the bars shut us down.

Ain't that just what Christmas is all about?

And i hope, hope you are happy with your self,
'Cause i'm not laughing (not laughing)
Don't you think is so damn trashy
What yoy did this holiday?
(so trashy)
I gave you my heart, (heart)
You ripped it apart
Like the wrapping paper trash (wrapping paper trash)
So i wrote you a song,
Hope that you sing along,
And it goes,
"Marry Christmas, (bitch), Kiss my ass!"
