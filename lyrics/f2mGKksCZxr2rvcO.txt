Strange to be on Marvel hill
I've walked some years to find
I know there is a piece to fill
The gap I have in mind

No, nothing's here
I close my eyes
It's on the other side

And what I've worked so hard to gain
I'd gladly give away
'Cause I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more

A postcard from where life's a thrill
On top of Marvel hill
But I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more

No, I don' t need this
(I don' t need this)
(Ooo)
Too good to be true
(Good to be true)
(Ooo)
Too good to ignore
(Good to ignore)
(Ooo)

I don't need this
(I don't need this)
(Ooo)
I need so much more
(Ooo)
It's too much to ask for
(Ooo)
