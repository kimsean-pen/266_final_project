Broken down so I walk the line
I dry my wounds and I ain't dying
I'm out of money, I'm out of time
I fly low like a broken arrow
Time slows and my vision narrows
I'm out of money, I'm out of time

Sing your hearts out, sing it loud
Make me happy, make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me

I feel alive beneath the rubble
A wretched soul in a sea of trouble
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Stop the fire set it out
Good intentions wearing out
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

Sing your hearts out, sing it loud
Make me happy, make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me

I'm fighting the fever again
I'm fighting the fever

Sing your hearts out, sing it loud
Make me happy make, me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me
