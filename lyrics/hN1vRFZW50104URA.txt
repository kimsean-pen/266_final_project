My eyes are weary
Of you before me
I see for their sake
The light of daybreak
It shines upon me
This night we'd all see
No reason ever was given
No reason ever was given

Two tides of recoil
This moment's glory
A failed reminder
Of a broken story
My vague emotions
One day will find
No reason ever was given
No reason ever was given
