Saturday is shopping day--
I drive my car but there's no place to park it
No respect for supermen in the supermarket
I guess there must be trouble but I not been alerted
looking round the store it was all deserted and I'm
stranded here with my empty basket
so full of question got nowhere to ask it

By the one way out
strange voice shout
"Don't let that good man out!"

"Have a wonderful day in our one-way world
one way, one day
Have a wonderful day in our one-way world
one way, one day
one-way man
one-way mind
get along with mankind"

Oh, there's an old man on the floor, so I summon my charm
I say "Hey Scumbag, has there been an alarm?"
he said "Yeh, 'been selling off eternal youth
they all got afraid 'cos I'm the living proof
My name is Einstein do you know time is a curve?"
I said "Stop old man! you got a nerve
'cos there's only one rule that I observe
Time is money and money I serve"

By the one way out
strange voice shout
"Don't let that good man out"

"Have a wonderful day in our one-way world
one way, one day
Have a wonderful day in our one way world
one way, one day
Have a wonderful day in our one way world
one way, one day
one-day man
one-day mind
get along with mankind"
