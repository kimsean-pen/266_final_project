Oh, Banana Co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh, Banana Co.
We'd really love to believe you but

Everything's underground
We got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Oh, she said "No go"
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, Banana Co.
She knows if you die
Then we all do and

Everything's underground
We've got to dig it up somehow
Yeah, yeah

Everything's burning down
We got to put it out somehow
Yeah, yeah
