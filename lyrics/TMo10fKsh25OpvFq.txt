You thought it'd be
An easy trip
But I took you for a ride
Woah, the devil's on your side

You first refused
To take me in
But I made you open wide
Woah, the devil's on your side

I'm in the back of your mind
I'm in the front of your head
I'm in the meaning behind
I'm in the gold and the lead
I'm there when you're whirling the wheel
I'm there when you're facing the fire
I'm there when you're doing the deal
I'm there in the lower and higher

The slime of life
Had stained your heart
But I kept you purified
Woah, the devil's on your side

The kings of earth
Tried to lend a hand
I made sure their hands were tied
Woah, the devil's on your side

I'm at the top of the stairs
I'm at the foot of the cross
I'm at the death of your cares
I'm at the moment of loss
I'm there when you're breaking the bone
I'm there when you're daring to dream
I'm there when you go it alone
I'm there when you're part of the team

When all your thoughts
Become as one
I'll reveal a new divide
Woah, the devil's on your side

You can try your best
To block me out
But I just won't be denied
Woah, the devil's on your side
(Woah...)

No matter where you try to go
You can never hide
The devil is inside
