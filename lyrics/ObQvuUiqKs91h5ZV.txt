You came to me
Was like a dream
But maybe it's time I let you go
It's all on me

Can I find it inside
And feel that fire burn in my eye
Can I give you up
Can I come back down

Gotta get you out of my head
Gotta get you out of my head (Addicted to love)
Gotta get you out of my head (Addicted to love)
Gotta get you out of my head (Addicted to love)
Gotta get you out of my head (Addicted to love)
Gotta get you out of my head (Addicted to love)

(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)

And I wonder why (Addicted to love)
I'm addicted to love (Addicted to love)
One day I will run away from you
And this is love (Addicted to love)

And I wonder why (Addicted to love)
I'm addicted to love (Addicted to love)
One day I will run away from you
And this is love (Addicted to love)

(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)
(Addicted to love)

And I wonder why (Addicted to love)
I'm addicted to love (Addicted to love)
One day I will run away from you
And this is love (Addicted to love)

And I wonder why (Addicted to love)
I'm addicted to love (Addicted to love)
One day I will run away from you
And this is love (Addicted to love)
