In exchange for a house made of windows
Went your roof
While the archive of the past swells with its growth
You've been moved

It's a modern trouble
Metamorphosis
Panoramic splash
And you're a wash in it
It's a modern trouble

This building puts a new angle through the sky
The city moans
In its reflection we can feel what lies ahead
More unknown

It's a modern trouble
Metamorphosis
Panoramic splash
And you're a wash in it
It's a modern trouble
Metamorphosis
Panoramic splash
And you're a wash in it
It's a modern trouble
