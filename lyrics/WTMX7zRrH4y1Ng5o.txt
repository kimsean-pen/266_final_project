You're losing me
Stuck inside a loop
I know you always disagree
There's nothing I can do
So I just

Let go and let you suffocate
'Cause you know, you know that you're too late
This I swear to you, no matter what you do
I'm gone for good!

You've always known that I never show where my heads at 'til it's gone
You've always said you're just a thread, just sew me up and I'll say
Take my breath away, I'm okay
Good to know that you're still faded
I blame myself for this
Paid in full, but now I'm cashing out

When it's face-to-face, you just change
Hurts to see me?
Yeah, you hate it
You failed to see
The strength in me
But now you're finding out

You see my face
Blank and empty
Just waiting to leave this place
I should've known to cut this off and just suffer as I grow
So let go, I know it's hard to take
And you know, you know what's on my plate
This I swear to you, no matter what you do
I'm gone for good!

Take my breath away, I'm okay
Good to know that you're still faded
I blame myself for this
Paid in full, but now I'm cashing out

When it's face-to-face, you just change
Hurts to see me?
Yeah, you hate it
You failed to see
The strength in me
But now you're finding out

And if you hurt yourself to prove something else
Know, I hardly remember your face
There's nothing left to prove
Feel like I barely know
This demon, I thought would stay in one place
But I'm gone!

Take my breath away, I'm okay
Good to know that you're still faded
You failed to see the strength in me, but now you're finding out

When it's face-to-face, you just change
Hurts to see me?
Yeah, you hate it
You failed to see
The strength in me
But now you're finding out

The strength in me
But now you're finding out
