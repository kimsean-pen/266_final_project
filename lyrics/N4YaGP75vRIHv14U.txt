The sky opened up the day you were born
I was so lost, broken and torn
There was no hope, no joy in my life
Ended my darkness by bringing the light

As I fought through the flames
Now you save me

You give me a reason to feel like I belong here
I've been building this house made of gold
Darling have no fear
Yeah I pushed through the rain and the cold
And forgot all the pain that I've known
Yeah, you give me a reason to feel like I belong here
In this house made of gold

Daylight sang from the sky
And burned through the violence inside my mind

Your eyes, your eyes
Your infinite eyes
Your innocence shines
My shadows, they die

Gone is the wandering soul
Once half a man, now my heart,
My heart has come home

My heart, my heart
You'll never be alone
A paradise found
You are my true north

As I fought through the flames
Yeah, you saved me

You give me a reason to feel like I belong here
I've been building this house made of gold
Darling have no fear
Yeah I pushed through the rain and the cold
And forgot all the pain that I've known
Yeah you give me a reason to feel like I belong here
In this house made of gold

You give me a reason to feel like I belong here
I've been building this house made of gold
Darling have no fear
Yeah I pushed through the rain and the cold
And forgot all the pain that I've known
Yeah you give me a reason to feel like I belong here
In this house made of gold
