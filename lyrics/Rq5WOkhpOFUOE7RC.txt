Hit me like a ton of bricks
Like a crashing wave
Everywhere I turn there's tricks
Up your sleeve again

Can't hide in the den of lions
Can't move with your feet tied
No rest when you sleep in shadows

There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS
There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS, the BIG GUNS

Every little move is fixed
Like a game of chess
The blood on your hands is thick
And you're placing bets

Can't hide in the den of lions
You can't move with your feet tied
No rest when you sleep in shadows

There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS
There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS, the BIG GUNS

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to run

There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS
There's nowhere to run when all is coming undone
You can try, you can try
But you can't hide from the BIG GUNS, the BIG GUNS
