Son, I see it in your eyes
There is a burden you cannot hide
But in their arms you feel so alive
And in a moment you cast aside

All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll stay with you, it's a promise not forgotten

Now I hear you in my mind
There was a story you claim to have
And I will bow gently by your feet
I'll tread softly or tread on my dreams

All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll stay with you, it's a promise not forgotten

You're crying all these tears but they mean to leave you dry
Still fighting all these years 'bout the same old things
We wished we never had

The vision softly fades
But there's a light that still remains
And in these walls, I feel your sadness wain
But in the moment you feel no pain

All lines have broken but we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll sing to you, it's a promise not forgotten

Come on baby, let's ride the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night
Come on baby, let's light the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night

Come on baby, let's ride the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night
Come on baby, let's light the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night

Come on baby, let's ride the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night
Come on baby, let's fight the sunrise
Come on baby, let's light the night

Let's light the night
Let's light the night
