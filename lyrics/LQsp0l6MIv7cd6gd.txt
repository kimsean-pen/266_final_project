I know its been a while
But I will not fake this stupid smile
Cause you robbed me, Fed me the line
Your bounty was me
Took all you could see
And worked just side by side
The trust and love we'd abide
Until you left home thrust with the tides
And put this hate back inside my eyes

Are you blocking all the things
That have to do with me?
Is it easier now?
Do you feel any release?
Tell me how you fit in
And where do you begin?
Do you toast when they toast?
Do you sin when they sin?

Stepped through your place
Lust in my eyes, Toyed with deceit
Planted your lies
Play it off well, Say that I'm fine
Do I hold that small space in your mind?
Stuck in your web, Flailing my arms
Trying to break loose from your charm
Split up your mind, Do you some harm
No stranger to harm

Are you blocking all the things
That have to do with me?
Is it easier now?
Do you feel any release?
Tell me how you fit in
And where do you begin?
Do you toast when they toast?
Do you sin when they sin?

And how can I feel anyone anymore?
And how can I feel anything anymore?
And how can I feel anything anymore?

Are you blocking all the things
That have to do with me?
Is it easier now?
Do you feel any release?
Tell me how you fit in
And where do you begin?
Do you toast when they toast?
Do you sin when they sin?

Stuck in your web, Flailing my arms
Trying to break loose from your charm
Split up your mind, Do you some harm
No stranger to harm
