Picking up the pieces of the world I know
With one in the fire and one in the snow
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
The comeback story of a lifetime

I've been told believing everything is all right
I break with the day and I've been with the night
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
The comeback story of a lifetime

I'll walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

The bright of the lights they're burning me out
Everyone says it's a lovely sound
I don't know where they are leading me
Trying my best hoping that you'll see

I'll walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your

I'll walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

You'll rue the day when you understand
I did my best to be an honest man
Race isn't over until the finish line
It's a comeback story of a lifetime

I'll walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

Now I'm a mile away
