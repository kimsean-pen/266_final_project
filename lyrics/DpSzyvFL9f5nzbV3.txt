Can we walk in hope
Into another new year
Just to cast away the ghosts
Or to have the time to again
You said hold on to dreams
But I know you don't try
Cos you're innocent I know that you won't survive

I heard the phone ring
So late at night that I
I thought someone had died
Someone had died
But your voice was full of hope
Like it was on better days
On clear mornings when the rain had left the sky

I can't stand the thought of you alone
I can't stand the thought of you alone

Don't try to get close to
Us because there's nothing
But our souls laid bare
Will we survive
I know we will
