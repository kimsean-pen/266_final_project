Going out on Friday night
We know we shouldn't dare
Resisting all the urge to fight
Pretending not to care
Minding our own business while we joke amongst ourselves
Dude keeps throwing crusty looks says we all should go to hell

Because tonight is the night of the knuckleheads
They're gonna list out all the reasons you should change
Tonight is the night of the knuckleheads
They're preying on the freaks for dressing strange

Going out on Thursday night
Minding our own affairs
Not talking about what's wrong or right
Everybody seems impaired
Getting yelled at by some older guy
he used to play in a couple of bands
He said that music nowadays is full of
shit why can't we get it through our heads

Because tonight is the night of the knuckleheads
They're gonna list out all the reasons you should change
Tonight is the night of the knuckleheads
They're preying on the freaks for dressing strange
It's the night of the knuckleheads
