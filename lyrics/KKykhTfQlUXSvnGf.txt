I'm not afraid of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find a decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now, you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I will not forsake, the colors that you bring
But the nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see
You are such a fool to worry like you do
I know it's tough and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now, my oh my
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
Now you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
Now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better now
You're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass
