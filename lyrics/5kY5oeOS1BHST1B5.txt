I survived the wasteland
Of taste and tongues but can't deny

A beacon shined in blistered light for a while
Burnin' in an open eye

No room for improvement
You're just some muse I use for joy
The version of you I love is some other
Not this virgin little boy

Little souls flirtin' boys and poured on anyone
It'll never be the same
Thunderin' loud, stand up proud as lightnin' crashed the waves
I don't want to stay, I'm wearin' your remains

I pulled you in my body
The thought is really all I know
Does it alarm you or disarm you?
I should have warned you, I didn't mean to harm you so

I only said I wanted
To bring you near your phoney house
You were a loner and a stone
Who didn't know if you could be my home right now

Little signs, beacon shinin' out on anyone
It'll never be the same
Summer storm, bodies worn with seven of anything
I don't want to wait, I'm wearin' our remains

I'll bet you sad missions
I pressed my tongue against your hair
You invite me, say delight me, and come inside me
There's no room to hide me there

Am I a tortured glutton?
Am I some portion of a whole?
On your horizon, always shinin', the beacon brightest
I take my hands off all controls

Little souls can take no more, I'm torn from everyone
It'll never be the same
Summer haze, all decayin', hand around a blade
I don't want to wait, I'm wearin' love's remains
