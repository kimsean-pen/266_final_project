September seventh and she's heading for school
She'll probably leave me for some college fool
And I know that's just the way it goes

In front of your place under the street light
Face to face here on our last night
You should know one thing before you go

I tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out
I like the way that

She looks at me like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
And she makes me feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done

By the twenty seventh she's been gone for weeks
I'm terrified she won't remember me
And I know that's just the way it goes

I stare at her picture, stuck up on the fridge
Face to face with the one I miss
I'm alone and reaching for the phone

To tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out
I like the way that

She looks at me like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
And she makes me feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done

And I wanna make her feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
And I wanna make her feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done

Back from the city standing in the rain
Asked if she'd be going back again
She said no, this time I'm staying home

She looks at me like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
And she makes me feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done

And I wanna make her feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
And I wanna make her feel like nobody else
Like nobody's ever done
Like nobody I
Like nobody I
Love somebody like
Like nobody else
Like nobody I
Like nobody I
Love somebody like
Like nobody else
