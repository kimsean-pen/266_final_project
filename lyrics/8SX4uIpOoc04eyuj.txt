Frank Zappa: Willie the pimp
I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back
Pair a khacki pants with my shoes shined black
Got a little lady... walk the street
Tellin' all the boys that she can't be beat
Twenny dollah bill (I can set you straight)
Meet me onna corner boy'n don't be late
Man in a suite with bow-tie neck
Wanna buy a grunt with a third party check
Standin' onna porch of the Lido Hotel
Floozies in the lobby love the way I sell: HOT MEAT
HOT RATSHOT ZITSHOT CHEST
HOT RITZHOT ROOTSHOT SOOTS
