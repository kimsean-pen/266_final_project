And this is how...
We're fighting feelings again
We're trying hard to let go
We're dodging punches for friends

And this is where...
We forget we belong
We quietly tell ourselves
We do nothing but run

I just want to feel safe, again
And I just want to stay calm, forever

This wind changed me
(Will you still believe?)
This wind changed me
