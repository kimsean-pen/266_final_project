Watch me light the sky
Watch me light the sky

Hands held high sweat dripping off me
Light it softly, got these fakers trying to stop me
This ain't a hobby it's a way of life
Just like Holyfield and Tyson, gloves on fight night
Boom here comes the hurricane monsoon
Switched up, came to redecorate the room
My ears are ringing from hearing the same sound
So what now all of the walls just came down
I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Watch me light the sky

Game time ripping mint condition
Lights out stomping all competition
My upmost to it's highest it gets no flyer
Uh oh we set the mainframe on fire
Boom cold lead from the peddle I push to the metal
The dust never settles
F5 level kick up the bass in the tremble
Because faith that's rebel, I could show you the devil
I blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
Sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might
Someday I'll die but not tonight
Excuse me while I light up the sky

Watch me light the sky

Nowhere else have I seen such lions led by lambs
So if you're not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
We got a battle upfront but beyond that's the promise land
And when we all shout together then believe me they'll understand
