Railway tracks
Mountain tops
Frozen fields
A church a dog
Icicles
On a fence
That reminds me
Of my heart

And you're in my head
Only in my head

Roadhouse
Parking lots
Factories
Stones and rocks
Metal sky

Crispy air
I'm halfway gone
I'm halfway there

Villages
I white disguise
Lakes as green
As your eyes
Railway traces
Mountain tops
I'm breaking through
These tunnel walls

And you're in my head
Only in my head
I'm waving goodbye
Only in my mind
