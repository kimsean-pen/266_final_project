Back when you were so cruel
And I was a fool
Like a grave growing daisies
You were so sweet and crazy
Back when I was so ugly
That you couldnt love me
And the loneliness nearly killed you
How can I live with myself
When I need you more?
I need your body
More than I need my own
I need to live with you
More than I need a home
And if its over, its true
That I always loved you
So its breaking my heart
When I miss the old you
Its breaking my heart
Cause I miss it, too
Its breaking my heart
When I miss the old you
I saw you grinding your teeth
And I felt it, too
In the dreams that Im flying
Theres a reason I do
How can I be a man
Now that youre alone there?
What a painful routine we live in
How do you care for yourself
When I need you more?
I need your love
More than I need myself
I need your tenderness
More than I need to rest
And if its over its true
That I always love you
