And ride with us, young bonny lass
With the angels of the night
Crack wind clatter, flesh rein bite
On an out-size unicorn
Rough-shod winging sky blue flight
On a cold wind to Valhalla
And join with us, please
Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
Breakfast with the gods night angels serve
With ice-bound majesty
Frozen flaking fish raw nerve
In a cup of silver liquid fire
Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve
And light the old Valhalla
Come join with us, please
Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
The heroes rest upon the sighs of Thor's trusty
Hand maidens
Midnight lonely whisper cries
We're getting a bit short on heroes lately
Sword snap fright white pale goodbyes
In thedesolation of Valhalla
And join with us, please
Valkyrie maidens ride
Empty-handed on the cold wind to Valhalla
