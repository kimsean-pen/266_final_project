Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side 'cause baby
It's always better with you

In the middle of the pouring rain
On a crowded subway train
When I'm just about to go insane
You make it go away

Monday morning in a traffic jam
And I'm going to be late again
The world is getting underneath my skin
I see you smiling then
I know that it's going to be okay

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
'Cause baby it's always better with you

Girl when I'm alone
You're where I belong
'Cause baby it's always better with you
Ooh ooh
Baby it's always better with you

You make a bad day better than good
You make me feel better than I should
You understand when I'm misunderstood
Like no one else ever could

Girl you show me things I never see
If you were never there to see them with me
And when I get a little too crazy
You are my sanity
And everything will be okay

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
'Cause baby it's always better with you

Girl when I'm alone
You're where I belong
'Cause baby it's always better with you
Ooh ooh
Baby its always better with you

Girl it doesn't matter where we go
'Cause you always make it feel like it's home
When I'm with you
Ooh ooh ooh

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
'Cause baby it's always better with you

Girl when I'm alone
You're where I belong
'Cause baby it's always better with you

Wherever I go
Whatever I do
Stay by my side
Baby it's always better with you (Wherever I go)

Whatever I do
You're where I belong
Baby it's always better
It's always better with you
