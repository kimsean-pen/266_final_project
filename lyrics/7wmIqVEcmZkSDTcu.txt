leanin in a dark room:
a look alike james wright
(when all my life I've been rejecting
what will I say yes to?)
what did I say yes to?
i'd been cutting glass carefully
& all my time was spent alone;
i didn't expect you

what did I say yes to?
what did I say?
been talkin 'bout you so much
i'm talkin you away
(what did I say yes to?
what did I say?
i've been talkin about you so much
i'm talking you away)

cookin up some mushroom in my kitchen
tryna tell you about my month
you're only half-listening

i know i never listen
how can i? Your eyes bloom:
slanted yellow in the blinds
bleeding into a dark room//

so how could i say yes to you?
what should i say?
i've been talking 'bout you so much
yea, what did I say yes to?
what did I say?

i've been thinkin 'bout you so much
i think I'm thinkin you away

i'm opening it up now:
What a plunge! What a lark!
i'm picking all the seeds out
i'm peeling off the bark
i'm picking all the seeds out!
i'm breaking it apart
i'm opening it up now
i'm peeling off the bark
