Just a step onto the street
An uncomfortable heat
Rattlers at your feet
In running town

Helter-skelter all a-swelter
The impetus is seething
In running town

A thousand curses
Full speed ahead

Lockjaw aggression
And buzzing irritations
Deride the friendly Martian
In running town

Helter-skelter all a-swelter
The impetus is seething in running town
A thousand curses
Full speed ahead

If you gaze into her face
She'll glare back and drown
All refugees in the sea
In running town

A thousand curses
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

Laughter rebounds
And strangles that sound
In running town
In running tow
