"I'll try" she said as he walked away
"Try not to lose you"
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception, unmasked fear
"I'll be here waiting" tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood, you'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me"

Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises, tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here, tasting salvation's near

Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood, you'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me"
