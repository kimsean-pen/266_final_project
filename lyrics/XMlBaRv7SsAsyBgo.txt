Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's something else

Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive

When they tell you that you've got to stay the same
Even though you're not yourself
And you've got somebody else
When they tell you that you've got yourself to blame
Even though it's not your fault
That your heart just wants to know love

Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Now it's something else

Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive

So won't you? Will you be my cherry?
So come on, talk to me, talk to me
Will you, will you be mine?
I see you watching me, will you be mine baby?
Wanna be your cherry?
So come on, talk to me, talk to me
Will you, will you be mine?

Won't you be my cherry now?
Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
Oh, they make me feel alive

Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
(Oh, they make me feel alive)

So won't you be my cherry?
Will you, will you be mine?
Wanna be your cherry
Will you, will you be mine?
