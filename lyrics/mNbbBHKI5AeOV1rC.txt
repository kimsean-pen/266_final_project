I like tight jeans, dark shades
When I walk the ground shakes
Like an 808
You appreciate my lean
Body nice shape
Wanna take me on a date
You've got what it takes
You better have some cake

I like, how I'm catching your eye
I-I-I-I like, how I don't even try
I-I-I-I like you, I like you, boy
I like you, boy.

You might mistake me for heart breaker
'Cause there's blood on the floor
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me
Never seen before
Might mistake me for a heart breaker
'Cause there's blood on the floor
I know you're checking me
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door

I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good girl
But I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good, good girl
I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good girl
But I've been bad before
Good girl

I know I can be a good, good girl

I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good girl
But I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before
I chew bubble gum and talk fast
Switch up to high class
On my day to day

On these 28's
My hydraulics bump hard
But I can't kiss a car
If you walk away

This could be your day
I like, how I'm catching your eye
I-I-I-I like, how I don't even even try
I-I-I-I like you, I like you, boy
I like you, boy.

Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before, yeah
