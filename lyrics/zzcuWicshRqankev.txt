Bodies fill the fields I see
Hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
No one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields

Bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care

Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die

Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine gun fire

Does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
Get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear
Glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Soldier boy, made of clay

Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die

Back to the front

You coward
You servant
You blind man
Why, am I dying?

Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
(Solo)
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying

Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth
Nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
Molded day by day
Looking back I realize

Nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here, greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Back to the front

Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
