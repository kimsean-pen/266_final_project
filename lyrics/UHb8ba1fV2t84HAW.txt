My old friend, where have you gone?
We've taken different paths
I've chosen love, you've chosen gold
My old friend, where's your heart?
It's hidden somewhere cold
Deep inside your lost soul
Don't pretend you still feel whole
Tell me now, please don't lie
Will you be there for me?
As I would for you when times are hard
I'm no bard, but listen to these words
Filled with heed, inked with need
Sun of mine, light his oak tree path
