If I came on to you
Tell me would you stop me
If I gave it all to you
Don't think you would stop me, no

I think you shouldn't look at me when you came in with someone else
I think I shouldn't look at you the way I do but you're no help

I can't make my eyes behave
Tryna make them leave but they stay
I know I should look away
I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave

Girl, you make my mind insane
Heard your middle name is pain
I know I should look away
But I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave

If you came close to me
There's no way I could stop you (yeah)
The point of no return
So we should stop before we start to move a little closer

I think you shouldn't look at me when you came in with someone else
(When you came in with someone else)
I think I shouldn't look at you the way I do but you're no help

I can't make my eyes behave
Tryna make them leave but they stay
I know I should look away
I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave

Girl, you make my mind insane
Heard your middle name is pain
I know I should look away
But I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave

Girl, you're such a tease
And I know you're bad for me
No I shouldn't let you in
No I shouldn't let you win
All your strategies, yeah they're working well on me
No I shouldn't let you win

I can't make my eyes behave
Tryna make them leave but they stay (no baby, no, no, no, no)
I know I should look away (I know I should look away)
I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave

Girl, you make my mind insane (you make my eyes insane)
Heard your middle name is pain (oh baby, when you follow my brain)
I know I should look away
But I can't make my eyes behave
I can't make my eyes behave
