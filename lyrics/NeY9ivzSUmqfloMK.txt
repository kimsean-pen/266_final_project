Now there just passed on another day
Where I really wanted to get away
From the problems that I built up
Can only see one way to make it stop
Unable - I'm too bound
I wanna get away from what I found
Each day another rock upon my head
Each night I lie awake in bed

What shade
Of joy
Will hit
Me first
I hope
It lasts
A burst
In bliss

Pressure
Pressure
Oh god no
Pressure

Adorned in carnal ecstasy
A hazy focus blurs and sharpens sight
Now my senses are leading me
A mere blow of wind could turn me into light
Hands everywhere, covering me
Feels so overwhelming I can't breathe
But bliss is momentary anyhow
Yet worth living for - take me now

What shade
Of joy
Will hit
Me first
I hope
It lasts
A burst
In bliss

Pressure...
Pressure...

Pressure
Pressure
Oh god no
Pressure

Can't take this pressure
