Wakin' up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Lookin' for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothin' else, no
Majorin' in undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writin'
Never dreamed anyone else would like 'em
Now they're sittin' on a Walmart shelf

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nuttin' the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughin'
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I bought a ring and she said "I do"
But everybody else said, "man, you're twenty-two
"Whatcha tryin' to prove?"
"Hey why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waitin' on her since the second grade yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holdin' her hand
And now everybody wanna die happy now

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothin' the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughin'
Life changes (yes it does) and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I remember the day I told my daddy and mama
You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adoptin'
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen
Well I was wrappin' my head around bein' a dad
A bigger wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showin' and got one on the way
Yeah that's two into two, hey, what can I say?

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothin' the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughin'
Life changes and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
(The world, the world)
