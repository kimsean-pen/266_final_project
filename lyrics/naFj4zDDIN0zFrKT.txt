You were so sad, you were so blue
No need to tell
'Cause I know all of the story
Baby, my love is all so true
The morning comes
There is no need to worry
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
I'm with you all the time
'Cause you know that
When you feel so lonely in your heart

Chorus:
I'll be by your side, tonight
I'll be by your side, oh-oh-oh
When the world is falling all apart
I'll be by your side, tonight
I'll be by your side, oh-oh-oh

The darkness will end
The dawn will shine
You are my love
I'm by your side tonight
Baby, you know we will be fine
Just don't let go
You have to hold on tight
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
I'm with you all the time
'Cause you know that
When you feel so lonely in your heart

I'll be by your side, tonight
I'll be by your side, oh-oh-oh
When the world is falling all apart
I'll be by your side, tonight
I'll be by your side, oh-oh-oh
