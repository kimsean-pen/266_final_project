People say that we're born with a purpose
And that we're meant to make our dreams come true
But if our dreams start to crumble, they can bury us
Gotta take yourself out and push on through

They say that nobody changes
But I'm living proof that they do
Because I found the answer
And you can find the answer, too
They made me think I was crazy
And that the fate wants you to stay
Now that I've found the answer
I'm never ever gonna lose my way
Ever again
Ever again

I'll admit there were times I was terrified
I honestly thought I wouldn't survive
But I learned a lot from my trip to the dark side
And from here on out I'll keep my light alive

They say that nobody changes
But I'm living proof that they do
Because I found the answer
And you can find the answer, too
They made me think I was crazy
And that the fate wants you to stay
Now that I've found the answer
I'm never ever gonna lose my way
Ever again
Ever again
Ever again
Ever again

Ever again
Ever again
Ever again
Ever again
