Try to understand what I'm going through
Don't blame me for what folks will do
For some of us it's not a good time
But you're going to get used to and you'd better resign yourself

You get what you deserve
You ought to find out what it is worth
And you've gotta have a lotta nerve

You just do what pleases you
And go on and sign out every move
You're going to get place in the scene
All God's orphans get face in the dream

Now, you get what you deserve
You ought to find out what it is worth
And you've gotta have a lotta nerve, oh

Too bad such a drag, oh
So much pain down the drain
A lot of us ain't got many friends

Try to understand what I'm going through
But don't blame me for what folks will do
For some of us it's not a good time
But you're going to get used to and you'd better resign yourself

You get what you deserve
You ought to find out what it is worth
And you've gotta have a lotta nerve
You get what you deserve
