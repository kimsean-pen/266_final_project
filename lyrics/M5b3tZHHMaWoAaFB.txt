So he found the heart in barren land
it was beating, still alive
he held it gently in his hand
and looked up to he sky
with evil thoughts of vicious kind
and sinister disdain
his thoughts of bringing back to life
the witch that died in flames
serpent's kin
born of sin
dark within
father of the wolf!

He then devoured gullveig's heart
and she was born again
they brought to life an evil force
a beast that can't bne tamed
with dark deception in his soul
betrayal of the gods
the bane of oden now is born
born of evil blood
serpent's kin
born of sin
dark within
father of the wolf!

They brought to life a malicious force
a vile beast that cannot be tamed
fimbultyr's nemesis now is born
a vile beast that can't be restrained
dark!
deception in his
soul!
betrayal of the
gods!
oden's bane is
born!
born of evil blood!
serpent's kin
born of sin
dark within
father of the wolf!
