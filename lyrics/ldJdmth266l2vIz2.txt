We've always been kept in the dark
A vision of our sanctuary overshadowed by deceit from the start
The lie within belief
All our thoughts and uncertainties
Are mirrored by our grieving plea
The breathless wind, the verse of debauchery
Scorched by the tyrants of industry
She cries "What is it you want from me?"

So I will beg the feeble question
Our divided species asks
If we're gunning for this
But we know that it's diminishing fast
Can we at least enjoy it while it lasts?

The tidal waves of fear are bearing down on me
Our confusion connects us, our deception unites us
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know?
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know

Never say, nihilist of modern day
Never say, nihilist of modern day

Let's feel
Let's feel this together

We are the species, of course we fight
Fighting started life
It's time to rectify
Stop living in your fantasy lives
Don't let your body be a graveyard for your mind

Turn it up, turn it up

This is a broadcast brought to you by the rank and file
Not the back of the room
Exploit our minds and keep us idolizing ignorance

There's a spark in the fuse
There's a fire inside that'll guide us through
The remains of a nation divided
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know?
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know

Never safe
In a black market democracy
Never safe
To no avail we turn the other way
To no avail we turn the other way

Let's feel
Let's feel this together

Let's feel this together

All of my struggles
Like steel trying to become wood
But seeing it in others is a forest fire
All of my struggles
We're still trying to become one
When will we learn that all we have is enough?
Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know?
We blinded by our needs
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
