I wanna know
What you really think of me
I wanna feel all the
Pain that sets you free

These waves of doubt
Are drowning me
Gone are the days
When this was easy

Buried in the past
So many moments, I want back
Tomorrow doesn't
Hold onto yesterday

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it, don't hide it

Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it

I wanna know
After all these lessons learned
If there's a road from these
Bridges the we burned

I need to know
If you still want me
Want me to show
How much I need you

Buried in the past
So many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't
Hold onto yesterday

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it, don't hide it

Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it

Gone are all of the days
When this was easy
Tomorrow can't
Hold onto yesterday

If you come right back to me
I won't fight it, I won't fight it
Show me what you need from me
Don't hide it, don't hide it

If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it, don't hide it

Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it
