Well, I didn't tell anyone
But a bird flew by, saw what I done
He set up a nest outside
And he sang about what I'd become

He sang so loud
Sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbors would hear
So I invited him in just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again

But he sang louder and louder inside the house
And now I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make him stop

I picked up the bird, and above the den
I said, "That's the last song you'll ever sing"
Held him down
Broke his neck
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget

But then my dreams
Began to creep
That old familiar
Tweet, tweet, tweet

I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout

I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
The song was coming from my mouth

From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth

From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth

From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth

From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
