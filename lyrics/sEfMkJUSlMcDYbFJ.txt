Now I'm screaming how you'd get here
Runnin around all through my mind
I wish your body would reappear
I won't let you run out this time

Because the two of us Were meant to love
Love
Each other
And I know the two of us were meant to touch
Touch
Each other

He didn't even tell me his name

Ya pictures tattooed in my brain
I wish that he was up in my room
So I'm off to Paris, can't miss my train

Because the two of us Were meant to love
Love
Each other
And I know the two of us were meant to touch
Touch
Each other

And someday love is gonna bring us closer baby
Thats why I'm never givin it up
And I give you all of me, down to the heart of me
There's no escapin our love

Because the two of us Were meant to love
Love
Each other
And I know the two of us were meant to touch
Touch
Each other
