The birth of a realisation
The rise of a high expectation
Together successful, defiant
Together the parts make a Giant

See the world in the palm of his hand
Striding steps that will cover the land
He is coming, hear him coming
Are you ready for his being?

See the giant
Feel the giant
Touch the giant
Hear the giant

Together successful, defiant
Together the parts make a giant

The birth of a realisation
The rise of a high expectation
