Nobody knows, all the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows, all my sorrow
Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah

Nobody knows, all the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows, all my sorrow
Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah

I've been used and I've been scorned
I've been talked about, yes I have
Just as sure as you're born
This is a mean world to try to live in
But you've got to stay ahead until you die
Without a mother, don't even have a father
I'm looking for my sister, I can't even find my brother
I wish I had somebody...

Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
Glory, Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
