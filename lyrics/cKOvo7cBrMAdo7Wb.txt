Fire (Uh) Fire (Its all about) Fire (Woo, woo, woo)
Fire

The way you walk and talk really sets me off
To a fuller love, child, yes, it does, uh
The way you squeeze and tease, knocks to me my knees
Cause Im smokin' baby, baby

The way you swerve and curve, really wrecks my nerves
And Im so excited, child, woo, woo
The way you push, push lets me know that you're good
Oh, yeah

Fire (What I said, child, ow)
Fire (Uh-huh)
Got me burnin' burnin' burnin'
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh
Burnin', burnin' baby
Oh, baby
When you shake what you got, and girl, you've got a lot
You're really somethin' child, yes, you are
When you're hot you're hot, you really shoot your shot
You're dyn-o-mite, child, yeah
Well, I can tell by your game, you're gonna start a flame
Love, baby, baby
I'm not gon' choke from the smoke, got me tightenin' up my stroke
Do you feel it, girl, yeah
