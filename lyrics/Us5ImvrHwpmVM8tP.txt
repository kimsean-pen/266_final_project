Thinking of you I lie awake
Longing to suffocate
Spilling my tears as you turn away

Light cast onto a memory
Darkens the scenery
I can't know you the way you know me

Visions of you through clouds of smoke
Inhale until I choke
Filling my lungs but now I'm alone

Cold as an emptiness consumes
Rain dripping in my wounds
You don't want me the way I want you
