You don't have to have money
To make it in this world
You don't have to be skinny baby
if you want to be my girl

Oh you just gotta be happy
But sometimes that's hard
Just remember to smile, smile, smile
And that's a good enough start!

So if you ain't good looking
Don't you let it get you down
And if your love life ain't cooking baby
there'll be more fish around

Oh you just gotta stay happy
So put away that frown
And just remember to smile, smile, smile
And turn the world around

Just remember to smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
C'mon and show us your teeth and what you got underneath

Coz everyone's got troubles
That's the way the story goes
You don't need to use Hubble, baby
To see what's underneath your nose

Oh coz if your feeling happy
that's the place to let is show
so just remember to smile, smile, smile
so everybody knows

And it will make things so much better when your feeling low

Just remember to smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
C'mon on and show us your teeth and what you got underneath

Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
C'mon on and show us your teeth and what you got underneath

Just remember to smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile
C'mon on and show us your teeth and what you got underneath

Smile, smile, smile (you better smile)
Smile smile smile (just remember to smile)
Smile smile smile
and turn the world around

yeah
