Volume up, lights down, the time is running out
The wax melts on memories wrecked by doubts
I don't have to think now, it's the moment to pretend
The answers are so clear, It's not the end

In the nite
I'm sinking

The shades covers people, forgetting who they are
Blessing by the neon lights in a sky with no stars
Everyone's dancing in circle at the moonbeams
It's a new call, a new rite or just a strategy to leave

In the nite
I'm sinking
