From nothing to something
A respectable tale
(Giving blood for dice)
Everybody's got a price
Liquidating my decisions
(Holding it in, waiting on a vision)
Investing in an ending that might come true
(Or not at all)
Keep up my head for the water will rise
Hoping for calm if it ever resides

Try to find heaven in hell
Find a Haven right here
The dogmatist will keep barking until the stars disappear
Find heaven in hell
Find a Haven right here find out for ourselves
Heaven on earth can be real
And it can be right here

Keep my head up because the water will rise
Subterraneans prevail from out of thin air
A hope fueled dream though nothing in this life's guaranteed
Mouths to feed
Endless people to please
Still walking around on my knees

Try to find heaven in hell
Pull ourselves off the clouds
Resting in our own hands
Shake it out onto the world all around
Find Heaven and Hell
Find our haven right here
Find out for ourselves
Heaven on Earth can be real

Give me a chance and I'll take it
I'll eat up every crumb
On my knees and my hands gaining momentum
Till I can finally run
Run free run down this living dream
Tear it at its seems and wrap it all around me

Try to find Heaven and Hell
Some relief from all this chaos
Unpack our dusty dreams we were saving for later
Heaven and Hell, find a haven right here
Find out for ourselves
Heaven on Earth can be real
And it can be right here
