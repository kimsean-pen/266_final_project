I can see the sun coming up
and I need it (oooh yeah)
I feel like I've been down for a while
They said the grass was always greener
but you know I haven't seen a...
I feel like I've been dying for a smile

And I'm not going to stop
coz time waits for no one
I got only? what I got
while I'm alive

I can feel the world spinning 'round
do you feel it? (oh yeah)
before every day comes a night
but if you're blinded by the light
you can't see anything in sight
sit tight sit tight it'll be alright

And I'm not going to stop
coz time waits for no one
I got only? what I got
while I'm alive

Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine
Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine

I said I've been looking for you
but I haven't found ya
I said I've been looking for you
but I haven't found ya
I said I've been looking for you
but I haven't found ya
I said I've been looking for you
but I haven't found ya

Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine
Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine
Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine
Happiness you belong to me,
Happiness you're mine
