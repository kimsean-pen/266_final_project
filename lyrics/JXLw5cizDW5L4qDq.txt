I spend the night, yeah, l
Looking for my insides in a hotel room, waitin' for you
We're gonna make it tonight, yeah
Something in the air tells me the time is right
So we better get on
DJ, play a song for the lovers, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

Don't wanna wait, Lord, I've been waitin' all my life
But I'm too late again, I know but I was scared
Can't you see, oh?
I'm moving like a train into some foreign land
I ain't got a ticket for this ride but I will
Oh, to a song for my lover, tonight
DJ, play a song for my lover, tonight
DJ, play a song for my lover, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

Can't stop looking back, oh no
(DJ, play a song for my lover, tonight)

One more for the lovers
(Please, play a song for my lovers, tonight)
One more for the lovers
Can't stop looking back, oh, no

Oh, brother, won't you lend a hand?
I'm alone in a room and I'm waiting for love
I don't know when this dreams gonna stop
But I tell you, friend, I don't wanna get up

Oh, brother, won't you lend a hand?
I'm alone in a room and I'm waiting for love
I don't know when this dreams gonna stop
But I tell you, friend, I don't wanna get up
I need you here, I need you here
(In the midnight hour)
(In the midnight hour)
Take me up, take me up
