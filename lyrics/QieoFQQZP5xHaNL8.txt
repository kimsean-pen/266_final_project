Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others, I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ooo, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day to see if I'm faking it all

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right, take it in right

There's been many others so many times
Sixty new cities and what do I, what do I find?
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall, can you hear me call?

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right, take it in right

Well, can you hear me?
Yeah
Can you feel me inside
I do
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love
Show me your love

Take it in right, take it in right
Take it in right into your love love
Babe, take it in right into love life
Take it in right, take it in right, right to love life
Take it in right

Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it
Right to your heart?

Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it
Right to your heart?

Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it
Right to your heart?

Why don't you take it?
Why don't you take it?
Right to your heart?
