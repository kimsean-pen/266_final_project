Atop the skyscraper
One hundred and two floors
New York City
It was yours
It's yours

You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there.

Below the busy streets
We watched your dreams unfold
New York City
It all yours
It's yours

You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there

You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights
You live there, under the lights

You live there, under the lights

(Hi, Jeremy, I just wanted to tell you that
Uhm, and we're gonna drop off a prescription
so I probably won't be home when you get there. Okay? Bye bye)
