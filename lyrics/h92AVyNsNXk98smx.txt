DIVE THE DEEPEST ABYSS

Broken faces behind the idol
Self sacrificed believers once (betrayed)
Those who disregarded (authorities)
In deadly position they affend

The junless domain
For ages and ages
Where his sleeping majesty
Under the black sand

Skeletoned shapes look lifeless
Thrones dissapeared in dusty (old centuries)
Where glory hide the myth
Nothing to see those who died
The junless domain
For ages and ages
Where his sleeping majesty
Under the black sand

Invaders who follow the legends
Spread mouth to mouth
Approach the phenomically
Quite graveyard

Well hidden lonny sentinels
Around his sandy dwelling
Out of date carnivorous survivorous
They offend his sleeping majesty

The events can be said by human words
So strength so hate to those who dare
They break the frontiers and they come
Now dust of melting bones mixed with the Sandy land

Broken faces behind the idol
Self sacrificed believers once (betrayed)
Those who disregarded (authorities)
In deadly position they affend
