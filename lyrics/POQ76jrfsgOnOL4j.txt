I see you in my dreams
Seems like you never leave
You are the blur in my eyes
As I wake up through the night
Ten thousand hands can't hold
This heavy heart of stone
I feel it break like glass
Still I keep coming back
So pick me up
Then throw me down
Shine the light
Then turn it out
You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
I'll follow werever you go
Right down that rabbit hole
Then everything gets dark
And I feel pulled apart
Running through my blood
You are the rarest drug
With every word I breathe
I see the way you've changed me
Around then throw me down
Shine a light then turn it out
You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on
Paint the road to see the way
Should I go or should I stay
I'll come around again
I'll come around again
We never learn to let it go
Always fell it as you grow
It comes around again
It comes around again
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
You into the night
Lets get lost until its light
You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, Lead on
