Ah, peace like a river ran through the city
Long past the midnight curfew we sat starry-eyed
Ahoh, ahoh, we were satisfied
Ah, and I remember misinformation followed us
Like a plague
Nobody knew from time to time if the plans would change
Ahoh, ahoh, ahoh
If the plans would change
You can beat us with wires
You can beat us with chains
You can run out your rules
But you know you can't outrun the history train
I've seen a glorious day
Ahee-ee-ee-ee-eeee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee

Ah, four in the morning I woke up from out of my dreams
Nowhere to go but back to sleep but I'm reconciled
Ahoh, ahoh, ahoh
I'm gonna be up for a while
Ahoh, ahoh, ahoh
I'm gonna be up for a while
Ahah, ahah, ahaah
I'm gonna be up for a while
