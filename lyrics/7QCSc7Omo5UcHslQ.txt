The seed's in my head
Visions in red
All that I dream
And all that I've bled
My mind is a gun
I won't be outdone
Say what you want
While I shoot for the sun

All you doubters and haters
Actors and fakers
I don't have time for you all
You're feeding the fire
That's taking me higher
Coming like a cannonball

Oh
It's kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
Oh
So what're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
Scream, scream, scream
Til they hear you
Scream

Step out of the haze
Sleepwalkers awake
The pills that they give
You don't have to take
Don't wanna see life
Through cadaver eyes
Yesterday's dead
Tomorrow's alive

All you movers and shakers
Freaks and hell raisers
We're climbing over your walls
You're feeding the fire
That's taking us higher
Coming like a cannonball

Oh
It's kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
Oh
So what're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
Scream, scream, scream
Til they hear you
Scream, scream, scream
Til they hear you
Scream

Oh
It's kicking down your door
Kicking down your door
Oh
So what're you waiting for?
What're you waiting for?
Scream, scream, scream
Til they hear you
Scream, scream, scream
Til they hear you
Scream

(Tired of waiting)
