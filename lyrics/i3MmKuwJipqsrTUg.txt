Give a bit of hm to me,

And your eyes like a laser,
every time cut me deeper.

and I'll give a bit of hm to you. (it's so confusing)
Give a bit of hm to me,(you're a mystery)
and I'll give a bit of hm to you. (or am I dreaming)

Are you devil or angel?
Are you question or answer?

For you, I break all the rules
And for you, I'll go to the moon,
'Cos you're the one
There's no one else.

For me, you are an enigma,
For me, you really are a mystery...
A mystery (a mystery)

I just can't make you out
Are you real or am I dreamin'?
This is all very confusin'
Specially when you start singin'
