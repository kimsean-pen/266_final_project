Hey sis, listen
This is our night
Hey miss, misfit
This is alright

We should never doubt our hearts
They can do without us
'Cause now it's all about us
(Hey sis, it's Christmas)
Here we are united
Just to feel excited
(This is our night)
Even you can't fight it
(Hey sis, it's Christmas)

'Twas the night before Christmas
And all through the house
The children were voguing and turning it out
As mama Ru stood at the top of the stairs
Watchin' with pride as her children got theirs
Poppin', and dippin', and spinnin' below
Miss RuPaul decreed, before striking a pose
"What you can conceive so shall you receive
The glamour, the coinage, the trade and the weaves
This night will live forever and a day
As long as we remember that Christmas is gay"

You don't have to be alone on Christmas
We are family and that's what this is
Hey sis, it's Christmas
You don't have to be alone on Christmas
We are family and that's what this is
Hey sis, it's Christmas

(Hey sis, listen
This is our night)
That's what this is
(Hey sis, it's Christmas)
That's what this is
(Hey miss, misfit
This is alright)
And that's what this is
(Hey sis, it's Christmas)
