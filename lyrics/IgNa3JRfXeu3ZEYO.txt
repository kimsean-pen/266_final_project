Time is able to discern when long-term love has had its turn
Only then, we'll drop the curtain, let the credits start to roll
Her aura so imposing, hand me in your bed and clothing
Luke-warm caffeine in the morning
Can your brother take me home?
When we were pulling strings to keep her alone
Those were the days I didn't let it down
Though love will run deep like hurt runs out

Time held us in her arms, she loved us hard
Time held us in her arms, she loved us hard and for the longest
Held us in her arms, she loved us hard
Time held us in her arms, she loved us hard and for the longest

Raised us, shaped us, moulded and made us
Into who we are today and who we plan to stay

Time held us in December, made your name one to remember
Now though only here to cool the embers
She never will cease to console us
So as you look back to where we began
Loosening your grip a little on her hand
Keeping in mind, we owe her more
Than we could ever make apparent

(Time) Barely on our hands, still loved us hard
Time barely on our hands
Still loved us hard, her care was constant
Held us in her arms, she loved us hard
Time held us in her arms
She loved us hard and for the longest
And was nobody's but ours

Make part of me live on in you
Let your heart bleed and be an open mood
We know time will tend to
And as part of you lives on in me
I'm holding, broken to the same degree
Knowing time will mend me

Raised us, shaped us, moulded and made us
Into who we are today and who we plan to stay

Time held us in her arms, she loved us hard
Know as she turns to depart
She loved us hard and for the longest
Held us in her arms, she loved us hard
So know as she turns to depart
She loved us hard and for the longest
And was nobody's but ours
