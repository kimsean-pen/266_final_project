Throw it to your world
Son of a knife!
Some should have lasted me yesterday
With the first try!
Throw it to your world
And say 'die'!
I am the monster reaching out
For your blood
Away! Remember my words...

As you make your way...
You must lie...
Talk to seek mankind-talk to die!
I think, tomorrow, for you
Just don't make it, as I am the monster... you created!

You had us trust our tribes
Now you're alive!
No man has, past our time
Recede, or anticipated, our funeral feast for the deceased
We blackmail thee, while your faces show lack of the shade
Either caught, or withered away
Today's the day!
Away! Remember my words...

As you make your way...
You must lie...
Talk to seek mankind-talk to die!
I think, tomorrow, for you
Just don't make it, as I am the monster... you created!

Let me free this world from parasites
Now, as I am the only one alive
I thank your God, only once, for he created... SUICIDE!

Well, I am to take the next step
Well, I am forever restored
Well, I am to end the nation
Well, I am the red slave for you!
