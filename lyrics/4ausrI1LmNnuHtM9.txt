Can't be my friend
Can't be my friend

It's fun to pretend
that we're not in love
so we can fall in to love again

Can't be my friend
Can't be my friend

It's fun to pretend
that we're not in love
so we can fall in to love again

Float and star deceit to fight
Don't know how sleaze can die
There's a madness in your plan
