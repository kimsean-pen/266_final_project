I was stopped in London when
I felt it coming down
Crushing all around me with a
Great triumphant sound
Like the dam was breaking and
My mind came rushing in
I was stopped in London
Oh, I was awakening
I was

I was o'er in Paris when
I almost ran away
Two times round the block
Before I decided to stay
Puffed along a cigarette that
Went and made me sick
Spent another day pretending
I was over it

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh

And all along the highway
There's a tiny whispering sound
Saying I could find you
In the dark of any town
But all that I am hearing in
The poem of my mind
Are silent twisted words finding
Their way in every line

Oh, this time
Oh, this time

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
Oh, I lost you in the morning, don't live anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm

(Back in my body)
(Back in my body)
(Back in my body)

Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
Oh, I lost you in the morning, don't live anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
Back in my body, oh, oh
