All of the bodies arounde
I hear the voices inside
The battle's over
This war has been won
Visions haunt me in my dreams
Visions of what I've done
So much blood shed
Now am I worthy to come home?

My God, forgive me
For all of the bodies
I've taken in battle
Oh God, don't forsake me

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home

I've been knee deep in water
It's time to be set free
So devastated
The damage has been done
So violated
Like I've been raped and left for dead
I'm lyin' naked
I'm lyin' naked on the floor

My God, forgive me
For all of the bodies
I've taken in battle
All's fair in love and war

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home
Home

This is the last time
I raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
And let's just disappear
This is the last time
I raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
And let's just disappear
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm comin' home
Now I'm comin' home
Yeah, I'm comin' home
Yeah yeah I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
Home
This is the last time
I raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
And let's just disappear
Let's just disappear
