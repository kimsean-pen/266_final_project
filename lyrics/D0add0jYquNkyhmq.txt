I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that girl that I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

There's nothing where she used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm Torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusions never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is Torn
You're a little late, I'm already Torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

It crawled beneath my veins and now
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm Torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusions never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is Torn
You're a little late, I'm already Torn

There's nothing where she used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm Torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusions never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is Torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already Torn
