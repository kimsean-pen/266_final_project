Hickory, oak, pine and weed
Bury my heart underneath these trees
And when a southern wind comes to raise my soul
Spread my spirit like a flock of crows

Cause I loved ya for too long
I loved ya for too long
I loved ya for too long

Old heat of a raging fire
Come and light my eyes
Summer's kiss thru electric wire
But I'll never die

Sycamore, ash, moss and loam
Wrap your roots all around my bones
And when they come for me
When they call my name
Cast my shadow from a bellow's flame

Cause I loved ya for too long
I loved ya for too long
I loved ya for too long

(So let the storm come)

Old heat of a raging fire
Come and light my eyes
Summer's kiss to electric wire
But I'll never die...

I will never die
You can bury my body but I'll never die

In the dead of the night
(In the dead of the night)
I'm gonna loose this chain
(I'm gonna loose this chain)
I'm gonna run and run and run and run and run
(Sing on sister)
I'm gonna run and run and run and run
Coming for you again
(Oh I'm coming for you again)

Oh
So let the storm come

Old heat of a raging fire
Come and light my eyes
Summer's kiss to electric wire
But I'll never die...

I will never die

You can bury my body but I'll never die

Hickory, oak, pine and weed
Bury my heart underneath these trees
