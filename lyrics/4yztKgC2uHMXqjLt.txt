I see your future now
Stretching on through the years
Devotion is not a word I fear
What falls between your hand and mine
Forsaking
For breaking a sculpture that we made in time

Don't you wonder how it could be?
Too soon to tell
Too soon to tell

If hate is what you claim, how can it be undone?
If only we could better pain that strains to make us one

Don't you wonder how it could be?
Too soon to tell
Too soon to tell
Don't you wonder how it could be?
Too soon to tell
Too soon to see

I see you around
Not as a friend
