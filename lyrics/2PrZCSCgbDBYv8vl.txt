We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'm lettin' you fly
'Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die

No you'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Oh darlin' cause you'll always be my baby

Do do doop

I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no

You'll always be apart of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder oh
(I know that)
You'll be right back, baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time

You'll always be apart of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me, yeah
Oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
(You and I will always be)
Time can't erase a feelin' this strong
(You and I)
No way you're never gonna shake me

Ooh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
