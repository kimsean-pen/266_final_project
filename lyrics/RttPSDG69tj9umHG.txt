So you wanna be the master
(Pokemon)
Do you have the skills to be number one
Number one!

I wanna take the ultimate step
Find the courage to be bold
To risk it all and not forget
The lessons that I hold

I wanna go where no one's been
Far beyond the crowd
To learn the way to take command
Use the power that's in my hand

We all live in a Pokemon World
(Pokemon)
I wanna be the greatest Master of them all
(Master)
We all live in a Pokemon World
(Pokemon)
Put myself to the test
To be better than all the rest

So you wannna be the master
(Pokemon)
Do you have the skills to be
number one

We all live in a Pokemon World
(Pokemon)
I wanna be the greatest Master of them all
