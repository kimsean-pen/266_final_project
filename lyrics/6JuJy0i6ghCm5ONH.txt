Too many times I watched you leave
I didn't say anything
Too many lies inside that bleed
And now we're running out of time
Out of line, out of faith, out of reason
Some might say
I guess there's somewhere we can stay all night
So we can turn it all around

Don't say that you know me,
unless you wanna stay around
Don't say that you know me
Show me, shoot me down

Itsumo, it's the only way
Stay
Itsumo, don't take our love away
Our moment can't be found

Too many sides that you can't see
I wonder if we ever change
All that divides us is the sea
Rhyming words making sense
Out of line, out of faith, out of reason
Some might say
I guess there's somewhere we can stay all night
So we can turn it all around

Don't say that you know me,
unless you wanna stay around
Don't say that you know me
Show me, shoot me down

Itsumo, it's the only way
Stay
Itsumo, don't take our love away
Our moment can't be found

Itsumo, it's the only way
Call me out in my defence
Call me out in my defence

Don't say that you know me,
unless you wanna stay around
Don't say that you know me
Show me, shoot me down

Itsumo, it's the only way
Stay
Itsumo, don't take our love away
Our moment can't be found

Itsumo, it's the only way
Call me out in my defence
Call me out in my defence
Call me out in my defence
