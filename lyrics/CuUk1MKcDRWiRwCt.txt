I didn't know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
right behind my back
you stabbed me
I should have known you were a bitch
shut up, you're makin me sick
little man you're nothing like me

lying, cheating, so deceiving
I trusted you, broke me down
and you screwed me over
Don't try to deny it
you cannot hide it
I'll be ignited

When I get to watch you
Burn Burn Burn
I wanna watch you
Burn Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
I wanna watch you burn

You turned me, inside out
My world is upside down
You're not her are you happy now
Looking over your shoulder
Fucking me over

I trusted you, sold me out
this is far from over
don't try to deny it
you cannot hide it
I'll be ignited
When I get to watch you

Burn burn burn
I wanna watch you
Burn burn burn
I wanna watch you
Burn burn
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve

And you'll never learn
Yeah
your time has come now

it's your turn
I'll watch you burn
BURN
BURN
BURN
I wanna watch you
BURN
BURN
BURN
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
And you'll never learn, Yeah
your time has come now
it's your turn
I wanna watch you BURN BURN BURN
I wanna watch you BURN BURN BURN
I wanna watch you BURN
