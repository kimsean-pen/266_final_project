I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up
All my broken things

'Cause you left me
Police tape, chalk line
Tequila shots in the dark
Scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling
That I'm giving up everything for you

How was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me?
I think that I should go (Go!)
And something's telling me
To leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do you
Damned if I don't

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You made up, dressed up, messed up
Plans I set in stone

But you made me do when I don't
Like dancing in the alley
With a street-rat, night-life
Can't keep living with a feeling
That I'm giving up everything for you

How was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me?
I think that I should go (Go!)
Something's telling me
To leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do you
Damned if I...

Don't make a fool of myself
When you hang around
When you're gone
I'm a match that's burning out
Could have been, should have done
What I said I was going to
(Said that I was going to)
But I never promised you
(But I never promised you)

How was I supposed to know
That you were o-o-over me?
I think that I should go (Go!)
Never took a fool to see
The things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do you
Damned if I do you

Oh, oh, oh
('Cause you left me)
How was I supposed to know
(Police tape, chalk line)
That you were oh, oh, over me?
I think that I should go
(Tequila shots in the dark, scene of the crime)
Something's telling me
To leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do you
Damned if I d-d-d-
Damned if I do you
Damned if I don't
