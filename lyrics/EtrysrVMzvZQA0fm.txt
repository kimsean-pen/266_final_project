this is not your playground
I'm not here for you to shoot me down
preying on my weakness
even when you're not around
nothing lasts forever
but you're wrapped around my DNA
and I'm hiding in the corner as the wounded kid I was
like it was yesterday
like nothing's changed

all that you've done you see
ever so quietly
comes creeping back up on me
haunting me, goading me
why can't you let go of me?
I don't have the patience anymore

that's not me
I won't be the version of me
the one you think you're comfortable with
the one you think you had your fun with
If I can't trust myself
why should I trust anyone else?
