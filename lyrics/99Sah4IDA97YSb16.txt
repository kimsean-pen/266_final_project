The way you walked in
I saw you standing there
You caught me staring at you
Hot Like Wow

You came a little closer
You know you make me blush
You got a body that is
Hot Like Wow

And all my friends they tell me
You know they think I'm crazy
The things you've got me doing
Hot Like Wow

They say they don't believe me
But I know they're just jealous
The freaky things you do are
Hot Like Wow

And all I wanna do
Is find a boy like you
Someone to make me feel
Hot Like Wow
(Hot Like Wow)

And if you want me to
And I just watches you
You got a body that is
Hot Like Wow
(Hot Like Wow)

(Hot Like Wow)
Hot Like Wow
(Hot Like Wow)

And when I see you boy
You make my heartbeat jump
I can't stop looking at you
Hot Like Wow

I think of all those things
I wanna do with you
And then I try to stop it
Hot Like Wow

I bet you look much better
With no clothes on
Although I know I shouldn't
Hot Like Wow

I know you see me looking
I see you looking too
You know you make me feel
Hot Like Wow

And all I wanna do
Is find a boy like you
Someone to make me feel
Hot Like Wow
(Hot Like Wow)

A little boy like you
To make my dreams come true
You got a body that is
Hot Like Wow
(Hot Like Wow)

La la la la la la

Hot Like Wow
(You got a body that is
Hot Like Wow)

Hot Like Wow
(You got a body that is
