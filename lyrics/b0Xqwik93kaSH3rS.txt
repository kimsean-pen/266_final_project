I'm afraid of pain
Both yours and mine
Both yours and mine
I'm afraid of pain
From where it comes
And where it falls

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Marching away and you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say?

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
We've got a long way to go
Before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home
