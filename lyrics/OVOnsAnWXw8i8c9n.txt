Mistakes and broken faith
I wish that I could make it go away
Friendly, with hidden hate
I know the past really has its ways

Is this a case of we're giving up?
Maybe we're gold, I'll never know
We're so unpredictable
Maybe we're gold
Gold

Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're

Ok, another mess
But just a touch and I lose my breath
Crazy, what we do best
I wanna know what's inside your head

Is this a case of we're giving up?
Maybe we're gold, I'll never know
We're so unpredictable
Maybe we're gold
Gold

Is this a case of we're giving up?
Maybe we're gold I'll never know
We're so unpredictable
Maybe we're gold
Gold

Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're gold
Maybe we're, maybe we're
