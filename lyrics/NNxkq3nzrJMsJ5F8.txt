Up the stairs, behind the door
She was sitting there crying
She smashed all the glasses on the mirror
Which was shattered all across the room

She screamed so loud
Until she was laughing
Well now, there's no more reasons for her to cry
It was so late, it was 4 a.m.

I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again

Up the stairs, by the bed
There was a dead man waiting
Waiting for someone to find him out
And bury him deep down the ground

He looked so scared
But not regretful
In the other side of town a car drives fast
Hard to tell fear from happiness

I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again

Rat is dead
Rat is dead
Rat is dead
Rat is dead

Up the stairs, behind the door
She was sitting there crying
She smashed all the glasses on the mirror
Which was shattered all across the room

She screamed so loud
Until she was laughing
Well now there's no more reasons for her to cry
It was so late, it was 4 a.m.

I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again

I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again, girl
