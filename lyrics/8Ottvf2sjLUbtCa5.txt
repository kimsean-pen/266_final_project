I'm coming in hot, I'm coming in fast
Take my time, it's so damn hard
I'll make this last
I'm the artist, paints in white
Your skin canvas
I'll leave you scratching, gasping, screaming, screaming
I was lost until I found myself inside of you
My friend, my love, my life, my
Truth be told I would
Set my whole world on fire
Just to watch it burn in your eyes, in your eyes

Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth
Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth

Set my world on fire
It caught spark in your eyes
And now I could see myself with no other baby
I've had you so many times
But you know I could never get enough
Of your love

I could never get enough
I could never get enough of your love

Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth
Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth

I'm here
This is faithfulness at its finest
I'm still here
This is faithfulness at its finest
I'm still here
This is faithfulness at its finest
I'm still here
This is faithfulness
