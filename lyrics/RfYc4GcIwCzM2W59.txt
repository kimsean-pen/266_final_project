Tell me something sexy and I'll log off my whatever
Gag me, awake my fighting spirit
Take your time and stay off the channels
We're not attracted to this country's standards

That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me

Open the gearbox and she's on it
Staying alive with a permit
No definition, feed our needs
The perverts define my fuck history

That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me

Free abortions and clean water
Destroy nuclear
Destroy boring

Lovers got love in a love fest
Every time we fuck we win

This house makes it hard to fuck
This house makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
