"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction"

Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out (XO)
You can turn my lights out

We don't have forever
Oh, baby daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out (Mmmh, yeah-e-yeah)
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Baby take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

I love you like XO (XO)
You love me like XO (XO)
You kill me boy XO (XO)
You love me like XO (XO)
All that I see
Give me everything
Baby love me lights out
Baby love me lights out
You can turn my lights out...

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
