Beneath The Wheel...

Go! Don't be late
First one out of the starting gate
Run! Be on time
First one to cross the finish line

Swim ahead of the school
If you have to, cheat
If you never slow down
You'll never be beat
If you lose in life
It's because you lagged
Keep up with the traffic
Or you'll get dragged down
Beneath the wheel!

Go! Don't be tardy
Fell asleep last night ar a party
Run! Make the grade
School's a job you dont get paid

Run at the head of the pack
Be the leader in this race
Stay up front
Just in case
If you lose in life
It's because you lagged
Keep up with the traffic
Or you'll get dragged down
Beneath the wheel!

Go! Don't be late
First one out of the starting gate
Run! Make the grade
School's a job you dont get paid

Don't play child's games
They're just a waste of mind
Study every night or you minght fall behind-
Dragged down beneath the wheel

Stop! - You can't win
But you can always
Catch up in the end
