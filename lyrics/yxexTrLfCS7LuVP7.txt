Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Did it ever become what I've always wanted it to
You tell me I'm the lucky one
How can you say that
When it breaks my heart to see another woman with you
Oh, lover of mine
Oh, lover of mine
When it hurts so bad
I want to hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you want to be
A lover of mine
After we've said all there is to say
Am I still in your heart
Or am I just in your way
My desire for you is running wild
Jealousy, dangerous time
When I see you looking at another woman that way
Oh, lover of mine
Oh, oh lover of mine
When it hurts so bad
I want to hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you want to be
A lover of mine
Please set me free
Give me a reason
I'm trying to keep it alive
There is no need
For us to be lonely
Give me some kind of hope
I'm walking a fine line
Oh, lover of mine
Oh, lover of mine
When it hurts so bad
I want to hold you in my arms
Make me feel like you want to be
A lover of mine
Make me feel like you want to be a lover of mine
Make me feel like you want to be a lover of mine
