It's late at night, and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe, thinking of your smile

Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God, I wish I could make you see

'Cause I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
No, I ain't giving up on us

I just want to be with you
'Cause living is so hard to do
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes

The future I cannot forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see

'Cause I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love

Baby can you feel it coming?
You know I can hear it, hear every soul
Baby, when you feel me feeling you
You know it's time
Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
No, I ain't giving up
No, I ain't giving up on us
