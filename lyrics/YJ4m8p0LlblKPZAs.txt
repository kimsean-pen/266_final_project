I'll be the lights and the soul of the party,
Follow the swarm of the bees to their honey!
You'll find the struts in the club like a pony,
And I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!

I'm stronger since September,
And it's affecting feeling better than ever!
You were a let down from what I remember,
And I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!

We're gon' keep on dancing, out on the floor,
We're gon' keep on drinking, give me one more!
Mojito, let's go, barman stack em' in a row!

I don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside
It's fantasy I'm doin fine,
Without you,
The girls are goin out tonight
Get blinded by the city lights,
Everythin's gon' be alright,
Without you, without you, without you, without you, without you,
Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah
Ooh Ooh oh oh

Yes it's you that's headin' for a breakdown,
And I'm sorry, sorry's not any use now!
Cause you're the best thing I can do without,
Cause I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!

I can smell the roses, the sun has come out,
I'm comin into focus, look at me now!
Sambuca at the bar, laser fire in my heart!

I don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside
It's fantasy I'm doin fine,
Without you,
The girls are goin out tonight
Get blinded by the city lights,
Everythin's gon' be alright,
Without you, without you, without you, without you, without you,
Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah
Ooh Ooh oh oh

I never felt so care-free,
I never felt so naugh-ty!
Being single isn't lonely,
Raise a lighter if you're with me!

Mojito, let's go, barman stack em' in a row!

I don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside
It's fantasy I'm doin fine,
Without you,
The girls are goin out tonight
Get blinded by the city lights,
Everythin's gon' be alright,
Without you, without you, without you, without you, without you,
Without you, Without you, Without you, Without you!
