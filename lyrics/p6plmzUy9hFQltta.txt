You got the feeling, I know you're there
You got the feeling, I know you're there

It's like I'm living in a daydream
Got your love all over me
I can feel something starting
Take me all the way you want me

'Cause too many times I've complicated this love
Too many times I don't know when to shut up
But every time you keep pulling me closer
You don't let me down

You got the feeling I need
You got the feeling, I know you're there
You got the feeling I need
You got the feeling, I know you're there
You got the feeling, feel good

You got the feeling I need
You got that feeling, yeah
I know you're there, I know you're there
You got that feeling, yeah
I know you're there, I know you're there

You're like a storm raging through me
The way you touch me with your energy
And I can feel something rising
I'm so high it's getting hard to breathe

'Cause too many times I've complicated this love
Too many times I don't know when to shut up
But every time you keep pulling me closer
You don't let me down

You got the feeling I need
You got the feeling, I know you're there
You got the feeling I need
You got the feeling, I know you're there
You got the feeling, feel good

You got the feeling I need
You got that feeling, yeah
I know you're there, I know you're there
You got that feeling, yeah
I know you're there, I know you're there
