I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding in ways of the fire burned.
I'm crying, I'm crying in ways of the nightbird.
No more is there one to lay by my side.
I'm straying, I'm straying in nightmares all the time.

A little something I know
A little somewhere I go

Reminds me of you.

To blossom blue is to blossom without you.
To blossom blue...
I'm breaking, I'm breaking but I cannot bear to.
I'm staring, I'm staring but I cannot see you.

For no more are you to lay by my side...
I'm weeping, I'm weeping no more then this second time.
A little something I know

A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow
Reminds me of you...
A little something I know

A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow
Where the mistletoes grow
Reminds me of you.
To blossom blue is to blossom without you.
To blossom blue is to blossom without you.
