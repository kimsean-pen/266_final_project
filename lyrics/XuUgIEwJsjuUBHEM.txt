What did you mean when you opened your mouth
And let all our secrets out?
You told him what I was about
My cover was completely blown
I tell you darlin', I've been watching the war film
I got a few ideas of my own
'Cos after the film had ended the call for recruits was shown

And I'm joining the professionals
I want to be a man
With all that animal magic
I'll do anything you can
I'm joining the professionals
'Cos I want to be a man
Look! I wave my wand, watch the rabbit disappear
Join the professionals and learn to fight

I bet the two of you still laugh at me
For being timid as a lamb
That may be still the way I look
It's no longer what I am
Been across to Northern Ireland
I came home with a new kind of charge
I learned to hunt in the night
I learned about camouflage

I've been joining the professionals
And now that I'm a man
With all that animal magic
I'll match anything you can
I'm joining the professionals
This time I understand
There's no way you'll get by me
With the slightest sleight of hand
I'm joining the professionals
I want to be a man
Kook! I wave my wand
Watch the rabbit disappear
Join the professionals and learn to fight

Animal magic
