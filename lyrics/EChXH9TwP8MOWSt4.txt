Oh ohh noo ohh ohh
Gave you the benefit of the doubt
Till you showed me what you were about

Your true colors came out
Oh ohh
And your words couldn't hide the scent

Cuz the truth about where you've been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize
Standing there

Scratching your head
Blood shot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge

I'm done with this
Feeling like an idiot
Lovin you, I'm over it

I just don't love you, don't love you no more
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay

Say, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
Don't wanna hear a thing you say
So yesterday

Funny now how I'm gone
The little light in your head came on
Now you realize it's all your fault
Oh ohh
Don't you wish you had a time machine

That way you could change history
That's the only way that you could be with me
Standing there

Scratching your head
Blood shot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge

I'm done with this
Feeling like an idiot
Lovin you, I'm over it

I just don't love you, don't love you no more...
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way

Now you come begging me to stay
Honey, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
Don't wanna hear a thing you say

So yesterday
And now you wanna reminisce
Say you wanna try again
Started with a little kiss

(We can't even regret) no no
Now I never wanna see you, never wanna feel you
Ever wanna hear you
I don't love you, don't need you, can't stand you
No More...
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay)
Baby, you...
You are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
Don't wanna hear a thing you say
So yesterday
So yesterday
So yesterday
