You look so pretty when you cry
Don't wanna hit you but the only thing
Between our love is a bloody nose, busted lip and a blackened eye
You look so pretty when you cry
Don't wanna hit you but the only thing
Between our love is a bloody nose, busted lip and a blackened eye

You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped

Cock, cock, cock it

When I undo my belt,
you melt and you walk away with a red, red, red welt
Or so they say
When I undo my belt (cock, cock, cock it)
You melt and you walk away (cock, cock, cock it)
With a red, red, red welt
Or so they say

You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped

Cock, cock, cock it

I wanna have your ache and beat you too
I wanna have your ache and beat you too
I wanna have your ache and beat you too
I wanna have your ache and beat you too

You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped
Cock, cock, cock it
Cock, cock, cock it
You're a little pistol and I'm fucking pistol whipped
Cock, cock, cock it
Cock, cock, cock it

Cock, cock, cock it
