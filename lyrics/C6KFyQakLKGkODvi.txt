Baby I know
It's no big deal
I'm sorry if I'm overreacting
You can pull me in but don't speak
When I act like this
I'm unpredictable so don't ask me

How I can be so cold
And wake up at the break of dawn every morning
It's out of my control
You say it's time I let you help

But I'm no good at talking
Open up like you
It's not that I don't want to
But I'm so used to
Whenever I am down
You can't see it on my face
'Cause I hide the pain away
You see baby
I'm no good at talking

Once I was told
I need to treat myself like a friend would
If I don't get the job that I want
Don't pass a test
Fall in love with someone who's no good

But small things can hit me hard
I stay up 'till the break of dawn every morning
And I'll always be on guard
Maybe it's time I let you help

But I'm no good at talking
Open up like you
It's not that I don't want to
But I'm so used to
Whenever I am down
You can't see it on my face
'Cause I hide the pain away
You see baby
I'm no good at talking

Takes time if you wanna get to me
I keep it down deep
But don't give it up, don't you give me up
There's quite a lot I don't let you see
I hate to feel weak
But don't give it up, don't you give me up

Baby I'm no good at talking
It's up to me to solve it and I know
Oh I wish that you could walk in
Change it on the spot but boy you won't

I'm no good at talking
Open up like you
It's not that I don't want to
But I'm so used to
Whenever I am down
You can't see it on my face
'Cause I hide the pain away
You see baby
I'm no good at talking
Open up like you
It's not that I don't want to
But I'm so used to
Whenever I am down
You can't see it on my face
'Cause I hide the pain away
You see baby
I'm no good at talking
I'm no good at talking
I'm no good at talking
I'm no good at talking
I'm no good at talking
