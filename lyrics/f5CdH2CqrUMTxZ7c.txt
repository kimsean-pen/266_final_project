No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer
Sometimes
I feel like going down and so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin'
I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
In the shadows

(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
In the shadows

They say
That I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I
I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave
Sometimes
I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow
I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin'
I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

Lately I've been walkin',
walkin' in circles, watchin', waitin' for somethin'
Feel me, touch me, heal me, come take me higher

I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin'
I've been livin'
For tomorrows all my life

I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
I've been searchin'
I've been livin' for tomorrows

(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
In the shadows

(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
In the shadows

I've been waitin'
