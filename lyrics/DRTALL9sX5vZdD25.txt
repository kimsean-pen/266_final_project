Your body's cold
You're on the bed
I'm the only one
Who knows you're there
I'm reeling in that silver line
The cord that brings you back in time
Reality obscures my view
The pain of wanting to
When am I going to be a part of you?

Your eyes are closed
They're in your hair
But I'll make it
Just say you care
When every one has had their fill
You're holding on although you're ill
I watch the ripples in the storm
Until I have the brew
And then I throw them evening(?)
Over you

How can you want to stay like this?
The choice is ignorance or bliss
We'll go together don't be scared
It won't take long we'll soon be there
When we arrive just look around
There's so much to be found
We'll sail away upon a sea of sound
