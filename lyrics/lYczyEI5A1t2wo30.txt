Gotta give you up, but I don't know how
I'm on my knees
And I wanna know the secret of love, of love
And if I could be stronger than you, then maybe I'd leave
But you got that hit that I need
My baby please

But I can't keep taking
I'm numb, I'm sedated

Only love hurts like this
So tie a rope around my wrist
I'm losing, I'm losing the feeling
You're my tourniquet, eh, ehi
Sticks and stones built my home
And all the faces I have known
I'm losing, I'm losing the feeling
You're my tourniquet, eh, eh, eh, ehi

Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh
You're my tourniquet
Eh, eh, eh, ehi

One touch and I'm running for the hills
But how could I leave when the pain gets real?
Make me feel
Cover up in the middle of the night
Like a child I was scared, I was lonely
I was fighting the good fight
Bright light

But I can't keep taking
I'm numb, I'm sedated

Only love hurts like this
So tie a rope around my wrist
I'm losing, I'm losing the feeling
You're my tourniquet, eh, ehi
Sticks and stones built my home
And all the faces I have known
I'm losing, I'm losing the feeling
You're my tourniquet, eh, eh, eh, ehi

Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh
You're my tourniquet
Eh, eh, eh, ehi

You're my tourniquet
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
Eh, eh, eh
You're my tourniquet
Eh, eh, eh, ehi
