Little trip to heaven on the wings of your love
Banana moon shining in the sky
Feel like I'm in heaven when you're with me
Know that I'm in heaven when you smile
Though we're stuck here on the ground
I got something that I've found
And it's you

I don't have to take no trip to outer space
All I have to do is look at your face
And before I know it I'm in orbit around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you
When I see your constellation
Honey, you're my inspiration
And it's you

You're my North Star when I'm lost and feeling blue
The sun is breaking through the clouds, don't you, don't you know it's true
Honey, all the other stars seem dim around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you
When I see your smiling face
Honey, I know nothing ever gonna take your place
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
