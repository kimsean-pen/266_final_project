Angel eyes, you have angel eyes
Such a smile, lights up my life, ohh
You're a dream come true, now I'm holding you
And I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go

First time I laid my eyes upon you
All my dreams were answered
First time I kissed your tender lips
My love to you I surrendered, ohh

I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go

Angel eyes, my heart relies
On the love you give to me
You never let me down, you're always by my side
And I'll never, never let you go, I will never let you go

When my heart starts to crumble
And the tears start to fall
You hold me close with tender lovin'
And give me strength to carry on, ohh, ohh

I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go
I'll never let you go
You're always on my mind
You're the only one for me, you're all I need
And I'll never, never let you go, ohh, ooh
And I'll never, never let you go
