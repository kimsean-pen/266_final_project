Ooh oh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh oh ooh ooh ooh oh

It seems the more I know, the less I know
Makes me uncomfortable
Wondering if it's all for show
Am I just an animal?
Digging into rabbit holes
I'm falling on my knees
Fall in love endlessly
And break up easily
Repeating my history
Am I just an animal?
Digging into rabbit holes again

What I thought I knew
I can't seem to find
What I think I need
I'm wrong every time

I'm on the floor again
Woke up with aspirin
My lucky talisman, bring me back to life again
Don't want to be a vegetable
I keep it unpredictable
It's up to me to write
The story of my life
Even if it's all a lie
We still got an alibi
We just a bunch of animals
Digging into rabbit holes again

What I thought I knew
I can't seem to find
What I think I need
I'm wrong every time

Give it up, give it up
I was born an animal
I'll be an animal til i die
Give it up, give it up
I was born an animal
I'll be an animal til I die
Ooh oh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh oh ooh ooh ooh oh
I want some chocolate (give it up, give it up)
Don't want a Tootsie roll (I'll be an animal)

They're robotic (Give it up, give it up)
But I'm an animal (Give it up, give it up)
What I thought I knew
I can't certify
What I think I need
I'm offered anytime
