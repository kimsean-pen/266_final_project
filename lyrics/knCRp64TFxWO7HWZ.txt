See me up in the club with fifty-leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here, got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe (How it's looking, babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
Tell me how it's looking, babe (How it's looking, babe)
Tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe

Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble
Puffing on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cuz when he wanna smash
I'll just write another one I
sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
