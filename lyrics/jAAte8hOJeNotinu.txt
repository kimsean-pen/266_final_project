Oh the deer and the wolf
They never try to get along
But they need each other
It's an unknown bond

One waits in the dark
While the other seeks light
But they both have hearts
That break in the night

Come away, come away darling
Look at how we are
See ourselves reflected in a river
Guess that's the hardest part

On and on and on my love
Agree to disagree
Under the surface it's role universal
The opposites decree
We're both in tune
When we're chasing the moon
But under the sun I'm hunted just like you

Oh the deer and the wolf
I think they wanna get along
Cause they need each other
Or the world is done

One takes the grain (takes the grain)
One's the carnivore (carnivore)
Such a gentile eye
To see the sharpest claw

Come away, come away darling
Look at how we are
See ourselves reflected in a river
Guess that's the hardest part

On and on and on my love
Agree to disagree
Under the surface it's role universal
The opposites decree
We're both in tune
When we're chasing the moon
But under the sun I'm hunted just like you

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

Oh the deer and the wolf
We really wanna get along
We're in this together
You're the only one

On and on and on my love
Agree to disagree
Under the surface it's role universal
The opposites decree
We're both in tune
When we're chasing the moon
But under the sun I'm hunted just like you
Hunted just like you
I'm hunted just like you
