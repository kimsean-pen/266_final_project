You're fighting battles and fighting wars
You storm my castle, I'll hold the doors
We are too fragile to fight for sport
Please see, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed for you

Our love's been caught in the crossfire
Been balancing on a hot wire
Peace is just a distant memory (Memory)
We sat down at the table with your daggers out
Just sharpen the blades with the words from your mouth
You can't forgive if you can't forget
A bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now

We're fighting battles and fighting wars
You storm my castle, I'll hold the doors
We are too fragile to fight for sport
Please see, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed for you

The tension is too high to call a truce
But I can't take another bruise
Or this vicious cycle anymore (Anymore)
We walked across the mention of thin ice
To know what flag that you need to sign
Are we too prideful for mercy?

You're fighting battles and fighting wars
You storm my castle, I'll hold the doors
We are too fragile to fight for sport
Please see, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed, I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)
And I bleed for you

A bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now
Our sweet surrender's sinking deeper while we drown
I bleed for you (For you, for you, for you)

A bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now
Our sweet surrender's sinking deeper while we drown
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
I bleed for you, for you

I bleed for you, I bleed for you
I bleed for you, for you
