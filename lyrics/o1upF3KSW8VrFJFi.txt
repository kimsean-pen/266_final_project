I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy, I'll be your hope
I'll be your love be everything that you need
I love you more with every breath truly, madly, deeply, do
I will be strong, I will be faithful

Because I am counting on a new beginning
A reason for living a deeper meaning yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish send it to heaven that'll make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection

Of the highest power and lonely hours
The tears divide you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
