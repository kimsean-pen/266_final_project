Park hill romance
We got the love
But they put out the fire
Park hill romance
Coz they expect us
To walk on the wire
Park hill romance
We got the love
But they put out the fire
Park hill romance
Coz they expect us
To walk on the wire

A kid lifts up a spray can
And never thought it would be famous
What he did
Turned the mess into a dreamland
With a quirky act of romance

A version of Romeo and Juliet
This time with adidas, sneakers and cigarettes
A couple of kids trying to cut down the safety net
They twisted the story
So they could bring glory to it

I love ya
Will you marry me?
Oh what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad

Park hill romance
We got the love
But they put out the fire
Park hill romance
Coz they expect us
To walk on the wire
Park hill romance
We got the love
But they put out the fire
Park hill romance
Coz they expect us
To walk on the wire

They didn't write her name on the article
That to me just seems pretty farcical
Now coppers take coppers out of his hands from a ban from alcohol
Fundamental narcissistic
Tried to make out he didn't exist
When they wrote on the what
When they wrote on the t-shirts, cool merch and postcards
And lighting it up like a piece of art
They kicked him to the side and left him to starve
The memory that's re-breaking his broken heart

I love ya
Will you marry me?
Oh what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad

I love ya
Will you marry me?
Oh what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad

Everyday, everyday, every single day
Everyday, everyday, every single day

I love ya
Will you marry me?
Oh what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad

I love ya
Will you marry me?
Oh what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad
