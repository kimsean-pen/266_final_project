I'm your baby girl
Been six years since I'm your world
You say the best things that I've ever heard
But darling I wish I was first

Don't wanna be that, wanna be that, wanna be that girl
Don't wanna feel that, wanna feel that, wanna feel that burn
But I found your ex on your insta
Just wanted to know what you're into

And lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see this pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me
Are you gonna leave
This pictures of her
Watch you make me your ex, your ex, your ex
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex
Watch you make me your ex

Hello baby girl
Say whatever, I mean, every word
Never argued your heart's made of gold
Darling my heart has been stole

Don't wanna be that, wanna be that, wanna be that girl
Don't wanna feel that, wanna feel that, wanna feel that burn
But I found your ex on your insta
Just wanted to know what you're into

And lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see this pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me
Are you gonna leave
This pictures of her
Watch you make me your ex, your ex, your ex
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex
Watch you make me your ex

Everyone can see
You got eyes on me
I'm just crazy
It's not you it's me
I know truthfully
I'm your baby

But lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see this pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me
Are you gonna leave
This pictures of her
Watch you make me your ex, your ex, your ex
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex
Watch you make me your ex
