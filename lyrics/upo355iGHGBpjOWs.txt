Shades of the dead
Rise at night
They're my cryings... In these cries

Gaze of death
Shame from the past
They're a game and a blame

This is the darkness
This is the gate
I've done my dare of light and gazes in flames

Why you don't believe me
Now I close my eyes with you
Father please don't leave me

Bring me by the hand again
Save me from my grave...
I'm fallin' through your vein...
