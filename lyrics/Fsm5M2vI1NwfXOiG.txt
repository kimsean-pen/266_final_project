Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Can you go the distance
I don't wanna see
Can you make a future without maturity
I'm doing fine as far as I can see
So go ahead and keep your American dream
I wanna live my life to the fullest
Make the most out of being young
And when I'm laying down on my death bed
I'll be proud of every story told

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Have you had the same mentality
Since you we're just a kid
Can you ever face reality
Growing up so quick

It's either hard at work or hardly working at all
It's either hard at work or hardly working at all

I don't wanna purchase what you're selling
Please will you accept my written apology
Listen close to the words I say
When I'm old and I'm deaf you'll still be hearing me

I have one life to live
And I want true happiness
I have one life to live
And I want true happiness

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Have you had the same mentality
Since you we're just a kid
Can you ever face reality
Growing up so quick

It's either hard at work or hardly working at all
It's either hard at work or hardly working at all

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Go ahead and keep your American dream

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your American dream

Have you had the same mentality
Since you we're just a kid
Can you ever face reality
Growing up so quick

It's either hard at work or hardly working at all
It's either hard at work or hardly working at all

Go ahead and keep it
I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it
I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it
I will never need it
Go ahead and keep your American dream
