LET GO!
This time is different
I'm burning up
I'm filling up, see

Forever plagued with this fire inside me
Deliver all, to live or die blindly
It's empty, it's bluffing defining the nothing
Interfering with the call of fate is crawling out of you and now

Finding comfort in the smallest spaces have sold out
I know I said, I hope I don't upset the light you defend
But this time it's different
Destroy my pain

Then capture life again
Destroy my shame
Can't live my life this way
LET! go, GO! let go

And capture life again
LET! go, GO! let go
Can't live my life this way
I'm giving up

I'm living but weak
I'm hearing voices from shadows inside me
I never sleep
My eyes are too focused, too hopeless, too broken, too open, to notice

Interfering with the call of fate is crawling out of you, and now
Finding comfort in the smallest spaces have sold out
I know I said
I hope I don't upset the light you defend

But this time it's different
Destroy my pain
Then capture life again
Destroy my shame

Can't live my life this way
LET! go, GO! let go
And capture life again
LET! go, GO! let go
Can't live my life this way
I open my eyes
The voice inside me
I open my mind
But this time it's different
Destroy my pain
Then capture life again
Destroy my shame
Can't live my life this way
LET! go, GO! let go
And capture life again
LET! go, GO! let go
Can't live my life this way
LET! go, GO! let go
And capture life again
LET! go, GO! let go
Can't live my life this way
Can't live my life this way
Can't live my life this way
