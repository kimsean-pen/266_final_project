No sense in running away
From the hollow gaze of your new and only friend
Your sins, your lies,
Your dim disguise
Can never escape that grin and those eyes
We shy away
We want to stay
The end has never been so close
Creeping behind us
We can't stop what we started
Pray time will change your ways
Find where to take this pain that's eating you inside out
Try waiting for new light
