Pray for our love
Heal thyself
(Holes for our eyes?)
We are bound

Analyze
Sacrifice
Live forever
(??)

Idolize
Magnify
Fall in the black
(??)

You have to feed us to see the beast
You have to give up and be the feast

Lost in life, we blindly seek
All we know will set you free

I want blood on my hands
A violence to face
I need you to wash me away
Gouge my eyes

Take me farther down the corridors (??)
To the chamber, the centers of absolute power
Let me course through the veins (of the other?)
Then tear me apart, take me (??)
Make us the forces of nature
I will turn every thought towards (??)
I will burn with the (??) at the altar
I will make up the starlight
