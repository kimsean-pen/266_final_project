Hey me
Remember when you were skinny
Remember when you didn't worry
Remember when you didn't care
That's when you were living
You were living, you were alive

And I don't know what's happened to me
No, I don't know what's happened to me
I guess the devil's back
I guess the devil's back
I guess the devil's back
I guess the devil's back

Hate me
I hate what I've become and now I cannot breathe
Anxiety is killing me slowly
What happened to youthful carefree
When did I get so old

And I don't know what's happened to me
No, I don't know what's happened to me
I guess the devil's back
I guess the devil's back
Against the devil's back
Against the devil's back
