I left My street
I'm a guillotine
Pulling away in my machine
Where have I been now? Not you

Shooting stars in my left arm
An alcohol low
Giving away time to Casio
Sun is low

Is this where I'm going to?
We'll see we'll see we'll see

I kill this sleep
I'm the man in the moon
Walking on sand on my home high noon
In love with the moon, love you

Cos I lift my street I'm a guillotine
Pull it away in my machine
Forget where I've been before

Is this where I'm going to
We'll see we'll see we'll see
Forget you
