Please don't get me wrong
See I forgive you in a song
We'll call the likely lads
But, if it's left to you
I know exactly what you'd do
With all the dreams we had
Just blood runs thicker, oh
We're as thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
But, you don't wanna know

You don't want to know
If you pipe all summer long
Then get forgiven in a song
Well that's a touch, my lad
They sold the rights to all the wrongs
And when they knew you'd give me songs

"Welcome back", I said
The blood runs thicker, oh
We're as thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see

But, you don't wanna know
You don't want to know

Oh, what became of the likely lads?

What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever? Though

Oh, what became of forever? Though
We'll never know
Please don't get me wrong
See I forgive you in a song
Will call the likely lads
We all bought the ones

We taught 'em all we wrote the songs
That's filled with dreams we have
But, blood runs thicker, oh
We're as thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
It's important to me

I tried to make you see
But, you don't wanna know
You don't want to know
Oh, what became of the likely lads?
What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever? Though
Oh, what became of forever? Though
We'll never know
But, blood run thicker, oh
We're as thick as theives you know
And that important to you
Yes, it important to me
I tried to make you see
But, you dont want to know
Oh, what became of the likely lads?
What became of the dreams we had?
Oh, what became of forever? Though
Oh, what became of forever? Though
We'll never know
