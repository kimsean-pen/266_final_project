Steam rising and spiraling then vanish in the wind
I cant tell where the land ends and the sky begins
Are you acquainted with the threat of being killed?
Or are you conversing with pigeons on the windowsill?

Every battle has been fought
And everything I think was thought
Down we, down we've descended

Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
So we patronize pedestrians
With no sense of direction
When you're lost and can't ask a question

Steam rising and spiraling then vanish in the wind
I cant tell where the land ends and the sky begins
This city truly is assaulting my senses
Unkempt, unruly, devour, defenseless
Occupant. If Poverty builds up character,
And spoils breed arrogance,
I'd rather consort with the low and the decadent

Every battle has been fought
And everything I think was thought
Down we, down we've descended

Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
So we patronize pedestrians
With no sense of direction
When you're lost and can't ask a question

You'd better have the strength
Of the wandering aimless
With an audience
Of the most prestigious
Do you have to strain
To love the one you came with?
I hope you have the strength
Because we're in the belly of...

Every battle has been fought
And everything I think was thought
Down we, down we've descended

Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
So we patronize pedestrians
With no sense of direction
When you're lost and can't ask a question
