I hear a voice I hear a sound
But nothing plays on my mind
I take the car I travel round
But nothing stays on my mind

What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning
In the heart of the bushland
What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning
In the heart of the bushland

But now I'm scared
Now I'm lost in love
All these things were never done
Your burning bridge my talking drum
Now we're too late for heaven
