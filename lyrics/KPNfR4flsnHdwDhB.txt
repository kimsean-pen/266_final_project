The misery I know
Like a friend that won't let go
Is creeping up on me now once again
So I sing this song tonight
To the ghost that will not die
That somehow seems to haunt me till the end

Do you feel the same
For what once remained?
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by?

I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars
It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

Do you feel the same
For what once remained?
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the ghost of days gone by?

And I know it's drawing closer
With each day I fear the end
And I don't want to die
Don't want to die
Don't want to die
I don't want to die

Do you feel the same
For what once remained?
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry
For the days gone by?
Do they haunt you like a ghost until the end?
Haunt you till the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end
