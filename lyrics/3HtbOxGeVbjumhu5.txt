Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need

You say you're lookin' for someone
Never weak but always strong
To protect you and to defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Move lightly from the ledge, babe
Move lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down

You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and maybe more

But it still ain't me, babe
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go melt back into the night, babe
Everything inside here is made of stone
Well, there's nothing in here that's moving
And anyway I'm not alone

You say you're looking for someone
Pick you up every time you fall
Someone to gather flowers constantly
And come at the time you call
A lover for your life an' what more

But it still ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
