All my life trouble follows me like a mystery girl
And I've been chasing down a memory like a mystery girl
I've been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
Took a wrong turn at growing up and it's freaking me out
Back at school it never made much sense

Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess but that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs and violence

English, Math and Science
Safety in numbers
Gimme gimme danger
I don't wanna be an imbecile

But Jesus made me that way
All my life I've been running wild like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me like a stowaway
Back at school it never made much sense

Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess but that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, Drugs and Violence
