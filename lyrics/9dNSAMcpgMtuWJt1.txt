Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space
Somewhere far away in space and time
Staring upwards at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky

We're marooned on a small island,
In an endless sea,
Confined to a tiny spit of sand,
Unable to escape

But tonight, on this small planet
On earth, we're going to rock civilisation

But tonight, on this small planet
On earth, we're going to rock civilisation

Is this bass really strong enough?

We're marooned on a small island,
In an endless sea,
Confined to a tiny spit of sand,
Unable to escape

But tonight... its heavy stuff!
