Girls in their high tops dancing for days
Guys in the gold pants talking new slang
Rolling through cities like a storm
Kids on the corner shaking spray paint
Making their mark on the interstate
Drawing peace signs cause life is beautiful
No ties, no fear, we're living in the minute
We came, we saw, not stopping till we get it
Just love, just light, we'll start a revolution
In waves we crash, one voice

Making headlines just for kicks
Tryna get love not tryna get rich
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia
Not in it for the fame we do it for the thrill
Gonna light it up wanna change the world
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia

Kings of the sidewalk, John Wayne smooth
With curbside dreams shooting for the moon
Concrete hearts beat loud with burning truth
No ties, no fear we're living in the minute
We came, we saw, not stopping till we get it
Just love, just light, we'll start a revolution
In waves we crash, one voice

Making headlines just for kicks
Tryna get love not tryna get rich
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia
Not in it for the fame we do it for the thrill
Gonna light it up wanna change the world
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia

No ties, no fear we're living in the minute
We're coming up, not stopping cause we got this love
This light, come join the revolution this wave will crash

Making headlines just for kicks
Tryna get love not tryna get rich
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia
Not in it for the fame we do it for the thrill
Gonna light it up wanna change the world
We're the new bohemia
We're the new bohemia
