Life long summer's out
Touching all the nice spas
Destination overhall
The vintage fan's still heart
Midnight morning
Payback (suffering?)
Listen to the warning
I'm bringing you the (ice gel?)
Call to the masses
I know it's just a long shot
The most colourful senses
(.?)
Let's get down

Hot sensations
Ice cold energy
Calling all the stations
You might have got the remedy
Call to the masses
I know it's just a long shot
The most colourful senses
(.?)
Let's get down

Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down (Break down, break down)
Break it down (Break, break down)
Break it down (Break down, break down)
Break it down (Break, break down)
Break it down

Break down, break down; break, break down
