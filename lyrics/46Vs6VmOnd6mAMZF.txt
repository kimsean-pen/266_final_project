Just a little cold
But still you are standing out
I'm sitting with you now
Swear that I might leave the ground

Wish we were moving half speed
I want to feel you feel me

Why don't we forget all the distractions?
I should just be focusing on you
Why don't we just silence all the noise
And lower both our voices and talk slow? Yeah
Yeah, talk slow

Maybe we should go, I don't want a room so full
I want you to know just how special I see you

I wish we were moving half speed
I want to feel you feel me

Why don't we forget all the distractions?
I should just be focusing on you
Why don't we just silence all the noise
And lower both our voices and talk slow? Yeah
Yeah, talk slow

Oh, I never liked small talk
We can never get too deep
I don't see what's up
With only putting in our feet
Let's take all the walls off
'cause there's a lot of stars to see
I don't want anything but you right now

Why don't we forget all the distractions?
I should just be focusing on you
Why don't we just silence all the noise
And lower both our voices and talk slow? Yeah
Yeah, talk slow
