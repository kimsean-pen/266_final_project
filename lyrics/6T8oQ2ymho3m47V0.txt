Here she comes, mmmm just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

There she goes, no she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that
Should keep us apart, baby
I can't live without your love and affection

I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
I can't live without your love
Mmmm, your love
So I wait, mmmm never an answer

And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
But I can't go on living this way, baby
I've been on the outside looking in

Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize it's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah
I can't live without your love and affection

I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
I can't live without your love
For your love, I'd put my arms around you

For your love, I'd find the strength to tell you
For your love, that I can't live without your
Your

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
Baby
I can't live without your love and affection

I just can't go on this way anymore
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know you for sure
I can't live without your love
There she goes ouhh
I can't live without your love, baby
There she goes
I can't live without your love
There she goes
There she goes
I can't live without your love
