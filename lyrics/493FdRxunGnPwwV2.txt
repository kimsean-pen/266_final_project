Can't you hear me
Calling out for help?
My days are coming to an end

A constant disguise
Each step takes a new direction
Escapes the perception of my eyes
No exception cut your lies

Waking up by the lights
A sense of sustained surveillance
Vectors calling my desire
My conception devised

One answer in my mind
In my imagination
It's a passage to your life
That you've put aside

Can't you hear me
Calling out for help?
My days are coming to an end
Now that you've entered the maze

Can't you hear I'm
Crying in despair?
No one knows that I'm aware
And it's the end of your days

A digital maze
A global mass protection
Cryptic deception, mortal affection

One answer in my mind
In my imagination
It's a passage to my life
That you've put aside

Can't you hear me
Calling out for help?
My days are coming to an end
Now that you've entered the maze

Can't you hear I'm
Crying in despair?
No one knows that I'm aware
And it's the end of your days

One final wall among a multitude
A hundred pathways left to find

One final step towards my solitude
Like an echo in my mind

One answer in my mind
In my imagination
It's a passage to your life

Can't you hear me
Calling out for help?
My days are coming to an end
Now that you've entered the maze

Can't you hear I'm
Crying in despair?
No one knows that I'm aware
And it's the end of your days

Can't you hear me
Calling out for help?
My days are coming to an end
Now that you've entered the maze

Can't you hear I'm
Crying in despair?
No one knows that I'm aware
And it's the end of your days
