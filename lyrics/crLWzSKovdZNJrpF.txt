You waited for Saturday
You waited for my birthday
And most of us would probably
Expect even less than that
And I'm glad
You're not like us
And by us
I mean everyone in the world who isn't you

And all this time
I thought was mine
Your proximity made
When boredom comes
It won't be long
Before I sing to you
There's nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
To make my problems go away
Or to make me do the same

From the outside
My dealings
Pour me outside
But feeling
For an answer
Marble ceiling
Commence the healing
