I found love in the nearest of places
I knew that I would not let you go
It was summer and the rain was at bay
You came like the storm that washed me away

And if only love was this easy
I'd write a book about every time you kissed me
It was true, true, true love
I found peace in a world so cruel
You made me believe in something anew
You're my beginning, you're my life till the end
I'd never let you walk on by

And if only love was this easy
I'd write a book about every time you kissed me
It was true, true, true love
Oh, and it was real and new and true love
'Cause you made me believe in the world again
Oh, it was true, true true love
Oh, and it was real and new and true love

And, oh when you look at me
It makes me feel so strong
It makes me remember what it was like to be young
And, oh when you look at me
It makes me feel so strong
It makes me remember, remember that I am the one
