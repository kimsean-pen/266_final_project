Locked up I'm held so tight, this place is dark and dirty
I've been here too many times, my private purgatory
Cry out but no one answers, silence consumes my mind
Another morning after a truth I can't deny (a truth I can't deny)

When the stars are falling, and worlds collide
You feel like you won't survive
I'm bruised and broken, but I'm hanging on
As long as I am alive

You say I'm so deluded, you say that I am blind
You say that I will never seek the will I find
I say you'll never know me, you are no friend of mine
I'm gonna fuck you up and set your world on fire

When the stars are falling, and worlds collide
And you feel like you won't survive
I'm bruised and broken, but I'm hanging on
As long as I am alive

Stars are falling, and worlds collide
And you feel like you won't survive
I'm bruised and broken, but I'm hanging on
As long as I am alive

When the stars are falling, and worlds collide
You feel like you won't survive (feel like you won't survive)
I'm bruised and broken, but I'm hanging on
As long as I am alive
