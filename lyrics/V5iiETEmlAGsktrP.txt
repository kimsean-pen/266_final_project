When your reflection in the mirror smiles back
It lies, you know it
When you lay your head to sleep at night, it's filled with every moment
Every chance you missed to be something
Well, learn from your mistakes
You're not alone
You're with me
You're not alone
You're with me

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over
You're not alone anymore

When it feels like all is lost and there's no guide that's left to prove it
Take a look inside
Cherish your life and live before you lose it
You're all waiting for the answers
Keep on searching
Strength in numbers

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over
You're not alone anymore

At the end of the day
What will you choose?
Will you keep moving on or be forced to lose?
Look inside of yourself cause the power's in you
There is always hope
You're not alone
Anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over
You're not alone anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
Don't let the world bring you down
You're not alone
Don't let the world bring you down
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over
We're not alone anymore!
