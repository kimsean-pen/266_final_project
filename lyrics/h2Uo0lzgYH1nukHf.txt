Yall listening to this
But U ain't supposed to
Alright here we go
Now I know where I wanna be aye
Not a tree with the same leaves aye
More drama is a way to go
And u will know so just follow
I won't wait too long
I'm gone at the end of this song
Ain't no way to right your wrongs
But I know but I know
The fuck are U looking around
Close eyes and take the sounds
I ain't gonna watch U
I ain't never gonna watch U go
Why the fuck are U looking around
Close eyes and take the sounds
I ain't gonna watch U
I'll never watch U go why
The fuck are U looking around
Close eyes and take the sounds
I ain't gonna watch U
I ain't never gonna watch U go
Why the fuck are U looking around
Close eyes and take the sounds
I ain't gonna watch U
I'll never watch U go why
All the things that are new to me
The hell am I supposed to do baby
Can U look baby
Through
All the things in me
Hell am I supposed to do baby
Show me a safe way yeah
I don't see like I used to see
But damn I love the risk baby
do U baby
Through
All the things in me
Hell am I supposed to do baby
Show me a safe way yeah
You know now
why I been wondering
I want for U to forgive
all my wandering
Come with me to my wandering
I want for U to forgive
all my wandering
I ain't got time to think about
It's too much maybe
I'll spend the life
I have to keep it around
And it feels like true love baby
I ain't got time to think about
It's too much maybe
I'll spend the life
I have to keep it around
And it feels like true love baby
