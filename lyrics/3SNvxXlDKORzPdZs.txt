she was a nightcap poem queen
flighting furious
fancily through an alluring alliteration

ghostly smile, her silent steps
leaving scents and musk upon the sheets

the joyful rebellion, if we could only live for today
willfully floating, our limbs intertwine where we lay
arise from the ashes, our new lives spring from decay

tasted tongue in throes of the blinding bellows
before she bursts
lick lips within the blanket of darkness
burning shapes illuminate
her fingers curve down contoured perfection

euphoric resistance, if we could only live for today
soaring sensation, our limbs intertwine where we lay
arise from the ashes, our new lives spring from decay

our revolution is love
there is no revolution if you can't save yourself

the joyous rebellion, and now we only live for today
willfully floating, our limbs intertwine where we lay
didn't know to stay here with nothing but our hearts to obey

like morning peace
and we will dance arm in arm
amidst the crumbles of failed empires
and tired ideals, long dead from neglect
they will serve as our stage and solid foundation
