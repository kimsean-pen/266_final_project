I've feared the deepest darkest secrets
That live inside of me
Defeat and tragedy walking in shame
Finding nowhere to hide
I've thrown my bottles of guilt into the sea
Hoping the waves carry them away from me, oh

My heart is beating, I'll never stop fighting, I'll keep breathing
My heart is beating,
I'll never stop fighting, I'll keep breathing to stay alive

And here I go, off to make a change
I'm screaming, screaming revival

All of my strength, all of my might
Will go into this to take back my life
All of my strength, all of my might
Will go back into this to take back my life

My life, my life, my life
I'm taking back my life
My life, my life, my life
Taking back my life

Let's go!

This song is music to my ears
(This song is music)
And is a new production on an old stage
(On an old stage)

I won't dwell in unhappiness
(I will not dwell in)
Grasping humility
Asking forgiveness

Tomorrow is gone, I'll start living for today
I'll never stop the fighting and I'll take it all away
Tomorrow is gone, I'll start living for today
I'll never stop the fighting and I'll take it away
