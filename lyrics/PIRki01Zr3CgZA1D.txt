Cynthia's shame, I'm all in white
I lay down through the cyclone wild
Even though I don't really know you
I keep my head over my shoulder

Julie's place, after the corner
I grit my teeth, survey down Shannon
Calling for days, can't find a door
Keep it down, foot through the floor

Though I laid off
Though I laid off
And I blazed up
Well, I played up

Noon off my neck, I feel it calm
I'm standing it here like a burning house
Calling for days, can't find a door
Keep it down, foot through the floor

Though I laid off
Though I laid off
And I blazed up
Well, I played up
