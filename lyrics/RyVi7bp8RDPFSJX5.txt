I'm gonna wake you up early
Cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're going down to the auto shop
I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Get on the ride, no sweat sure
We'll take you anywhere you want me to

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, hang on tight
Third gear, ain't I right
Faster, it's all right

It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheel ride
We'll go on into the hills
Or anywhere you wanna decide

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, hang on tight
Third gear, ain't I right
Faster, it's all right

We'll ride some hills like a champ
Because my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turn
Lean with me, hang on tight
I think I'll put on the lights
So I can ride mine under the night

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, hang on tight
Third gear, ain't I right
Faster, it's all right

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, hang on tight
Third gear, ain't I right
Faster, it's all right
