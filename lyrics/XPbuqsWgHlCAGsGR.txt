I'll go back to Manhattan
As if nothing ever happened
When I cross that bridge
It'll be as if this don't exist

I've a prince who is waiting
And a kingdom downtown
I'll go back to Manhattan
As if nothing ever happened

We don't have to speak at all
I won't look in your eyes
And I won't have to fall
We don't have to speak at all

But Brooklyn holds you
And it holds my heart too
What a fool I was to think
I could live in both worlds

We don't have to speak at all
I won't look in your eyes
And I won't have to fall
We don't have to speak at all

I should go back to Manhattan
It's just a train ride away
I know nothing about leaving
But I know I should do it today
