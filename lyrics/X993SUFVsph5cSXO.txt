I feel happy, I feel sad
I feel like runnin' through the walls
I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided
I don't know who I am
Well, maybe I'm not perfect
At least I'm working on it
Twenty-two was like, the worst idea that I have ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom
What should I do with this

It's not the way you plan it
It's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
Hello cold world

Girls and boys keep lining up
To see if they can mesure up
But they look good and they feel wild
But it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
You can't just stay down on your knees
The revolution is outside

You wanna make a difference
Get out and go to get it
Whoa, get out and go to get it

It's such a cold, cold, world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold, world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
Hello cold world

Don't need my eyes open, wide
I just wanna feel something

It's such a cold, cold, world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold, world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
Spins around
Hello cold world
Hello cold world
