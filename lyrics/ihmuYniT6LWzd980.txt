As she parts her greying hair
Voices on the stair
When she turns there's something there
Like a nightmare from the past
To the sound of splintered glass
Dance the monsters in the mask
Man of steel
Man of steel
You just stood laughing in the rain
Have you killed her, someone said
As they drag you from your bed
Aah, kicking in your head
What kind of times are these
No-one hears no-one sees
As they drive you to your knees
Man of steel
Man of steel
Just standing in the rain
You just stood laughing in the rain
What kind of times are these
As they drive you to your knees
What kind of times are these
As they drive you to your knees
Dying on your knees
Dying in the rain
The rain
How can you laugh this one away?
Will you ever laugh this one away?
