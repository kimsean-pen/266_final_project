Oh, angel eyes, am I deceived

Or did you sigh?
For all I know you let you love light
Shine on me
Oh, angel eyes, you never close
Who's got the time?
Well, I can wait until your love light
Shine on me
Oh, angel eyes, on the wing
And open wide
No matter how high the moon
Shine down on me
Angel, angel eyes
Angel, angel eyes
Angel, angel eyes
