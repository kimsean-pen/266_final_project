Some kind of evidence
Some kind of reason
Why I can't find a way
To begin my life

Somewhere in this dying day
If I can only find a way for my escape
I find it hard to concentrate with all my past mistakes

To begin my life

I can't feel my faith can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights desolate highway

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall

With eyes wide open
I can't recall my crime I think I sealed my fate
I can watch my world evolve
Alone in our own way, I think I sealed my fate
Nothing left to die for
I can't recall my crime I think I sealed my fate
Thoughts inside can make me crawl
Think I sealed my fate
Make me drop down on my knees
Break me down until I question me
Darkness can't destroy my drive

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Welcome my downfall
Sun doesn't rise at all

Somewhere in this dying day as I plan my great escape
I find it hard to concentrate while you maintain control
I fold and falter, empty alter, all I gave I pray it makes me whole
I think the brink's around the corner
There's an error in my soul

I can't feel my faith can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights desolate highway

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall

I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
Damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Desolate highway
