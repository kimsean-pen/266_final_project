Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
And is it real or just something we think we know?
Where are we going now?
Where do we go?

Cause if it's the same as yesterday, you know I'm out, just so you know,
Because, because our paths they cross,
Yesterday was hard on all of us, on all of us,

Who can we trust from here?
Who can we trust?
And are you real or just something from wanderlust?
Who can you trust when ears we flower?
Who can you trust?

From cradle to grave, from ashes to ashes, from dust to dust,
Because, because our paths they cross,
Yesterday was hard on all of us, on all of us

Who can we trust from here?
Who can we trust?
And are you real or just something from wanderlust?
Who can you trust when ears we flower?
Who can you trust?

From cradle to grave, from ashes to ashes, from dust to dust,
Because, because our paths they cross,
Yesterday was hard on all of us, on all of us
