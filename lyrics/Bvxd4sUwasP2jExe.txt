Well I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thang
Well I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thang

She give me hard time in the day
A Hard time at night
She can be so sweet till she wanna
Fuss and fight

Till I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing
Well I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing

Ain't passing from the right
I'm, passing to the left
Burn this whole thing down
All, by myself

Till I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing
Till I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing

Well I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing
Well I'm numb
Yeah woman I can't feel a thing
