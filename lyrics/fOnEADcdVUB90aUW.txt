Ooohhhhhhhh
In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Ohhhh Ohhhhh
I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Ohhhh ohhhh
Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't, I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
In the heart
Of the night
Where is dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhhhh
