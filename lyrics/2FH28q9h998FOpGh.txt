Sever the tongues of the wretched
Eradicate the filth of the divine!

Ancient pariah cursed by the weak
encased in the flames
vengeance I now seek
Vengeance I seek!

Immortality awaits me for what I've become
my insanity my darkness within
the skies will burn
in the shadows of eternal sin!

You all will suffer
you will all rot the same
you all will suffer
you will all rot the same!

Despise humanity
slaughter relentlessly
despise humanity
slaughter relentlessly

False prophecies etched in bone
lost souls they enthrall
man and serpent entwined
now rise to conquer all!

Fallen figures born marked
their endless misery grows
the procurer of their darkened faith thrives
bear witness to their endless torment
the agony of the deprived!

Sever the tongues of the wretched
eradicate the filth of the divine.

Ancient pariah cursed by the weak
encased in the flames
vengeance I now seek!
vengeance I seek!

Let the blood of all humanity spill
erase this pathetic failure!
