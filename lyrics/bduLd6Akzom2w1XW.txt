I had a good job
And a good lovin' woman
But the world fell apart
And then I lost her
I can't bear to lose
I'll be over to fight
Can't drink enough whiskey
To make it all right

But the tide will turn
Cause I have learned

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

You say I drink too much
And that is a problem
But that's how it goes
When you hit rock bottom
Don't need your advice
Or your helping hand
Cause I'm living on the road
In a rock and roll band

The time will turn
And you will learn

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

The tide will turn (Yes it will) (Hey, hey)
I'm gonna roll on (Hey, hey)
I'm gonna stand strong (Hey, hey)
For the long haul (Hey, hey)
Its rock and roll

When the chips are down
You gotta make your play
'Cause there ain't no way (But the hard way)
There ain't no way (But the hard way)
I said there ain't no way (But the hard way)
Oh no there ain't no way
But the hard way

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it (Rock and roll)
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

There ain't no way but the hard way
No way but the hard way
No way but the hard way
So get used to it
The tide will turn
