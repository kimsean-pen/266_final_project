I can see you're somewhere far away
Caught in another place
Where nothings going right
Shouldn't worry about
The worst that could be
When you're here beside me
Don't look for troubled times
Now when everything is fine

So you need to feel the bad to see the good
And that's the thing you do
But don't let it spoil the view
Of what's around you

Chorus:
There's no rain, there's no storm
Though the blue sky makes you wonder
Don't you fear what will come
Will come
And right now we're in the sun
Sure enough, seasons change
But don't let today get lost
Cause today the sun's on us

Today the sun's on us

You're so restless
Underneath the surface
Don't you think I notice
It's something you can't hide
When you're fighting with the tide
But you're got to let it go
And just accept the things you can't control
Don't let your shadow spoil the view
Of what's around you

Chorus

The years go by
Stars will rise and fall
And you'll be by my side
Though it all

Chorus

Today, the sun's on us
