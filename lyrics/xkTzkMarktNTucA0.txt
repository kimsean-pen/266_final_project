All of my dreams have flown away
All of my ambition with the wind
Now you're here.
I never thought I would be satisfied
With anything I had
Now I'm not so sure.
I waited so long for you
Now you're here I don't know what to do
With you.

I went hunting for love
When I thought I'd lose.
I meant to shoot down a dove
Shot an angel instead.
And now she wakes up every day and she invites
All of my demons to play.

Fade in fade out like a musical
Rhythm and rhyme in time
Our heart beats sing
Just to remind you we're still alive in here.
I waited so long for you
Now you're here I don't know what to do
With you.

I went hunting for love
When I thought I'd lose.
I meant to shoot down a dove
Shot an angel instead.
And now she wakes up every day and she invites
All of my demons to play.
