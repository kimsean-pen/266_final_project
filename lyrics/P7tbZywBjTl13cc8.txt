I can't deny, I'm begging for attention
Dropping hints, hoping for some tension
Getting tired of making all this racket
Waiting on you to get your ass in here
I didn't want to be so invested
Played it cool and then I overdressed it
You were there, I was tired of this
Common sense when you pretend you don't

Get me Feel me Want me Like me Love me Need me

Tonight
You're fuel for my fire

You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I've tried Put your fuel to my fire

You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

In a minute I'll be hoping that you're outside

Another second you'll be walking on my wild side
You know I'm ready for anything to happen

Take this passion, turn it into action
Get me Feel me Want me Like me Love me Need me
Tonight
You're fuel for my fire
You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've tried Put your fuel to my fire
You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Right where I want you, back against the wall
Trust when I promise, never let you fall
Right where I want you, back against the wall
You can trust me I'll never let you fall
Tonight
You're fuel for my fire
You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've tried Put your fuel to my fire
You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight
You're fuel for my fire
You can't stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stop desire, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
