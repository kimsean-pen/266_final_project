A new place to drown
New place to drown
New place to drown

Well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Fuck! My mental health!
Went down the drain as well!
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell
You just swell, you just swell, you just swell

I start to lose control
Argh shit, now what have I done
I may have fucked away the only true one
The true girl under the sun
Piercing in and out of life, how you live it free
This tiny eye, it cannot see things
Simple lies and deceit
Yeah, they still live with me
Girl you [?]
Why'd you [?], girl

A new place to drown
New place to drown
New place to drown

See well, I might have found
A new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck! My mental health
Went down the drain aswell
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell
You just swell
