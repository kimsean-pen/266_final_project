Are you ready?

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
(A place inside my brain, another)
Kind of pain
You don't know the chances, I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Another place I find, to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
(A place inside my brain, another)
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances, I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I journey to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self esteem is low, how deep can I go, in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to, see through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind

I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind

I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
(Aaa)
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind
(Aaa)
I can't see, I can't see, I'm goin' blind

I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
