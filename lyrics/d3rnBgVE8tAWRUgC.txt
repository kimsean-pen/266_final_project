I was sailin' down here on the wind
When I met you and I fell away again
Like a train in reverse down a dark road
Carrying the whole load
Just rattling the whole way home

Have you fixed your eyes to the wind?
Will you let it pull you in again, on the way back in?
I'm a bit run down here at the moment
Let me think about it, babe
Let me hold you

There's a cold wind blowing down my old road
Down the backstreets where the pines grow
As the river splits the undertows
But I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't mind
Leave it hanging on the line
Lost inside my head
Is this the way I'll be denied, again?

So I'll set my eyes to the wind
But it won't be easy, to leave it all again
Just bit run down here on the scene
There's just a stranger living in me

As you set your eyes to the wind
And you see me pull away again
Haven't lost it on a friend
I'm just bit run down here at the moment
And I'm all alone here, living in darkness
