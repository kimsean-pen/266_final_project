Blazing up all night oh
不管有多无奈
一直等待无所谓
I'll be okay

我知道你只在乎虚伪的表面
I should let it go 但我一直在想念
You don't have to go far away 再看不见
Eh yeah yeah okay (I was real)

I told myself that I'll be okay (yeah)
无所谓每天擦干眼泪
All night 只剩下自己面对 ey
I'm on my own (on my own, on my own)
就说服自己 like

I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (good right now)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (it's good, it's good, it's good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (I feel good, I feel good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now
Good right now

Man my vision blurry
I know you're outta my zone girl
Me Captain, you are my ferry
Now sailing all alone girl
My life is blindfolded locked up in your shadows
Your life with me cropped out of the photos
Think I don't know
Girl, why'd you gotta be like this?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I tried to get you back
To do what it takes
But you turned your back on me, on me
Alright, alright, yeah
Told myself that I'll be okay
Don't worry
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now

I told myself that I'll be okay (yeah)
无所谓每天擦干眼泪
All night 只剩下自己面对 ey
I'm on my own (on my own, on my own)
就说服自己 like

I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (good right now)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (it's good, it's good, it's good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (I feel good, I feel good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now
Good right now

这感觉你不懂
那回忆我感动 (yeah)
但你没留下什么 我却一直在作梦
这感觉你不懂
那回忆我感动
I was only trying to be the one for you
Baby I was real

I told myself that I'll be okay (yeah)
无所谓每天擦干眼泪
All night 只剩下自己面对 ey
I'm on my own (on my own, on my own)
就说服自己 like

I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (good right now)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (it's good, it's good, it's good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now (I feel good, I feel good)
I'm feeling good right now
I'm feeling good right now
