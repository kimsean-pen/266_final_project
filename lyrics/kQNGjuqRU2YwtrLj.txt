His empty words, will melt in your hands,
In stolen skies, he says it ends,

So bless us all.
So bless us all.

I'm, I'm reading into, all his words,
They're timed and reckless,
But still they work.

In broken mirrors,
I reflect,
On all his words,
And how they end.

So bless us all.
So bless us all.

The thought is right,
The path is not,
He's lurking in the blind spot,
And for what, what, what.

So bless us all.
So bless us all.

So bless us all.

So bless us all.
