I wish I could rip out a page of my memory
'Cause I put too much energy in him and me
Can't wait till I get through this phase
'Cause it's killin' me
Too bad we can't re-write our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how its supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of (my energy)
Seems only like yesterday, Not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when you were with me
How could two be as one
And become to divided now
Theres no use hiding from memory(no)

Such a mystery when hes here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how its supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy (Oh, Yeah)
How do we reverse the chemistry (We gotta re-)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy (Energy)
Energy (Energy), my energy (Energy)
Taking all of

Now I can feel a change in me
And I can't afford to slip much further
From the person I meant to be (Whoo-oa)
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Not givin' up for movin' on
Before it gets too deep
'Cause you're takin' all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy (Oh)
How do we reverse the chemistry (Oh, Oh)
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

Energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy (Oh-Oh)
Energy, My energy (Taking all of me)
Taking all of
Ya killing me
Ya taking all of me yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
