Time flies, time crawls
Like an insect up and down the walls

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The conspiracy of silence ought
To revolutionize my thought

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The cold light of day pours out of me
Leaving me black and so healthy

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

It jerks out of me like blood
In this still life, heart beats up love

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me
