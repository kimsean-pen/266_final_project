Another summer coming to an end
And Im still walking on without a care
And even if the birds have flown, the sun has gone
Ill still be here

Oh I want to walk with kings
Oh and take a chance on things
And though I may give way to those who could cause me pain
And step aside to threats and bullies
I still believe, I still believe

Id rather go dreaming, believing in something, better than in me
Id rather die loving, lost in the feeling of letting go
Id rather die caring, working for something, seeing it as good
I can let it go, I can let it go

Theyre all flying flags and making noise
Bringing on their speeches drinks and boys
But when theyre gone Ill be standing here
And picking up the mess they left
I still believe, I still believe
