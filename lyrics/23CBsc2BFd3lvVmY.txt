When you look at the skies while you're so alone
Does for ellis (?) a spend me all the time (?)
Have you woke up hours connected with the sun
Of the shadows taking cover in the night
And the lines when you were pegger (?) so long
It was obvious he left it in the past
We were so close that I took comfort in the sounds
In the air of places that we hadn't found

Oh honey you're a sinner
We forget oh we forget oh we forget
So unwind slowly
And we drive our suspicions of the past
And we realize that we shouldn't couldn't last
On an impulse reaction
Or ideas on the future

So long
Got away, from everything, relating to
Impossible life
So long
