If I had a dime every time they said
(Girl) I think I'd have a million
But it wasn't mine it belonged to them
A negative opinion

On my own I had to learn it, learn it, learn it
On the radio oh, oh, oh
Heard a voice,
Yes I heard it, heard it, heard it
On the radio oh, oh, oh

It's your responsi-trannity
Don't forget, don't forget-get who you are
Yes it's true, true for all of you
We are all stars, we are all stars
Internet
Video
Television
Stereo
What you are is what you know
Heard it on the radio
When I close my eyes
Voices in my head sound more appealing
Constantly remind me of what he said
He said "don't stop believing"

On my own I had to learn it, learn it, learn it
On the radio oh, oh, oh
Heard a voice,
Yes I heard it, heard it, heard it
On the radio oh, oh, oh

It's your responsi-trannity
Don't forget, don't forget-get who you are
Yes it's true, true for all of you
We are all stars, we are all stars
Internet
Video
Television
Stereo
What you are is what you know
Heard it on the radio
In the middle of the night
In the middle of a dream
I woke up to the radio
And the message was loud
And the message was clear

Don't be a victim of what you don't know
Cause if the truth means something
It's all or nothing
Tell me what I need to know
Everything you are (on the radio)
Everything you know (on the radio)
It's your responsi-trannity
Don't forget, don't forget-get who you are
Yes it's true, true for all of you
We are all stars, we are all stars
