If I was wise, I would see
I'm a child still asleep
Listen to the guess you made
There are no separate things

If I was wise, I would see
I'm a child still asleep
Listen to the guess you made
There are no separate things

If I was wise, I would see
I'm a child still asleep
Listen to the guess you made
There are no separate things
With all the world still asleep
I would like not to be
Let belief fade away
It wasn't real anyway
