Every time I think of you
I got a shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
And it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind

There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And that's what nobody knows
Well, every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the word that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I feel like I never should
Whatever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be like we were yesterday

I'm not sure what this could mean
(Every time I see you falling)
I don't think you show me what you seem
(I get down on my knees and pray)
I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else
(I'm waiting for that final moment)
You'll never see like it was meant to be
(You'll say those things that I won't show)

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling
(I feel fine and I feel good)
I get down on my knees and pray
(I feel like I never should)
I'm waiting for that final moment
(Whatever I get this way I just don't know what to say)
You'll say the words that I can't say, I can't say
(Why can't we be like we were yesterday)

I feel fine and I feel good
(Every time I see you falling)
I feel like I never should
(I get down on my knees and pray, and pray)
I will say what you say
(I'm waiting for that final moment)
Why can't we be like we were yesterday
(You'll say the words that I can't say)

You'll say the words that I can't say
You'll say the words that I can't say
You'll say the words that I can't say
You'll say the words that I can't say
