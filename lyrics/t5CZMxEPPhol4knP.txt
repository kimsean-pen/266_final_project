As it all falls down, do I walk away?
Or do I stand my ground and accept my fate?
And there's the faceless cries that twist my every dream
And almost every night I hear the demon sing

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

Happiness is found in the darkest ways
And as I searched around, I knew nothing but mistakes
And there's the faceless cries that twist my every dream
And almost every night I hear the demon sing

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

And when you scream, you push me so much further 'head
And when I leave, I always walk right back again
And when you cry, the tears are cleansing bitterness
I'm out of time, I'm slowly dying, give me back my life

Just give me back my life
Just give me back my life
Just give me back my life

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

As it all falls down, do I walk away?
Or do I stand my ground? There's nothing left to say
