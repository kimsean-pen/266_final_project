Once upon history
Man created his own dieties
Trust in divinities
Kept enlightenment upon mysteries
Behave through mythos
Fictive idolatry
Faith and praise for those still left unseen
Searching veracity
Myths dominate prophetically
Behave through mythos
Mortal perplexity
Mind emprisoned in credulity
Mental intricacy
Truth being revealed through fake entities
Behave through mythos

Pure rationality
Man's self-edified supremacy
Senseless reality
Mind-constructed tales praised slavishly
Behave through mythos
Fictive idolatry
Man's self-edified supremacy
Searching veracity
Truth being revealed through fake entities
Chaotic nought
Reigns silently
Upon an-ki
Chaos being solved
As mortal kneels
Light shall be brought... thy mighty beings
