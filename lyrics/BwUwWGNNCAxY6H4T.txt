Don't even think about reachin' me
I won't be home
Don't even think about stoppin' by
Don't think of me at all

I did, what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you

Don't even think about gettin' inside
Voices in my head
Oh, voices
I got scratches, all over my arms

One for each day, since I fell apart
I did, what I had to do

And if there was a reason, it was you, oh
Footsteps in the hole, it was you, you
Oh oh

Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you
I did, what I had to do
And if there was a reason
There wasn't no reason, no
And if there's something you'd like to do
Oh, just let me continue
To blame you, oh oh
Footsteps in the hole, it was you, you
Oh oh
Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you
