I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty-two now, but I won't be for long
People ask me when will I grow up to understand
Why the girls I knew at school are already pushing prams

I loved you then as I love you still
Though I put you on a pedestal, you put me on the pill
I don't feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about letting you know

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was bloody yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you need a friend

I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them, but they were only satellites
It's wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

My dreams were full of strange ideas
My mind was set despite the fears
But other things got in the way
I never asked that boy to stay

Once upon a time at home
I sat beside the telephone
Waiting for someone to pull me through
When at last it didn't ring, I knew it wasn't you

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl
Girl, girl, girl
