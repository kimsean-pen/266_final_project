I've been waiting for to long
Everyday fades into the past
Uninvited yet so strong
It's you who stay the same

Drown me
Make me fall into the sea
Hold me down until I can breath
Wake me up beneath the sun

It finds us
It's in our side

I've been staying far too long
Everything chain is as I wake
Wandering alone our God
To you, paved the way

Drown me
Make me fall into the sea
Hold me down until I can breath
Break me up beneath the sun
