She's an underdog, lives next door to me
She's always heard, you won't amount to anything
And it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes
Tragic the way people pass her by but now I realize

That everyone sees her but nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow for a better tomorrow
She hates it but she takes it, watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

She's original, never trying to fit in
She's got a way to always go against the grain
Oh yeah, someday they'll see how beautiful she really is
I know the last will be the first, the tables gonna turn

'Cause everyone sees her but nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow for a better tomorrow
She hates it but she fakes it, watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

Maybe she'll be in a movie
Maybe she'll be in a song, yeah
Better pay her some attention
Before she's gone

She's an underdog, yeah
She means the world to me, yeah

Everyone sees her but nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow for a better tomorrow
She hates it but she makes it, watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world

And everyone sees her but nobody knows her
She screams in her pillow for a better tomorrow
She hates it but she makes it, watch out for that girl
One day she may change the world
