Un, duex, trois, quatre!
Hello today, 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, God and Buddha love me too
Hello Monsieur, c'est la vie regret no more
These boots that show, only walk
Only walk away from you
Hello today 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, God and Buddha love me too
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Then yesterday, the ghost is screaming in my brain (he said)
I'm passing through to count the bad things that you do
I'm getting free, rip the stitches out with me
Then baby blue, I'll only walk
Only walk, away from you
Hello today 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, God and Buddha love me too
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(Instrumental)
Hello today 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, God and Buddha love me too
Hello today 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, God and Buddha love me too
Hello today 'cause I got heaven in my veins
Tomorrow's new, 'cause God and Buddha love me too
