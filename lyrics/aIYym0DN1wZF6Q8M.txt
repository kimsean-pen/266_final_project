Close the door, shut the world away
All the fight's gone from this wounded heart
Across the floor, dreams and shadows play
Like wind blown refugees

Call the man who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world of hearts in need of care
Shine a light ahead when the next step is unclear
Call the man, he's needed here

I close my eyes, I remember when
Your sweet love filled this empty room
The tears I cry won't bring it back again
Unless the lonely star should fall

Call the man who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world of hearts in need of care
Shine a light ahead when the next step is unclear
Call the man, he's needed here

Needed in the chaos and confusion
From the plains to city hall
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall

Call the man who deals in once upon a time
Maybe he can mend this broken heart of mine
Shine a light ahead, now the future isn't clear
Call the man, he's needed here
Call the man, he's needed here

He's needed here
Right here right now, yeah, yeah, yeah
He's needed here, right here
Call the man, yeah, yeah, yeah
He's needed here
Right here
He's needed here, right here right now, yeah
