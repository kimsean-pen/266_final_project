Down in my valley
Are vultures like lovers
That search for
That something
To hold on to

Maybe
Its crazy
That I hope for
Something more
The first in the world to teach, keep
Walk without you baby

Do you
Hold my
baby
When I'm still
And sometimes
We can't see
What we're meant to do

If I have kids don't
Remember
Those nothings
From our heart
That quickly
Exploded
