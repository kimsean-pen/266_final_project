I laid the night before me
Unraveled the tangles of my heart
All I felt
Was stale hollow air
These streams of uncertainty
They are collapsing
Upon my mind
Upon my mind

Torrents, torrents fill
My veins until I
I burst, I burst with
Mistaken guilt and shame
My battered bones try to keep
Fighting against this endless
This ocean of
Of self defeat

As time goes on some months are yet to pass
As time goes on some months are yet to pass
As time goes on
Some months are yet
Are yet to pass

Let's go!

Puddles, puddles of ink
Surround this tired chair
All of my, of my
Sorrow has been spilled
Into, into my
My reflection
