Take me down from the ridge where the summer ends
Watch the city spread out just like a jet's flame
I've got a secret for you, I cut your angel in two
I left her bleeding and soaked it with a dry sponge
No life has singed her now
No life has singed her now

No life has singed her now
No life has singed her now
I can see it fade

We've got a license to live, it's our only one
If it expires we float up to the dust haze
I've got a picture of you, i cut your angel in two
I saw her spinning and dripping on your new dress
No life has singed her now
No life has singed her now
No life has singed her now
No life has singed her now
I can see it fade
