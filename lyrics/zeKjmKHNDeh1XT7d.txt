We take it easy, tigers in a cage
We're pacing on our pads and waiting
For the town to come in revelry
Our lazy bones ache for a tearing

You can't hold on to the thrill
So I hope you find your will to follow through
What we invented I am now ending

Hold on to who you love
We have triumphed on like doves since we were young
What we invented I am now ending

The closest thing we had to royalty
A chance to break our parents patterns
You chose to keep your teenage tragedy
In lieu of a romantic palace

Play tender like a newborn baby would
Play tender till the night is over
I'm leaving you to nurse your cherished wounds
And cover it just like your lover, yeah

You can't hold on to the thrill
So I hope you find your will to follow through
What we invented I am now ending

Hold on to who you love
We have triumphed on like doves since we were young
What we invented I am now ending

I can't hold on to the thrill
So I hope you find your will to follow through
What we invented I am now ending

Hold on to who you love
We have triumphed on like doves since we were young
The morning's over, the day is in full swing

I know you're busy
But please, won't you come visit me?
You are an aimless ghost
You have your bag of bones

Now I won't mess with your vision
Sitting in your kitchen while you sleep tonight
You would eat young and you would act surprised

You can't hold on to the thrill
So I hope you find your will to follow through
What we invented I am now ending

Hold on to who you love
We have triumphed on like doves since we were young
What we invented I am now ending

I can't hold on to the thrill
So I hope you find your will to follow through
What we invented I am now ending

Hold on to who you love
We have triumphed on like doves since we were young
The morning's over, the day is in full swing
