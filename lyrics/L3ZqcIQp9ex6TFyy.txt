The sky is not blue in Homer's Odyssey.
The sea is not blue. There's a wine dark sea.
She is reading on a night train.
On an night train, on a night train
She is reading on a night train.
On an night train, on a night train

Devoid of color
Devoid of color
And she sees the same,
Reading on a night train

There is no blue color in Homer's Iliad
The world is murky, muddy,
Black, white and grey
She sees the same
The same, oh the same
She sees the same
The same, oh the same

Devoid of color
Devoid of color
And she sees the same,
Reading on a night train
Devoid of color
Devoid of color
And she sees the same,
Reading on a night train
