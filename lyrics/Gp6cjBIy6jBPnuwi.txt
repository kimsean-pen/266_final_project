If you say that you are free,
come out and be it here with me,
come out and be it here with me...

If you feel like having fun,
you can say no one till you've done time with me.

If we say nothing's going on,
we can be walking in the sun,
we could be walking in the sun,
like an ember growing to a flame.
You could be living in the same hole as me...
