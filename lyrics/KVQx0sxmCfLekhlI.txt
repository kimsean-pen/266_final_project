A world without you here
An unreflecting mirror
His words were so sincere
He left you standing there

Oh, I'll never let you down
While I'm still around

His words were never meant
Your one last tear's been spent
You'll never be content
In a world as big as this

Oh, I'll never let you down
While I'm still around

When you were lost, who was it who found you

Oh, I'll never let you down
While I'm still around
Oh, you've just been found
Oh, I'll never let you down
