In those days we were lions
In those days we were kings
It's not one thing or the othere
It's all things all at once

I will love you better than him
I will love you better than him
I will love you better than him
I will love you better than him
Oooh
These wings ain't for flying
These wings are just for show
It's years since I've been flying

I'm down to the earth
I will love you better than him
I will love you better than him
I will love you better than him

I will love you better than him
Oooh
In those days we were lions
In those days we were kings.
