I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lu-lu-lungs

Say, yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We can stay young forever (yeah)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh

You cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful? Do you wanna? Yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet

'Cause I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead

Say, yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lu-lu-lungs

Say, yeah (yeah)
Let's be alone together (yeah)
We can stay young forever (yeah)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh-oh-oh

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken

We'll stay young, yo-yo-young

I-I-I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
