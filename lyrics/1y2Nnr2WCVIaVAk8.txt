If you go looking for hot water
Don't act shocked when you get burned a little bit
If you really want some hot water
I can help you find it

Oh... oh
Ah, yeah

Well, if they catch me around you
playing "Rock the Boat", I'm gonna catch hell
And if you're throwing your voice in
bed singing a note, I'm gonna catch hell
I know it

Guess what
Try and catch me

Tricky, tricky
Yeah
Oh... oh

If you're getting tricky lying to yourself, you're gonna catch hell
And if you're testing God and lying
to his face, you're gonna catch hell
C'mon

Hey, that's it
They're gonna catch you
Yeah, they're gonna catch you

Easy
