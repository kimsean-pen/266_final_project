I know he's blood
But you can still turn him away
You don't owe him anything

Do you go to the dungeon
To find out how to make peace
With your days in the dungeon?
Writing a letter to you
Didn't make me feel any more peaceful
Than how I felt when we weren't speaking
Because I didn't cop to what I did
I can't love you because we're supposed to have professional boundaries
I'd like you to be schooled and in awe
As though you were kissed by God full on the lips

I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you, see you close up

Slid into the ditch
I have this overwhelming loss of ambition
We said let's name thirty good reasons
Why we shouldn't be together
I started by saying things like 'you smoke' 'you live in New Jersey'
You started saying things like 'you belong to the world'
All of which could have been easily refuted
But the conversation was hypothetical
I am totally short of breath for you
Why can't you shut your stuff off?

I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you, see you close up

For a while I'm speaking
You know how much you hate to be interrupted
Maybe spend some time alone
Fill up your proverbial cup
So that it doesn't always have to be about you
I've been wanting your undivided attention
I like the fact that you're nothing like me
Are you not burdened by the lack of perspective people
Have of your charmed life (seemingly)?

I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you, see you close up

Hey I'm not mad at you guardian
I'm mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your Jekyll and Hyde-ness
I'm glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist
You laughed a wicked laugh and said 'come here let me clip your wings'
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you don't owe him anything)

'Raise the roof' he yelled 'yeah raise the roof' I yelled back
(Unfortunately you need a health scare to re-prioritize)
No thanks to the soap box
Having me rile against them won't make an ounce of difference

I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you, see you close up
