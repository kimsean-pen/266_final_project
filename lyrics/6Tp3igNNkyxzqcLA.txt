Ahem
Yeah

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
Screaming words with no remorse
Pitchforks pointed at my heart
I was staring at the sky

Run from your pain!
Run from your pain!
Run from your pain!
Run from your pain!

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
