The world is too heavy
too big for my shoulders
come take the weight off me, now.

Thousands of answers
for one simple question
come take the weight off me, now.

I'm like a kid who just won't let it go
Twisting and turning the colours in rows
I'm so intent to find that's what it is.
This is my Rubik's Cube
i know i can't figure it out.

We're lost in the playground
Late night nostalgia
open the sky for me, now.

Friends round the fire
Outside in December
Open the sky for me now.

I'm like a kid who just won't let it go
Twisting and turning the colours in rows
I'm so intent to find thats what it is.
This is my Rubik's Cube
i know i can't figure it out.

Credits roll over
the edge of the horizons
but I haven't discovered yet.
I'm like a kid who just won't let it go
Twisting and turning the colours in rows
I'm so intent to find thats what it is.
This is my Rubik's Cube
i know I can't figure it out.
