Step out from the setting sun
You might be my holy one
Penetrate my peaceful lie
You're my perfect alibi
Your silhouette against the sound
Underneath you there's no ground
Beneath you there's no ground

Slipping inside desire
You tell me everything
Staring into your fire and all I ever see is me
There's nowhere left but time
And all I ever see is me
And all I see is me

Climbing out to the edge of two worlds
All the life in me felt so still
Face to face against my own will
Screaming over my shoulder to you
Crying out so I had one choice
But I still couldn't find my voice

Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Hanging on to the edge of two worlds

Slipping inside desire
You tell me everything
Staring into your fire, it's all I ever see in me
You're all I see in me

Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Hanging on to the edge of two worlds

I wasn't pretending just telegraphing my ending
Just telegraphing my ending to you
I wasn't pretending
I wasn't pretending

Climbing out to the edge of two worlds
All the life in me felt so still
Face to face against my own will
Screaming over my shoulder to you
Crying I saw I had one choice
But I still couldn't find my voice

I need more than just a rush
For me to not feel dying more than I feel the living
Oh because of this instant with you
The death of youth suspends itself
Suspends itself

Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Hanging on to the edge of two worlds
Telegraphed my ending to you
Telegraphed my ending to you
Telegraphed my ending to you
Telegraphed my ending to you
Celebrate my ending with you
Celebrate my ending with you
Celebrate my ending with you
Celebrate my ending with you
