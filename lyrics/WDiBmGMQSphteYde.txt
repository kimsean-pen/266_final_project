I was watching with one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people tellin' me to move
I got movin' on my mind
I found shelter in some thoughts turning wheels around
I said thirty nine times that I love you to the beauty I had found

Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I've been thinking, of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'till we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stompin' our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry 'bout locking the door

Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly, for me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough, and I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married, in a big cathedral by a priest
Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say "I do" at least

Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's four, five, six, seven
Grab your umbrella and grab hold of me 'cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy
