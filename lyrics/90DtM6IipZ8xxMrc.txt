A state of mind, without pain
In this world of luminous dreams
Unaware of what the future brings
This world; the most serene thing

Visions bear impending salvation
Creating faith that will deceive
Reality, crueler than
Ever imagined
Our inner light to be bereaved

Innocence tainted
When touched by reality
Pure souls corrupted
A result of mortality
