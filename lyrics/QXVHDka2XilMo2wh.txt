I found the phone
I must've missed your message
You got it wrong
It wasn't what your friend said
Tell by your tone
I've taken it too far again.
Just when I thought I'd gone and fixed it all again.

Your friends are telling you, you gotta move on.
Just when I thought I'd gone and wrecked it all again.
You turned around so I could tell you what took so long.
I don't know why I ever waited to say.
'Cause I'm just dying just to see you again .

Instead of holding you, I was holding out.
I should've let you in, but I let you down.
You were the first to give; I was the first to ask.
Now I'm in second place, to get a second chance.

I should've known, that you were not for granted
Gotta let you know, I was never underhanded.
Tell by your tone, I've taken it too far again.

My last mistake, putting my friends first.
I tried to laugh it off but I made things worse.
You were the first to give; I was the first to ask.
Now I'm in second place, to get a second chance.

What you give is always what you get.
There's so much I haven't given yet.
If you could give another second chance.
