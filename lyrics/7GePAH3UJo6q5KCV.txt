Sometimes I need the fuel I drain from you
That lasting dose turns cold and blue
I've died before so many times
In time reborn, in time I'll find

That everlasting glow that blinds my view
My apathy turns thru and thru
This war inside has drained my will
Those things I've done were overkill

I've felt the pain of a brutal war
I feel the pain of a lasting war
