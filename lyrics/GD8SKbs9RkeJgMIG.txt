You've got heart and it's painted on you
And I can see all the false yous
I see through all that they do
And I'm brave when my words are curving
But I don't see me in my eyes anymore
Haven't seen him since that turn

I cannot move in forever, I stand
On the feet of my drunkenness
I am my father's man
How you even look in forever?
'Cause I can't
No I'm six gin and tonics down
Baby, I can hardly stand
No, I can hardly stand

I've got soul, but it's weak, it's aching
For I've been burnt one too many times
Haven't said the right lines
So I smile and say you make me happy
But don't think there's length to my subtlety
I've been dying for some sleep

I cannot move in forever, I stand
On the feet of my drunkenness
I am my father's man
How you even look in forever?
'Cause I can't
No, I'm six gin and tonics down
Baby, I can hardly stand
No, I can hardly stand

I live and I learn and I try to pretend
That one day, I might be wiser than my sins
I live and I learn, let the hope sink in
That one day
I might be wiser than my sin, than my sin
Than my sin

I cannot move in forever, I stand
On the feet of my drunkenness
I am my father's man
How you even look in forever?
'Cause I can't
No, I'm six gin and tonics down
Baby, I can hardly stand
No, I can hardly stand
