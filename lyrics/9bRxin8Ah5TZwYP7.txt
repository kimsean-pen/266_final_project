Before the dawn
We all have died
May the dark be a sovereign
And midnight lied
We praise a lot for
All the pale lunar light
The sun has gone
Beyond the skies
Days have come to the final end
The more we hide
We raise a sword to
Glory bound side my side

Let there be light
God bless the father and son
Let there be light
And day be gone
Let there be gone
The mass of dark has begon
Let there be light
And damned the sun

Before the throne
We all declined
May the moon be your saviour
And twilight hide
We roaming dead for
God we drink senguent wine
The fathers call
Across the sky
Rais your cup to the fallen saints
At dawn we die
Back raised and ride on
Dawn the dusk be our guide

Let there be light
God bless the father and son
Let there be light
And day be gone
Let there be gone
The mass of dark has begon
Let there be light
And damned the sun

Let there be light
God bless the father and son
Let there be light
And day be gone
Let there be gone
The mass of dark has begon
Let there be light
And damned the sun
