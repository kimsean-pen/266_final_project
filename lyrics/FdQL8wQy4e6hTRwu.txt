When I get home
And you're lying there
Crying in the bedroom
I know I've let you down
And the makeup
I didn't notice running down your face
Showing my mistakes
I'm always angry
I live with pain
You're going crazy, 'cause
I don't know how to explain

And we both know
It's plain to see
You're better off without me

Fill your glass up 'till it overflows
You just wanna talk
I don't wanna know
Like a street dog
Who's never had a home
I don't know how to live here
I don't know how to not feel alone
You give me so much love
I give you trouble
All that you've gone and built
I only turn to rubble

Now we both know
It's plain to see
You're better off without me

Woah
Yeah
My, oh, my

I don't know, I don't know why
You and I we can't survive
I don't know, I don't know why
You and I we can't
You give me so much love
I give you heartache
I know you're not giving up
'Cause giving up is not your way

But we both know
It's plain to see
You're better off without me

We both know
It's plain to see
You're better off without me
