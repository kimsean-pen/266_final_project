Can I have it all
The sound of little feet
The calm of the retreat
The mould and the complete

Can I have it all
The longing and the tears
The regrets and the repairs
The truth when the air clears

Can I have it all

Can I have it all
The whole and the remains
The freedom and the chains
The mountains and the planes

Can I have it all
The hunger and the dissent
The drunk and the content
The joy and the lament

Can I have it all

In the distance there's a rumble
Can you feel it
Is anybody out there
In the distance there's a rumble
Can you feel it

Can I have it all
The nasty and the clean
The worker and the queen
And everything in between

Can I have it all
The morbid and the sweet
The vulgar and discreet
The rubato and the beat

Can I have it all

In the distance there's a rumble
Can you feel it
Is anybody out there
In the distance there's a rumble
Can you feel it
Is anybody out there
