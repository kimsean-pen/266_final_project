Even if you run
I will find you

I decided I want you
Now I know
I need

If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought
Keep in mind
I am with you
Never left out fate, can't concentrate

Even if you run
You will be mine
Oh, fucking you will be mine
Oh, fucking you will be mine

Oh, fucking you will be mine
I found you
Leaning out of an open window
You laughed, our fingers clenched

Too perfect, far too careless
I couldn't help myself I just took you
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake

Damn it man I knew it was a mistake
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake

(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake

(You brought it outta me) Mistake
Better make yourself at home
You're here to stay
You won't bother me

If you let me bother you
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut
Keep in mind
I watch you

Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker
Even if you run
What the fuck is different, man?
I can't believe I'm doing this

What the fuck is different, man?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different, man?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different, man?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doing this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doing this
Man I knew it was a mistake.
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake
Damn it man I knew it was a mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me) Mistake
(You brought it outta me)
