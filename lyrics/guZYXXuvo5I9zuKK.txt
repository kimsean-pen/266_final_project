I feel soon I will sink into you
What do you think
There's still blood in your hair
Got the bruise of the year

But there's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her shade tonight

I hate your tattoos
You have weak wrists
But I'll keep you

'Cause there's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her shade tonight

And it's too bad
And it's too bad
And it's too bad
You're married to me
