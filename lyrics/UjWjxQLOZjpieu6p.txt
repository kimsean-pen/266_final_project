We're holding on, to fantasies
Of places that, we've never been before
Don't fade away

I stay awake, every night
Cause all these dreams, tearing me apart
Please fade away

I see the fire in your eyes
I'm mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

I see the fire in your eyes
I'm mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

Reminder of reality
Facelessness, the things that we've become
Please fade away

The lessons learnt
Traditions kept
Denial of, the seamless interest
Don't fade away

I see the fire that's in your eyes
Im mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

I see the fire that's in your eyes
I'm mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

I see the fire in your eyes
I'm mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

I see the fire in your eyes
I'm mesmerised
I cannot break your spell

Shut down your system
Shut down your system
Shut down your system
Shut down your system
