I don't know who you are
I don't know your name
But if you want to live
Ah, you better learn the game

Don't know why you're here
Don't see your face so far
If you don't want to fail
You better hide the scars

Make a poor man cry, the way you run your life
Make a poor man laugh, the way you run your wife

Time you hit the road
Better be on your way
Don't scream, don't shout
Three strikes and you'll be out

It's a shame, I know
No chance to see the show
Fear the man, kill the snitch
Just remember life's a bitch

I don't know what you've got
I don't know your mom
But if you like your life
Then don't act dumb

I don't know where you go
And I sure don't care
If you don't want to starve
You better get your share

Make a grown man sick, the way you run your mouth
Make a grown man shake, the way you're running out

Time to hit the skids
Better be on your way
Don't shout, don't scream
Three strikes and they be mean

A shame, you're right
No chance to see the fight
Be a man, fix the glitch
Just remember life's a bitch

I don't know what you see
I don't know the score
But if you don't like blood
You better close the door

I don't know how you think
Don't want to hear your tale
And if you talk too much
You're gonna land in jail

Make a tall man short to see you act this way
Make a short man puke, the way you waste the day

Time to go to Hell
Better be on your way
Don't moan, don't pout
Three strikes take your ass out

Oh no, bad news
No chance to shine your shoes
Fear the sky, eat the rich
Just remember life's a bitch
