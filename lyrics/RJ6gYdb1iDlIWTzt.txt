Would you go
If they came
Open arms

Maybe R.I.P. humans
Tears for animals animals animals
And nature
Did you ever feel an alien
What's your blood type
Is it delicate as night
Imagine my father did feel feel feel feel
Feel feel me
I was R.I.P. R.I.P.

Would you go
If they came
Open arms

My love letters
My father did me nature
Nature nature nature
I was one year passed three
Maybe nature
