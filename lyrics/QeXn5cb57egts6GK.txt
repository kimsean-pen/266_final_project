We got the classic image
We got the glossy finish
Bringing back all that good shit
Our love is vintage, uh huh
We're driving through the moonlight
Touching you just like you like
Every kiss is timeless
Our love is vintage, uh huh

In a fast car on a late night
And I'm staring at your jawline
You're killing me slowly
(You're killing me slowly)
Now you lean me on the sofa
In a cloud of marijuana
You're getting to know me

I need someone to love me right
Who will give me peace of mind
Who gon' be there day and night
Alright, uh huh

We got the classic image
We got the glossy finish
Bringing back all that good shit
Our love is vintage, uh huh
We're driving through the moonlight
Touching you just like you like
Every kiss is timeless
Our love is vintage, uh huh
Our love is vintage, uh huh
Our love is vintage, uh huh

Feel the bassline on the speaker
And my waistline on your fingers
You're killing me slowly
(You're killing me slowly) Uh huh
Now we're dancing on the border
So romantic, pull me closer
And right there you told me, uh huh

You need someone to love you right
Who will give you peace of mind
Who gon' be there day and night
Well alright, uh huh

Who's gon' be there day and night
