the dogs died
in the park last night
nothing we could do
there's nothing we could do

let the bees go hunt for honey
there's nothing we could do
there's nothing we could do

oh but praise them

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

let it ring through the arch of my skull
let it breathe through the teeth of all of these people
there's nothing we could do
there's nothing we could do

oh but praise them

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door

oh Elk Blood Heart
tastes like the Great White North
and I hope you found
that i hold all the keys to open up
every single door
