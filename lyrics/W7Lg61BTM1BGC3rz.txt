Opinions unbiased, shut up and be quiet
I'm trying to make you understand
This is what you're up against
Powerful, powerless
Leaving with the upset
Here to stay by the way I turned it around
In a room full of mirrors I figured it out

I had to take leave of my senses
To call my own conclusion
Had to swing for the fences
To find my own solution
In a world gone mad, it's all so sad
Look what we've become
Welcome to the age of the new revolution

Evolve, evolve
Revolution
Evolve, evolve
Evolve, evolve

Itching to fight it so bring on the riot
Cause we're all invited to the dance
Raise a glass now for the damned
Terrorize, terrified
Praying for your fucking life
Wide awake, dominate
I figured it out
In a room full of mirrors there's only one way out

I had to take leave of my senses
To call my own conclusion
Had to swing for the fences
To find my own solution
In a world gone mad, it's all so sad
Look what we've become
Welcome to the age of the new revolution

Evolve, evolve

Evolve, evolve

I had to take, had to take leave of my senses
To call my own conclusion
Had to swing for the fences
To find my own solution
In a world gone mad, it's all so sad
Look what we've become
Welcome to the age of the new revolution
