The world around me
Is lost in misery
The only good I've got in my life is you
No meaning, no other reason
When everything feels wrong I feel right with you
So madly, desperate, deeply, obsessed your love is better than life to me
Can I have this moment forever?
Take me to the beginning

You are what I believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth
In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?
When I'm down on my knees

You are what I believe

When we started, wholehearted
I never needed anything or anyone else
I was broken, you made me whole again
The only one I trusted more than myself
So madly, desperate, deeply, I will live for you completely

Can I have this moment forever?
Take me to the beginning

You are what I believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth

In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me save tonight?
When I'm down on my knees

You are what I believe
Believe in your love
Believe in your life
Believe that you can put me back together on the inside
Chase all the fear away
Every time I speak your name
Take me
You are what I believe
You are what I believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth
In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?
When I'm down on my knees
You are what I believe
