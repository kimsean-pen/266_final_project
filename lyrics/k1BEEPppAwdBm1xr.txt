Sun through the blinds
The heat comes down
Wish you were mine
What can I do?

Gotta be real
Gotta be true
I'm going crazy
Can't see the world
I'm walking through
It's all about you

Gotta be real
Gotta be true
I'm going crazy
Can't see the world
I'm walking through
It's all about you

Ouhhh ouhh

I've got to say
I love you
I miss you so bad
What can I do?

Gotta be real
Gotta be true
I'm going crazy
Can't see the world
I'm walking through
It's all about you

Gotta be real
Gotta be true
I'm going crazy
Can't see the world
I'm walking through
It's all about you

Gotta be real
Gotta be true
I'm going crazy
Can't see the world
I'm walking through
It's all about you

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
