Ah come on!
I can't believe
The drama that I'm in
The flood is getting closer
I don't think they know that I know how to swim

Your feeling numb, from all that has become.
It leaves your gums, slips down your tongue
and travels fast down towards your lungs.
All because I'm... (leaving you behind)
I feel the pressure
it's coming down on me

It's turning me black and blue.
(Ooh whoa)
You left me on the side of the road (side of the road!)
and now I've got no place to go.
You brought the flood.

I can't believe
The troubles that you've caused
The pain is getting stronger
like an open wound without the gauze.
It's on my brain, driving me insane.

It's on my mind all of the time and if it left I would be fine

All because I'm... (leaving you behind)
I feel the pressure

it's coming down on me.
It's turning me black and blue.
Ooh whoa
You left me on the side of the road (side of the road)
and now I've got no place to go.
You brought the flood!
Oh!
Leaving me!

Ah!
Oh!
I take it back, (take it back!)
Leaving me!
I take it back, (take it back!)

Leaving me!
Leaving me!
Leaving me!
I feel the pressure
it's coming down on me.

It's turning me black and blue.
Ooh whoa
You left me on the side of the road (side of the road)
and now I've got no place to go.
You brought the flood!
I feel the pressure
it's coming down on me.
It's turning me black and blue.
Ooh whoa
You left me on the side of the road (side of the road)
and now I've got no place to go.
You brought the flood!
I take it back, (take it back!)
Leaving me!
I take it back, (take it back!)
Leaving me!
Leaving me!
Leaving me!
