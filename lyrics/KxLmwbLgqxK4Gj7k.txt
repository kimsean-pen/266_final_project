Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

And I'll be yours to keep
Wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep
Wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep

Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

And I'll be yours to keep
Wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep
Wind in the shadows, whale song

Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart

Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Girl show me heart
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Girl show me heart
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Darling I feel you, under my body
Darling you're with me, forever and always
Give me shelter, or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
