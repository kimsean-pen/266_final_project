This party, and so are you
It's our house at long and it is our home.
Baby, lost in the music,
We go on, it's long, when the beat is strong.

And the beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.
The beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.

Sun comes up to the groove, all night,
And the heat goes up.
Palms up, go in and you're smooth,
Goes up, baby, everything goes up.

We're down in the grooves,
We'll be history, but we'll leave it be.
'Cause, baby, you're on feeling too express,
And they're going strong when the beat goes on.

And the beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.
The beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.

Sun comes up to the groove, all night,
And the heat goes up.
Palms up, go in and you're smooth,
Goes up, baby, everything goes up.

The beat don't stop, the beat don't stop,
Everybody in our house 'till the sun comes up,
Whoa, music, clap, the beat don't stop,
Everybody, everybody.

And the beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.
The beat don't stop 'till the heat goes up,
Until the heat goes up.

Sun comes up to the groove, all night,
And the heat goes up.
Palms up, go in and you're smooth,
Goes up, baby, everything goes up
