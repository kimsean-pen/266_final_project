Winding your way down to Baker Street
light in your head and dead on your feet
but another crazy day you drink the night away
and forget about everything
This city desert makes me feel so cold
it's got so many people but it's got no soul
and it's taken me so long to find out you were gone
when you thought about everything
Used to think that it was so easy used to say that it was so easy
but you're trying you're trying now
another year & then U'll be happy just one more year & then you'll be happy
you're crying you're crying now
Way down the street there's a light in this place
he opens the door he's got that look on his face
and he asks you where you've been tell him who you've seen
and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
he's gonna give up the booze and the one night stand
and then he'll settle down in this quiet little town
and forget about everything
But you know he's gonna keep moving no he's never gonna stop moving
he's rolling he's the rolling stone
when you wake up it's a new morning the sun is shining it's a new morning
you're going you're going home
Winding your way down to Baker Street
light in your head and dead on your feet
but another crazy day you drink the night away
and forget about everything.
Used to think that it was so easy used to say that it was so easy
you're trying, you're trying now.
Another year then you'll be happy
Just one more year then you'll be happy
you're crying you're crying now
