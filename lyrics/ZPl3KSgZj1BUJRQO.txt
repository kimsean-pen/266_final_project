I love the way that your heart breaks
With every injustice and deadly fate
Praying it all be new
And living like it all depends on you

Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
Only surrender will help you now
I love you please see and believe again

I love that you're never satisfied
With face value wisdom and happy lies
You take what they say and go back and cry
You're so close to me that you nearly died

Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
Only surrender will help you now
I love you please see and believe again

They don't have to understand you
Be still

Wait and know I understand you
Be still
Be still

Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
Only surrender will help you now
The floodgates are breaking and pouring out

Here you are down on your knees
Trying to find air to breathe
Right where I want you to be again
I love you please see and believe again
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
Right where I want you to be again
See and believe
