I remember when you lit my flame
A bit of pressure with a pinch of pain
You left me praying for a single drop of rain, oh
But now the fire's burning out of control
Because I'm never gonna let you go
So bring the gasoline and we can start the show, oh

You got under my skin and I can't begin
To think of all the trouble you keep getting me in
So I'll just hold on and try to be strong

And I fall apart when I'm with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know you're really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, I'll never understand and it shows
You get me high but you're laying me low
Oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh

Well I remember every broken line
I'm just the victim of the perfect crime
You keep running while I keep on doing time, oh
So give me something just to keep me sane
I only wanna hear you say my name
Now I know I'm never gonna win this game
But I play anyway

You got under my skin and I can't begin
To think of all the trouble you keep getting me in
So I'll just hold on and try to be strong

But I fall apart when I'm with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know you're really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, I'll never understand and it shows
You get me high but you're laying me low

Oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh

And I fall apart when I'm with you
I cry when I kiss you
I know you're really no good
You got my heart in your hand
No, I'll never understand and it shows
You get me high but you're laying me low

Oh oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
(Laying me low)
Oh oh whoa oh oh
Oh oh whoa oh oh

You get me high but you're laying me low
