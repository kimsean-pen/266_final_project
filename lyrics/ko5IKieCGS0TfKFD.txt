Ahh, yeah

Yeah, she's gotta have soul
Or it won't feel right
Well, just plain, clean and simple
Wrapped up, nice and tight

In a home grown and down home
That makes a woman
Cookin' up that old time, long lost recipe, for me

It's gettin' hard to find
Guess it ain't hip enough now
You take an average guy
Who can't identify
And there's a short supply
Ooh, of the fine, fine stuff

Let me get on, let me get on, let me get on some of that
Shake it up, pick it out nice
Let me get on, let me get on, let me get on outta there
I still love my baby's poundcake

Home grown and down home
Yeah, that's the woman
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe

Let me get on some of that
Uh ha, uh ha, ho
Uh ha, uh ha, ho
I want some of that
Uh ha, uh ha, ho
Give me some of that
Uh ha, uh ha, ha

Oh, got some real fine poundcake

I've been out there
Tried a little bit of everything
But it's all without love
I found the real thing is poundcake

Home grown and down home
Yeah, that's the woman
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe, yeah, woo

She's down home and down home
Ohh, that's my woman

Give me some of that
Uh ha, uh ha, ho
Uh ha, uh ha, ho
Let me hold that
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, uh!
Uh ha, uh ha ho, yeah
Home grown and down home, woo
C'mon, baby
Give me some of that
Give me some of that
Home grown, way down home, yeah
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, yeah
Give me some of that, woo
C'mon baby
