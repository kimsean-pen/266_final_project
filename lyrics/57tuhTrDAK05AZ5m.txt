I'm gonna ride to Carolina
Drive for miles, till I see the light
Find my feet in Carolina
Some man I'll meet to take my mind off ya
My hearts on fire for Carolina
Never been but I've seen the skyline
In a postcard from Delilah
She's got it made and I got my mind made up
But in my heart I know it's time to come back
(I feel it, I feel it)
Cos you're the home I never find off the beaten track
(I feel it)
In my heart I know I can't keep running away
(I feel it, I feel it)
I'm always travelling fast to nowhere
(I feel it)
Come get a new life in Carolina
I don't know why but I'll soon find out
I'll find a house with an ocean view
Work good hours and be somebody new
But in my heart I know it's time to come back
(I feel it, I feel it)
Cos you're the home I never find off the beaten track
(I feel it)
In my heart I know I can't keep running away
(I feel it, I feel it)
I'm always travelling fast to nowhere
(I feel it)
