When the world, leaves you feeling blue
You can count on me, I will be there for you
When it seems, all your hopes and dreams
Are a million miles away, I will reassure you

We've got to all stick together
Good friends are there for each other
Never, ever forget that I got you
And you got me so

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your hearts desire
Reach for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

There's a place, waiting just for you
It's a special place, where your dreams all come true
Fly away, swim the ocean blue
Drive that open road, leave the past behind you

Don't stop, gotta keep moving
Your hopes, gotta keep building
Never, ever forget that I got you
And you got me so

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your hearts desire
Reach for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

I said reach
Climb every mountain
Reach
Reach for the moon
Reach
Follow that rainbow
And your dreams will all come true

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your hearts desire
Reach for the stars
And when that rainbows shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your hearts desire
Reach for the stars
And when that rainbows shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your hearts desire
Reach for the stars
