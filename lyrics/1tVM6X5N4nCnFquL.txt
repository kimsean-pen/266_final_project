(R. Pollard)

Chicken blows
I suppose we could have a girl or a boy
And I see what you mean
I'm not here to drink all the beer
In the fridge (oh, la la la)
In the room (oh)
In the house
In the place (oh, la la la)
That we both (oh)
So love
Can you sink to the depths (lots of "oh"ing)
I don't know
I don't even care
And our lives slip away
In the end we will probably reach
All the way (oh, la la la)
To the walls (oh)
over there
Have you flown? (oh, la la la)
Our courage (oh)
Is only a taste
And I'll get paid (ooh, ooh)
If you'll get laid (ooh, ooh)
It's our parade (ooh, ooh)
