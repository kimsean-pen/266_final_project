What's going on?
Can you correct my vision?
Helping my decision?

What's going on?
If you know what I'm meaning
You won't find me kneeling.

Should I be standing on a chair?
My hands are waving in the air
You know as well as I do now
I'm going to get to you somehow.

What's going on?
Everyone acts crazy
Yes or no means maybe.

What's going on?
Could you correct my vision?
Helping my decision?
