Oh, you can't hear me cry
See my dreams all die
From where you're standing
On your own.
It's so quiet here
And I feel so cold
This house no longer
Feels like home.
ohhh... Mmmm
ohhh... Mmmm
Oh, when you told me you'd leave
I felt like I couldn't breath
My aching body fell to the floor
Then I called you at home
You said that you weren't alone
I should've known better
Now it hurts much more.
ohhh... Mmmm
ohhh... Mmmm
You caused my heart to bleed and
You still owe me a reason
Cause I can't figure out why...
Why I'm alone and freezing
While you're in the bed that she's in
And I'm just left alone to cry.
ohhh... ohhh
Yeahh... Yeahh
Yeahh... Yeahh... Yeahh...
ohhh... ohhh
Yeahh... Yeahh
Yeahh... Yeahh... Yeahh...
ohhh... ohhh
Yeahh... Yeahh
Yeahh... Yeahh... Yeahh...
ohhh... ohhh
Yeahh... Yeahh
Yeahh... Yeahh... Yeahh...
You caused my heart to bleed and
You still owe me a reason
I can't figure out why...
You caused my heart to bleed and
You still owe me a reason
I can't figure out why...
Oh, you can't hear me cry
See my dreams all die
From where you standing
On your own
It's so quiet here and I feel so cold
This house no lounger
Feels like home.
