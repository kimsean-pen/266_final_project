Oh my song says it all,
Do you hear it in the verse?
Oh I'll call,
When you see it on my face, see it on my face

Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
(Oh I know...)

In the morning light those circles fade
I've always hated that moment
It's bitter sweet in my mouth
Just as we face ourselves

Oh my song, says it all
Do you hear it in the verse?

Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
Ain't got a second to waste, oh I know
(Oh I know...)
(Oh I know...)
(Oh I know...)

We've comped this bass together
Let's build
Let's build
