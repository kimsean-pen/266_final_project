So it's not
Loaded stadiums or ballparks
And we're not kids on swing sets
On the blacktop

And I thought at fifteen that I'd
Have it down by sixteen
And 24 keeps breathing at my face
Like a manhole
And 24 keeps pounding at my door

Like a friend you don't want to see
Oldness comes with a smile
To every love given child
Oldness comes to life

The youth, they dream suicide
Oldness comes with a smile
To every love given child
Oldness comes to life

The youth, they dream suicide
