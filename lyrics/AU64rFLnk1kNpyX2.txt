We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
Come, come forth, come forth into winds strong
All men rise up
Set our sails high
An epic journey, Our ships across the sea
All crew stand up
Fly the banners high
To ancient lands
Where legends dwell
Whelming breeze
The east wind swell
We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
Look, look forth, The isles of cats ahead
Norsemen stand up
Set our sails high
For Victory, Our ships across the sea
A glorious quest
Fly the banners high
To ancient lands
Where legends dwell
Whelming breeze
The east wind swell
We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
Strength on strength
Restless souls
Defy death
From Coast to coast
From Coast to coast
We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
We stand and fight, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We seek for foreign lands
It's time to strike, We sail tonight
Across the sea
We reach for ancient lands
Strength on strength
Restless souls
Defy death
From Coast to coast
To coast
