I am a silhouette of the persen wandering in my dreams

Tears of unprecedented beauty
Reveal the truth of existence
We're all sadists

The age-old development of conciousness
Drives us away from the essence of life
We meditate too much, so that our instincts will fade away
They fade away

What's the point of life
And what's the meaning if we all die in the end?
Does it make sense to learsn or do we forget everything?

Tears of unprecedented beauty
Reveal the truth of existence
We're all pessimists

Teach me how to see and free the disbelief in me
What we get is what we see, the Phantom Agony

[III. Nevermore]

The lucidity of my mind has been revealde in new dreams
I am able to travel where my heart goes
In search of self-realisation

This is the way to escape from our agitation
And develop ourselves
Use your illusion and enter my dream...
