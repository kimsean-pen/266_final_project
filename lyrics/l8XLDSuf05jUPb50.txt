Oh it's like I've been asleep forever
waiting for the clouds to clear, yeah
And all along I've been dreaming of you
Been dreaming for a million years

Wake me from an endless night
Tell me that the wait is over
Kiss me like the morning light
Let me stay awake forever

I don't wanna close my eyes
Wake me up and watch me rise
You make me wanna see it all
Let me stay awake forever

Got my head up in the clouds
Won't you come and pull me down
You clear the sky, you make me fall
Let me stay awake forever

Baby I can feel the wind is changing
Blowing all my fears away
'Cause I close my eyes
and I try to hide from everything
Now I know the sun is here to stay

Wake me from an endless night
Tell me that the wait is over
Kiss me like the morning light
Let me stay awake forever

I don't wanna close my eyes
Wake me up and watch me rise
You make me wanna see it all
Let me stay awake forever

Got my head up in the clouds
Won't you come and pull me down
You clear the sky, you make me fall
Let me stay awake forever

Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake forever

Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake
Stay awake, stay awake, stay awake now
Let me stay awake forever
