Once I walked a lonely road
Had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay

You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right

Lonely age of uncertainty
They disappear when you're near me
When you're around my life's worthwhile
And now I long to see you smile

You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
My life is right
My life is right

Once I walked a lonely road
Had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay

You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
