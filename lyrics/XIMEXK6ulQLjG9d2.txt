Wendy, you're stuck in my game, i know
Wouldn't be here without pain, for sure
50 years on, no one will know
The delicate, humdrum ways of this love

If you can keep up someday
Finally face to face
It's something i'll learn to take
If you can keep up someday

There's still an ocean between us, love
Everything hurts when it's not enough
If you rely on the coldest nights
Look in my head for what's not in sight

Wendy, you're hurt that i came back home
Wouldn't be here without pain, i know

If you can keep up someday
Finally face to face
It's something i'll learn to take
If you can keep up someday

There's still an ocean between us, love
Everything hurts when it's not enough
If you rely on the coldest nights
Look in my head for what's not in sight
