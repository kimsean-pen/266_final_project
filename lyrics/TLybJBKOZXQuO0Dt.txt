Let's get my mucky self washed
April is the cruelest month
Insecure, fuzzy lines crossed
Playful, I'm the coolest sun

It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful
It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful

It's okay, I didn't do drugs
A kiss before the girl gets lost
And hearing on the phone how much
You missed me only made it hurt

It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful
It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful

Late last night, you asked me
"Am I the most important thing?"
It's looming that I might lose you
You don't love me like you used to

It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful
It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful
It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful
It's fatal
Oh, oh, oh, unfaithful

Unfaithful
Unfaithful
Unfaithful, aha
Unfaithful
