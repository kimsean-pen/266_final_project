My friends feel that
It's their appointed duty
And he keeps trying to tell me
All you wanna do is use me
But my answer to all that use me stuff, oh baby

Now I wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Keep on using me 'til you've used me up

(Use me)
(Use me)

Mother sat down
And you know she told me
"If he can overcome you, all he's gonna do is use you"
But my answer to all that use me stuff, oh baby

Now I'm going to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Well, keep on using me 'til you've used me up
'Til you've used me up (Use me)
(Use me)

Now I'm going to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Come on and keep on using me 'til you've used me up

'Til you've used me up (Use me)
(Use me)

Sometimes it's true
You really do abuse me
I lost the only people
Who really ever didn't use me
But oh baby, when you love me I can't get enough, oh baby

Now I'm going to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Well, keep on using me 'til you've used me up
'Til you've used me up (Use me)
'Til you've used me up
'Til you've used me up (Use me)
Come on and use me up

(Use me)
(Use me)
Come on and use me

(Use me, use me, use me, use me, use me, use me)
(Use me, use me, use me, use me, use me, use me)
(Use me, use me, use me, use me, use me, use me)
(Use me, use me, use me, use me, use me, use me)
