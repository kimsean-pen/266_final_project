You wanted to do make videotapes
And put everything into a screen
But you're not the one...
If you did I would have.
If you did I would have seen
What it would be like to see you again?
You're not in my hands,
I thought I'd see you often in my head.
You never wanted anything else
Just to see the lie in everything
And you would ... the world.
But if you did I would have,
If you did I would have seen.
What it would be like to see you again?
You're not in my hands,
It's why I see you often in my head.
What it would be like to see you again?
You're not in my hands,
But I see you often in my head.
What it would be like to see you again?
You're not in my hands,
But I see you often in my head.
What it was like to see you again, what it was like?
What it was like to see you again, what it was like?
What it was like to see you again, what it was like?
