Silver tongue told me to
believe in the truth,
Cos I'm young he won't let it go
Problem with you, ohhh
When it's done, it will be done
If it stops, something's wrong
When it's gone, I'll be gone
If I sleep scared what comes...
Gonna be myself right into falling

Sometimes I feel
It's just a warning, it's all a warning sign
Sometimes I feel
It's just a warning, just a warning sign

It's only done long enough
Believe me, it's all
Cos I'm young, I won't let it go
Believe in the tongue
And we're done, and we're done
And we're done, leave it right now
And we're done, and we're done
And we're done, leave it right now
Gonna be myself right for falling

Sometimes I feel
It's just a warning, it's all a warning sign
Sometimes I feel
It's just a warning, just a warning sign
Sometimes I feel
It's just a warning, it's all a warning sign (hold your breath)
Sometimes I feel (I feel alright)
It's just a warning, just a warning sign (hold your breath, hold your breath...)
