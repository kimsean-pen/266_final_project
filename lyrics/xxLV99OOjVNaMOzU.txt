Tar on the road held the heat of the day
Craving the danger, as on it we lay.
Clothes like cling film on your back
Caught in the swelter like it's a trap

Dizzier then, we're spiraling down
Our time is all spent cause I'm spending it now
Tar on the road held the heat of the day
You're holding it in, you say you're okay

And I believe you
Cause nothing else could get much better
I believe you
Feeling like we're at the equator, I see you
Keepin' it to yourself
Hey

Stepping right in to find out we were blind
Our vision was drowned by a burning sky
Caught in the daze you wore it so well
The hotter it got the less that I felt

Treading the line of the land and the sea
Shivering as we got up to our knees
It's colder than we thought it'd be
Further South than we've ever been

But I need you
It's hard to make you not forget that we need you
After all this time, I'm starting to see you
Convince me that you're fine
Please

I can see your collarbones and baby I'm scared
Never thought I'd be so unprepared.
