Would you please release me, everything is fading
I can't keep my eyes shut long enough to see
Visions I'm getting confused with,
shadows on my eyelids flickering the light

It's just like Vera Lynn, A Nightingale Sang Berkeley Square in 1940
Oh, we'll met again
Someday if you hit the big one,
everybody wants some from you, it won't last
Cause then one day you'll bite the big
one, everyone will move onto somebody new
It's just like Vera Lynn, A Nightingale Sang Berkeley Square in 1940
I still connect with every single thing she sang
A Nightingale Sang Berkeley Square in 1940
Oh, we'll met again

I warn you, everybody see through, coming out to get you
Tell me how's it feels
Love like every day's your last one
Exploding with passion, pretty soon you'll see
It's just like Vera Lynn, A Nightingale Sang Berkeley Square in 1940
I still connect with every single thing she sang
A Nightingale Sang Berkeley Square in 1940
Oh we'll meet again
