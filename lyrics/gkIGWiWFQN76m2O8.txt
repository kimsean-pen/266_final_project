We'll be the worms in your apple pie
Fake abuse for our bios, blacken our own eyes
Grass isn't greener on the other side
We'll set it on fire, and we have no reason why

Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow
Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow

Good for nothing but being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing but being everything that's bad, bad, bad

We know who we are and what we want to say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

I've got my villain necktie and a mouth of hi-fi
So sharp, I'm bleeding from my Judas hole
I'm the Arch Dandy no-goodnik and I'm headed for Crashville
I'm most monster with my groan box in the "Meat Show"

Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow
Set fashion, not follow
Spit vitriol, not swallow

Good for nothing but being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing but being everything that's bad, bad, bad

We know who we are and what we want to say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

Crashing the ether, we've got the loudest stereotype
Even neophytes deep set your pro-life
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
We're so beautiful and damned, simply as a "still-life"

Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause

Stop the song and remember what you used to be
Somebody that could fucking impress me

We know who we are and what we wanna say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

We know who we are and what we want to say
And we don't care who's listening
We don't rebel to sell, it just suits us well
We're the bright young things

Good for nothing but being everything that's bad, bad, bad
Good for nothing but being everything that's bad
