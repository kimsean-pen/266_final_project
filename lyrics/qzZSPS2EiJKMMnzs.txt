We had so many good times
And some bad
We shared the happiness
Shared the sad
We suffered all...
All the miseries
Back when I had you girl
You had me
But when you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like a sewer in the rain
It all went down the drain
You and I

My life is so empty
What can I do
I ain't got nobody hey nobody
To take the place of you
And I'm not so strong
Honey as I used to be
Back when I had you baby
And you had me
Then you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like a sewer when it rains

It all went down the drain
You and I
You and I

You played the game
Pick and choose
Yesterday I sang a love song baby
Now I'm singing the blues
And I'm not so strong
As I used to be
Back when I had you baby
You had me
But when you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like the sewer in the rain
It all went down the drain
You and I
For you and I

What can I do
What can I do
To take the place of you
Like a sewer when it rains
You know it all went down the drain
You and I
You and I
Mmmm you and I
