I don't wanna shower even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off, wash you off my skin
It's been about an hour
And I'm still trembling, oh
Feel you deep, feel you deep within
Yeah-eh-eh, eh eh eh

Opened bottles on the drawer
Rolling papers on the floor
Yeah, don't want no cigarette yet
Don't want no drink in my breath, yeah
Wanna taste your taste some more
Feel you pourin' through my pores
Yeah, I'm goin' back in my bed
To play it back in my head

'Cause I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself
Only you, eh
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else
Only you, only you
Only you

I feel you in my fingers
And even in my toes
Steam up on the mirror
And on the windows
Baby, that was it
Wish it would never end
I just wanna do it, do it again
Yeah-eh-eh, eh eh eh

I can smell your smell so sweet
On my pillow, on my sheets
Yeah, I wanna keep it like that
Keep on sleeping like that, yeah
Baby, you'll be hard to beat
What I have is yours to keep
Yeah, I never wanted so bad
Best that I ever had

No I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself
Only you, ah
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else
Only you, only you

Only you, you
Only you, only you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself
Only you, only you
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else
Only you
