I'm just a poor boy
Waiting for answers
No one heard you coming
I watched the ashes blow away

Spent some days with runaways
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
You could kiss the lips of fate
The less we know the less it drains us

Close your eyes and see it through
Chaos comes and collects the youth

I can feel the cold air when the night comes
Heaven's only wishful
I can feel the cold air when the night comes
Heaven's only wishful

Someone said
Each night I wonder
Hoping to find meaning
Life and its horrors
Oh, there's no getting out
Don't tempt these vultures
Oh, who are circling round and round
Don't be the reason
Close your eyes and see it through
Chaos comes and collects the youth

I can feel the cold air when the night comes
Heaven's only wishful
I can feel the cold air when the night comes
Heaven's only wishful

Someone said
(Ehhh, whatever)

Some say
You're the reason I, I
Feel this way
Some say
You're the reason, you're the reason
You're the reason
