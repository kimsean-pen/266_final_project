I've been looking out through bubbles in the air
The ground is so unsure

I've been shaping my eclectic dream domain
Between whiles just quietly looking what you're up to
I've been taking way too gravely of what's been said
The ground is so unsure

There's enough to stay for, but the lungs need fillin'
I'm a rainproof distant spawn that I can't ignore
But it gets hard to run while doubting that I'm breathing
I'm a tragic exploration of self-trust
