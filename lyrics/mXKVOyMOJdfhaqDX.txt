Erased by the words, consuming desolate
In death in remorse, in this we celebrate

Theories from another world, from another failure
We don't adhere to fascination
Weary, fall on mother earth, call your other saviour
We won't adhere to fascination

Drained by the voice in which we tolerate
Rejection restores resistance provocates

Theories from another world, from another failure
We don't adhere to fascination
Weary, fall on mother earth, call your other saviour
We won't adhere to fascination
