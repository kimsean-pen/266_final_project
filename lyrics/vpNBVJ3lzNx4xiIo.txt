Everything is upturned,
But you don't know what you're looking for.
It's funny in such a small room that love can get lost so soon.
It was just a little heartbeat,
Still too fragile,
And too weak to ever make it through without shattering,
To ever make it through without breaking.
Still I thought I saw the start of a whole new thing that could really have been something.
Still, no matter how hard I squeeze this hand it's not feeling.

How do you make a heart light up
Until everything is fireworks,
Until the heart is yours?
How do you make a heart light up
Until everything is fireworks, everything is love, and the heart is yours?

Why are we so uptight if we don't know what we're looking for?
It's funny in such a small room there could be so much space between us.
We could spend the whole night talking about this.
We could spend the whole night placing the blame.
We can say the same words over and over and never get to figure it out,

How do you make a heart light up
Until everything is fireworks,
Until the heart is yours?
How do you make a heart light up
Until everything is fireworks, everything is love, and the heart is yours?

So I tried to build a home where there should not be and I built a little wall around me until you could not see,
Until you could not see, till you could no longer see me.
And now there's one more broken heart in the world, well who wants to hear about it?
There's just one more person in the corner of the room left crying

"how do you make a heart light up until everything is fireworks, until the heart is yours?"
