I hear the rain
I hear the rain
I hear the rain
Got to kill the pain

I hear the rain
I hear the rain
I hear the rain
Got to kill the pain

Bury me out on a lone prairie
Prairie water washin' over me
Bury me out on a lone prairie
A friend who calls a coyote

Bury me out in the lone city
Sewer water color of my tea
Bury me out in the lone city
Sewer water wash we all down to sea

She use to sit and watch and wait
Now I think I'll go and sit
