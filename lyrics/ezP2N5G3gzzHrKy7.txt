My world is on fire
And I've got nowhere to watch it burn
No one to admire
How well I disappear

Don't call me a liar
We'll cross the bridges I meant to burn
You reek of desire
That's why there's no one here

[Chorus Pt.
There's no one here to watch me as I fall asleep
They assassinate the ones who dream
And if I got it all, I got it for you

We all came to watch your world as it burns
My world was on fire way before it was meant to burn
Makes it more [?] when they're all [?]

Now that I'm a liar
No one's willing to mark my words
Come down to the wire
You'll enjoy it here when...

[Chorus Pt.
There's no one here to watch you fall asleep
Assassinate the ones who dream
If I got it all, I got it for you

[Chorus Pt.
We all came to watch your world as it burns
We all came to watch your world as it burns
Wants me to save my breath 'cuz it's all it gets
We all came to watch your world as it burns

'Cuz I can't wait unless it's for you
No, I can not
I can't wait unless it's for you
No, I can not

[Chorus Pt.

We all came to watch your world as it burns... [x4
