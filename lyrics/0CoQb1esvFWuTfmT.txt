Live for the mess
Make me feel ageless
No pain, no gain
Teach me carelessness

And I'm about to see all that's made up
And everything they want from us
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, make way

And I can't hide it
I won't fight this
Yearning feeling inside

Gotta get

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love
Hoo ooh hoo ooh

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love
Hoo ooh hoo ooh

There's nothing more to say to back it up
When I'm unafraid
I've lost enough
Go on, hold on for dear life

'Cause I won't hide it
I can't fight this
Burning feeling inside

Gotta get

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love
Hoo ooh hoo ooh

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

Won't you lean on me
You can lean on me
Let them look, don't know, don't care

Go deep with me
Go deep with me
Go deep with me

Hee hee hee
Hee hee hee

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love
Hoo ooh hoo ooh

Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love
Hoo ooh hoo ooh

What you waiting for
What you waiting fo-or

What you waiting fo-or
What you waiting for
What you waiting fo-or
