It's another night
I wish I wasn't cold
I just bought a bag
And smoked it on my own
I just bought a 8th
Chewed it now I'm trippin' feelin' like
I need somethin' stronger tonight
I be feelin' lonely tonight
No matter how much I be smokin' drinkin' sippin' I ain't never high I'm comin' down
And I don't care how long it take me to get here
Nigga I need somethin' now
My feet can't ever touch the ground
I need it every morning
Need a little fore sleeping
Everybody want it
I just go and get it
Nigga why you mad at me?

It's another night
I keep a sweet roll
I light it on fire
And turn it into smoke
I still ain't fucking high
I need a little mo'
Story of my life
Tryin' to save my soul

Everybody talking
Somebody 'ought to listen
I be feelin' different everytime I wake up niggas in the kitchen
They ain't eating nothin'
They ain't cookin' chicken
Boilin' water
Gettin' harder
Using dishes traped up in the kitchen

What'cha doing with your day?
What'cha doing with your night?
What'cha doing with your mind?
What'cha doing with your time?

Get up off yo ass
Get up off yo ass

What'cha doing with your day?
What'cha doing with your night?
What'cha doing with your time?
What'cha doing to your mind?

Get up off yo ass
Get off yo ass
