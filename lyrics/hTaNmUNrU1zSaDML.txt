Please don't cry
My train-jumping child
I am here but lost in the light
I know you and I took the last of the light
From a bulb that resembled a tear

Stop your talking
We are the same twin
All I hear is mothers crying
I'm not honest
I'm not honest
Oh so selfish
And dishonest

She took all of the light
Took all of the light
Took all of the light

You spin and you wind through the canyons and find
That you span right back where you started
As I weep for my loss and a beloved cross
Then I stood and wept like a gypsy

Stop your talking
We are the same twin
All I heard was mothers crying
I'm not honest
I'm not honest
Oh so selfish
And dishonest
