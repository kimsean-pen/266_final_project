I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loneliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea.

When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping bout the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind.

In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea.

And I sometimes hear the echoe of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find
For the answer I was seeking was the secrets she's still keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind.

Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind...
