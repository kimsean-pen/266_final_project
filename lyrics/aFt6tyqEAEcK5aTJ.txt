I'll take it from the start
You know
I'll give it all I've got
I'll give it all I've got
'Til I show
That you can trust in me
Just trust in me
Don't have to be afraid

You can stop all the leaves from falling away
I believe you can stop my skies from turning into gray
Wish the sound of your voice would stay
Because it feels like I am only steps away
Only steps away

When you turn off the light
Ooh, you make me feel alive
Yeah, you know I'd give all my time
All my time
I'd never walk away from you

I'll hide from the day
'Til I run out of sunlight
Time doesn't pass by
I'll lie awake
Imagine the next time I look in your eyes

You can stop all the leaves from falling away
I believe you can stop my skies from turning into gray
Wish the sound of your voice would stay
Because it feels like I am only steps...
From the next time you call me before you sleep
Swear to god when you laugh, it's like you're standing right in front of me
How I wish how I wish your voice could stay
Because it feels like I am only steps away
Only steps away
Only steps away
Only steps away

You can stop all the leaves from falling away
I believe you can stop my skies from turning into gray
Wish the sound of your voice would stay
Because it feels like I am only steps away

I'm at the edge of the world, won't you hold me?
'Cause at the edge of the world, it gets lonely

I'm at the edge of the world, won't you hold me?
'Cause at the edge of the world, it gets lonely

I'm at the edge of the world, won't you hold me?
'Cause at the edge of the world, it gets lonely

I'm at the edge of the world, won't you hold me?
'Cause at the edge of the world, it gets lonely

Yeah, it gets lonely

You can stop all the leaves from falling away
I believe you can stop my skies from turning into gray
Wish the sound of your voice would stay
Because it feels like I am only steps...

From the next time you call me before you sleep
Swear to god when you laugh, it's like you're standing right in front of me
How I wish how I wish your voice could stay
Because it feels like I am only steps away
