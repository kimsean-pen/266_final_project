You love my love, you never gonna find better love
You hate my love because you're dead without it
You loved my love, you never gonna find better love
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it

Oh, you couldn't live without me
I didn't ask why, but then, why should I?
Oh, guess I was fine without you
But when I saw you so fair, you couldn't do without
Had to find out what it was all about

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love because you're dead without it
(you got me good for you)
You loved my love, you know you'll never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it
(you got me good for you)

Oh, you had to do the hard work
You had to á¹—lay me, I didn't disagree
You said you lost your number, and now you needed mine
That's all you got, now get it right this time

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love because you're dead without it
(you got me good for you)
You loved my love, you know you'll never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it
(you got me good for you)

You got me wondering why didn't we just play rough for the night
You got me wondering why shouldn't we call it a night

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love because you're dead without it
(you got me good for you)
You loved my love, you know you'll never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it
(you got me good for you)

You love my love, you're never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love because you're dead without it
(you got me good for you)
You loved my love, you know you'll never gonna find better love
(and I don't want you to)
You hate my love, you couldn't live without it
(you got me good for you)
