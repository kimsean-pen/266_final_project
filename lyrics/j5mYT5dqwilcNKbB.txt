Marijuana keeps me still
Takes all the anxiety from seeping in
Hearing voices
Sound so free
It's like these angels got wrecked and torn apart
Inside of me

Couldn't believe what I see
Couldn't believe nothing but what's inside

I'm from hell
I yearn for somewhere that isn't real
As the planet gets ripped and torn apart
We might as well

Couldn't believe what I see
Couldn't believe nothing but what's inside
Of me
