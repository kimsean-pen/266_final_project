Love
Love
You're my Brooklyn Love
Love

Walk me to the deli for
Late night candy runs
What we have is good
So fun

You're my Brooklyn Love
Love
You're my Brooklyn Love
Love

We don't say 'I love you'
But that's fine by me
Always at your crib
You live right by me
Got me watching Shark Tank
We so creative
You don't take me on dates
But I don't hate it

Ooh La La
Je suis chaude pour toi
Oh my god
Pourquoi je suis comme ça?
Ooh La La
Je suis chaude pour toi
Oh my god
Oh my god

Walk me to the deli for
Late night candy runs
What we have is good
So fun

You're my Brooklyn Love
Love
You're my Brooklyn Love
Love

We be talking all night
You don't say much
Never met your parents
They don't know about us
Fancy ass dinners
Overrated
Peanut M&M's
That's your favorite
Love
Love

Ooh La La
Je suis chaude pour toi
Oh my god
Pourquoi je suis comme ça?
Ooh La La
Je suis chaude pour toi
Oh my god

Walk me to the deli for
Late night candy runs
What we have is good
So fun

You're my Brooklyn Love
