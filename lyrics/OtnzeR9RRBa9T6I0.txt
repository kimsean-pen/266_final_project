So, what's with your kinds?
You scavenge to find
What makes you
Supreme in design?
Accuse you 'cuz they had the fun
So differently divine
When my mind goes override
It's so typical to capture anonynimity
I choose the crowd to divide

So you see I try
I cannot ever displace
You see I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place
So you see me die
Right in front of your face
See I'm jaded at times
From nowhere, leavin' this place

(Woh, ah, ah, ah, oh)
(Woh, ah, ah, oh)
(Woh, ah, ah, ah, oh)
(Woh, ah, ah, oh)

They made us with a tool
Then they taught us how to live
We met the candyman
Who filled us with his contraband
Then they scared us all away

While you're visiting your bubble of reality
Salivating at the sound of the bells
I'll be seducing you through your confession
They've been the ones you've known forever
Someone's been lied to
With all the rage
Caught us dismal at times
We've known forever

So you see I try
I cannot ever displace
You see I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place
So you see me die
Right in front of your face
See I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place

You've been denied of supervision
Just a test tube life away
How could you make believe?
That we've grown with circumcision
When it's right here next to me

Our friendships change with time
And they never let us leave
You took your time
So too late
Missing what you've never had
I'll be the only one that knows
Just how we've been abused

So you see I try
I cannot ever displace
You see I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place
So you see me die
Right in front of your face
See I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place

So you see I try
I cannot ever displace
You see I'm jaded at times
From nowhere leavin' this place

So you see me die
Right in front of your face
See I'm jaded at times
