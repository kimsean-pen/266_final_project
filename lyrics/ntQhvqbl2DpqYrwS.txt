The way I see it
Things have changed
It's better for me now
And it all began on a summer day
When the rain was pouring down
You sent my way a smile
And I can't forget just how wet you are
And of you
Of you

And on and on
That summer day just took it slow
I remember every sway of your body and everywhere you go
We sat on a corner and I got to know you good
And the afternoon
Yeah, it's for you
Its all for you

But I could've been somebody
But I was just a body, for you
Yeah, I could've been the king of many things
But now I'm not, cause of you
And the things you do
I hear the rhythm of your shoes

What was a dream
Changed quickly
Here I am months later
I'm staring out of this window
Looking for your face
I mean, I know, I know that we met at the place
Oh, but it's got to change
I mean it's got be real
I can't believe that afternoon couldn't be real
But the days go by
And months too
And I'm staring
And the nights go slowly too
But I'm staring
I'm staring for you
Yeah them things you do

Oh, I could've been the king of many things
But now I'm not, cause of you
Yeah, I could've been somebody
But I was just a body for you
I hear the things they do
I hate the rhythm of your shoes

Can it be
That it was only you and me
On a street somewhere
That can never be
I mean I fell in love
The second you caught my eye
And how many time do that happen in your life
I mean, how many times
And I won't forget you
But how could you
I mean, the afternoon in the park
Was something that I'd never do
And here I am
Just looking for you
Out a window
In the city
I'm looking for you
Them things you do
I love the things you do

Oh, I could've been the king of many things
Now I'm not, cause of you
Yeah, I could've been somebody
But I was just a body for you
Ohhhhh, I could've been the king of many things
Of many things, many things
Yeah, I could've been somebody
But I just a body for you
I hear the that thing you do
I hate the rhythm of your shoes
It follow you
I hate the rhythm of your shoes
I hate the rhythm of your shoes
