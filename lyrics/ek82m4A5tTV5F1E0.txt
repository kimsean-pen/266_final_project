(Uhuuu Ahhh)
This time her mind is made up

Yeah, she's moving on
It's not like her spirit's crushed
It's just she don't belong
Maybe she thinks too much

She thinks she's given enough
God only knows she's got a heart of gold
Always looking for love
She's beginning to think she's cursed
On her looks she judged
By the folks at work
All alone the night she's cried

silently she's filled with pride
One day they'll know, she's got a heart of gold
And she sings, I want to know what love is

But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold
Been coming 'round here

Since she's a little girl
But now the change is clear
We live in a cynical world
She don't care for fashion and fame

Those kind of people they are all the same
They don't wanna know, she's got a heart of gold
And she sings, I want to know what love is

But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold
To see her footsteps in the snow
And she sings, I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold
