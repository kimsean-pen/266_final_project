Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about and
It's definitely not a particle that's nearby.
It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing
It's way out in the distance
Certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time.
As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock
About maybe ten or twelve diameters.
I don't know whether that does you any good, but there's something out there.
