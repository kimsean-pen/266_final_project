(G.Kooymans - Dayglow music)
oh believe me it's not true
The rainbow hides no treasure

and there ain't no mixture
that will give you back your youth
No mystic machine that makes the sand turn to gold
Like there ain't no magic word
that holds you back from getting old

and I break it in my hands
I catch a branch
Like you broke my heart
oh I still can't understand
No mysterious mixture
Only time will bring peace to meand
can heal the wound you've made
now I just hate
No more lies, no more rainbow treasures

Oh I'll break up and I give it all up

No more fairytales, no more games for me
It's my life, my life, a pleasure
There's just a little bit of peace in my heart

There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part
and I break it in my hands
I catch a branch
Like you broke my heart
oh I still can't understand
No mysterious mixture
can heal the wound you've made
and now I just hate
Only time will bring peace to me
Oh I'll break up and I give it all up

No more fairytales, no more games for me
No more lies, no more rainbow treasures
It's my life, my life, a pleasure
There's just a little bit of peace in my heart

There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part
When will I learn to stop wondering why

The time rolls by, the days go by
Despairing I'm going down on my knees
I'm begging, begging, begging, oh please

There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part
