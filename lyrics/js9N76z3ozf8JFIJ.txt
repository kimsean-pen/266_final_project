My little clover
Are we past the change?
Our future taking shape
Scratching the surface
Selective memory
It's the ritual we keep
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
Reflections aging
Our morning vanity
Waking up right next to me
This way or that way
Always rushing ahead
This way or that way
Always rushing ahead
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
This way or that way
Always rushing ahead
This way or that way (waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead
This way or that way (waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead
This way or that way (waking up right next to me)
Always rushing ahead
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
Oscillation pulling me close
Pushing me back
