I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you

Miss days of her laughter
But I've turned another chapter
In the 6 with my Raptors
Went ghost, now you calling me Caspar
Could it be, that it's not serious to me
I stay with these
Cause I heard [?]
Cutting ties after hot sex in the bathroom
Now that we're over I won't look at you
Feelings in my stomach like it's high school
I know there are other niggas looking at you
But you can't diss me on my set
You [?] me by my text
Said it received, not read
20 minutes later a paragraph or two

I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you

Naked
Does he [?] when you're naked?
Do you never let him taste it?
Does he fuck you like he loves you?
Treat you good like a mansion
Does he bathe in the shower for you?
Does he do the things that I do?
Does he tell you that I want you?
I know how much I really love you
I can't-s put no one above you
I'm a lover man for you
You the don-girl for me
Rolling blunts on your roof
Let my ex know about you
She can't do things you do
Inside and on the room
You're the only one that knew that

I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
And you knew that I wanna love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you

About Roy Woods Love You
Love You is the sixth song of Roy Woods' new album Nocturnal. He is talking about a girl that he was trying to love.

Now she doesn't notice him, which is why he says that now she calls him casper â€“ and he's not trying to see her. She's with another man, but he is asking whether he is as good as he used to be, whether that is in bed, or everything else he does.

He is also with another girl, and she knows about her, because he is still in love with her.
