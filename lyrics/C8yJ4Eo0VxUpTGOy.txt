I know you're trying to make me happy,
And I know you're doing it your way, way,
And I don't always make it easy
To know the perfect words to say, say.

If you wanna give me what I want, listen;
'Cause I'm gonna tell you what I need, so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave, hold me;
So I can feel your love.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
I want a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

Woah, woah, woah.

You're always trying to solve the puzzle,
And you always want to fix what's broke, broke.
You keep searching through the rubble,
And never want to let it go, go.

Sometimes it feels like I'm raining on the inside,
And all the things that I'm trying, I don't get it right.
And sometimes, yeah, I fall and I get up.
It takes a while but I get there in my own time.

If you wanna give me what I want, listen;
'Cause I'm gonna tell you what I need, so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave, hold me;
So I can feel your love.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
I want a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

Love is a very wide open door:
You can go through every time you want more.
Why do I feel like the glass is half full
When I've got enough of it to fill a swimming pool?

Listen

'cause I'm gonna tell you what I need, so bad.
If you wanna give me what I crave, hold me;
So I can feel your love.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
I want a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.

When the craziness begins to get to me,
Just need a hand to hold just be that somebody.
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right.
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind.
