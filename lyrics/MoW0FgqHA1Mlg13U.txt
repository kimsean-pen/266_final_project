I think its time we talk, say everything
I know a secret that your eyes won't keep
that you're the author of?
Just tell me how it ends

You have a stubborn heart, I can't persuade
I'll say three words you won't reciprocate
I know you want to, I know you use to,
but you just don't love me

And I won't let you waste everything you are on me
I know that all you love about me is who I use to be

Made of? hearts and patchwork love
Seems unavoidable it came undone
I'm sorry all of me was not enough
I know it never was

I know you blame yourself from the pain I feel
and I'll still hurt before it starts to heal
I won't forget you I wont regret through the pain, the years I gave to you

And I won't let you waste everything you are on me
With every night you spent sleeping with our memories
cause its like spring to winter your heart has changed and nothing feels the same
And I won't let you waste everything you are on me

All I ask, my one request is dont forget me dont regret me
(fearful I let go)

And I won't let you waste everything you are on me
Your beating hearts been sinking into apathy
Cause its like spring to winter your heart has changed and nothing feels the same
And I won't let you waste everything you are on me
And I won't let you waste everything you are on me
