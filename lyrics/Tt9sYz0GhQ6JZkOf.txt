I just want to go home
This road's so cold and I'm alone
I've got my friends but they don't know
I've lost my soul I'm made of stone

I'm just so tired
Nothing is real
I lost my love to the complex inside me
I was so mean
To a girl who loved me unconditionally

Is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
And OH Is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
To be in love
I don't know

Face your heart to the door
You fooled them once but now you're sure
This cold dark road is all you know
You've got no soul
You're made of stone

I'm just so tired
Nothing is real

I lost my love to the complex inside me
I was so mean
To a girl who loved me unconditionally

Is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
And OH is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
To be in love
I don't know

What to do anymore
The complex heart calls the shots
I'm just a pawn in its game
The complex heart makes me so tired
Makes this too real
I lost my love to the complex inside me
I was so mean
To a girl who loved me unconditionally
Is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
And OH is it so wrong?
Is it so wrong?
To be in love
To be in love
I don't know
