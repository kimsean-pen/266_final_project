"Hey just calling you back doing pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all.
Yeah tomorrow I got this procedure, I think everything's gonna go smooth there is all.
I'm hoping anyways.
I need some good news for once."

Don't wanna hear it's over
What a rude awakening
Angel of death has come and ripped you from my life

I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you on the other side

Blue sky
Has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone
It just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore

What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt begin to penetrate my heart

With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss are tearing me apart

Blue sky
Has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone
It just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore

We're sorry, this mailbox is full and cannot take messages

My world is shattered and disarrayed
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter
Anymore
