Feelings will change but I never feel enough
And time heals in waves but won't fill the holes you dug
Memories fade but I hold onto my love
I stay awake wishing on stars above

I try not to think about the ways that it's coming down
The things I was feeling then
I don't wanna feel again
Deep breaths coming in and out
One kick and I'm coming down
The things that I never said
I don't wanna hold them in

It snowed in October when I wanted rain
I don't think I'm changing but I don't feel the same
And all of my pieces that I gave away
I'm burning my body so I can stay warm

I tried to grow but I never change enough
I tried to be whole but somebody pulled the plug
All that I was crumbled beneath your weight
Days turn to night and love withers into hate

I try not to think at all
The room never felt so small
I heard all the words you said
Coloring my bones in red
Have we lost the coast line yet?
How deep does the water get?
The waves go above my head
I don't wanna hold my breath

It snowed in October when I wanted rain
I don't think I'm changing but I don't feel the same
And all of my pieces that I gave away
I'm burning my body so I can stay warm

It snowed in October when I wanted rain
I don't think I'm changing but I don't feel the same
And all of my pieces that I gave away
I'm burning my body so I can stay
