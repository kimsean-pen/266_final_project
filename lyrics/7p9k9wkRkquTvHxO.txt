If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise.

See I got you,
All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Girl, you're so vain,
You probably think that this song is about you.
Don't you?
Don't you?

And don't you dare act like you don't know,
Know what's up,
Cuz your nose is up.
I'm approaching up. (Yup)
Like I can't give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter
Miami in December
Trying to look bored in them diors.(Diors)
She probably is,
Was acting shallow until
She find out how deep that my pockets is.
Mrs. pre-madonna,
This is your reminder,
That I think you're fine.
But I'm finer.

Cause it sure seems.
Cause it sure seems
You got no doubt
That you got no doubt.
But we all seem
We all seem
We got your head
In the clouds
