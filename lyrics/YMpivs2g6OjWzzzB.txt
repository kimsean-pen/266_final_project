Coming with a lie
Here we go again
First you say you write
Then you take my pen
'Cause underneath your smile
You don't wanna lose
Babe, I got the style
You just got the shoes

Came in from the start
Ready for a fight
Betting that your bark
Got nothing on my bite
Now I'm number one
You'll be back for more
We'll be having fun
But you'll be keeping score

My love is better
Than your love
My heart is better
Than your heart
My moves are better
Than your moves
My shoes smell better
And I bet bet bet bet
My kiss is wetter
Than your kiss
My lips are better
Than your tricks
You know you'll never
Have these hips
I'm so much better
So eat this!

I'll let you go there if you go my way
I need to know you're happy to obey
I let you touch me every now and then
And if you want some, yeah, I'll tell you when when when
