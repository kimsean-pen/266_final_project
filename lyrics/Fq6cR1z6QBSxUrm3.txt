Don't change your name keep it the same
For fear I may lose you again
I know you wont its just that I am unorganised
And I want to find you when something good happens
If you come down we'll go to town
I haven't been there for years
But I'd be fine wasting our time
Not doing anything here
Just doing nothing
We'll sit for days talk about things
Important to us like whatever
Well defuse bombs walk marathons
And take on whatever together
