It seems like I can do no wrong
Through your eyes
Sing the wrong lines to my own song
You don't mind
Make it up as we go
All the words we don't know

Even When I'm a drunken mess
You don't care
Still like me better than the rest
I swear
I don't understand it
How you like me when I'm dancing

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

All my idiosyncrasies
You like 'em
Annoyed at all the little things
I know I can be frustrating
But you still like me when I'm dancing

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

When I lose myself
There's no one else
Who else is?
Quite like you

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
Those eyes, in those eyes
I can do no crime
When dance like I don't care
You call me Fred Astaire

You call me Fred Astaire
Those eyes, damn, those eyes
They get me every time
