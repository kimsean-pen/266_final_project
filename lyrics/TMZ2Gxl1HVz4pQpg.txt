Funny
How you turned red
When I first said
Let's join the dead

Funny
I was driving by
Feeling really high
It made me cry

Wooooohhhhhh
Ahhhhh

Funny
There were swastikas
On Santa Monica
Where they were scarred

Funny
That no one said
That you were dead
And painted red

Where do you go when you fall on your face
It's a place that you never should know
Is there a reason why people should change
And they changing the way that they go

If I was there with you for long
Would you be singing me this song
I'm holding on

Wooooohhhhhh
Ahhhhh

Where do you go when you fall on your face
It's a place that you never should know
Is there a reason why people should change
And they changing the way that they go

If I was there with you for long
Would you be singing me this song
I'm holding on

Wooooohhhhhh
Ahhhhh

Wooooohhhhhh
Ahhhhh
