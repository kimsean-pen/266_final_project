My feet are sore from walking all night long
No direction when there's no where to go
Empty picture frames of times all go
Lonely echos of the stories we told

If you, put on my shoes walk a mile or two
'Till your eyes open wider then they used to
Then I will meet you there where the air is clear
Pinky swear I'll meet you there

And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
And I'll——— stay, today until forever
And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
My eyes are open wider today until forever
I'll stay with you

Familiar faces as we chase the moon
Fall in love and I'll come crying to you
Through the changes and the us battles
I lay my troubled bones on you

If you, put on my shoes walk a mile or two
'Till your eyes open wider then they used to
Then I will meet you there where the air is clear
Pinky swear I'll meet you there

And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
And I'll——— stay, today until forever
And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
My eyes are open wider today until forever
I'll stay with you

(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)

(Music)

I'll stay with you

(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)

(Music)

And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
And I'll——— stay, today until forever
And I'll—— stay, with you and see new colors
My eyes are open wider today until forever

(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)

(Music)

I'll stay with you

(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)
Oooh woah woah woah

My eyes are open wider

(Music)

Tonight

When I'm 102, and I can sing to you
Close your eyes memorize how we used to
