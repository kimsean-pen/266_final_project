Without the sense of space or time
The infinite, the endless static
And doubt, doubt will never add away
Let us play a game
If you take my hand I'm gonna get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swaying chandeliers
Tormented minds, they wonder
Gripping away from the line
I will lift you up, my friend
You have to learn to breathe again
Let us play a game
If you take my hand I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swaying chandeliers
Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some room, let's turn them into something
You're lost within
Fading out, a world that threw you away
Let us play a game
If you take my hand I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swaying chandeliers
