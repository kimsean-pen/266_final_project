I've been following
Your minds instructions
Oh how just to slowly, sharply screw myself to death

Ah yes, there is a screw
It's pointed at my head

Then look a dream peddlar
And a stick of light through my bones
"Don't get on the wrong one"
"Oh you and you what's your game"

Laying me down to waste laying me down
Pin me up or put me down
Uh uh uh uh oh
Now let it all go

It's a horror show, you should come on round
Horror show, the horse is brown
Uh uh oh left something in Moscow

She said "I'll show you a picture
A picture of tomorrow
There's nothing changing
It's all sorrow
Oh no please dont show me
I'm a swine, you don't wanna know me

Ah yes, there is a screw
It's pointed at my head

Laying me down to waste laying me down
Pin me up or put me down
Uh uh uh uh oh
Now let it all go

It's a horror show, you should come on round
Horror show, the horse is brown
Uh uh oh left something in Moscow
