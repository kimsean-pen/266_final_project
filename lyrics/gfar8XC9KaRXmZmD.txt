Seeking below you
Time's been a wasting
Alone in a fall room
Nobody plays in here

I own everything
Why I don't settle get on with it
I own everything
Crying eyes are so long flying

Hurt does surround you
Blinding the tide on
Numbness goes through
Let bygones be bygones

I own everything
Why I don't settle get on with it
I own everything
Crying eyes are so long flying

And it tells me in a way
Hangin' over
And I feel it's here to stay
And I comment so in vain

Feel like a fake thing
Where did the time go?
Memories worth making
Pass by the window

I own everything
Why I don't settle get on with it
I own everything
Crying eyes are so long flying
So long flying
