Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing (ah cut this tension, it's too much)

Situation volatile, seriously hostile
Breadwinners, soul searchers, fear merchants, seeking
Brightly coloured, no use for camouflage
When you're venomous and willing to sabotage
We're just a group of your white blood cells fighting off parasites
We're your system mechanics trying to fix this machine
What's the one thing that has more speed, more strength, and goes deeper than us?
A nuclear submarine

Ah come on, just open the door
Knocked off my feet by the backdraft
Brought back to earth
Oxygen clears my head
And I just gotta say
Oh, you're not gonna believe this, you can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you (yeah lucky for you) this is an open door

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down (down on your shoulders, down on your shoulders)
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back

Oh, you're not gonna believe this, you can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you (yeah lucky for you)
They're well prepared, but they forgot one thing
Yeah yeah, we're nice guys
Until we're not

So come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down (down on your shoulders, down on your shoulders)
Come and join the party leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back
Just push right back
Just ...
Just ...
