You got immersion
Conclusion that will set us free
It takes us closer and closer
To human, how we wanna be

Invitation was a strife
I couldn't that we tried it all
Tried it all, I descend before the countdown
From the ocean of emotion
I will wake up when I'm plentiful
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot it like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

Get my injection, the poison
Let's believe that's all I need
I can't describe it, the picture was too sharp
I couldn't get it off, no

A description, a prescription
I can't handle, but I tried it all
A deception, a recession to the countdown
From an ocean of emotion
I will wake up and I'm already gone
Breaking my shell, I initiate deception

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot it like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

is my profession, follow my lead
my seduction, I down
my obsession (it is my moment)
my self-deception, my addiction

It's my obsession, the pressure
To be a slave of what I trace
I force it higher and higher
The are leadin' to your name, oh yeah

I wanna swing around in hell
I'm gonna scream and shout it out in vain
Tried it all, I descend before the countdown
Be remembered
I will wake up if already dead
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot it like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot it like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
Now I shutdown
My countdown
