So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow

It's criminal

Believe me
It's easy to let this cut deeper
The taste could be sweeter, come on
You're too strong
And far gone
I'll keep my composure, just tell me

What this is really all about
I feel you tearing down
Castles in my head
When we're in different beds

So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow

It's criminal
It's criminal
It's criminal

I'm sideways
Can I say you pull me to pieces
Just tell me your secrets, come on
For what it's worth
I'm more concerned with how you got me here in the first place

I guess you're really all about
I feel you tearing down
Castles in my head
When we're in different beds

So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow

It's criminal
It's criminal

Believe me
It's easy to let this cut deeper
The taste could be sweeter, come on

You're too strong
And far gone
I'll keep my composure, just tell me

What this is really all about
Feels you tearing down
Castles in my head
When we're in different beds

And I'm a world away
Somehow you'll come find me
To close to stay on track
Tossing and turning back

It's criminal

So what's it mean
When every dream I have's about you now?
I can't believe
You get to me the way you do somehow

It's criminal

(I'm sideways)
(Can I say you pull me to pieces)
(Just tell me your secrets)
It's criminal
