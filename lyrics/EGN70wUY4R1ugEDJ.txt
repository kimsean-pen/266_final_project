This world has brought you down to your knees
You're not alone, everybody needs
To believe in something
To believe in one thing
I believe in you

Living your life like it's on the brink
Drifting away on a broken ship
But I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you

Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you

Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you

I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you

You've been so numb for the longest time
Losing your faith, yeah, it's left you blind
But I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you

Stop hesitating, the road is bright
Dream it, do it, turn around, you have the right
To believe in something
To believe in one thing
I believe in you

Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you

Oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
I believe in something
I believe in one thing
I believe in you
(I believe, I believe)
I believe in you
I believe in you
(I believe, I believe)
I believe in you
I believe in you
(I believe, I believe)
I believe in you
