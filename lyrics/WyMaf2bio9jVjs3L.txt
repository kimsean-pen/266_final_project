Carved out of stone, earth, blood and bone
Knock the mountains down
The earth's grating sounds
They soothe the great machines
That yearn desperately
Just to lay them down within her gaping mouth
More than a symbol
More than I bargained for
They wander ridges high
Between the earth and sky
Like spikes upon a crown we wear upon our brow
And want is not a need reserved for human beings
It's fingers on your throat
Is pain that all things know
An army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart's lands
Eating all reality
Producing only dust and sand
Nothing hurts them
Nothing gets under their stone skin
And when their earthen mouths will open up
Just what words should come out? but
"we wish we were dead"
