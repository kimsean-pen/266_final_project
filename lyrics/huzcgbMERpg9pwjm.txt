Take Yo Praise - Camille Yarbrough

we've come a long long way together
through the hard times and the good
I have to celebrate you baby
I have to praise you like I should

you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine
you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine

you make me glad I'm a woman
cause your a feeling thinking man
and anytime I know your needing
I'm going to please you every way I can

you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine
you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine

you've cleared the questions from my mind
I was afraid to say I love you
afraid to take and too eager to give
you helped me deal with what I'm feeling
with why and how I want to live

you're so rare
man you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine
you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine

I have to praise you when you hold me
when you work your way around
aint a part of me left over
that your sweet love aint found
you make my (my) moan turn to whisper
you make my whisper turn to call
you make me scream
and scream that I love you
when you (when you) make me rise and fall

you're so rare
man you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine
you're so rare
you're so fine
I'm so glad your mine

oh (oh) your mine your mine
you know I want the best for you baby
and what you want I want for you
and we can work together baby
to see it, to see it all come true

cause your so rare
and your so fine
and lord knows I'm so very glad your mine
you're so rare so rare
and your so very very fine
oh you cleared all the questions from my mind

through the hard times and the good
I'm going to take this day to celebrate you baby
cause I have to stop and praise you like I should

your so rare, take yo praise
and your so fine
and I hope you know I'm glad your mine
take yo praise, your so rare
take yo praise, your so fine
