In this life I'm me
Just sitting here alone
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there for you

Walk the silent emptiness
That leads me by my hand
And throw away
What I don't understand as a man

Love-hate-sex-pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-hate-sex-pain
It's underestimating life

And I wonder as I tear away my skin
It's taken me so long to stitch
These wounds from where I've been

And mother please don't bury me
I'm begging for my life
It's hard to say that I would be complete
Before I die

Love-hate-sex-pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-hate-sex-pain
It's underestimating life

Don't you worry, please
And don't you leave me
Because I'll surely slip away
Through love-hate-sex and pain
I fall away into
Love-hate-sex and pain
Love-hate-sex-pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-hate-sex-pain
It's underestimating life
Love-hate-sex-pain
It's complicating me sometimes
