You're tired of working in the city
You fight for life and that ain't joking or exaggerating
You try to smile your way through every single obstacle oh
Without making you exasperated
Your dreams reminding you to fix it
Don't wait for change but don't start counting days adn nights before it
You try to see that maybe everything's a miracle oh
Without making you feel less about it
Your time is eaten by the city
You sweat for dimes and then you're counting days and weeks without them
You have to live your life without the prize surrounding you oh
Even though it's whay you're told to wake for
Your dream is somewhere in the country
You crave the air and all the flowers that are free to gather there
You try to feel that maybe where you are's a miracle oh
Helping you to not think less about it
