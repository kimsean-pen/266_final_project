Exhale, exhale it
Exhale, exhale it
Exhale, exhale it

Breathe in and then breathe out
Slow down, like your body all round
Breathe in and then breathe out
Exhale, can you feel it come down?

Breathe in and then breathe out
Slow down, like your body all round
Breathe in and then breathe out
Exhale, can you feel it come down?

Exhale, exhale it
Exhale, exhale it
Exhale, exhale it
Exhale, exhale it

We only ever loved
When is the moments that you need me?
We always felt the rush
When every time feels so easy
The way you're moving your body
Feels like a blacked out story
'Cause people faded as hell now
It's time to exhale now
