Don't make me crazy, baby
This is real, not dreaming
I knew I'd met you before this
Corner room and it was right

You make me crazy baby
This is real life
Don't wear out how you look on me
I think that you could follow
I knew I'd met you before this
Cornered you and it was right

Don't wear out
Hanging with my (???) now
I think you can follow me down

Well don't wear out
Hanging with my (???) now
I think you could follow me
Corner room and it was right
Cornered you and it was right
