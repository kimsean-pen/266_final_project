Bleeding light in a life spent in broken arms,
can't return my soul to the mountain.
Desperate eyes reach the sleeping dark vessel
filling within the desert.

Visions raining destroying where I began.
Set adrift I pray to the ocean.
Waves of dreams,
Bare my heart for deliverance.
The closer I get the further
I become... become... become...

.the beast that conquered me.
And traveled through my head.
And sprayed like blood on you.
And left me buried beneath the river
