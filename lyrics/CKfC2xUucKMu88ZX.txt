Do I really know where I'm going
I don't even know where I've been
Standing on the edge of confusion
Miles, miles, miles away

've lost the best of me
Can't find that spark of gold
I'm my worst enemy
I'm frightened of it all
Looking for the beast
That little fireball
You want a piece of me
The me that I have lost

Stop
I'm not ready
Can't let go how I really feel
You see these scars
They're not ready
Can't meet him 'til I face the fear
Of falling in love

Take me back to right where I started
Back to when I knew how to give
When everything I gave was full-hearted
And I-I-I lived

've lost the best of me
Can't find that spark of gold
I'm my worst enemy
I'm frightened of it all
Looking for the beast
That little fireball
You want a piece of me
The me that I have lost

Stop
I'm not ready
Can't let go how I really feel
You see these scars
They're not ready
Can't meet him 'til I face the fear
Of falling in love

Only the lonely keep running away
Am I the only one that is afraid
And all that I want is to be worth the wait
So I can be all that you really say

Stop
I'm not ready
Can't let go how I really feel
You see these scars
They're not ready
Can't meet him 'til I face the fear
Of falling in love
Stop
I'm not ready
Can't let go how I really feel
You see these scars
They're not ready
Can't meet him 'til I face the fear
Of falling in love
