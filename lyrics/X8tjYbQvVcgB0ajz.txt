And I, I sit in my room, all night long
I forgot how to smile, I forgot, how to be strong
And you and me, we'd make out in my bed
Sometimes I imagine life, if you were dead
It's not that rough

And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else

I'd love, to find, a way, into you
I can't go through life, having nothing new
The same awful day, over and over again
I can't make myself cry, I can't give into sin
It's not that rough

And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
You, can only love, someone else
And you can only love, someone else
