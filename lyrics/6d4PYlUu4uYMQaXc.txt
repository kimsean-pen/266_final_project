I can be there
I saw it there
But, I don't know
I'll have to call you later
I'm sorry

Some say I'm a God, I don't feel like one
I feel like I'm stuck here waitin' for a text back
Whats a conversation?
Tell me what is true love, I'm tryin' to find that
Never could I escape havin' brought you down
I want more, you keep your heart a secret
I had somethin' till I went and lost it
And now it's totally abandoned

I think her blood is toxic, that's why she won't let me in
I called her old roommate just to hear what she'd say
And if there's passion in you, I'm tryin' to find it
And if I can't have what I want, what's the point of anything?
Tell me why I'm in pain, why I feel ashamed?
To want love and all of its burdens
To take and totally possess her
And still I wait for invitations

I thought if I dreamt it then something might happen
I tried to light a candle, it came back to burn me
And if there's passion in you, I'm tryin' to find it
And if I can't have what i want, what's the point of anything?
