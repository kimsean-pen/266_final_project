I see the place that we've been locked together
Together
Like we were something more
And it felt like maybe we could last forever
Forever
But you led 'em to our hideout
Forced their way inside, now
They want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night right here
Between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send the message
We're saying, "Give it up, give it up"

We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
Please God, tell me we're dreaming

Wait for the dust to settle down around us
Around us
And stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again
To breathe again
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath, and calm down
'Cause you have been selected
You've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you've got your nest egg
You've got your nest egg
So live it up, live it up

We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We're saying, "Give it up, give it up"

But you led 'em to our hideout
Forced their way inside, now
They want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night right here
Between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send the message
We're saying, "Give it up, give it up"
We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no, please God, tell me we're dreaming
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
