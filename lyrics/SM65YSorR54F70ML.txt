This is what it's all about y'all (Oh yeah)
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well, you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way
I thank you
Oh and then for the times when we're apart

Well, then close your eyes and know
These words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember
Keep smiling and keep shining
Knowing you can always count on Stevie, for sure

That's what friends are for
In good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for

For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Keep smiling, keep shining

Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for
For good times and the bad times
You know that I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

So all of you, keep smiling, shining
Knowing you can count on D and D for sure
You see that's what friends are for

Keep smiling (Smiling)
Keep shining (Shining)
You know you can count on me for sure
You see that's what friends are
That's what friends are for
That's what friends are for
Thank you all so very, very much
God bless you and goodnight
