To stand mortified
Deceit can't hide the error inside
The words you say
Don't stand they fall
Amongst the tangled lies you make
Believe are true, convince yourself
It's me not you
That delivers pain and comes between

Tonight - shame me with the thoughts I am denied
Tonight - shame me, shame me

Or leave me for dead...

It's natural to feel like this
Remember times when nights are long
I've lost the means to carry on
I think it's time to realise
There's no time left no time at all
So take what's mine I want what's yours

Tonight...
