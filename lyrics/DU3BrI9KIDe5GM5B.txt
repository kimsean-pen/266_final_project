Digs deep to the bone
When the Chinese whispers surface all you said
So I'll leave you alone
With the kinda thoughts that circle through your head

And I know, I know
You can work it out
I know, I know
Just wake up

I'm sick of all this bullshit
Shut up
I don't care what you're saying

And did you know that the friendship's wearing thin?
Not even trying to help yourself
And I've heard some of your good mates slag you off

But I know, I know
You can work this out
I hope, I hope
Just wake up

I'm sick of all this bullshit
Shut up
I don't care what you're saying

When in denial it's hard to see the forest through the trees
An act of violence
An ugly thing we all witnessed so
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

It's probably best we leave you alone
Leave you alone

Wake up

Wake up
I'm sick of all this bullshit
Shut up
He said he caught her cheating

Wake up (I hope you sort yourself out)
Wake up (Hitting girls, is this what you're about?)
Wake up (I hope you)
Wake up
