I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

Here comes the sunrise
In bed with red eyes
She left a 4 letter warning
At 4 in the morning

Already the day's gone
Bye bye baby so long
She left a 4-letter warning
At 4 in the morning

And I don't rock right no more
And you need to act right
Be right calm down
Baby come on
Baby come on
Come on
We're all good people,
All good people
Come on
Baby come on
Baby come on
We're all good people,
All good people

She holds the power
I, I am nothing
When I said I was leaving
She could tell I was bluffing

And I don't rock right no more
And you need to act
Right be right calm down
Baby come on
Baby come on
Come on
We're all good people,
All good people
Come on
Baby come on
Come on
We're all good people,
All good people

I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name

We're all good people
Come on
Come on
Baby come on
We're all good people,
All good people
Come on
Baby come on
Come on
We're all good people,
All good people, people, people,
People, people, people, people
