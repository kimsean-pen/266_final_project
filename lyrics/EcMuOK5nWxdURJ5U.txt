Get up and jump, get up and jump, get up, get up, get up and jump
Jump on up
Jump on down
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away
Jump all over town
'Cause jumpin' is okay in a jumpin' kinda way, ghey ghey!

Jump a boy
Jump a girl
Jump a rope
Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumpin'
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?

When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!

Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Lookin' like you're mighty silly
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?

Mister Mexican jumpin' bean knows
His fun is skeaky clean
Christ, how'd ya think that he got so clean?
Not from sittin' on his goddamn spleen. Get up!

Oh, I be jumpin' I be jumpin' I be jumpin' alone
I be jumpin' for the phone
I be jumpin' Misses Jones
I really wanna jump on Kinski's bones

Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

Get up and hump
Get up and hump
Get up and hump
Get up and bump
Get up and bump
Get up and bump
Get up and stump
Get up and plump
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogiewoogie
To the tune of slam my Willy
Lookin' like you're mighty killy
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?
