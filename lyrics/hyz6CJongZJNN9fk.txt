I never thought I'd be a killer
Cause there's so much to lose
But if I can't drink the water
What else can I do

And although the axe is heavy
It just sits in my hands
While you're changing like the current
Not a shore on land

Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

I never thought that I'd be facing
A sea that's bluer than the tide [?]
Now my knees are shaking
And I can't look in your eyes

But if you're gonna make me do it
How'd you want it done
Is it best to sip it slowly
Or drink it down in one

Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

The executioner's within me
And he comes blindfold ready
Sword in hand
And arms so steady
Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around
But every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you
Make up your mind
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall
Oh, make up your mind
Before I make it up for you
