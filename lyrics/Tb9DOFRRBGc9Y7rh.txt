She flies, she's gone to ride an angel's breath
Gone to taste a dream
And every time I call her
A shadow crawls away

But she takes, she laughs him all there is
And everything she owes me

She gives, she told me that she loved me
Love, just for a day
And all the time I feel her
I feel her fade away

But she takes, she gives him all the fakes
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day

She takes, she gives him all the shadows
And everything feels good
Clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day
