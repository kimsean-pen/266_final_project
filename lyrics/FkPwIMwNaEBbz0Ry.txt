Just as I turned away
And you fell to the ground
All I heard was your screams
But you never made a sound
Never made a sound
These voices I hear are never truly near
Letting go of what I hold true is something I'll always have to fear

I knew that this would be the last time
I saw it in your eyes
I never believed it would be the same
But in my mind I thought that this would change
I know that this might be the end
It's been weighing on mind
It's killing me, killing me on the inside

Hear me out, hear me out
This isn't what I want to become of us
But I cant live with this pressure
It stabs deep inside my gut
When time moves on so do I
I see the damage of what I have done
Always feeling the burn like a close encounter of the sun
I begin to retrace what nearly could have been
Just please forgive me for I know that I have plenty of fucking sins

I knew that this would be the last time
I saw it in your eyes
I never believed it would be the same
But in my mind I thought that this would change
I know that this might be the end
It's been weighing on mind
It's killing me, killing me on the inside

I'll stand by my broken views
Alone in this dark place, I have paid my dues
I'm freeing myself from the endless cycle
Finding the strength within
I don't need some miracle
Don't need some miracle

I knew that this would be the last time
I saw it in your eyes
I never believed it would be the same
But in my mind I thought that this would change
I know that this might be the end
It's been weighing on mind
It's killing me, killing me on the inside
