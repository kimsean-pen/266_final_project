They say love can drive you crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I'd pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

They say good things come to those who wait
It's like counting in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here??

When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing's more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard is so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won't waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or living life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
