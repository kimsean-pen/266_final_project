I have never felt like I've been part of something.
Community is a lost cause.
I need to be where I once was,
Not with the people I want
But the ones that I trusted.

This is a toast, to make amends
To all our friends who were there from the start.
Apologies we had to leave,
We thank you with open arms.

You made us who we are.
We'll drink to this, through thick and thin.
Lost in desire;
Misdirected but never inspired.
Even though we are miles apart,
You kept us close, held to your hearts.
Through these years we'll drift afar.
My head will always be back at the start.
You kept us close, held to your hearts.

We've come so far, to look back now.
We will never leave you behind.
We'll always find a way.
I can see through you with the eyes of a snake.
With good intentions I've learned once, I'll learn twice.
The open road is not my only home.

This is a toast, to make amends
To all our friends who were there from the start.
Apologies we had to leave, we thank you with open arms.
Lost in desire;
Misdirected but never inspired.
Even though we are miles apart,
You kept us close, held to your hearts.
Through these years we'll drift afar.
My head will always be back at the start...

This is what you call a real friendship.
This is what you call a real friendship.
This is what you call a real friendship.
