Do you agree with me
We're finding hope in disaster
Aim it casually
And I cant go any faster than
You are beyond sight
howling at the moon each night
(howling at the moon each night)
howling at the moon each night

A veil you secretly
will hide behind until after
you run easily
farther than my hope could ask for
break open the sky
forcing up a black sunrise
break open the sky
forcing up a black sunrise

Do you agree with me
We're finding hope in disaster
Different frequencies
And I can't go any faster than you are
Beyond sight
howling at the moon each night

Enjoy the scenery
Don't know how long it will last
You say it dreamily as if we'd already passed it by
break open the sky
forcing up a black sunrise
break open the sky
forcing up a black sunrise
break open the sky
it's more than i can leave behind
