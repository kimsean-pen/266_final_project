Our waves of fear
are gonna drown the moments we earned
before they lied Are we for real?
When we beat our souls on the walls
of the earth?
Let's mute the rain
till we find the sounds we can feed
to lonely words
Don't lose the pain
'cause it's the only thing we can use
to really see ...
Where our hearts are crying,
and bleeding out, in the hope we fall away
We want more, we won't fall
We want more, we won't fall
The road is long
and the shards of time floating by
won't be caught
My shoes are gone
Stones and glass are piercing my skin
just to show ...
Why our hearts are crying,
and bleeding out, in the hope we fall away
We want more, we won't fall
We want more (retaliate)
We won't fall (regenerate)
