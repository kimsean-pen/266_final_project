For the wolves we fought when a child was brave
Days on a Southern strand
Where we'd all pretend to be touring
And I'd wait all night for the smile you'd saved
Or how the wind would howl
Better head back now
It's a warning

We were swimming out so far this time
The sun and your eyes were the only fire
Pretty intimate so far so I
Lit a holy fire

So we all gather our ghosts around the island flames
Oh and the song she throws is not one I know
But it knew me
For an age long lost in time, erased
Days when they called our names
Stories tucked away, you tell it to me

We were swimming out so far this time
The sun and your eyes were the only fire
Pretty intimate so far so I
Lit a holy fire

Take me back to places I feel loved in
Maybe failing that, take me to Boston
Strange that I'm not seeing you as often
Wandering 'round in cities I feel lost in
What if all the costs are even

We were swimming out so far this time
(Take me to Boston, Boston)
The sun and your eyes were the only fire
(Take me back to places I feel loved in, loved in)
Pretty intimate so far so I
(Wandering 'round in cities I feel lost in, lost in)
Eyes of e-e, holy fire
