I'm gonna let go of my ghost
Wherever you go, I'll be waiting
I will live through you, my spirit
I will guide you through the rain

There's a monster
It's got me trapped on the other side
But this monster has become my home

I'll be comfortable
Twisted up in a shadow
One day, kid
We will get to go to the dance

There's a monster
It's got me trapped on the other side
But this monster has become my home
There's a monster
It's got me trapped on the other side
But this monster has become my home

I will live through you, my spirit
I will guide you through the rain

(Hold your head up)
Take a deep breath
Open your eyes
Rise the midnight girl
(Hold your head up)
Take a deep breath
Open your eyes
Rise the midnight girl
(The midnight girl)

There's a monster
It's got me trapped on the other side
