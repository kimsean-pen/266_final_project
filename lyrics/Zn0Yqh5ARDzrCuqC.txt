This time, this time is my time
My life lies in the base line
You tried to take what was all mine
My pride, I bowed down and I swear

My turn to make all the bells shine
I know that you know that I tried
I don't count the tears I've cried
This car has driven its last mile

As you stand on the edge for a love
For somethin' to believe in
As you stand in the rain and then fall
For somethin' to believe in

Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you to get it right
Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you, somethin' to believe in

In another world, another life
I still belong to you
In another time, you'll still be mine
And I belong to you

I'm ready and you're ready so who cares?
But get the stranger's judgment and mean glares
I always did what I thought had seemed fair
I walked away, saved by the last hair

Not easily, my God, I was so scared
Just so you know I can't help that I care
I pray you're well, I just know that I can't
I can't, I can't be afraid

As you stand on the edge for a love
For somethin' to believe in
As you stand in the rain and then fall
For somethin' to believe in

Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you to get it right
Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you, somethin' to believe in

In another world, another life
I still belong to you
In another time, you'll still be mine
And I belong to you

Even though it's at the end
A brand new morning can begin
And the sun will shine again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again

Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you to get it right
Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you, somethin' to believe in

In another world, another life
I still belong to you
In another time, you'll still be mine
And I belong to you

Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you to get it right
Waitin' around all over town
Waitin' around all over town
For you, somethin' to believe in
