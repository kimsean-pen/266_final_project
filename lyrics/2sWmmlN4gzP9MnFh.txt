Once again, I'm in trouble with my own friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

Once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well, of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again, we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house

Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well, of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only, only, only
Only, only, only
Only, only, only
Only, only, only
There's someone listening in
