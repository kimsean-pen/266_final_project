So you wanna be a champion, girl
So you wanna make demands on the world
Well, you gotta pay attention
Gotta, gotta pay attention
So you wanna be a champion, girl
So you wanna make demands on the world
Well, you gotta pay attention
Make a man see your vision

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Ain't no, no, no, got nothing on me, no
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Ain't no, no, no, got nothing on me

So you want that lifestyle
Wanna go nonstop
Get in line
Where's your mind?
So you wanna be a big star
Wanna be a porn star
Know you're lying
Know you're lying

We don't need your energy
We don't need your formalities
Don't let them take a piece for free
Don't give it up so easily
Your bullshit, it is killing me
So don't you raise your voice at me
You will not take a piece for free

So you wanna be a champion, girl
So you wanna make demands on the world
Well, you gotta pay attention
Gotta, gotta pay attention
So you wanna be a champion, girl
So you wanna make demands on the world
Well, you gotta pay attention
Make a man see your vision

So you want that lifestyle
Wanna go nonstop
Get in line
Where's your mind?
So you wanna be a big star
Wanna be a porn star
Know you're lying
