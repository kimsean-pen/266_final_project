Two, ah-three, ah-four
Two, ah-three, ah-four
Two, ah-three, ah-four

I should be saying goodnight
I really shouldn't stay anymore
It's been so long since I held ya
I've forgotten what love is for

I should run
On the double
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble

So come to me darlin' and hold me
Let your honey keep you warm
Been so long since I held ya
I've forgotten what love is for

I should run
On the double
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble

I should run
On the double
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
I think I'm in trouble
