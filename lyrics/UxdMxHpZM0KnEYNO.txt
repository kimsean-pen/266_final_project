Once again we found ourselves to be lost
Holding hands while straying from the path in the forest dark
Aren't you happy to see me crawl serpentine towards the sun to you

Lift the lid off your heart's casket in the arms of rain
we'll Drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secret's you've kept from me
Hail Marys for tomorrows dream
In the arms of rain we are free

Again, I fought myself and lost
Come bite the apple and I'll coil around your heart
I'm so happy to see you weep along in these arms you belong

Lift the lid off your heart's casket in the arms of rain
we'll Drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secret's you've kept from me
Hail Marys for tomorrows dream
In the arms of rain we are free

Ave Maria we've tried
Ave Marie we've cried
Ave Maria we've died

Lift the lid of your heart's casket in the arms of rain
We'll drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secret's you've kept from me
Hail Marys for tomorrows dream
In the arms of rain we are free

Lift the lid of your heart's casket in the arms of rain
We'll drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secret's you've kept from me
Hail Marys for tomorrows dream
In the arms of rain we are free

It's the end of the road, hold me
It's the end of the road and we're free
