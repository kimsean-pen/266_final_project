Give me a reason
It's not romantic here in blue
swimming, swimming in blue
You left me lonely and confused
question, questioning you
so soon goodbye you stole my heart
believe, believing you
Was it a lie right from the start?
Answer, answer me do

Well now my body's weak, so just give me a reason
And my makeup's off, so just give me a reason
My defenses down, so just give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason

You'll never know the love I felt
Wanting, waiting for you
It takes a weak heart to forget
Follow, follow it through

Well now my body's weak, so just give me a reason
And my makeup's off, so just give me a reason
My defenses down, so just give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason

So what's a girl like me to do?
Drowning, drowning in you
And who's to save me from the blue?
And carry, carry me through

'Cos now my body's weak, so just give me a reason
And my makeup's off, so just give me a reason
my defenses down, so give me a reason
I am strong enough, so give me a reason
Now my body is weak, so just give me a reason
And my makeup's off, so just give me a reason
My defenses down, so just give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason
Give me a reason
What did I do wrong?
