I see your scars
Your fears
And the pain in your heart
It's killing me
Consuming
My soul and all beyond

You're bent and broken

Come closer now
Hold me
And please keep me warm
So much agony
So much pain
Please save me now

I'm bent and broken

All that you fear is bound inside
You fight
You die
All that despair just makes you blind
You're crucified
By lies

You're bent and broken

I'm bent and broken
