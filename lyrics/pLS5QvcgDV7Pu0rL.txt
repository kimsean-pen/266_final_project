Summer, summertime
And the feeling is breezy
And I'm living easy
And the sun, the sun, it shines
Was only here for the weekend
But I'm never leaving

Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my ice tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
?, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But I feel? this where I'm gonna be
I'm just a girl on the coast

Blue, how blue is the sky
Palm trees are shedding
And the sun is blazing
And I close, I close my eyes
I hear the waves all crashing
And I'm here relaxing

Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my ice tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
?, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But I feel? this where I'm gonna be
I'm just a girl on the coast

Ay, I never felt so free
I'm happy here, swimming in the sea
I guess the mermaid life it's just for me

Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my ice tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
?, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But I feel? this where I'm gonna be
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But I feel? this where I'm gonna be
I'm just a girl on the coast
