The city's so in style
All you see for miles are people spillin' in and out of cars
Man I love these bars are makin' a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there's no one here but me

Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't a way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead
Downtown's dead

Their dancin' in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything's a blur
I don't hear the words but lips are movin'
Try to get involved
But I've about had enough of people wall to the wall
And I'm just holdin' it up 'cause

Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't a way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead
Downtown's dead

Free drinks, bright lights, what am I doin' with my life?
Okay, I quit... I've had enough of this
'Cause people are losin' their minds
Can't get you out of my head
I'm callin' it a night
I'm crawlin' back to your bed...

Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't a way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead
Downtown's dead
(Downtown's dead)
