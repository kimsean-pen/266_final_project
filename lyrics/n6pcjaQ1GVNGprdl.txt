Summer clouds blowing up and down the stair
By the end, we'll take music from them both
Give it back, shining broken glass
Wedding coat, I was waiting there for you
You raised your glass and the scars fell of my heart
We threw a stone, but we never heard it land
There are clouds keeping quiet every night

By the end, we hold something too high to ever come back down
By the end, there's a song we will sing meant for someone else
By the end, we leave somewhere too long to ever wander back
By the end, we give someone too much to ever close their hand

Summer clouds doing good for gold and gray
Tell me where all this love fits in the world
You can lie, give me all the rain you want
