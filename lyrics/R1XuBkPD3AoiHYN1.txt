I walk in a line
I see where I'm going
I turn inside out
The days that I've known
I face to myself
And give up the ghost
I turn in my mind
What time already knows

In the Time Of The Assassins
They say hallelujah
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a
Heart from the dead

I sift through the ash
I look for a sign
I open the wound
That keeps me in line
The shoulder that turns
The flame that goes out
The chapter I close

In the Time Of The Assassins
They say hallelujah
it doesn't take a miracle to raise a
Heart from the dead

And can something change
But still feel the same
