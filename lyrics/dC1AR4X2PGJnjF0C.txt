I can see the Russian Army rolling through my head
On one side of me lies the enemy, the other half is dead
I've got diamonds and I've got pearls. . .
And I said "Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl

That's the whole thing about it. . .
I'm so in love today
I've been waiting at the bus stop
Come my way?
"Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
I'm a
Psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl

In the Russian Army rolling through my head
The snow is falling, January's all across the land
I've got seven other men in the ditches behind me, and
I think I'm the last survivor

And I said "Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
I'm a
Psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl
