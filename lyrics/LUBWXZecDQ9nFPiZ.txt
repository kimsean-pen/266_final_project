I don't know if hell is certain
But I pray you'll be burning
You treated me like a vermin
Fuck you for this lifelong burden
I can't succeed
Without remembering what you did to me
I can't forgive
You should've never fucking let me live

I wish that I could forgive you, but I feel it still
I wish that I could forget you, but I never will
To tell the truth, I just want my youth back
The life that was ripped from me

Looking back it should've killed me (Killed me)
I'd trade it all just to have a normal life
You know you ruined me completely (Completely)
A living nightmare, you still keep me up at night
Your morality was on the fence
Your depravity at my expense
Your sick, sadistic mind exposed
All you are is all I loathe

I wish that I could forgive you, but I feel it still
I wish that I could forget you, but I never will
To tell the truth, I just want my youth back
The life that was ripped from me

As you played god
Tried to warp my mind
Drained me of love
And left my innocence behind
How do you like me now?
I'm still alive somehow
And I can tell you this
Nothing haunts me

Lambs to the slaughter
You fucking monster
You have no right to get to live your life
Not an ounce of mercy
You cursed me, did me so dirty
Left me feeling so unworthy
You made me feel cheap
Burned me inside my bed
And now my life is bleak
Because your threats ring in my head
Let me tell you, it takes one to know one
You're by yourself
There's nowhere left for you to run

I wish that I could forgive you
But you remind me some scars are the truth
Accused and abused
You owned the room
I'll take care of me
Instead of you

I wish that I could forgive you, but I feel it still
I wish that I could forget you, but I never will
To tell the truth, I just want my youth back
The life that was ripped from me

I wish that I could forgive you, but I feel it still
I wish that I could forget you, but I never will
To tell the truth, I just want my youth back
The life that was ripped from me
