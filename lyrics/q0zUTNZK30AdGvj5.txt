Your scarlet hour
Is here even now
Holding my mind
With your second sign

Mesmerise

Leaving
What's mine
I'm with you
All the time
Reach me
And you'll find
I watch you
Come alive

Don't stop to follow
Dream for tomorrow
Never have shine
Have second sign

Mesmerise
Mesmerise

Leaving
What's mine
I'm with you
All the time
Reach me
And you'll find
I watch you
Come alive

Mesmerise
Mesmerise
Mesmerise
