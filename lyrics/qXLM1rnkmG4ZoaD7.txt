I felt the first real sting
Right about the time that you let it ring,
Left me high and dry
Now I can see your letting go
I tried to walk these streets
Hoping that my feet wouldnt fail me
Waiting for a sign
Now I can see youre letting go
Hold on
Cause I dont think that I can save us baby
But hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go oh oh oh
We got so high
We cant come down
So hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go
We had a real good thing
Right about the time that you fell for me
Used to hold me tight
But I can see youre letting go
I tried to walk these streets
Hoping that my feet wouldnt fail me
Waiting for a sign
But I can see youre letting go
Hold on
Cause I dont think that I can save us baby
But hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go oh oh oh
We got so high
We cant come down
So hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go
I dont feel like letting go oh oh oh
Letting go oh oh oh
I dont feel like letting go
Letting go oh oh oh
I dont feel like letting go
Letting go oh oh oh
Hold on
Cause I dont think that I can save us baby
But hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go oh oh oh
We got so high
We cant come down
So hold on
Cause I dont feel like letting go
