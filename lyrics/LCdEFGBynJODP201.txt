Lie...

Walls full of eyes
Staring you, whispering lies
You're not justified to die
But they want you to eat yourself alive

Punished in the Chamber of Eyes

"Show your allegiance.
Munch yourself, be our servant forever"

Forever...

With tears in your eyes you start to masticate
Those whispering eyes, no more silent, laughing at your fate
