Something bout your confidence
has got me baby on the fence
and I know that my love is falling
down down down down

Lately I cant get no sleep
I wish that I could just count sheep
but in my in my mind your going
round round round round

Wish that I could just let you go

My mama warned me
it aint no mystery
you're gonna walk out that door

Woaaah oh

Your kiss I cant take
hey you should stay away
I only want want you more
cuz you ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

You're the lucky strike outside the bar
you're the last drink that takes me too far
and hun you're the one who really drives me crazy

Even when I say I'm done
there's no way I could save my heart from you
and the hold you got on me baby

My mama warned me
it ain't no mystery
you're gonna walk out that door

Wooaahoh

Your kiss I can't take
hey you should stay away
I only want want you more
you ain't no good for me

ooooooh

Woaahoh

Your kiss I can't take
hey you should stay away
I only want want you more
cuz you ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

No your no no good
ain't no good for me

Ooooh oooh

Wish that I could just let you go

My mama warned me
it ain't no mystery
you're gonna walk out that door

Your kiss I can't take
hey you should stay away
I only want want you more

My mama warned me
it ain't no mystery
you're gonna walk out that door

Your kiss I can't take
hey you should stay away
I only want want you more
cuz you aint no good for me
