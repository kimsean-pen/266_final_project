Winter is blue
Living is gone
Some are just sleeping
In spring they'll go on
Our love is dead
Nothing but crying
Love will not find even
One more new morning

Why must i stay here
Rain comes i'm sitting here
Watching love moving
Away into yesterday

Winter is blue
Everything's leaving
Fires are now burning
And life has no reason
I am alone
Waiting for nothing
If my heart freezes
I won't feel the breaking

Why must i stay here
Rain comes i'm sitting here
Watching love moving
Away into yesterday
