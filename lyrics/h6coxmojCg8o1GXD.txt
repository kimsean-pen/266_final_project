Said papa gon' roll one for me
He gon' get me lit, keep my everyday smoke
Baby let it pour right through me
Give me one more hit of that eveyrday nasty, so nasty
Light me up, till my problems straight past me
And baby let it fall right through me

I said me and my backwood
Ooh we be vibing so good
(Aha, aha, aha)
I roll it like sushi, such a beautiful tease
(Aha, aha, aha)
You gon' when I count to three

Said papa gon' get your money
I know they need a hit of that eveyrday smoke
I know you bring it right back to me
Cause they get me so lit
I can't take it no reckless, so reckless
Light me up like barbeque in Texas
Said baby let it fall right through me

I said me and my backwood
Ooh we be vibing so good
(Aha, aha, aha)
I roll it like sushi, such a beautiful tease
(Aha, aha, aha)
You gon' when I count to three
I know you can't stay

Sweet bliss when I'm smoking you
I said I know you can't stay
Count to tres, we back to blue
You got me feeling some type of way
Tell me what is a girl to do till you back my way
