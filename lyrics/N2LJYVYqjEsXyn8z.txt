Sipping tequila after dark
Wasn't that, gave us the head start
The world is our playing park
And I'm crossed arms with my lucky charm

Wild child and cherry bizarre
Running down the aisles, life sparkle bizarre
Not a care for a while, no one knows who we are
You know I'd chase you oceans far

Roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in the way

Oh roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in our way

We're all men 'cause we stray for a while
Creatures that live just for the night
I can stay out as long as I like
'Cause no one's calling me to come back inside

Woo!

So what we put off the rest
They're so awkward in our presence
We don't give a fuck; they're not our friends
And you give me superhuman strength

And I can be whatever I want
But you can't be free, not once you're caught
You told me then that we would never run
You sold me then that we would never rot

Roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in the way

Oh roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in our way

We're all men 'cause we stray for a while
Creatures that live just for the night
And I can stay out as long as I like
'Cause no one's calling me to come back inside

Hey hey, it's just a little heartbreak!
Hey hey, it's just a little heartbreak!
Hey hey, it's just a little heartbreak!
Hey hey, it's just a little heartbreak!

Roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in the way

Oh roller coaster, just to have a little fun
Won't listen to any caution
We're the breakers on the waves
And we'll break hearts, break hearts, break
Yeah we'll break hearts, break hearts, break hearts that get in our way!
