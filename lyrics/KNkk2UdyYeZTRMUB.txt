Crystal clear
Reveal to me
A view unobscured
Pass through the gate
Emerge and consecrate
Negative plane

Of coming to sentience from unbeing
To find... discovering
An inherent asymmetry
Drenched in absurdity

Non-existence is a divine state
Without the imposition
Of values
Or emotions

Soaked in nihility
Worshiped and revered

Traverse the aether into the affliction
Cursed by unavoidable states
And sentenced to suffer
Better to dwell in the void
Than ache with torment
For even the most fleeting juncture
Longing for the godliness of inverted immortality

No pain, how minuscule,
Is worth enduring or bearing
No pleasure can overcome
The slightest suffering or misery

The impending conclusion
Dripping with truth
The fate that consumes
Divine anhedonia
