It's undeniable
But we can see
That we're all beautiful
It's more than physical
More than skin deep
'Cause we're all magical

You won't find it in the mirror
Gotta look a little deeper

Look inside, just look inside, it's all inside
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
What you see is all you need, you got the key
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
'Cause the truth is in there

It's unbelievable
How strong we are
We can go anywhere
No limit to how far
No dreams unreachable
So take that doubt
And kick it out the door
And then just lock it out

I know sometimes you don't know it
But the power's here, so own it

Look inside, just look inside, it's all inside
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
What you see is all you need, you got the key
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
'Cause the truth is in there

You can see it
You can reach it
Just believe it
You can do anything

Look inside, just look inside, it's all inside
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
What you see is all you need, you got the key
'Cause the truth is in there
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
'Cause the truth is in there, oh oh oh
'Cause the truth is in there
