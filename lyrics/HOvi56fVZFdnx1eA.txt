I call my needs from a blinding sun
With everything and all I want
You were calling me
I heard it in the morning breeze

Watch your breath consume you
Suffer now seems far to soon

I broke my legs in a city street
to show you what you mean to me
With words to songs you'll never read
Just to feel alive subconsciously

Draw my keys off from the desk
Just wont know all the things we said

Everyone knows life's deathless
Why cant it feel more like this?

It isn't hard to understand
entitlement and where we are
Another day will cycle through
and turn away the present truth
Back on my knees, from a blinding sun
With everything and all I want
and you were calling me
I heard it in the morning breeze

I call my needs from a blinding sun
With everything and all I want
and you were calling me
I heard it in the morning breeze
