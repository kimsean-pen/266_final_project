Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind

Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just... spank me
Mmm!

Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back
And ooh, I'm in ecstasy

Don't slobber me with kisses (mm, mm)
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky, you better...

Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna hanky panky (just wanna)
Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna (just wanna) hanky panky guy

Ooh!

Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree

'Cause I don't like a big softie
(No!)
I like someone mean and bossy
Let me speak to you frankly, you better...

Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna hanky panky (just wanna)
Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna (just wanna) hanky panky guy

Ooh, yeah!

What about?
Yeah!
That's an interesting...
Ooh!
My bottom hurts just thinking about it!

(She wants you to...)
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
(She needs you to...)
Even when I'm being good to you
(Wooh!)
I don't want you to thank me
(Don't thank her...)
You better...

Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna hanky panky (just wanna)
Like hanky panky
(Hanky panky!)
Nothing like a good spanky
(A good spanky!)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry (don't wanna cry)
I just wanna (just wanna) hanky panky guy

(Hanky panky)
Oooh, yeah
(A good spanky)
Get the picture?
(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna.)

That's the way I came into this world
(Hanky panky!)
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl"
(A good spanky!)
He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled
(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna.)
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it!
Yeah!
(Hanky panky!)

(A good spanky!)

(Don't wanna cry, I just wanna.)

(Hanky panky!)

(A good spanky!)
