I'm pulling my hair out
I can't get to sleep
The bed feels so empty
I can still smell you on me

A moment in space, the look on your face when I said "hello"
You stagger to mine, you're still on my mind; why do I feel so low?

It could have been forever but we'll never know
24 hours ago
The night was all we had and then I had to go
24 hours ago
We were lovers
24 hours ago

Where did the summer go?
Everybody's fallen in love
Hey, lover, I'm in limbo
I can still feel your touch

So look in my eyes and tell me you don't want to run away
I know I was bold, but life is too short to catch a heart so cold

It could have been forever but we'll never know
24 hours ago
The night was all we had and then I had to go
24 hours ago
We were lovers
Just 24 hours ago

How do we conceal that life is not what it should be?
Life is not what it seems
If you're fraying at the seams
Don't let your heart fray
24 hours ago
The night was all we had and then I had to go
24 hours ago
We were lovers
Just 24 hours ago
We were lovers
24 hours ago
24 hours ago
