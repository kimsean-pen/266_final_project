When I was a kid
I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly
And I could teach you for a fee
Broke every window in my hotel heart
When I was only 5 years old
The 12 years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice
Echo in my mind
Said 'son you got an angel, to chase the devil at the night'

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves"
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of have and have nots
And as I walked through that storybook life
I've been looking for an angel to chase the devil at the night
Oh! oh! oh!

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about love
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves"
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

Wave
Put your hands up and hands down
Wave
Put your hands up and hands down
Wave
Put your hands up and hands down

When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about life
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves"
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
