Dazed all day,
Stuck in a maze.
Sleepless knights,
Daydreamed fights.
Weapons drawn,
Protect your own.
Lives are lost,
Too high the cost.
No Peace for War,
She keeps the score.
The stakes are high,
Many will die.

Another war has begun.
With the loading of a gun,

In war, to kill is not a crime.
Another mother never said goodbye.

As the Echoes, of the battle cry, subside,
From a distance, a new wave comes alive.

As the Echoes, of the battle cry, subside,
From a distance, a new wave comes alive.

Sleepless knights,
Daydreamed fights.
Weapons drawn,
Protect your own.
Lives are lost,
Too high the cost.
No Peace for War,
She keeps the score.
The stakes are high,
Many will die...
We do things,
That can't be undone.
We fight a fight,
That can't be won.

Another war has begun.
With the loading of a gun,

In war, to kill is not a crime.
Another mother never said goodbye.

As the Echoes, of the battle cry, subside,
From a distance, a new wave comes alive.

As the Echoes, of the battle cry, subside,
From a distance, a new wave comes alive.
