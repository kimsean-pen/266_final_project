You're in my stars you know
Don't need no crystal ball to tell me so
Whispering in the air
Hoping that my words find you somewhere
Even when I close my eyes
I'll never recreate the time that flies
The consequence is hanging there
The sky will fall but I don't care

Chorus:
Meet me beneath my balcony and say
No one but you could ever fill my night
Be the sunlight in my every day
Underneath my balcony I'll say
No one but you could ever fill my night
Be the sunlight in my every day

Your love is haunting me
And all I want is more to set me free
Whispering in the air
Hoping that my words find you somewhere
Do you hear me call your name
I know we will never be the same
The consequence is hanging there
The sky will fall but I don't care

Chorus
