I'm gonna take my time
Make sure that the feeling's right
Instead of staying up all night
Wondering where you are
Miles and miles away
In a town in another state
I wanna know if you just can't take

The thought of us apart
If I'm gonna fall in love
There's gotta be more than just enough

I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high
I come from an empty town
Far away from the city sounds
I'd like to settle down someday
And I need to know your past

Something that'll take you back
'cause I wanna live like that one day
If I'm gonna fall in love

It's gotta be more than just enough
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high
You gotta love to own

Gotta live life like a rolling stone
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high
If I'm gonna fall in love
I can't stop wondering why
You're taking so long to find
Maybe I should just let go
But baby all I know...

Is I'm gonna fall in love
Someday, somewhere you'll show up
I'm gonna get that old feeling

I'm gonna get that old high
If I'm gonna fall in love
There's gotta be more than just enough
I gotta get that old feeling

I gotta get that old high
You gotta love to own
Gotta live life like a rolling stone
I gotta get that old feeling
I gotta get that old high
If I'm gonna fall in love
I gotta get that old high
I gotta get that old high
If I'm gonna fall in love
