You can lie
Until the stars align
Watch the tides
Unfold and unwind
You can run
With it 'til she smiles
How long
Must we carry the cross?

So far away from it all
So far away from it all

With the chord still trying to pry
In the dawn
Chasing fireflies
Just like they rise from the ground
Begins a world anew
And you're wearing the crown

So far away from it all
So far away from the tides

I can't find a ride

So far away from it all
So far away from the tides

So far away from it all
