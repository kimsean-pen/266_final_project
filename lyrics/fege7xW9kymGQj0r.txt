'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again and again

Lost into the dark
In a wilderness of nothing
Where do I start
When my world is self destructing
So confused, so confused

Nowhere to run
Need to numb this pain with something
Coming undone
Need to pull myself together
So confused, so confused

I'm coming undone
It's the beginning of the end

'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again and again
'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again

Where's the sun?
I'm still crawling in the darkness
Needing someone
To come put me back together
So confused, so confused

I'm coming undone
It's the beginning of the end

'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again and again
'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again

(It feels like I'm going under, under again)

So confused, so confused
So confused, so confused

'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again and again
'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again

('Cause when I'm losing my head)
It feels like I'm going under, under again
('Cause when I'm losing my head)
It feels like I'm going under, under again

'Cause when I'm losing my head
It feels like I'm going under, under again and again
