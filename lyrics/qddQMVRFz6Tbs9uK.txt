Open wide! Space and time
Distort the mind.
Constantly, we dance in sheets,
It feels so right to be so wrong.

Normal love set aside,
Leave your heart at the bedside...
Contaminate the air like you do,
Swear I'm telling you the truth.

Jaded masquerade.
No names.
Contradicting fates.
It's all the same.

I'm telling you the truth,
I'm telling you the truth, I swear...
I'm telling you the truth,
I'm telling you the truth, I swear!!!

I just want your attention baby,
Every sweat-soaked night, every taunting fight!!!
Lock the doors, turn off the lights,
Remove all your clothes!!!
Lock the doors, turn off the lights,
Remove all your clothes!!!

Jaded masquerade.
No names.
Contradicting fates.
It's all the same.

I'm telling you the truth,
I'm telling you the truth, I swear...
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the truth.

Lock the doors, turn off the lights,
Remove all your clothes!!!
Lock the doors, turn off the lights,
Remove all your clothes!!!
