My hopes are like embers lying around inside a fire bed
And your mind is a firewalker
It steps on them like they are dead

But I can grow
Inspite of all you know
You might not recognize me tomorrow
Yes, I can change
Inspite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like JOY, Like JOY

Me, I'm like a wild flame that catches on whatevers near
But your mind is a firewalker
It sets its course and never veers

But I can grow
Inspite of all you know
You might not recognize me tomorrow
Yes, I can change
Inspite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like JOY, Like JOY

Take offers from every side and give my attentions about anywhere
Well do I recognize my actions
I look like I'm so unaware
Like I don't care

But I can grow
Inspite of all you know
You might not recognize me tomorrow
Yes, I can change
Inspite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like JOY, Like JOY
