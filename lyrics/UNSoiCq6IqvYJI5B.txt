Maybe one day
I'll find a way
To make you say what you want to say
I'm hopin' you'll be
Da one that I see
And da one that I need

Now I'm gonna try, to make you feel da things that I feel inside
Now maybe you'll cry
But with you I just can't lie

Wooh wooh
Tell me now what you want from me baby
Wooh wooh
Is it love that you want from me baby, yeah

Tell me please
I'm on my knees
So I can set my mind at ease
There's always a way
To make you say
That you want to stay

Now just let me know
If I'm da one for you just let me know
'Cause I want to be
The only one that you see

Is it love, is it love or romance
Or a trick to keep me in a trance
Take it on like da moon around da world
I'm just a fool for you girl

Come down and don't keep me around
Take a trip with da sound
I want to let you know I'm not a fool for you
I will show you what you need to do

Boom! My heart is pumpin'
And just for you it is jumpin'
I want to take you here, want to take you there
Everyday we'll be humpin'

One time two times, tell ya
Gimme gimme your love and I'll hold ya
Make up your mind 'cause I need to know
Where to go
