Stigma
Fury
Throw him
Bound and gagged upon the soil
The red sun
Burning
Burning
Tear the soul of gods only son

Inhuman is elite
Anger
Release my breath
The violence burns in me
The words I speak to him of suffocating dark

Poison
Blind eye
Lashing
Bleeding shadows on the sun
The madness
Swirling
Swirling
Iesous

Constant suffering
Heaving breath
Cross hangs twisted round his neck

Inhuman is elite
Anger
Release my breath
The violence burns in me
The words I speak to him of suffocating dark

Eeso
Yeshua
Iesous
Absorb now this pain

Eeso
Yeshua
Iesous
Spirit encaged

Eeso
Yeshua
Iesous
All hope is slain

Eeso
Yeshua
Iesous
Die by our rage

Constant suffering
Heaving breath
Cross hangs twisted round his neck

Inhuman is elite
Anger
Release my breath
The violence burns in me
The words I speak to him of suffocating dark

The words I speak to him of suffocating dark
