I Made a promise to myself
Locked it way deep down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise

Oh I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light

Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have no choice

Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

Chorus
I believe in love
I believe in love
Love that's real
Love that's strong
Love that lives
On and on
Yes I believe in love

Repeat Chorus

"Tribute to America"
