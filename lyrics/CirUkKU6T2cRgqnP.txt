She sat right down on the sofa, I said,
Where have you been? I've been waiting for you,
'Cause last night I had something so good,
These days get so long and I got nothing to do.

I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town so long,
I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long.

We spend all day getting sober,
Just hiding from daylight, watching TV,
We just look a lot better in the blue light,
Well, you know I gotta get out,
But I'm stuck so tight,
Weighed by the chains that keep me.

Hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town too long,
I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long,
Well everybody twist.

This girl listens to the band play,
She says, where have you been?
I've been lying right here on the floor.
Well, I got all this time to be waiting,
For what is mine, to be hating what I am,
After the light has faded.

Hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town so long,
I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town for way to, way,
I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town for way long,
I been hangin' around this town on the corner,
I been bummin' around this old town for way,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long,
Way, way, way, way too long.
