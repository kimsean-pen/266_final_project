Been away, haven't seen you in a while
How've you been
Have you changed your style, and do you think
That we've grown up differently
Don't seem the same, seems you've lost your feel for me
So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho
I'm going back to a place that's far away
How 'bout you
Have you got a place to stay, why should I care
When I'm just trying to get along
We were friends, but now it's the end of our love song
So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho
So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh, oh-oh, ho
