You wanted help, but I am not the ambulance
To carry broken bodies back from suicidal tendencies
So take my breath, it's what you'll get
Another second to regret
The times you took and kept my everything
It's never been my selflessness
My car is not a taxi service
Cry into your pillow for the people who don't want you anymore
It was the perfect place to finally come through
Opportunities at funerals that aren't meant for you
You picked your place as the widow to a stranger
Shoot back your pride with pity as a chaser
And drunkenly drive yourself home
I hope you end up all alone
I know you just fell out of love
Soak up the feeling and know that it's what you deserve
And maybe if you wanted to mend what was broke
Then I'd understand where your empathy goes
The light in your chest is no longer exposed
The cold of your heart freezes ice to the roads
You know I'm broke
Each train of thought feels meaningless
If Bible School has taught you all the qualities you could improve
The cross around your neck has all but lost the purpose meant for you
So try and see yourself as what you are
That's righteous to yourself
As though your body isn't full of hell
You'll break over the pictures
Where your beauty once meant anything to me
In that church was the last time I saw you
I thought maybe you'd fix me
That's not how these things work
It was the perfect place to finally come through
Opportunities at funerals that aren't meant for you
You picked your place as the widow to a stranger
Shoot back your pride with pity as a chaser
And drunkenly drive yourself home
I hope you end up all alone
I know you just fell out of love
Soak up the feeling and know that it's what you deserve
It was the perfect place to finally come through
Opportunities at funerals that aren't meant for you
You picked your place as the widow to a stranger
Shoot back your pride with pity as a chaser
And drunkenly drive yourself home
I hope you end up all alone
I know you just fell out of love
Soak up the feeling and know that it's what you deserve
