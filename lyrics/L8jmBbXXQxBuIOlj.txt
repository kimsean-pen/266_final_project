i peeked inside of your gravity car
it won't go far with marbles found in a barnyard
i saw the distance between us and felt
for once in my life i believe what i'm saying

i peeked inside of your gravity car
through open fields past the graveyard
i guess i'm wrong when i say we won't get far
look where we are now
