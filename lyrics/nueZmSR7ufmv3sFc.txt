You have this certain something
You're my blues and my swing
No exaggeration
You're the greatest compilation
You are disintegration
My girl, my temptation

You're my rock steady beat
Maybelline in the drivers seat
You're the songs that bring a tear
Embrace the love, embrace the fear
Don't run to search for your heart
Love will tear us apart
You inspire devotion every emotion

You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything

You're the reason that I sing
You're my favorite everything
You're the reason that I sing
You're my favorite everything

No I won't waste my time trying to find
Another reason to love time after time

You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything
You're my favorite everything
