I know you independent
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me
I know you got a job
Who's the only one at home able to get you off?
It's me
I know you think you're better solo
But this is something that we both know
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me

I know that you're better on your own
And maybe for the night you can fuck with me
You think that you'd rather be alone
But I want you to see that I just
Need you but
I know that
You don't need a man
But you know
That
No
One can do it like I can wooh

Who gon' do it for ya
I know you're sayin' standards low
But that bar has gotta go
I'm the only one who movin' for ya
I know all your other exes let you down
I can never let you down
You just need to let me prove it for ya

Look I know what you like
I know that you're done with fuckbois
They ain't treat you right
Look I know you got a late shift
Workin' through the night
Independent bad bitch I ain't gotta tell it twice
So I'm like

I know you independent
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me
I know you got a job
Who's the only one at home able to get you off?
It's me
I know you think you're better solo
But this is something that we both know
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me

It's me
It's me
You already know it's me
It's me
It's me
You already know it's me wooh

You don't need no one to hold you down no you dont
You don't need no one to pay your bills no you dont
Payed your way through all your education congratulations
That's the reason why I fuck with you for real damn

We ain't gotta let nobody know no we dont
You know we ain't gotta take a photo
You know we can keep it on the low on the low
Will you want it? we ain't gotta be solo wooh

So tell me if you trynna go now
I can have a uber come and get us it's on the way
I know you came here with your girlfriends
We can go and tell 'em to forget us scurr scurr
You say you're leavin' in the morning
I know I can never make you stay make you stay
Because you never needed someone
People only gettin' in the way

I know you independent
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me
I know you got a job
Who's the only one at home able to get you off?
It's me
I know you think you're better solo
But this is something that we both know
If you want that kind of night
You know I can fuck you right
Whachu missin' in your life is me
