You told me
How the world will end
And I believed you
Because I always do
And you said to me
They don't stand a chance
Only we do

I don't want to lose what we have
I don't think you know how good it is

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

Where will I go

The people look at me
With a little sympathy
Cause it won't end
This chapter won't end
I won't let go
Of what I'm holding
I won't let go
I can't let go

I don't want to lose what we have
I don't think you know how good it is

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

Where will I go

I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go
Now I won't let go

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

Please don't leave
Please don't leave
Where will I go
Where will I go
