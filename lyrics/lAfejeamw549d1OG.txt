Strawberry design
In her mind
Strawberryshine
Her mind is a plane or window pane
It's all the same
Comming up on on a song, she dreams along
Then she is gone
Her dream is a fire, a streaming choir
Strawberryfire

So come trip on a stereo song
Drifting along with the radio on

Strawberry surprise
Oh what lies
In her green eyes
Her room I have seen
But I have not been
Into her dreams
Her dream is so sweet
Its all she needs
Just be a dream
Her dream is on fire, and shes so tired
Strawberryfire

So come trip on a stereo song
Drifting along with the radio on
