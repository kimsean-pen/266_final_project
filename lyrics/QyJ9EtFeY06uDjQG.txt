Waiting...
Waiting for you tonight
I'm dreaming you are here with me tonight

Someday...
I will be by your side
Together we climb mountain across the sea

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
None of this gone last forever

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
Love me till the end of time

Waiting...
I gone closed to you
Every time I see you, what you gonna do?

I'm waiting...
You gonna closed to me
No matter how the people want to say

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
And none of this gone last forever

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
Love me till the end of time

End of time
Its time...

(Solo Guitar)

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
And none of this gone last forever

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
Love me till the end of time

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
And none of this gone last forever

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
Love me till the end of time

Believe in me that you want it too
You never let somebody closed to you
Just promise me that you never let me down
Love me till the end of time
