Target on my back, lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sights
No surrender, no, trigger fingers go
Living the dangerous life

Everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up
They're knocking me down
Chewing me up, spitting me out

When I need to be saved
You're making me strong
You're making me stand
Never will fall, never will end

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave

You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory
In a stadium

Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired

You make me feel invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible

Here we go again, I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight
Every day we choose, we might win or lose
This is the dangerous life

Everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone
They say that they've won
The bell has been rung, it's over and done

When I need to be saved
They're counting me out
But this is my round
You in my corner, look at me now

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave

You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory
In a stadium

Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired

You make me feel invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible

Invincible
You make me feel
Feel

You make me feel invincible
You make me feel invincible

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Not gonna stop, invincible

Feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory in a stadium

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave

You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory
In a stadium

Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired

You make me feel invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
