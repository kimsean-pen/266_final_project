No way, no why
No care, no cry
No way, no sign
So so fine

The way I see it
This relationship ain't right
The space between us
Listen here, listen
Better close it up tonight

No way, no why
No care, no cry

The space between us
Close it up tonight

No way, no sign
So clear so fine

The way I see it
This relationship ain't right
The space between us
Listen here, listen, listen here, listen
We better close it up tonight

No way, no why
(The space)
No care, no cry
(The space)

No way, no sign
(The space)
So clear so fine
(The space)

No way, no why
(The space)
No way, no why
