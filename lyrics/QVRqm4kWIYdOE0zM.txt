You better put that down
You better put that down

All I need is a bottle
And I don't need no friends, no
Wallow in my pain
I swallow as I pretend
To act like I'm happy
When I drink till no end, no
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end

She says
Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground

When I'm sober, life bores me
So I get drunk again, yeah
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end

She says
Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground

Yeah!!!

You better sit back down
You better put that down
Put the bottle down

I am on a binge!!!

Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground

Yeah!!!

I am on a binge
I wish things would change
Wished they'd rearrange
I'm on a binge
I wish things would change
Wished they'd rearrange
I am on a binge

I am on a binge!!!

Yeah! Yeah!
