My Vampire, my vampire's fine
My vampire, my vampire's OK

He wants to break the rules I've made
He wants to crash my castle gate
Prince of Darkness you wake up too late
I hurt too, I miss you huh

Oh no, it's all a mess
Don't know if I should undress
The wounds you want to caress
I made it to the other side

Now I don't hurt no more
And you try knock down that door
You should have been there before
I made it to the other side

da na da da na da la
da na da da na da la
da na da da na da la
da na da

And now the sun is coming up
You pull away you've had enoughn
We got too close you're burning up.
