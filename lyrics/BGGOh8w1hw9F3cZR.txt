Step inside the maiden ride
It helps if you don't breathe
Patronize and criticize
And welcome to the scene

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

Hide behind another crime
The benefit's so sweet
It's alright it's just this time
The purity's unclean

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here

Realize just what's inside
We sink before we bleed
Some may run and some may hide
But that's alright with me

I hope it comes out right
It's just a little lie

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here
From here

It's the only way to go from here
The only way to go from here
From here
