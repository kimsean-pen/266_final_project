The murdering words
Words like forever
Violent and tender
They bind us together

Something in the sky
Looking down on you
At your every move
There's no use in crying

Something in the sky
Looking down on you
Something in the sky
Aligning

Innocence idifferent
We drop to our knees
Such a treason
Such a need

Dreaming
The end of
Dreaming
Of the end

Something in the sky
Looking down on you
At your every move
There's no use in crying

Something in the sky
Looking down on you
Something in the sky
Aligning

Something in the sky
Looking down on you
At your every move
There's no use in crying
