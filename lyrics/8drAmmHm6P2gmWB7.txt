How did you get me so damn controllable?
It's impossible, leaving your bed
We both know that we got things to do
But it ain't stopping you, we're starting again

Oh, I tell my friends I'm sorry
Oh, I had to miss the party
Oh, my phone was in the other room when I put my hands on you

When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
With one touch I lose all my senses
I can't help it when I put my hands, hands, hands on you

It's like a movie starring you and me
And when you take the lead, I play along
The way you move is like a symphony
And it gets louder, and louder, and louder, and louder

Oh, I tell my friends I'm sorry
Oh, I had to miss the party
Oh, my phone was in the other room when I put my hands on you

When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
With one touch I lose all my senses
I can't help it when I put my hands, hands, hands on you

When I put my hands all over your body
Got no where to go, I cancelled my plans
I pull all the curtains, I turn off all the lights and put it to bed
You leave me no options
I'm getting so lost in those hips and
Those eyes, got me so hypnotised, yeah

When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
Oh when I put my hands, hands, hands on you
With one touch I lose all my senses
I can't help it when I put my hands, hands, hands on you
(Can't help it when I put my hands)
When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
(When I put my hands) When I put my hands, hands, hands on you
With one touch I lose all my senses
I can't help it when I put my hands, hands, hands on you, oh yeah
