One look, twice sold, three for the way she looks at me
Held up, let down, she sings me silent melodies
Hair whipped, tight lipped, I been calling out for you
Cold sweat, once met, can't stand the way she looks at me

Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies (Whoowhoo)
And don't you tell me no truths, just all of your lies (Whoowhoo)
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies

Ho yeah, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway

One look, twice bold, three, four, I'm on my knees for her
Held up, let down, she sings me perfect harmonies
She fakes, heart breaks, I'd take just a part of you
Those eyes, sweet lies, I've been drowning out for you

Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies (Whoowhoo)
Don't leave your money at home, just a word to the wise (Whoowhoo)
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies

Ho yeah, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

So don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies (Whoowhoo)
And don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies (Whoowhoo)
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies, hehey

Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

Give me none of your truths, I want all of your lies (Hohoo, Whoowhoo)
Don't leave your money at home, just a word to the wise (Whoowhoo)
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies (Whoowhoo)

So give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
