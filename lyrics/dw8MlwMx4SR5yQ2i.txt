Ingest the fluid and drown.
Infest them I control the dead,
Tearing out the crown.

Existence destroyed,
The underworld of death.
Displace them through such agony,
Left to eternal rest.

Suffering through anxiety and burden,
A legion of an undead hoard.
Indulging on blood that's dripping,
A massacre that I won't stop.
Kill,
Kill.
I want to kill.
End everything I seek.

Torturing I seek a human life,
Slay them all as we maul,
Deep into the carcass.
Strife is waged,
Arise infernal existence,
Cast down.

End them,
End everything I seek.
End them,
End everything I seek.

Torture,
Infest,
Torturing I seek a human life,
Infesting I carve deep inside.

Infernal I am the creation,
Ingest the fluid and drown.
Infest them I control the dead,
Tearing out the crown.

Existence destroyed,
The underworld of death.
Displace them through such agony,
Left to eternal rest.
