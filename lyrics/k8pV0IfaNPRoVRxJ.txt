Ever since you met me
In this busy town
You tried to melt my cold heart
But I never was a good one
You used to give me roses
And hide your own pain
Lately I don't feel like
We could be the same
Maybe I will call you baby
No one wants to be alone
When love is gone
Maybe I will call you baby
Never pick up the phone
When love is gone
Thirty eight days have passed
Since you've been gone
I stay away from my friends
And keep staring at a ceiling fan
I had to leave it like this
And stop where emotions start
Lately I don't feel like
We should be apart
Maybe I will call you baby
No one wants to be alone
When love is gone
Maybe I will call you baby
Never pick up the phone
When love is gone
