Listen baby
thoughts has crossed my mind
and it's clear now
you are not my kind
oh! I've tried boy
better ways to say
what I feel now
it seems you plan to stay
but I won't waste a day
so I say...

hey! get out of my way
hey! hey! hey!
you've always been in my way

Hear now honey
I'll be good to you
if you stay gone
far out of my view
I'm sick and tired
of your dramatic ways
and when I think of
all those wasted days
I shake loose of your laces
and say...

hey! get out of my way
hey! hey! hey!
you've always been in my way

this is all that I will say
this is all that I will do
I'm not in love with you!
