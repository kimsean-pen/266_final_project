Run away with me in July
To the same place and be ourselves
In the ashes of the aftermath, pray

Call me, say you wash away your worry
It's the call that you made out to me
In the ashes of the aftermath, pray

Hey
Tell me something
Is there anything you wouldn't do for me?
I will walk with you
Show my heart believes in something, pray
Courageous and light

Please, darling
Believe in something
I want you to be yourself around me
I know it's too much to take
There's too much at stake
And I want you to be yourself around me

Please
Please

Please, darling
Believe in something
I want you to be yourself around me
I know it's too much to take
There's too much at stake
But I want you to be yourself around me

Praise
Praise
Praise
Take me to the night
