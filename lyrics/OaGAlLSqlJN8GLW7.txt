Awake in a slumbering world
As structures outside cave in
So harbor us, sweet sorrow
This lonely, exquisite hollow

Oh, mother on conscious dark sails...
In your theatre of sirens, hear us!

They see us weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split to two,
With love and defiance

From the distance they came,
Covered in ask
There's no hope in this lifeless void
Which aired of parasite tongues

Oh, mother on conscious dark sails...
In your theatre of sirens, hear us!

They see us weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split to two,
With love and defiance

As a speck in the cosmic ocean you sail
Trapped in ill-shaped tales with your grin
And your gods of death

They see us weeping the newborn horizon
We are here split to two,
With love and defiance

They see us weeping the newborn horizon
They are here in spirit and flesh
With love and defiance
