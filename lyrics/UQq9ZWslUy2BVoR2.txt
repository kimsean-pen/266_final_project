I lie awake on a long dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killin' me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
No, maybe I can't accept the life that's mine

Simple livin' is my desperate cry
Been tradin' love with indifference
An', yeah, it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah
Maybe that's why I feel so alone

'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together

I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
No, it just won't heal, no, no, no
The sun shines and I can't avoid the light
I think I'm holdin' on to life too tight

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Sometimes I feel like givin' up, yeah
I said, sometimes I feel like givin' up
'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels

And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
It just won't heal, no
The day reminds me of you
The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice
Speaking to you
Take all this pride
And leave it behind
'Cause one day it ends

One day we die
Believe what you will
That is your right
But I choose to win
I choose to fight, to fight
'Cause me I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And It just won't
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
