Through devotion
Blessed are the children
Praise the teacher
That brings true love to many

Your devotion
Opens all life's treasures, yeah
And deliverance
From the fruits of evil

So our mission
To bring a melody
Ringin' voices, woo hoo
Sing sweet harmony

For you here's a song
To make your day brighter
One that will last you long
Through troubled days

Giving your heart, ooh
The light to brighten
Oh, oh, oh, all of the dark
That falls in your way

You need devotion
Bless the children, whoa
Deliverance
From the fruits of evil

In everyone's life
There's a need to be happy
Let the sun shine
A smile your way

Open your heart
Feel a touch of devotion
Maybe this song
Will help uplift your day
Make a better way

You need devotion
You need devotion
Bless the children
Deliver from the fruits of evil

You need devotion
You need devotion
Bless the children
Why don't you bless the children
Deliver from the fruits of evil

You need devotion
You need devotion
Bless the children
