Did you ever see anyone? (Sleepin' on the streets)
Did you ever know anyone? (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.
Speech trial come and lead my palms. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Soil pressed to the knees and below. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.
Because standing tall will make you grow. (Sleepin' on the streets)
But only sharp eyes ever know. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.

Tell me where we plan to be.
Tell me where we plan to be.

That sugar met the cinnamon,
Babyboy's born a gentleman. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Only love for everyone. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.
My piano begs to take him home. (Sleepin' on the streets)
But he's got those keys in his nose. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.
That dance about in skipping views. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Got my only son feeling so low. (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.

Tell me where we plan to be.
Tell me where we plan to be.

I'll be digging up these crops like snails licking,
Leaving lips like living trails.
Bodies dragging down against the earth,
They said: "don't you squeal, I know a pig when I sees one."
Coming up about the bend, it's a long and quiet road ahead,
Still they're talking, talking, talking, talking, talking
And always moving while we're sleeping.
While we're sleeping.

Did you ever see anyone? (Sleepin' on the streets)
Did you ever know anyone? (Sleepin' on the streets)
Slip out your arrows in tongues,
Oh I, I'll dance on that cross.
Did you ever see anyone?
Did you ever know anything?

Tell me where we plan to be.
