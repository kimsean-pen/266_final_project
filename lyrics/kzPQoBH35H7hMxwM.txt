How can you be sleeping?
Waves like weapons crash
O'er us, cry for mercy
And hold fast hope
Hope

Who of us is cursed, or do we have to ask?
Search your souls and hold fast
If no one speaks a word, then let the lots be cast
Truth be told and hold fast

White death wakes in black skies
Mark your maker's wrath
Fear and flames of azure
Climb the crooked mast
You will yet be baptized
Steeped in shattered glass
Sink and sing your answer
And hold fast

As strong arms grip your shoulders
Like dead hands of your past
Pray as you're tossed over
This breath could be your last

Quiet and cold
Silent and slow
Night black as coal
Miles here below

Find your faith and dive deep
Through living gateways pass
Lined with death and ivory
And hold fast, hold fast

Deep beneath the black dawn
Leagues from lightning's flash
Ribs will raise cathedrals
For the morning mass
Steel yourself in sackcloth
Roll your heart in ash
Scrape your skin with steel wool
And hold fast

Ribs will raise cathedrals
For the morning mass
Scrape your skin with steel wool
Cross your heart and hold fast hope
Hold fast hope
Hold fast hope.
