Dear Theodosia
How to say to you?
Sometime last night
Your mother breathed your name
And like a flame
That flickers out too soon
She died
She's gone

She dedicated every day to you
She changed my life
She made my life worthwhile
And when you smile
I know a part of her lives on
I know I can go on

You have come of age with our young nation
We bleed and fight for you
Sometimes it seems that's all we do

And you and I will build a strong foundation
And I'll be here for you
The way is clear for you
To blow us all away (some day)
Some day, some day
Blow us all away (some day)
Some day, some day
Blow us all away (some day)
Some day
Oooh
Some day
Blow us all away
Some day
