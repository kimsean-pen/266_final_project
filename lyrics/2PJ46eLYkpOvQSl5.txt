I just want to feel your warmth
I think of feelings that I can't stop
I don't want to wait to feel warm enough to stay and not feel cold.

To be at ease
Promise to me.
To be at ease
Promise to me.

These feelings are all I want
Feeling new ways that I can't show
But girl it feels okay, the moon is still a plane, all alone.

To be at ease
Promise to me.
To be at ease
Promise to me.
