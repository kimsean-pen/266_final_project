Am I the only one that saw the sun burn out?
The locusts keep their rhythm, my watch is broken down
I wake up and take on water, sink to the peak of despair
What I need is a cigarette, no more prayers

The planets unaligned
We are saints without a shrine

A storm comes and the city's abandoned
The ship is going down with the captain
Oh, oh
A storm comes and the city's abandoned
The ship is going down with the captain
Oh, oh

I am the man that sank Atlantis
I am the man that sank Atlantis
I am the man that sank Atlantis
The bottom is not the lowest we get

Further down still the dark's absolute
And further down than that, it's only me and you

I assure you that Hell is not a myth
We both vacation there
Hell is not a myth
We spend each winter there, no one can prepare

A storm comes and the city's abandoned
The ship is going down with the captain
Oh, oh
A storm comes and the city's abandoned
The ship is going down with the captain
Oh, oh

I am the man that sank Atlantis
I am the man that sank Atlantis
I am the man that sank Atlantis
The bottom is not the lowest we get
I thought I knew the best part of the secret
I thought I knew the best part of the secret
I thought I knew the best part of the secret
The truth is the thing we forget

The glory I had witnessed was just a sleight of hand
These hearts cannot be salvaged, these bones cannot withstand
I have either been forgotten or I was never seen
Now I'm in the negative space between

I've weighed down the earth
Through the stars to the pavement
I've weighed down the earth
No use trying to save it
I've weighed down the earth
Through the stars to the pavement
I've weighed down the earth
Not sure I can take it

I've fallen out of frame
A strangled, distant flame

Clenched in the jaws of anguish are only godless men
Chaos is drawn to silence, like life is drawn to death
The dusk is so much clearer than the dawn had ever been
I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost, and yet

I've weighed down the earth
Through the stars to the pavement
I've weighed down the earth
No use trying to save it
I've weighed down the earth
Through the stars to the pavement
I've weighed down the earth
No use trying to save it
