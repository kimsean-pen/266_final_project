I'm at the stage
Where everything I thought meant something
Seems so unappealing
I'm ready for the real thing
But nobody's selling
Except you and yours
Saying open up your eyes and ears
And let me in

You must be out of your brilliant mind

You're at the stage
You want your empty words heard
And everybody's ready
They want to know your secret
But you are not telling
You're just gesturing saying open up your arms and hearts
And let me in

You must be out of your brilliant mind

I'm at the stage
Where I want my words heard
When no one wants to listen
Because everybody's yelling
About you and yours
And how I'd have the answer if I'd only open up, up, up
And let you in

They must be out of their brilliant minds

I said shame
Shame on you
Shame
Shame on you
Shame
Shame on you

You must be out of your brilliant mind
And they must be out of their brilliant minds
Everyone out of their brilliant minds
I'm must be out of my brilliant mind
My brilliant mind
