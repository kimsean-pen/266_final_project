I take two steps forward and don't look back
I buried my soul just to cover my tracks
So I'm like a dirty cop with blood on my hands
And I know it won't be long

I'm smoking cigarettes in the laundry mat
I'm wonderin what's next and where it's at
I got a future that's full with dirty cash
Oh I know it won't be long

Have you ever done something so wrong?
Won't you come a little bit closer to me?
Come a little bit closer

They've got a thousand bucks bounty on my head
The power line is down and they want us dead
I gotta know right now, baby are you in?
Cause that door don't look too strong

Did you move all alone?
Won't you come a little bit closer to me?
Come a little bit closer now
Just a little bit closer
Oh, a little bit close to me

Everyone pities someone else
And eyes are red, they don't hold sense
But she keeps dancing in company

So come a little bit closer to me
Come on, baby
Come a little bit closer now
Just a little bit close baby
Come a little bit closer to me
