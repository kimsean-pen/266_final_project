Screaming, all night
Rip me up from paradise
Big words, small lies
Out to get me every time

Lost in your heartbeat, body moving on mine
Caught in the madness, doubt the feeling, desire
Cause I know that you're trouble, and I know that it ain't right
But I want you, and I can't get enough

Of your wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
Hurts when I hold ya
Wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
But it's worse when it's over

You're no good for me
This ain't how it oughta be
But you're like honey
I get stuck when you get sweet

Lost in your heartbeat, body moving on mine
Caught in the madness, doubt the feeling, desire
Cause I know that you're trouble, and I know that it ain't right
But I want you, and I can't get enough

Of your wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
Hurts when I hold ya
Wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
But it's worse when it's over

It's kinda, criminal
When you mess with my head
But it turns me, turns me on
Everytime I see red

Of your wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
Hurts when I hold ya
Wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
But it's worse when it's over
Wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
Hurts when I hold ya
Wicked love, wicked love, wicked love, wicked love
But it's worse when it's over
