How do we alwyse do this?
We turn ourselves round,
Remember those sweets memories
Use to suit, use to make me smile
We put all our ...we live in cry baby
But we never be,
I know that I be caught
But baby I ain't got no solo
Our memorise, those sweer sugar thoghts
They ca.it's have ot be, it's have to be
We put all .we live in cry baby
But we never be marry
Give me time baby
I need time, have to be time, I gotta have time
There is a leap of faith
You, you,
Gotta grass is greenes
I know baby cuz I'll be there
I know baby, I know baby
I don't feel it, I don't feel it
Time, time, time, I need time
There is a leap of faith
Time, time, time, time ooh, ooh
I can't have you know, I can have you, know
I can do nothing
