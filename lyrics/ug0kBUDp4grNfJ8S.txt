State of love and trust as I
Busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and preaches but to have an empty court
And the signs are passin'
Grip the wheel, can't read it
Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands

And I listen
For the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself

Lay her down as priest does
Should the Lord be accountin'
Will be in my honor, make it pain, painfully quick
Promises are whispered
In the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end, end

And the barrel shakes aimed
Directly at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself
And I listen
From both sides of the bed
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Myself, myself

Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Wanna back, back it away

And I listen
For the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Oh, and the barrel waits
Trigger shakes
Aimed right at my head
Won't you help me
Help me from myself?

State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and
