What happened to this morning when I woke up hung over?
What happened to the people walking hand in hand?
Let's treat this day like a newborn baby wants to be looked after
Let's treat this moment like one never felt before

Everybody walk hand in hand
Get hold of your leg, push together
Everybody get over, hey! you turned up too late
That trick's over

What happened to the story when the lightness go of darkness?
What happened to that ray of sunshine she was fighting strong?
No more delay, no more competing for a happy ever or after
Today we play in one team, yes there's one team for all

Everybody walk hand in hand
Get hold of your leg, push together
Everybody get over, hey! you turned up too late
That trick's over

We won't run bleeding weak from strong,
Knowing right from wrong
What happened to this morning when I woke up
And the world was bruised?

See, everybody's taking care of themselves
Not looking out of the widest window
Somehow everybody's taking care of themselves
But not no one else, what happened to this morning
We're stiffening(?) our love

Everybody walk hand in hand
Get hold of your leg, push together
Everybody get over, hey! you turned up too late
That trick's over

What happened to this morning when we woke up hung over?
Like it's only forever
What happened to that day when the people walked hand in hand

Together, man
Let's treat this day like a newborn baby
who wants to be taken care of
What happened to this morining? We're stiffening our love
What happened to that day?
