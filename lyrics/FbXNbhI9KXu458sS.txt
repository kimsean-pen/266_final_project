I've got no clue what you're thinking
You move your hand away from mine
Shifty eyes and indecisions
Why does this happen every time?

Won't somebody hold me and tell me
It'll all work out
Say that there's nothing
To worry about now
'Cause I'm so sick of the drama
And I hate to shout
But you drag it out of me

Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your tears don't faze me
Say something before I go crazy now

(I go crazy, I go)
(I go crazy, I go)
I go crazy now
(I go crazy, I go)
(I go crazy, I go)

I feel like all of this has aged me
Right on the edge of twenty-two
You look like you've just seen a monster
Is that what I look like to you?

Won't somebody hold me and tell me
It'll all work out
Say that there's nothing
To worry about now
'Cause I'm so sick of the drama
And I hate to shout
But you drag it out of me

Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your tears don't faze me
Say something before I go crazy now

(I go crazy, I go)
(I go crazy, I go)
I go crazy now
(I go crazy, I go)
(I go crazy)

It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time

Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
My tears, your fears amaze me
But I'm still so devoted to you it scares me

Three words, two hearts, one maybe
Say something before I go crazy now
And my tears, your fears don't faze me
Just say something before I go crazy now

(I go crazy, I go)
(I go crazy, I go)
I go crazy now
(I go crazy, I go)
I go crazy now
(I go crazy, I go)
I go crazy now
(I go crazy, I go)
(Ooh I go crazy, I go)

It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
It's only a matter of time, a matter of time, a matter of time
