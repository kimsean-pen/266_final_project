I've heard that love makes the world go 'round.
Well, if that's true, she must be turning real slow.
Cause these days I find more and more lonely people
Everywhere I go.
And they're reaching out for love, but they can never get enough.

CHORUS:
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Well, it's never enough; No, it's never too much;
Nobody gets too much love.

Bigger and better in the nineteen nineties
Has got so many people working their lives away.
Reaching out for the finer things,
They've found that there's a price to pay.
And there reaching out for love, but they can never get enough.

CHORUS:
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Well, it's never enough; No, it's never too much;
Nobody gets too much love.

A little bit of company, is something everybody needs.
The touch of a hand, a little romance; someone who understands.
A nation of young has taken to the streets
Looking for somewhere they can call their own.
And they're running against their will, they'll say
Trying to find a home.

CHORUS:
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Nobody, nobody gets too much love.
Well, it's never enough; No, it's never too much;
Nobody gets too much love.
