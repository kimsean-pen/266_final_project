This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing
This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing

I've made promises that I know I can't keep
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend
But he'll have my back until the bitter end

Always climbing but only ever descending
The canvas before me is never-ending

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods
If I drop this torch, then I'll be gone for good
I said: "Enough is enough"
Well, I guess I lied, I guess I lied

This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing
This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing

All my mistakes will outlive me
I just can't accept that what will be will be
My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath
I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose

Always climbing but only ever descending
The canvas before me is never-ending

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods
If I drop this torch, then I'll be gone for good
I said: "Enough is enough"
Well, I guess I lied, I guess I lied

I wasted time building castles in the air
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose
This is the path I chose
This is the path I chose

I wasted time building castles in the air
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose
