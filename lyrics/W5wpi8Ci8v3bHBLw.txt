I wrote my lover, yeah, I wrote my lover today
The little letter gonna have to go a long, long way
I miss my lover, yeah, I write a letter everyday
The only thing is that my lover don't ever write me

Yeah
I want a letter to read

All that I have
All that I have loved is lost in the past
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read all alone, me and your memory
Before I let go
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read

I wait all day by the mailbox on the street
The postmen don't stop he just walks past me
Maybe it's the way that it's meant to be, yeah
Maybe it's the way I'm supposed to grieve

Yeah
I want a letter to

All that I have
All that I have loved is lost in the past
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read all alone, me and your memory
Before I let go
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read

Life is just a syllable and plays the same
So is it just a little overkill writing the days away?

I wrote my lover, yeah, I wrote my lover today
The little letter gonna have to go a long, long way

I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter

All that I have
All that I have loved is lost in the past
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read all alone
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
Before I let go
I want a letter, want a letter, want a letter
To read
