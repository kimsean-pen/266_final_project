When I see my baby,
What do I see,
Poetry,
Poetry in Motion

Poetry in Motion, walking by my side, her lovely locomotion,
Keeps my eyes open wide.
Poetry in Motion, see her gentle sway, on a wave out on the
Ocean, could never move that way.

I Love every Movement, and there's nothing I would change,
She doesn't need improvement, she's much too nice to
Arrange.
Poetry In Motion, dancin' close to me, a flower of the devotion,

For all the world to see.
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe

A-woe
Poetry in Motion, see her gentle sway, on a wave out on the
Ocean, could never move that way.
I Love every Movement, and there's nothing I would change,

She doesn't need improvement, she's much too nice to
Arrange.
Poetry In Motion, all that I adore, no number 9 love potion could make me love you more
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
A-woe woe woe woe woe woe
