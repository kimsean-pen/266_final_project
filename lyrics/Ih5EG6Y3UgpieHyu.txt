Remembering the days when our love began
Thinking of a million ways to escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

Dreaming 'bout you, I keep dreaming 'bout you
And I'm dreaming 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We could take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen Moments with you

But destiny didn't have such a simple plan
I was just a girl and you were a man
How could age define something so divine
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

Dreaming 'bout you, I keep dreaming 'bout you
And I'm dreaming 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We could take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen Moments with you

Dreaming 'bout you, I keep dreaming 'bout you
And I'm dreaming and praying for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine
Each and every day I'd walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around at light
Just to spend to time alone
If loving is a crime, I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We could take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen Moments with you
