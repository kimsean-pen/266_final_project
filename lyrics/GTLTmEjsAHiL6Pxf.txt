I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I feel you with my appetite

With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the key and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, "Be my little baby"

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company, a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight

Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, "Be my little baby"
Be my little baby
Just like Ronnie sang, just like Ronnie sang
"Be my little baby, baby my darling"

I feel a hunger, it's a hunger

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, "Be my little baby"
Take me home tonight

I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, "Be my little baby"
Take me home tonight

I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, "Be my little baby"
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
