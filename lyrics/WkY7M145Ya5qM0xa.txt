One day, it will happen
One day, one day
It will all come true.

One day, when you're ready
One day, one day
When you're up to it.

The atmosphere
Will get lighter
And two suns ready
To shine just for you
I can feel it, I can feel it.

One day, it will happen
One day, one day
It will all make sense.

One day, one day
You will blossom
One day, one day
When you're ready.

An aeroplane
Will curve gracefully
Around the volcano
With the eruption that never lets you down.

I can feel it, I can feel it

And the beautifullest
Fireworks are burning
In the sky just for you

I can feel it, I can feel it

One day, one day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day, one day
