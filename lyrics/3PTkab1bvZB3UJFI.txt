If we were in this room again
I could shape the light this way
Temper would build me back
Legs left belonged again
There is a breath that's left
Once was a pulsing thing
You shuddered every word
You are calling time again

I will reconcile, I will reconcile
I will reconcile, I will reconcile

We are in the room again
I will flick the teeth away
Temper would build me back
Legs you left belonged again
Now you're a limping grin
Once it was a pulsing thing
Sullen as a swollen tongue
You are calling time again

I will reconcile (candid in your hands)
I will reconcile (I hope you understand)
I will reconcile (candid in your hands)
I will reconcile (I hope you understand)

Again I know you're there
You will love again
It's there, in truth
You will love again
It's there, in truth
You will love again
