Before you left your garrison
You'd had a drink, maybe two
You don't remember Paris, hon
But it remembers you
It's true, we flew to Paris, dear
Aboard an Army jet
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
You said I was terrific
It meant zilch to you, ah
But I have our marriage certificate
And I'll keep it till I die
You were an Army officer
And I just a Rochette
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
No rose conveyed your sentiments
Not even a petunia
But you've got vague presentiments
And I've got little Junior
You said, nobody loves me
And I said, wanna bet?
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
