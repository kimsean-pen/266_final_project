It's no use
Theres no right or wrong
(When you're already gone)
I move slow
My compass spins like theres nowhere to go

Just let me fade
Blow away like dead leaves
Forget my face
Just erase me
Don't stay while I fade
(Just let me go, just let me go, let me go)
While I circle the drain
(Just let me go, just let me go, let me go)

Just calm down
Theres no need to kick while I'm already down
Remove yourself from the fear
Let me waste away, put me into the ground

Just let me fade
Blow away like dead leaves
Forget my face
Just erase me
Don't stay while I fade
(Just let me go)
While I circle the drain
(Just let me go)

I want to go where no one knows, put me below
Just let me go
I want to go where no one knows, put me below
Just let me go

Leave me alone
