Some think that they deserve more
Give a little like it's become a chore
Don't demand things, or walk yourself out that door
I fell flat on my face too many times
Left with nothing but some cheap perfume
Now you cry
Now you need me
Now that perfume's not cheap
Thought told you...

If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you
You should've tried harder
If you thought I would leap into your arms
Every time I would see your face, then
Maybe you
You should've tried harder

Go on, prove it
I'd love to see you try
Convince me that you gave me the world
I tried and tried but you never opened your eyes
You stand tall like you've won some kind of award
But really I've never seen someone so short
You'd look taller if you gave me some more
Thought I told you...

If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you
You should've tried harder
If you thought I would leap into your arms
Every time I would see your face, then
Maybe you
You should've tried harder

Some think that they deserve more
Give a little bit

If you wanted to be my only one
If you wanted to see this happen
Maybe you
You should've tried harder
If you thought I would leap into your arms
Every time I would see your face, then
Maybe you
You should've tried harder
