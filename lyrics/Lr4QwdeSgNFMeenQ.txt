I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)

And the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)

It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
Til Delilah showed me how

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them 'round

Now I'm dancing with Delilah
And her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
Different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you I can find
(Holding on for your call)
Different kind of danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Now it's one more boy and is one more line
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(But maybe not tonight)

It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
Til Delilah showed me how

Now I'm dancing with Delilah
And her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
Different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you I can find
(Holding on for your call)
Different kind of danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm rung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know

Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm rung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know

It's a different kind of danger

As I pull the pillars down

It's a different kind of danger

Never knew I was a dancer
Til Delilah showed me how

It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
