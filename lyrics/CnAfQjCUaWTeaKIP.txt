Suited up and now we're ready for war
The whole world is watching, time to settle the score
We want it now more than ever before
Do whatever it takes and never forget what we're fighting for

Three, never backing down
Two, our time is now
One, can you hear the sound of a million voices screaming out?

See the tables turn
Feel the fire burn
Once we get started there's no stopping us (No stopping us)
Yeah, we run this town
We're not slowing down
We came to change the game so get out the way
Watch out

Look in our eyes you'll see that we're not afraid
This is our moment, they can't take it away
Did you really think that we came to play? (No)
We're here to fight! (Yeah)
We're here to stay

Three, never backing down
Two, our time is now
One, can you hear the sound of a million voices screaming out?

See the tables turn
Feel the fire burn
Once we get started there's no stopping us (No stopping us)
Yeah, we run this town
We're not slowing down
We came to change the game so get out the way
Watch out

When the pressure's on
You're gonna find out what we're all about
Then when it's said and done, you'll never forget
We run this town

Watch out
We're never backing down
Watch out
Can you hear our voices screaming out?

See the tables turn
Feel the fire burn
Once we get started there's no stopping us (No stopping us)
Yeah, we run this town
We're not slowing down
We came to change the game so get out the way
Watch out

See the tables turn
Feel the fire burn
Once we get started there's no stopping us (No stopping us)
Yeah, we run this town
We're not slowing down
We came to change the game so get out the way
