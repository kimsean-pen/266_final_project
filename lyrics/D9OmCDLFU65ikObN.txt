Hard and [?]
And they can't be us

Information has gone astray
Yeah, I hoped, hoped we'd get it some day
Yeah, I hoped, hoped we'd get it some way
In and out, are we gone today
Yeah, I know, know you're running somewhere
Yeah, I know

You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts

Visionary, are you still in the clouds
Come bail me out, keep me cold in the wind
Blowing thin, you just let the phone ring
Give it time, don't come to my place
Yeah, I thought, thought you want it this way
Yeah, I thought, thought you were going out of state

Stuck bad on the memories
Goddamn heart on the memories
I went, prayed with my enemies
It's stuck hard of my reverie
Stuck bad on the memories
Goddamn heart on the memories
We missed our anniversary
We missed our potential
I'm emotional

You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
You make it hard
You're so good to me it hurts, good to me it hurts
