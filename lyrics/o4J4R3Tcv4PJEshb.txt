My friends turn up with love on their throats
Fucked up on their highs and lows
Piling into cars and their drivers
'Cause their summer feels slow
The light falls on his face like a waterfall
And it's hard to stay at home and be rational

'Cause people tell me: baby, you're just not worth the time
But I heard you were talking about me
Talking about me

You know that I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
And I know how to turn you on
But don't abuse my loyalty
If you want someone, then, you're on
'Cause I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
I don't know how to switch it off
But loyalty means I have friends
If you run then you're gonna get done
If you run, run, then you're gonna get done

My friends turn up with love on their throats
Breathing in so hard that we choke
Six ride in a four-seated drive
We're covered all sides
His coat falls off his shoulder like a landslide
And it's hard to look away and not die a little inside

'Cause people tell me: baby, you're just another flake
But I heard you were talking 'bout me
Talking 'bout me

You know that I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
And I know how to turn you on
But don't abuse my loyalty
If you want someone, then you're on
'Cause I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
I don't know how to switch it off
But loyalty means I have friends
If you run, then you're gonna get done
If you run, run, then you're gonna get done

The last time that we spoke was a year ago
Now you don't know a single thing about me
You only ever see me through a looking glass, yeah
But you're still asking for me

You know that I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
And I know how to turn you on
But don't abuse my loyalty
If you want someone, then you're on
'Cause I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
I don't know how to switch it off
But loyalty means I have friends
If you run, then you're gonna
You know that I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
And I know how to turn you on
But don't abuse my loyalty
If you want someone, then you're on
'Cause I'm damn (damn) loyal (loyal)
I don't know how to switch it off
But loyalty means I have friends
If you run, then you're gonna get done
If you run, run, then you're gonna get done
If you run, run, then you're gonna get done
