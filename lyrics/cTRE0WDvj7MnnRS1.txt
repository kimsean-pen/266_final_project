This diamond's growing in the mountains
beneath the pressure of all time
that glow in hope and expectation
waiting for your hands to find
'cause only you could reach inside me
and figure out the worth
of a life i live providing
what it was you needed most

And if everything is measured
by the hole it leaves behind
then this mountain has been leveled
and there's no more diamonds in the mine
go on now just leave it
the timing wasn't right
and the forces that swept us both away
was too strong for us to fight

Fantasy man you are always
one step ahead of me
well i never heard a warning
i haven't got things right
the sun came out this morning
and filled my room with light
so go now you are forgiven
let's put it down to light
the story of two lovers
would dance both edges of the knife

In the station you were standing
not knowing what you want
and the secrets that we're defending
have become our only bond
just be patient while i wait here
journeys out of sync
while you're out there running in the chaos
i need some time to think

Fantasy man you are always
one step ahead of me
well i never heard a warning
i haven't got things right
the sun came out this morning
and filled my room with light
so go now you are forgiven
let's put it down to light
the story of two lovers
would dance both edges of the knife
