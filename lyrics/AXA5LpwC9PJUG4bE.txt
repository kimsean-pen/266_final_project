Woke up this morning
Found a love light in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns

Guns are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
Oceans of diamonds

Always shine, smooth out below
Can we start it all over again
This morning

I lost all my defenses
This morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?
I've gone all around
'Til there's nothing left to say
Wrote it all down
Into something that couldn't be said
I tore it all down
It buried me underneath the wave
Can we start it all over again
This morning
I let down my defenses
This morning
It was just you & me
This morning
I found all my guesses
This morning
Won't you show me the way it could've been?
