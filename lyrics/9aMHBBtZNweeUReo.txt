Another day goes by me
Another day of life without you
And as I look around me
I feel so lonely there's no one
No one here beside me
No one here to help to see me through
To see me through
To see me through
Cause I need you
Cause I need you

Been standing still for much too long
And I realise there's something wrong
I'm feeling strange, I need a change
And I realise that there's something wrong
There's something wrong
There's something wrong

Another two years over
Don't understand what's happened to me
These days are so much colder
Up against the fire, don't feel any heat
Cracked up years behind me
Cracked up years ahead are all I see
Are all I see
