Ravenous waves attack
Drawn by the scent of life
Fever of our blood

Instinct rules this mass, ruthless living seas, devouring
Countless verming gnashing at my face
Tear meat from my skull
Swarming rabid, features are erased
Unrecognizable
Body covered, rat filled innards
Shred internal organs
Heart and lungs consumed from inside but my pain doesn't end
I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, boodthirsty rabid
devoured by vermin

Resistance now gives way, rodents freely feed
Tearing at my skin
Muscles are exposed, shining red with blood
Meat that they seek

Crawling rodents gorging on me
Repulsive starving droves
Shredding, stripping, consming all I was, tissue pulled from bones
Dying slowly, feeling every fang
Shock has yet to come
Scavengers tear out my eyes
My pain won't end, I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, boodthirsty rabid
devoured by vermin

Ruthless gnawing vermin - feed
Cleaning off my bones while I breathe
Stenching greasy rodents - swarm
My body is losing its form

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, boodthirsty rabid
devoured by vermin
