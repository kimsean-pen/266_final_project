Swerve
Put your hands up

I don't mind getting violent, but leave your pride at the door
Shame is all we've been hiding, so take me down
Throw me into the drywall, you got that bullet I'll bite it
Pop it off like you own me, and scratch my back when you ride it

Nobody wants a couple of rights without a couple of wrongs
And the fire that you're building up, is coming off so strong
It's like I'm burning inside when you spit my name
The rock, the roll, the pride, the shame
Let's skip the foreplay and become the teenage waste, that's what we call

Love sex riot, so excited
Love sex riot

Alright, let's do this
Gonna take you to the floor and rip off your clothes
We can leave the door unlocked, everybody knows
I'm gonna make your body shake, you can scream all night
It's a love sex riot, you're invited

Oh, here I am to get the party poppin'
Six rounds of shots and now we're never stopping
Just close your eyes and let your fantasy play
Sex, drugs and violence is my anthem, oh

Taking it up from the top, fuck everybody hard in the middle
If we get violent, oh yeah, we'll call it a riot
And now we'll be done with the sex and now everybody's excited

Nobody wants a couple of rights without a couple of wrongs
And the fire that you're building up, is coming off so strong
It's like I'm burning inside when you spit my name
The rock, the roll, the pride, the shame
Let's skip the foreplay and become the teenage waste, that's what we call

Love sex riot, so excited
Love sex riot
Fuck you

t's a riot, I'mma work it over 'til you're tired
Love it when you're screaming like a siren
Ready aim--ready, aim, fire, fire
Riot, I'mma set it off, I'mma light it
Heart beat beating like it's dynamited
Ready aim--ready, aim, fire, fire

I don't mind getting violent, leave your pride at the door
Shame is all we've been hiding, so take me down

If we get violent, oh yeah, we'll call it a riot
And now we'll be done with the sex and now everybody's excited

It's a riot, I'mma work it over 'til you're tired
Love it when you're screaming like a siren
Ready aim--ready, aim, fire, fire
Riot, I'mma set it off, I'mma light it
Heart beat beating like it's dynamited
Ready aim--ready, aim, fire, fire
Fire, fire
