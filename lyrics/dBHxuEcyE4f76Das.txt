Run away with me
Just stay down for this
Wake up for yourself
Nothing in destroy
Waiting for your heart
Makes me love again
What you see believe
I don't lifehunger
This wasted no more always could be change
Just stop you and me the eyes only see
This section for this my heard lonely blood
The woods roll on back for this are good luck
No more
No more
No more
No more
No more
So you think for me
Who are you do this
Fight for selfish pain
Never been survive
Heard you change my mind
You can go yourself
My heart is beating
Dead is not enough
This wasted no more always could be change
Just stop you and me the eyes only see
This section for this my heard lonely blood
The woods roll on back for this are good luck
No more
No more
No more
No more
No more
What's your problem now it's not forever
Forget yesterday never really over
Sick me to the bones all this fourth of july
Stop this world tonight
