A place that someone knew
A little city
Red lights
Beam up our way, wish upon a star
Out of the dark
It's someone new
A thrill, mesmerized
A smile, behind her hands
Seeing other girls
The lip stick, the tiny skirts
Blow them a kiss
I am a women but inside I'm a man
And I want to be as gay as I can
A thrill, mesmerized
A smile, behind her hands
Seeing other boys
The lip stick, the tiny skirts
Blow them a kiss
A place that someone knew
A little city
Street tunnel
Beam up our way, wish upon a star
Out of the dark
It's someone new
Whatever happen to poor dear me?
Never see that face again
I don't want to leave
No one wants to leave
Funny how things have to end
(Whatever happen)
Whatever happen to poor dear me? (To poor dear me)
Never see that face again
I don't want to leave
No one wants to leave
Funny how things have to end
You're pushing on my identity
How much longer do I need to be
This version of me
