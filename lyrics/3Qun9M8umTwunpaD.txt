I taped her to my heart
An embankment of spare parts
Damn dam must burst
Else we're dying of thirst
Remove the needle from my back
C'mon, commemorative plaque
Hashtag, never forget, no regrets

I'm not holding on to innocence
I'm not holding on to violence
And I'll be letting go of you, soon
I'm not holding on to innocence
I'm not holding on to violence
So I'll be letting go of you. soon

I pulled apart your words
Face value and face first
You spun so fast
Said you were tied to the mast
But there was action in your pace
Dissatisfaction in your eyes
Once I evacuate, you delay

I'm not holding on to innocence
I'm not holding on to violence
So I'll be letting go of you, soon

After the exorcism, baby
Foreign body
After the exorcism, baby
Foreign body

Can't have it both ways, baby
You can't have it both ways, baby
