What's on your mind?
'Cause I've been thinking about last night
What's the time?
Feels like I've sat here all my life

Your ship rolls in, I'm here waiting
I don't know what, I'm paralysed
All what I do to be with you
All what I give

To hear you say that 'I love you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Couldn't work out
Oh, why you gave me all those signs?
So tell me now
Before I lose my mind

Your ship sails in, I am waiting
You stand close by and watch me cry
Oh, what I'd do to be with you
Oh, what I'd give

To hear you say that 'I love you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Hold out your hand
Give me a light in the dark
You know that I'm broken
Don't leave me hear broken

To hear you say that 'I love you'
But hear it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that 'I miss you'
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
Oh, give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room
