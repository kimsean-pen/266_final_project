life has just begun
no turning back from now
when i opened my eyes
i see the good thing in life
it's a tapestry
i know you want to
it's a mystery
to where my life
now you're here with me
it's a tapestry
if it's meant to be
if it's not meant to be
that's where life led us to be
it's a tapestry
i know you want to ...
it's a mystery
to where our life led us to be
now you're here with me
it's a tapestry

it's a tapestry
i know you want to cater me
it's a mystery
to where our life leds us to be
now you're here with me
it's a tapestry
now you're here with me
it's a tapestry
