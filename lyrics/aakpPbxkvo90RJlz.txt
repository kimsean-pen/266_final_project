Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.
Always stepped in time, regardless of the beat
I moved my feet, I carried weight
What I could not do I faked
I dug seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave
So I stopped right there and said

Go on alone, 'cause I won't follow.
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
The path will be my own

This is the part where the needle skips
And the plays like a sink that drips
A syllable repeating, like a warning we aren't heeding
Until all of a sudden we noticed it
When the wheels brace and the tires grip
A map we've been misreading
A defeat we're not conceding
Until now
There must be some other way out

Go on alone, because I won't follow
But this isn't giving up no this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
A path to take me home

(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

The wind died
The whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet
Her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes
For just a moment or two
She asked why
I said "I don't know why,
I just know"

Go on alone, 'cause I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
I made most of all this sorrow
I tried to brave this discontent, but now I'm through
I'm letting go of you.

This is letting go
This is letting go

Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.
