Celestial ocean
Choice and chances
Future love and light

Infinity has
Many faces
I see them all tonight

In you
Our intersection
Our divine collision
In you
Our intersection
Our divine collision

Welling waves of tears
In recognition of
What patience will provide
When radiating
Celestial bodies
Fatefully collide

It's you
Our intersection
Our divine collision
It's you
Our intersection
Our divine collision

Hey
Hello
A joy to finally meet you
Hey
