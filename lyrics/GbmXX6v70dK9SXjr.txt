I'll be the one
Spin me around
Lifting you up
And holding me down
Inside a storm is raging
It blows up in your eyes
Inside a heart is breaking
The river's running dry
I could run, I could hide
When I'm crashing down who's the one who saves me
All intertwined
Wrap around me now with the thorns
And we're holding on
When there's nothing else to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
'Cuz all I have left is you, all I have left is you

Out of love, out of time
When I'm falling down, you're the one who saves me
All intertwined
Wrap around me now with the thorns
And we're holding on
When there's nothing left to hold on to

So don't tell me when it's gone

'Cuz all I have left is you, all I have left is you
Oh-Oh
When there's nothing left to hold on to

So don't tell me when it's gone
Cuz all I have left, all I have left is you

I'll be the one

Lifting you up again
Inside a storm is raging
Hold me down, hold me down

Oh yeah
Lying here waiting
Lying here waiting
Lying here waiting for
And we're holding on
When there's nothing left to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
'Cuz all I have left is you
Oh-Oh
Well there's nothing left to hold on to
So don't tell me when it's gone
'Cuz all I have left, all I have left is you
Oh-Oh
All I have left
All I have left is you
