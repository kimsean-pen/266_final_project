I scrapped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest heaven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off
And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
The tragedy it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts and false illusions
Just to come out the hero
Well I can see behind the curtain
The wheels are cranking, turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal that's nonexistent, it's nonexistent
But we just keep believing
And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off
Just turn it off
Again
Again, again
And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
