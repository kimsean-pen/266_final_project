Voices call, they call out my name (my name, my name)
They say I'm different, well I'm not the same (the same)
You say you want to be like me
Well boy, let me tell you, you didn't know what I've seen
They say the devil lives in my soul (my soul, my soul)
I promise not to let him take control

I'm minding my own business
I ain't doing nothing wrong
I ain't doing nothing wrong

Shadows follow so close behind me
I look in the mirror, I don't like what I see
Oh God, can't you help me get out of here? (here, here)

I feel like I'm living deep in hell

I'm minding my own business
I ain't doing nothing wrong
I'm minding my own business
I ain't doing nothing wrong
I'm minding, I'm minding my own
I ain't doing nothing wrong
I ain't doing nothing wrong
Nothing wrong
