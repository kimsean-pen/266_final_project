Feelings
Only feelings
Just let them
Let them go

Feelings
Only feelings
Just worthless
So I let them go

New York, I was Judas
She said 'A latte, double shot for Judas'
Cry for the things that happen
People need to know
And for a dream to happen
You gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go, gotta let it go
You let it go
You let it go

But there must be
Some answer
I keep seeking
'Cause I gotta know

We are numbered
And we are labeled
Do we ever
Break our home?

I knew it
Before you said it
There's no need for
Need to wait
Need to wait

You let it go
I'm running
In the sky
Slipping round
Hold me up high, high
Hold me up high
High, high
High, high

Still holding on
You know the dreams have just begun
You know the dream's just begun
You know the dream's just begun
I know you're still holding on
Because the dream has just begun
