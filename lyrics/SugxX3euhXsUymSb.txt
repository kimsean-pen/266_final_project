Spears fo fire speak of death
Enchantress of Hell, reborn!

I will have you on your knees
And the beast I hold within
Shall be fed with your hungering screams

For we shall own the night
And destroy the remains of their one „god"
And cast down Hell ... his soul!

The fire grows over the barricades,
and the heavens are crying with disgrace
All the creatures of the light hide in fear
for the night has come and will last eternally

We've conquered the light and the pyres are burning
The moon and the stars shine no more
Goddess come forth and stand by my side
As one we shall conquer them all

The fire grows over the barricades,
and the heavens are crying with disgrace
All the creatures of the light hide in fear
for the night has come and will last eternally

We've coverd the sun and the ashes are dancing
We came for the end of the world
Goddess rejoice! Stand bare by my side
As one we shall watch as they fall!

For we shall own the night
And consume the remains of their one „god"
and cast down to hell... his flesh!

The fire grows over the barricades,
and the heavens are crying with disgrace
All the creatures of the light hide in fear
for the night has come and will last eternally

The fire grows over the barricades,
and the heavens are crying with disgrace
All the creatures of the light hide in fear
for the night has come and will last eternally
