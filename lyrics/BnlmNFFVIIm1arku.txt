I could never get comfortable
Thats why my home always felt like a hotel; its
Chemical whats inside my skull and whats really here
The only thing im good at is letting go
Thats why i couldnt love you and i couldnt let you know
Like oh oh oh
So bloody nose
I keep having this dream where you forget about me,
go to bed with some guy
Then my nose starts to bleed
The only thing im good at is letting go
Thats why i couldnt love you and i couldnt let you know
Like oh oh oh
So bloody nose
I have this fear that ill die young
I'll never hear from Jasper and the light will never come like
a canopy over my home
it takes me by the throat
Won't ever let me go.
Like oh oh oh
So bloody nose
Like oh oh oh
So bloody nose
