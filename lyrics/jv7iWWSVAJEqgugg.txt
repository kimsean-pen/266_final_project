Rome

herbstzeitlose

there is no peace
no truce
no pause
no end
there will always be
guilt
impurity
despair
we are afraid (why are we afraid?)
we are not what was intended
we do not know
what was intended (why are we here?)
we shiver
shudder
tremble
(would you have been brave?)
would you have been just?
would you have beenů
(would you have been just?)
(would you have beenů just?)
(yes, father. yes. father.)
