It felt like yesterday
We were meant to stay
Living like nothing wrong could happen

I still recall a time
You were on my mind
Monopolizing each and every second

Figured I should know
How it's got to go
Cause nothing is made to last forever

I'm hardly movin' on
The proof in is in the song
Remembering how

I used to feel alive,
I used to want to,
I used to be alright,
I used to love you.
I used to never feel like I do now,
I used to never feel like I do now,
I used to walk on air
I used to care,
I had no fear of falling,
I used to never feel like I do now.

Well I can't ignore the hurt
Pretending isn't worth
Knowing that you're better off without me

I guess that you were right
When you told me I
Would probably one day be sorry

But you know I'm not the kind
to beg for second tries
Just chalk it up to another lesson learned

And let it settle in
If I'd ever love again
Remembering how

I used to feel alive,
I used to want to,
I used to be alright,
I used to love you.
I used to never feel like I do now,
I used to never feel like I do now,
I used to walk on air,
I used to care,
I had no fear of falling,
I used to never feel like I do now.

I know it's probably for the better
But I wish I could somehow just not remember
I know it's probably for the better
But I wish I could somehow just not remember
I used to...

I used to...

I used to walk on air,
I used to care,
I had no fear of falling,
I used to never feel like I do now.
