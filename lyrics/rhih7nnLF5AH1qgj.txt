Ohh, uhhh

See me cry
See me lay down
Cry, oh just lay down
Oh just lay down
Have you heard about grace?
Well she's golden
Have you heard about grace?
Well she's golden
And oh how I know it's rough
Ooh, I know about dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

Ohh, uhhh
Ohh, uhhh

Whatchu gonna do when you can't buy it?
Whatchu gonna do when you can't buy it?
Well stay away from my town
Cause it's just me in my town
And I'll just move around

And have you heard about grace?
Well she's golden
Have you heard about grace?
Well she's golden
And oh how I know it's rough
I know, I know about dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming

Ooh, in the middle of the road
Been driving so long I forgot about
The dreaming, well I forgot about the dreaming
About the dreaming
Well I forgot about the dreaming

Golden dreaming
Golden dreaming
Golden dreaming

Ohh, uhhh
Ohh, uhhh
Ohh, uhhh
Ohh, uhhh

Let's all go to grace gold
Let's all go to grace gold
Grace gold
Grace gold
