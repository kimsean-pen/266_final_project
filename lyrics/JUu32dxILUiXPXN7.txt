Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance for me)
Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me

Your life's a passing star
The price you paid was dear
You make the most of my life yet
Movements dance with fear
Your speciality's only nights
As you and pride compete
Neglect the pain in your heart
Come on and dance with me

Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance for me)
Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me

Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance for me)
Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me

You never dance alone
When love steps too near
Communicate with me
Your doubts will disappear
If it's love you're searching for
There's plenty love in me
Embrace the good things in life
Come on and dance with me

Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance for me)
Come on and jump to the beat
(Jump)
Come on and dance with me.
