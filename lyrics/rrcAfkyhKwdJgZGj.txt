If you smile at me
I'm gonna show you what is right
What is right for me
Outside is bright
Let's take a walk to talk
Squeeze my hand so tight
Promise me this time
You're gonna show me what's inside
What's inside your mind
Let's seat down by the tree
Stare the coast
And feel the breeze coming from the sea
Easy
It has to be easy
It should have been easier
And if it's not easy
Then why don't you leave me
Cause I'm gonna leave you behind
If things don't get easy
It has to be
It has to be easy
If you smile at me
I'm gonna show you what is right
What is right for me
Outside is bright
Let's take a walk to talk
Squeeze my hand so tight
Promise me this time
You're gonna show me what's inside
What's inside your mind
Let's seat down by the tree
Stare the coast
And feel the breeze coming from the sea
Easy
It has to be easy
It should have been easier
And if it's not easy
Then why don't you leave me
Cause I'm gonna leave you behind
If things don't get easy
It has to be
It has to be easy
Tonight I'm not busy
If you want to see me
You can come by
I can turn the radio on
Push the couch away
And dance to any song
Any song you wanna play
If you want to see me
You can come by
I can turn the radio on
Push the couch away
And dance to any song
Any song you wanna play
I'll dance to any
Any song you want
Any song you want, oh oh oh
