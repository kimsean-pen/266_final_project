How do you know if what you want is worth it,
With all this fighting lately Ive been wondering,
I never realised how vicious you could seem,
Tread so hard and flip this state Im in,

Spoken up you told me once to be strong,
I guess you meant with everybody but you did,
I go to leave he grabs my wrist and breaks my fist I try to hit him,
Why would I,
Why would I,

I can feel me changing and feel this rearranging,
Our love aint been decided yet,
I feel like if I aint careful and baby you wont be careful,
Elvis,

These wild roots are cracking my composure,
I went ahead and started drinking on my own,
Upon this hill Im high enough to breathe the air before its touched by someone else,
Just like your chest I need to breathe some,

My brother told me this would happen if Id let it,
I couldnt get myself to keep myself away,
I started drinking way before I ever met him,
I think you know that but you keep that ship at bay,

I go to leave he grabs my wrist and breaks my fist I try to hit him,
Why would I,
Why would I,

And I can feel me changing and feel this rearranging,
Our love aint been decided yet,
I feel like if I aint careful and baby you wont be careful,
Elvis.
