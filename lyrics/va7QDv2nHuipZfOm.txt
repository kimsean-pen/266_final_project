If ever you find yourself beaten and broke
And can't feel the wind for the weight of the yoke
And fear that the night will not turn into day
Remember the darkness will show you the way
It's a long way away, it's a long way away
And I'm all alone, alone, alone
All alone, alone, a long way away

Inside the mind of a man is a massacre
Made up of many of miniature message
And misses the most of it
So convoluted design for disaster
It's making the best of a universe
Far too expansive to cope with
And he never chose nor was chosen
By metrics that make any sense
And the senses are numbed by emotional stresses

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Who got time on a string on a finger
Nothing to remember
But the passage of it
Who got time to let anything linger
Where it hovers
Surely you will learn to love it
Who got time for this love shit anyway
Gotta survive
Isn't that mess enough for him

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Set a course
It's a bet upon an endless
Roulette wheel odds are ungodly
As are the odds of the body
Making it through and surviving the gravity shift
The gravitized self which lost
From the lost thoughts of a being ch-ch-chopped
To a bite size in the light eyes
[?] don't leave the messenger
The messages and SOS and other S's
In the language where it goes

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

And somebody gotta keep watch where the watch stops
He talks about his pops in polarity
Fingers fantasize of rocks there will never be
Land whole likely [?] hole
And the man's [?] heaven
He's demanding the evidence for something
That maybe never was for anyone
He's missing something pretty
He's missing where the air tastes gritty
He's missing the splendor and misery
Of bodies, of cities, of being missed

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Flesh is weaker than the metal, it is true
But the metal's being moved into a thing it doesn't do
Circuitry is only serviceable as much as it is you
So why don't you use it
'Til you use it up, abuse it
It is strong, it can take it if you can't
Your sinews are more intuitively designed for dance
Well it set up a randomly course safely away from suns
Four-hundred and twenty-three
By a hundred and twelve by fifty-one

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Inside the mind of a man is a mystery
Made up of these centuries
Of mistakes he believes
Are important to be
Part of his DNA, calls it history
Species with memories longer
Don't bother with sweating the old shit
Maybe it's this time-bound conscience
That keeps him out pushing through nothing
With only the hope [?] belief that

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Are you ready to go
Are you ready to go yet
Let's go
Are you ready to go yet
Let's go
Are you ready to go
Are you ready to go yet
Let's go
Are you ready to go yet
Let's go

There must be a
Better place to
Be somebody
Be somebody else

Go
