We can remember forever
We can remember forever now
We can remember forever
We can remember forever now

It's hard to find my way home
When my heart is lost???
Oh save me, every voice inside me screams
Like it's an emergency

I wanna live in your arms
And there I'll be safe from harm
I don't wanna live a life alone
If I'm apart from the ones I love

I'm just too??? to find my way
With a heavy heart I pray
Lead me to your door

I fool myself into the fray
Now I see??? come back
Love is on the way

We can remember forever
We can remember forever now
We can remember forever
We can remember forever now

I wanna live in your arms
And there I'll be safe from harm
I don't wanna live a life alone
If I'm apart from the ones I love

Forever and ever
That's right, forever and ever, I know
Forever and ever, I know

Forever and ever
That's right, forever and ever, I know
Forever and ever, I know

We can remember forever
We can remember forever now
We can remember forever
We can remember forever now

We can remember forever
We can remember forever now
We can remember forever
We can remember forever now
