Voice Of Dissent

How far will it go?
When will you be satisfied?
This rising toll
Can never be justified.
Stop.

They followed you and they complied
With your plans for preemption.
When will you give up the lie
And state your true intentions?

Stop.
The vein is collapsing.
This wound just never seems to mend.
Stop.
The blood you're spilling
Will choke you in the end.

So just give in,
And follow the drones.
A nation of consumption
Shouldn't challenge its role.
Just believe, and fall in line.
Freedom is a privilege
That's been left behind.

You say it's for protection.
You say you're justified.
But you were never threatened.
Your policy was built on lies.
