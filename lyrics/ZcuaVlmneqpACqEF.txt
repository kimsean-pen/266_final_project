Leaders come, stand in line.
Feel your true self, conformed.
I sold my soul, crossed the borderline.
I found something I'd never adjust to.
Come here, I payed up for you.
I have sold my weakness too.
Come here, I split my heart in two.
But you don't have it in you, do you.
Carbon soul, transparent and faded out.
See you soon, in my fiction.
I sold my song, my mouth was sewn.
It's coming undone, that's why I sold out.
Come here, I payed up for you.
I have sold my weakness too.
Come here, I split my heart in two.
But you don't have it in you, do you?
(Do you, do you, do you...)
