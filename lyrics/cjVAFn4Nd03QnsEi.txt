Feel like a dog

I feel like a dog in a cage
Doing bad if I say that I'm great
I wish that I could spend away the pain
But nothin' never change, gettin' money for the rage
But the cash won't go to the grave
I'ma give it to ma fam, fuck a chain
And I know I'm so close to the fame
Gettin' burnt, so close to the flame

Dancin' in the rain, let it go
Dancin' with the Devil, let it snow
Bitch I fuckin' did it on my own
With a little bit a help from my bros
Label say I'm up next with a broken heart
Time bomb boy, watch the countdown start

Gotta lotta hate in my soul
So if you love me let me know (Let me know)

If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
Oooooh, Oooooh, Oh

Ayy
Always feels so alone, where ma friends at
Man I'm sick of bein' broke, where ma bands at
It's gettin' hard to breathe, where the Xans at
Life's so short, still ask where the end at
Melancholy Hill where I stay
Death is tryna lead us away
I can't really fuck with a lame
Wide awake, my mistake for trusting you
Can't believe I fucked with you
Same ones talking down that came up with you
Same ones hate, used to be in love with you
Same ones hate, now they wanna come with you
Can't break face, never get comfortable
Can't save face, I'm getting so numb to you (Oh)

I feel like a dog in a cage
Doing bad if I say that I'm great
I wish that I could spend away the pain
But nothin' never change, gettin' money for the rage
But the cash won't go to the grave
I'ma give it to ma fam, fuck a chain
And I know I'm so close to the fame
Gettin' burnt, so close to the flame

Angel wing
Ayy
Feel that sting
Oh
Angel wing
I wish you told me that

If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
Oooooh, Oooooh, Oh
