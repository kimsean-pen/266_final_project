You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me
Even when you're not around

If there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe
Now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love, baby
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so in-captured
Got me wrapped up in your touch
Feels so enamored
Hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it
You got me losing every breath
What did you give me
To make my heart beat out my chest

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love, baby
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

And I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
No I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
No I don't wanna let, don't wanna let go
