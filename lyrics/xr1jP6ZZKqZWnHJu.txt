I've been running around
Like an unkempt kid
Tryin' to remember
The things I did
If I went too far
I hope it doesn't do me in.
'cause they tell me a man
Is just the sum of his parts
Well I'm body, and blood, and a terrible heart
And it all adds up
To every different person I've been.
I wanted to crash your party
But I couldn't find your house.
I wanted to touch your body
And kiss you on the mouth.
Bloodshot
What do you want?
What do you want?
And I know that you see me
As a younger man
But cities and countries, they had other plans
And we all grow up
What do you think, you're gonna grow back?
They people around me
They're not my friends
You can do what you want
I'd rather pretend
'cause no one should be lonely
Everyone needs people like that
I wanted to crash your party
But I couldn't find your house
I wanted to touch your body
And kiss you on the mouth.
Bloodshot
What do you want?
What do you want?
Everyone you know
Is living at home in the gutted out basement
And chemicals oh...
Bloodshot
What do you want?
What do you want?
Bloodshot
What do you want?
What do you want?
