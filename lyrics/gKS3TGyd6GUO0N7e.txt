that was that
you know
what to do
everybody
looking at the ring
they don't know what to think

the meds fell in a pit, and that was it
on the outs
future, snap to thirds
maybe friday
tvs on the beach
i hope that it is deep
my head is so slow
the moon is low

got it back
touch it
burn the disc
make a circle
take me off the list
my clothes don't even fit
reflection is gone
i could be wrong

by the pool
panic
we should leave
early morning
falling from the trees
the wall is in my eye
the birds are on time

cancel if you can
you found the memo to the man
it rained so i forgot about it
now my ears are ringing

step, step, step, watch where i step

cancel if you can
you found the memo to the man
who's the first caller?
my ears are ringing
