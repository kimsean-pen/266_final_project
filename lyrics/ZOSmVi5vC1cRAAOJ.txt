Yeah, I waited great to fall in love
And then I broke and hurt
I didn't know if it's better or not
I got to feel your breath against my ear

I waited great to fall in love
And then I broke and hurt
It's been a yearlong away from me
'Cause in my life I have been dead inside

And the flower is gone away
In my life it's told about its summer
I can feel your breath against my ear
Your whisper slow, my dear

It's all gone '
It's so far and now I realize
The year falls and memory
I want nobody else
I have to act to know how to feel
Happy to feel your breath when I'm lost

And the flower is gone away
In my life it's told about its summer
It's all gone and now we cry
We're so far and now we are both
