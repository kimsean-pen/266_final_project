Midnight, I've got trouble sleeping
I'm making my way up to the street where we last kissed
In one hand, I hold a picture of you
In the other I hold the pieces of my heart
In the other I hold the pieces of my heart

Was my love not enough?
Did I ask too much?
As my heart turns to dust
Over you...

And so long, I have trouble sleeping
I can help but feeling
A little insecure
So unsure...

Was my love not enough?
Did I ask too much?
As my heart turns to dust
Over you...
