Suicide is in my blood, it always was
But it doesn't evaporate in the light any more

And this world is no place
For a mind or a thought
No it's not
Well that's been said before

But space and the woods still know who I am
And I know they don't owe me anything
Not after what I've done.

Put on my radiation suit and slip away
I'm on the run from what I've become

And this life like suicide
Runs at a lot of different speeds
And I know they don't owe me anything
Not after what I've done

Late on a Monday night, I'm on the grapevine
Beating around the bush adds to the bassline
Thinking about the time when I was dancing slow
And out of control

I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry 'cause I don't care
I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry 'cause I...

I've done nothing, I've done nothing
But they forgive anything
Like how I don't stop you breaking my arms
And chopping chopping me down so I fit in your laptop

I've done nothing
