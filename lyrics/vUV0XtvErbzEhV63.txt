It's been a minute since we connected
I got the message, you don't feel like that
So why can't you leave it the way we left it
Instead of reminiscing about the past

I showed you things I know you liked
And I thought that I could change your mind
And I almost did now didn't I
And I almost did now don't lie

Do you think about me
And the way it could be
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know

Do you think about us
Could I give you enough
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know

Just for a second, answer the question
Can we address the things you do and say
You took the first flight, you were so recklessly in it
Now you're tryna say it was never that way

I showed you things I know you liked
And I thought that I could change your mind
And I almost did now didn't I
And I almost did now don't lie

Do you think about me
And the way it could be
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know

Do you think about us
Could I give you enough
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know

Do you think about me
And the way it could be
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know

And do you think about us
And could I give you enough
I'll make it easy
You tell me, should I stay or go?
'Cause I need to know
