Oh, I've been thinking 'bout our fortune
And I've decided that we're really not to blame
For the love that's deep inside us now is still the same

And the sounds we make together
Is the music to the story in your eyes
It's been shining down upon me now, I realize

Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We're part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day

Oh, I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for will turn to rain

Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We're part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day

Oh, I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for will turn to rain

Oh, when the final line is over
And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall
I can hide inside your sweet, sweet love forever more
