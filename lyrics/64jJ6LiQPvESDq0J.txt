You ban me from sleeping pills and codeine
I'm at my best, just even knowing
You're coming around, you're coming around
You switch from vodka, lime and soda
And I hate every girl that's ever known ya
And you know a lot about me, it's more than I can stand
Only on weekends we feel the love
Only on weekends this happens to us
Only on weekends I have no room for anyone else, but you
And I took your number quicker than my next breath
I call your house phone just to listen, to hear what your life might sound like
What your life might sound like
Only on weekends we feel the love
Only on weekends this happens to us
Only on weekends I have no room for anyone else, but you
Only on weekends we feel the same
Only on weekends is what we do
Only on weekends I have no room for anyone else, but you
There's a place for us
There's a tiny little room for two
And it's crystallised in my mind, that tiny little room
With you
Only on weekends
Only on weekends we feel the love
Only on weekends this happens to us
Only on weekends I have no room for anyone else, but you
For anyone else, but you
Only on weekends
Only on weekends
On weekends I have no room for anyone else, but you
