Cold, am I?
I'm beside myself because there's no one else
Have I grown so blind? (so blind)
Only God could save you
If you knew your way to the light

So fly away
And leave it behind
Just stay awake
There's nowhere to hide

I see you 'cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you 'cause you won't quit screamin' my name
I feel you 'cause you won't stop touchin' my skin
I need you, they're comin' to take you away

Frail and dry (and dry)
I could lose it all but I cannot recall
It's all wrong
Don't cry (don't cry)
Clear away this hate
And we can start to make it alright

So fly away
And leave it behind
Return someday
With red in your eyes

I see you 'cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you 'cause you won't quit screamin' my name
I feel you 'cause you won't stop touchin' my skin
I need you, they're comin' to take you away

I see you 'cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you 'cause you won't quit screamin' my name
I feel you 'cause you won't stop touchin' my skin
I need you, they're comin' to take you away

Away
