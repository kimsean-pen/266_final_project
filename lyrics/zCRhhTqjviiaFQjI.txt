Turn my back to the door
Feel so much better now
Don't even try anymore
Nothing left to lose
There's a voice that's in the air
Saying 'don't look back nowhere'
There's a voice that's always there

And I'll never be quite the same
As I was before this
Part of you still remains
Though its out of focus
You're just somewhere that I've been
And I wont go back again
You're just somewhere that I've been

I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you

And I'll never be like I was
The day I met you
Too naive, yes I was
Boy let's that's why i let you in
Wear your memory like a stain
Can't erase or numb the pain
Here to stay with me forever

Breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you

One of these days, I'll wake up from this bad dream I'm dreaming
One of these days i pray that I'll be over over over you
One of these days, I'll realize that I'm so tired of feeling confused
But for now there's a reason that you're still here in my heart...
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life crazy loud
Like I have the right to

No more words in my mouth
Nothing left for me to doubt
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, breathing out
Like i have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
