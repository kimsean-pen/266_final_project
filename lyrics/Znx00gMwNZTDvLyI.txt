Puppet on a string, I can't control myself, can't control myself with you
I crawl out of my skin, things I'll tell no one else, things I'll show no one else but you

Pandoras opened up my toy box
And now I've started I cannot stop
Puppet on a string, like I don't know myself, I only know myself with you

Take my pure, and wash it all away, wash it all away some more
Take my pure and wash it all away, wash it all away till I'm cured
Take my pure

Puppet on a string, I can't control myself, can't control myself with you
I crawl out of my skin, things I'll tell no one else, things I'll show no one else but you

Pandoras opened up my toy box
And take my high and leave me unlocked
Puppet on a string, you claw me back to life, boy, I'm forever tied to you

Take my pure, and wash it all away, wash it all away some more
Take my pure and wash it all away, wash it all away till I'm cured
Take my pure

Take my pure, and wash it all away, wash it all away some more
Take my pure and wash it all away, wash it all away till I'm cured
Take my pure
