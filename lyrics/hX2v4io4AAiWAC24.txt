I believe, I believe in the things you do
And I wanna believe you believe that too
All the noise in my ear when I hear about you
Pray it can't, pray it don't, pray it won't come true

I know you were thinking
Bad things, when you kissed me, oh
Your tongue told me every lie
Sad song, warm occasion
Last week, sweat no matter what
I'll be stretching out the time

Oh, I know
That boy's gonna rip me up
'Cause he ain't that nice, he won't do right
He'll leave a nasty cut
Oh, I cry, until I just dissolve
Come on watch my heart turn to pulp
Like paper (paper-paper)
Paper Love
(Paper, paper, paper, paper love)

I believe, I believe in a line so thin
There's a light, there's a light, and it pulls me in
Going down, going down, 'til I chip my chin
Take my head in your hands, pop it with a pin
(With a pin)

I know you were thinking
Bad things when you kissed me, oh
Your tongue told me every lie
Sad song, warm occasion
Last week sweat no matter what
I'll be stretching out the time

Oh, I know
That boy's gonna rip me up
'Cause he ain't that nice, he won't do right
He'll leave a nasty cut
Oh, I cry, until I just dissolve
Come on watch my heart turn to pulp
Like paper (paper, paper)
Paper Love
(Paper, paper, paper, paper love)
