When the curtains fall
It rolls, unwraps, reminds me the person that I am
I'm still afraid, ashamed of what's behind me
But you gave me the strength to stand!

Sha-sha-shake it off
Go get the things you want.
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)

Just, sha-sha-shake it off
No one will ever know (won't know)
I'm a slave

To all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid
I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave
Sometimes when no ones left to listen

I'll sit and argue with myself
Say all the things I wish to tell you
Without hurting someone else
Sha-sha-shake it off, go get the things you want

I'll bottle the same (bottle the shame)
Just sha-sha-shake it off, no one will ever know (wont know)
I'm a slave
To all these voices in my head

And I'm afraid
I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave
To all these voices in my head

And I'm afraid
They'll walk with me until the end
Stop!
Hey, you, when'd ya get so cold? (when'd you get so cold?)
Hey, you, just do what you're told, do what you're told
Hey, you, you're gonna be a star
As long as you'll let us, we'll make you the person you aren't
I'm a slave
To all the voices in my head
And I'm afraid
I'm afraid, of what they've said
I'm a slave (I'm a slave)
To all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid (I'm afraid)
They'll walk with me until my end
Sha-sha-sha-shake it off
Go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
