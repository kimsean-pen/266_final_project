Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that...

I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (but you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
