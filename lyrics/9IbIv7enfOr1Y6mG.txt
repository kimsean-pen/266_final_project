I see you in your
yellow evening window
And I'm down on my knees
Drained to heaven
where you may fall asleep
softly and in peace.

One flesh we are
and shall be still
No man hates his own kind
while he is alive.

One flesh we are
And shall be still
And I shall never tired
of honouring you.

Heaven knows men is the tear I've shed
I know I won't ever forget
for one flesh we are
and shall be still
and I shall never tired
of honouring you.

And heaven knows I promise I'll try
To live, to die with dignity
you've taught me.

For one flesh we are
and shall be still
and I shall never tired
of honouring you.

For one flesh we are...
