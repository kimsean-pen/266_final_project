That sinking feeling when you're not yourself:
Searching for a reason for some kind of help, but all that comes is empty promises and feeling anxious and useless.
Then, when I'm at my worst, comes someone who I don't deserve.
I'll call her destroyer, and I'll destroy her.
If you never had the chance, sing hallelujah.
