I close my eyes all that I see
Is a group of spawn chewing at me
Turn to me and say it can't be true
There's no way i came out of you

Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Too old to be my father

Too young to be my friend
Will you talk to me? I'm real bored
We're in the house, looking at the dark
I'll give you your lobotomy

There's no way you came out of me
Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands

Too old to be my father
Too young to be my friend
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me

I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me

I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea
Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
