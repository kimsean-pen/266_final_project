I contemplate
In idols I once made
Beckoned faith
Questioning the motives of our way
Illusions speak with more life now
How can they be wrong?
Logic gone, blinded faith
Morals can't be found
Under your reason
Under reason
I hesitate
To grasp ideals you make
Disbelief
Truth in pantomime
Eyeless now as the innate
Where does absence lay?
With challenged sight
Does truth enlight? Or only shift the mind?
Under your reason, under reason
