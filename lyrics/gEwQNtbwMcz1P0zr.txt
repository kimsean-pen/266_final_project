Black water rising, I got no time
Can't get no feelings from this phone tonight
Since it's raining, raining night and day
She keeps on raining, the more I crave
Black water running through my hands tonight
Books are burning, my hands are tied
Let's go baby, I want it fast
Let's go baby, I want it to last

Gimme a try, gimme a try
We are two white horses running blind
Gimme a try, gimme a try
We are two white horses running blind

Black water rising, tryna make its way
She left me digging with a silver spade
Come on baby, why are you so slow
Come on baby, I've got to know now

Gimme a try, gimme a try
We are two white horses running blind
Give it a try, give it a try
We are two white horses running blind
