I think I'm asking too much
Be here with your love
I wonder forever
That you make it better
To feel the mercy burning through your hands
I'm deeply drowning, reaching for dry land

Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry

[?]
And was so upset
I fall like a feather
I always remember
I followed you forever in the dark
We thought that we were lost and here we are

Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)

Just don't let me go
Just don't let me go
Just don't let me go-o-o-o-o
Just don't let me go
Just don't let me go
Just don't let me go (don't let me go)

Don't let me go
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)
Just don't let me go hunger, hunger, hungry (don't let me go)
