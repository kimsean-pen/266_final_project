Baby, they don't want you
They only want to tear you apart
They believe if they drink you they'll be like you
It'll never end
The drag will keep on coming

Dragged out in the weather
Dragged out in the madness
Dragged out in your loneliness

Sometimes I wanna lose my mind
Lose myself
Sometimes I wanna
Lose my mind
Lose myself to something
To someone else
Won't you take me down
I'm so tired, I'm so tired

Dragged out in the weather
Dragged out in the madness
Dragged out in your loneliness
Dragged out
Dragged out
Dragged out
Dragged out
Dragged out
Dragged out
Dragged out
