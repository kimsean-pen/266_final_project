This building smelled so familiar
And I had thought the sense was lost
And in a day dream I imagined my house
where all my father's sense of strength was lost
And it's all we have
It's all we have so find me a place to begin.

If I could get this feeling to end
Trembling idle hands, holding me there.
We laugh in the face of love
because nobody's really there.
Nobody's real.

Desire I would try it either way,
and we believe in something invisible,
the sense of smell that you use all your life
(well now you know your father lied)
It's all we have so find me a place to begin.

If I could get this feeling to end
Trembling idle hands, holding me there.
We laugh in the face of love
because nobody's really there.
Nobody's real.

And I could never find my way without you,
but you're already there.
And we've, we've come a long long way without,
without maps in our hands.
It's all we have so find me a place to begin.

If I could get this feeling to end
Trembling idle hands, holding me there.
We laugh in the face of love
because nobody's really there.
Nobody's real.
