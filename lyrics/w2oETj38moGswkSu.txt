If had wrote you for your thoughts
Pretend they are my own and turn the other way
Still living in my regrets
Reflected in the mud
But I'm not ashamed
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
I won't deny it
So that you run away
Voices tell me I'm better off feeding
Leading all the violence I see without breathing
Threw that innocence not knowing what I've done
Cold sweat holds the chill of the evening
Floor boards creak and theres leaks in the ceiling
I'm slipping up
and almost gone
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
Won't you mind and turn the other way
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
I won't deny it
So rabbit run away
Inch by inch I am moving in circles
Stepping on the cracks with it all in my purpose
Counting my wins knowing what I've done
If I roll my luck 'cross the table
See my hope through the eye of the needle
A narrow miss and I'm gone
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
Won't you mind and turn the other way
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
I won't deny it
So rabbit run away
If I had a write you for your thoughts
Pretend they are my own and turn the other way
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
Won't you mind and turn the other way
Believe me I'm losing sense of it all
I won't deny it
So rabbit run away
