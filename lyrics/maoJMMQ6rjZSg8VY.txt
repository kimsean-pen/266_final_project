Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who lived by intolerance and hate
For what they couldn't understand
Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Beating and ripping at a beautiful human
Who did nothing more than be himself

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

Scarecrow is left crucified
Left freezing, bleeding, tied and wondering why
The wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers and the teachers
Government's close-minded creatures
Trying to teach us
To hate that which is different

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

It's 12:53 AM, October 12th when the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty
It's 12:53 AM, October 12th when the shepherd died
The candle's light will alight your departure

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
