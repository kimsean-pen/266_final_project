Looking for a letter Trace it in the Sand
Nothing was lost on the way
I couldn't stay holding your hand
Hours on the sidewalk staring at the sun
Everyone is wasting away wasting the day
jumping the gun

I know it all comes full circle
it all comes crashing down on you

Hide in your heart
Chase it til the morning
Sunlight is lost in your eyes
you never tried facing these things
Walking on a circle taking staking on a stride
Faces are not what they seem

I always dream facing the tide

I know it all comes full circle,
It all comes crashing down on you

I'm gonna make it make it better
I'm gonna get the best lock it and swallow the key

I'm gonna make it make it better
I'm gonna get the best lock it and swallow the key

I'm gonna make it make it better
I'm gonna get the best lock it and swallow the key

I'm gonna make it make it better
I'm gonna get the best lock it and swallow the key
