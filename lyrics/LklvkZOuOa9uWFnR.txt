Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night (night, night, night)

This bar is full of locals, tourists, drunks and we are all hopeful
praying that tonight we will be better than the rest
Most of us think we are movie stars give us a shot the world is ours
Come on baby, I think that you and I should dance

Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night (night, night, night)

Telling us stories about the younger years
We're framed by the names etched in the boothel
Letting my shoulder lean on yours in this cloud of cigarette smoke
I lose track of time on purpose tomorrow's gonna be long
but it's worth it to feel the spins of alcohol and freedom
He'd just might and we'd still could come to debate it if I should

Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night
Ohohohoh

This bar is shutting and I don't mind if you walk me out
Oh that's kinda what life's about

Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make, all night
Ohohohoh
He's my mistake to make all night
