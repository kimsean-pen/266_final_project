Feel like the raven's song, like we don't know where to go
Belief is a telescope that nobody taught you how to hold
I don't feel like that anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't feel alone when my soul is a mountain
I've been down that road

Feel like the raven's song, like we don't know where to go
Belief is a telescope that nobody taught you how to hold
I don't feel like that anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't feel alone when my soul is a mountain
I've been down that road

Dreamers on a riverbend
Swim against these currents of indifference
Differently dreaming words we never said
We were dancing past the way it could've been
We could've been so

Surrounded, facing Main Street and I'm back
Oh I flashback to peach schnapps and laughter
This train's moving backwards
This train's moving backwards
I swear this train's moving backwards
