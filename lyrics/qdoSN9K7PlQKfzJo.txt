I sit home and make flower bouquets and listen to joni mitchell

Try modulating and articulating all the feelings that I have for you
Dr. rock -- help me out for I need to shout it
Dr. rock -- quickly derek run & get your mammy
There is no denying that you been supplying in a slathering ball of flesh
Dr. rock -- come quickly to see the scene
Dr. rock -- got everything that you need

Don't conceal your tragic flaw -- give the dr. rock a call
Dr. rock -- come quickly to see the scene
Dr. rock -- got everything that you need
You're the apple of my eye -- but with some aid I feel you'll die
Dr. rock -- save the soul from a bottomless pit
Dr. rock -- and see what you can make of it

You like the suffocating on a small crustation as you hammered your way to the truth
Dr. rock -- was examined by an indian eye
Dr. rock -- another lie that you're going to die
Try modulating and articulating all the feelings that I have for you
Dr. rock -- help me out for I need to shout it
Dr. rock -- quick derek run, get your mammy

Dr. rock! dr. rock! dr. rock! dr. rock!
Ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhh
Ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhh
Ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhh
Dr. rock!
