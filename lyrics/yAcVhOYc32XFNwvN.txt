You can hit me a thousand times
Fire bullets, bring it on
It'll be like a drop of water
On a blazing fire
Because this is who I am

Take me on a trip inside your mind
Make me understand a logic so undefined
Far behind, unkind, and blind
Your personality outlined
You call yourself a mastermind?
I'd call it all, and you, a disgrace to mankind

I'm gonna break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away
Before I break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away
Look in my eyes, can you see the red?
I'm going crazy, I'm losing it
I'm gonna break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away
Before I break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away

Feed me all your hate
It's only gonna build me up inside
Thrive on other people's misery
It only speaks of your insecurity
Because this is who I am

Trolling, lying, because ignorance is bliss
Manipulating, faking identities
Watch the walls come down
I'm gonna break you now
Put you out, lights out
And if you have a heart
I'm gonna rip it out
Rip it out, I'm gonna rip it out

I'm gonna break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away
Before I break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away
Look in my eyes, can you see the red?
I'm going crazy, I'm losing it
I'm gonna break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away
Before I break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away

I'm gonna break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away (run away)
Before I break, break, break your face
Better run, run, run away (run away)
Look in my eyes, can you see the red?
I'm going crazy, I'm losing it
I'm gonna break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away
Before I break, break, break your face
You better run, run, run away
