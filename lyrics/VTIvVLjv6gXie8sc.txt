Here she comes with a master plan
And I'm starting to lose control
Here she comes to this trash of man
And I'm ready to taste it all... when
She's bringing me in
Checking me out
Making me Glorious

Here she comes like a brand new day
Belly dancing across the room
In the moonlight I watch her sway
To her rhythm I'll go as groom
with grace... tonight...
She's bringing me in

Checking me out

Making me Glorious
Well
Here she comes
Now
She's bringing me in
Checking me out
Making me Glorious
She's bringing me in
Turning me on
Making me Glorious
