Don't give a fuck about yesterday or give a fuck about today
And tomorrow gonna be the same fucking way
Bitches love me I'm hitting, when I'm gone they start to tripping
So much codeine in my body you can smell it when I'm pissing
Smoking like an engine
Fucking all these women
In my casket grinning, I can't help my fucking sinning
Monkey mother fuckers, give them all banana clips
Water on my lips smoking dope with the clique
Triple six hot tip
Bitches flip just to dip on the dick of a prick
Bouncing tits, licking nips
Mother fuckers out their minds thinking they can fuck with $UICIDE
Smoking on a dime, bitches love the Five Nine

Slice me with an icey knife please
I'm about to light these tightly rolled blunts
Got about a hundred of them looking like tree trunks
Yeah, my white T has got a bright G on the front
The five nine in the police eyes mean that me and Sloth steady never doing the right thing
Because I'm the fucking opposite of Spike Lee
Yeah, I'm the frightening great white
I'm biting lightning, bitch
I'm the skeleton waking at night
Three wishes I will grant and then I smite thee
Oh, you think you're dope?
I'm tighter than the rope around your fucking throat
I'll be the last thing you see before you fucking choke, ho
