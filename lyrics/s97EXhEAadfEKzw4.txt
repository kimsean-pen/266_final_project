Best stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
I don't care I'm down for what you want

Day drunk in the night
Wanna keep you here
Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights
How it is for us
And it's all beacuse

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fk for life
On and on and on

Love, give me love
Anything you want I'll give it up
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste your fingertips

Day drunk in the night
Wanna keep you here
Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights
How it is for us
And it's all beacuse

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fk for life
On and on and on

Bodies
Baby making bodies we just use for fun
Bodies
Let's use them up 'till every little piece is gone
On and on and on
On and on and on

(Talking body)
(Put it on me)

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fk for life
On and on and on
