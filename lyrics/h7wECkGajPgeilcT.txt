There is a wait and that's what hurt
Makes it happen, fill the gap
It spreads her hair all about
My steps
If I do it slow

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

I hurry back to make him feel Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
I have to make him feel better Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
And oh, I know, no I can't
Freshness
You amaze me

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

How he'll never come to freshness
You amaze me
How he'll never come to freshness
You amaze me
You amaze me
You amaze me

How he'll never come to freshness
You amaze me
Looking at love as faces I could give this
You amaze me
No threats, no fights, no fantasies
You amaze me
You amaze me
You amaze me

No, no threats No threats, no fights
No, no fights No threats, no fights
No fantasies No fights, no fantasies
Lucy

No, no, no threats
No, no threats No fights, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
No, no fights
No fantasies No threats, no fights
No fantasies No threats no fights
Lucy No fights, no fantasies
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
