Hold me back and hold me down
Hold me close then push me around
Beat me up, beat me down to the ground
I'm sure i deserved it
Left my world, left me alone
Locked inside head becomes my home
Inside a hole buried bag of bone
I'm sure you had your reasons
Out of your sight
Are you out of your mind?
In my absence your heart
Never grew fonder

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
I can't believe it so i walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
Have to believe it so i walk alone
So i walk alone
By myself

Had my back then you turned around
Love by your fault but we're never proud
Ran away but i'm not aloud
So i suffered through it
Out of your sight
Are you out of your mind?
In my absence your heart
Never grew fonder

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
I can't believe it so i walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
Have to believe it so i walk alone
So i walk alone

You're not my family
Just nothing left for me you see
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
What you've created
Why don't you take a look
And see through a hole without a key
And see what I've been missing
Goddamn you for what has

You're not my family
Just nothing left for me you see
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
What you've created
Why don't you take a look
And see through a hole without a key
And see what I've been missing
Goddamn you for what has been done
(No one left, for me)

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
I can't believe it so i walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me
It ain't so
Have to believe it so i walk alone
So i walk alone

It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea

It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea

It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea

It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
