Take a walk outside, it's a nice day for a drive automotivation
The air is getting clear, and the time is getting near for us to roll
Gotta watch my style cause God it's almost over
Got a little more room to try it hopefully
I've walked this earth for twenty years and now my mind is floating...
Out to sea

Gonna hit the van, man you just don't understand total aggravation
Rolling down the highway, doing ninety, going my way in control
Gotta watch those corners in the stretch of danger
A problem could arise eventually
I've walked this earth for twenty years and now my mind is floating...
Out to sea

Every time I look into the north wind
I can't find a meaning, just a rhyme
I don't know but I've been told that good things come with time
Let's go!
