When I was so low
You were there to lift me up
Well, there's one thing that I know for sure
You're gonna win life's lovin' cup

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue

Dependin' on you

And when I get too high
You are there to cool me down
So fine, someone to turn to
Keepin' my feet on the ground

Dependin' on you

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
Darlin', you're always there at my rescue

I just keep dependin' on you
Someone to turn to
Keepin' my feet on the ground
So fine

Darlin', you're always there at my rescue
Dependin' on you
Darlin', you're always there by my side
You're always there by my side
