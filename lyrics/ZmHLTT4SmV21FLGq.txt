Guard and armour, protect me when I falter
When I tire of a world that leaves me cold inside

In darkness be the sound and light
Be the beacon, be the guide
In the cause of all you justify

When I wander and far I stray
When this world has failed me
Give me strength and heal my soul
When I'm broken when I'm lost,
And roads seem neverending
Be the path that brings me home
When it feels I can't go on
Let your armour cover me

Time relentless takes no sides
Mortals burdened, lost and blind
Tread a dream, a gift we vilify

Where tempests rage upon the seas
And sirens call to lure and lead
Fragile hopes on vessels run aground

When I wander and far I stray
When this world has failed me
Give me strength and heal my soul
When I'm broken when I'm lost,
And roads seem neverending
Be the path that brings me home
When it feels I can't go on
Let your armour cover me

When I wander and far I stray
When this world has failed me
Give me strength and heal my soul

When it feels I can't go on
When it feels I can't go on
Let your armour cover me
