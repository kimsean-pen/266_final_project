Like a pill
Like a pill these dreams
Like a pill
Kill almost everything

Like a drop in the ocean
Life's a drop in the ocean
Like a pill it's all the same

Accept the pain, for all who ever tried
For all who tried

Overkill, Overkill it seems
Overkill, Feeding off all extremes
Loyalty through emotion
Cruelty kills devotion

Accept the pain, for all who ever tried
Accept the pain, as all our fears subside (our fears subside)

Like a pill
Like a pill these dreams
Like a pill
It's all the same, it's all the same

Accept the pain, for all who ever tried
Accept the pain, as spirits purify (purify)
