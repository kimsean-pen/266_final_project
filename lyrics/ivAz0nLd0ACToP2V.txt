On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear,
By the river bridge a cradle floating beside me.
In the whitest water on the banks against the stone
You will lift his body from the shore and bring him home

Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
Oliver James washed in the rain no longer

On the kitchen table that your grandfather did make
You and your delicate way will slowly clean his fate
And you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of
A innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love

Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
Oliver James washed in the rain no longer

Walk with me down the beach and through the valley floor
Love for the one you know more
Love for the one you know more

Back we go to your brother's house emptier my dear
The sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear

Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
