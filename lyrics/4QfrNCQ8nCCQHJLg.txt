Cruor falls upon a disobedient time.
Holocaust claims the weak and feeble lives.
Sickness wells, bursting within.
No escape from the bludgeon, except to give in.

Deep depression enters your mind.
Premeditated oppression conquers all thought.
Striving with little reason to be.
A wretched subject of this cryptocracy.

The wreath which is weaving, woven full of lies.
Bore out of teachery, it snuffs out your cries.
Spawn on this Earth, to bring out suffering.
Avaricious hunger fulfills its voracious legacy.

A say we don't have, where it's written we shall.
Your life stripped away, destined to fall.

Wanting to die for your faith.
Everything you are is laid to waste.
Blood falls free from your open wounds.
Sets souls free to complete doom.
Dying and killing for your crimes.
Forever your eyes are smitten blind.

Economical structure falls from our grasp.
Just the beginning to the core that's now cracked.
Fractures inflict the corporate level.
Wickedness infest life's everyday drivel, drivel.

Cities lie fallen, broken with disgust.
Citizens mangled with deceit and mistrust.
Crimson tide swells, flowing through the streets.
Decadence, the swift end that you will meet.

Eyes blackened blind to these lustful crimes.
Decency falters and is all left behind.
Nothing left for your, except fear for the world.
Evil abounds as the darkness unfurls.
Can't see no reason for what really matters.
Nothing on this planet can outlast it.
Cold outstretched hands reach for the sky.
Decadence surrounds all that will die.

Decadence, despair falls on your faith.
Why doesn't God hear your prayers?

Decadence remains the only thing for you.
Self pity and denial, play you for its fool.
Evil takes your life, beckon to its call.
Evil claims your souls, laughing at its fall.
Laughing as you fall.
