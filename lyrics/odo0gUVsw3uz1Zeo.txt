Come up to my lighthouse for I have something I wish to say
It can wait for a moment; well in fact
it can wait all day
I just wanted to bring you up here so you could have the chance to see
the beauty of this situation that
you could share with me

It may seem strange
to talk of love and then lighthouses
It's not strange
to me
Hey
All alone
you and I in our high tower
That's the way
to be

Some laugh at my lighthouse they say it's just an ivory tower
But I don't mind because I know
their envy grows by the hour
See I have a purpose up here to guide the ships upon their way
All this is mine; it could be yours too
what do you say?

It may seem strange
to talk of love and then lighthouses
It's not strange
to me
Hey
All alone
you and I in our high tower
That's the way
to be
Hehehey hey.
