Try to find a way to talk about it
I'm also in the mind to just let it go
How to reach out my mind if I can't think straight
With the goodness so gone I feel to isolate
You called me baby, I called you one too
Until you spoke to me with another voice
You sent in spiders to fight for you
I was so disappointed I didn't know what to do
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you

Wasting so many hours away
So many ways to waste a day
In this same city I hope you're not
Cuz the town has shrunk to the size of my thoughts
It was so mystifying to see you so changed
I felt some certainty that you must have died
Because how could I live if you're still alive?

I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you

I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
I wish I didn't miss you
