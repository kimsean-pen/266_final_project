Girl, you taste like coffee
And you feel like rain
I'm not the coffee, I'm not the hot rain
I'm like the dust on the windowpane

Down on the Sunset Strip train
French fries and lying eyes
Somebody, somewhere gets?
Is that why they call you here?

God bless America
God bless the USA
God lives in America
In the land of the free
Wishing they were dead
Wishing you were dead instead

It's cold and getting colder
Since the day I told her
I'm going to some place warmer
I'm going to California

Where the city falls down
The people blowing up their town
I'm gonna take that gun
Girl at the end of the world

God bless America
God bless the USA
God lives in America
In the land of the free
Wishing they were dead
Wishing you were dead instead
