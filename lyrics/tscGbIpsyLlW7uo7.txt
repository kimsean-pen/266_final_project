I'm losing sleep
So I walk these dirty streets
I heal bad blood
Run through this neighbourhood
I don't get it
This bed ain't filled with romance
This life ain't living
It's screaming in my face
All right

On my knees, yeah
Much too late
I don't believe that
Man needs God, thank God
And all night long, yeah
The city's dreaming
I can't forget you
You're all I got, my love

Oh in the side street shadows
I gotta hold my head up
There's a stale street stench
Got a stranglehold
Oh milk and honey
Won't heal my heartache
Gotta take that chance, yeah
And dance through life

On my knees, yeah
Much too late
I don't believe that
Man needs God, thank God
And all night long
The city's dreaming
I can't forget you
it's all I got my love, ooooh

I'm on my knees, yeah
Much too late
I don't believe that
Man needs God, thank God
And all night long
The city's dreaming
I can't forget you
You're all I got my love
