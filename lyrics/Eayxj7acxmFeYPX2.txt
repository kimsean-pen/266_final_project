Told me you were fine every night
They said that you were dead and that's alright
I stay awake at night to hear you cry
I told them I was fine but they don't buy

And I don't want
to see you around
Cause you seem like
You don't wanna try
And I know how
You're starting to feel
So leave me alone

I will see you cry and I won't try
To help and calm you down cause you just lied
I don't believe a word that you cry
Remember I was there when no one cared

And I don't want
to see you around
Cause you seem like
You don't wanna try
And I know how
You're starting to feel
So leave me alone

And I will hear you cry every night
You wish that I will care but I just won't
I hate when you attemp to yell and fight
They said that you were dead and that's alright
