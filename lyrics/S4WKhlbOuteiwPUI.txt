I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time

People rushing everywhere
Swarming 'round like flies
Think I'll buy a 44
Give 'em all a surprise

Think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died

Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by 10 o'clock
Who do they think they are?

I'd make an exception
If you want to save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died

Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself, suicide
What a scandal if I died
Suicide, headline news
On the state of teenage blues
