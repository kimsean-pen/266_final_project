Coming down,
I can feel the sound of the daybreak,
Losing shades of the way things were,
Time is turning,

Coming down,
I feel you on my mind,
Losing touch,
But I never find the time,
You know, You know, You know.

The evening stars never heal my scars,
But they oughta,
Changing tones move in snow-like shows,
Always burning.

Coming down,
I feel you on my mind,
Losing touch,
But I never find the time
You know, You know,
You know, You know.

Coming down,
I can feel the sound of the daybreak,
Losing shades of the way things were,
Time is turning.

Coming down,
I feel you on my mind
Losing touch,
But I never find the time
You know, You know,
You know, You know.

I can feel it,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Love is the answer,
Love is the answer.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
