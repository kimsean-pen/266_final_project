There's a secret we wanna know
But you keep it, yeah, you keep it for your own
And all the kids, all the kids wanna know
Where do I belong? Where do I go?
And they tell you

Why generation
Why generation
Why generation
Why

There's a secret we wanna know
How the hell, how the hell are we supposed to know?
How to live in the twenty-first century
When every move you make everyone can see
So they tell you

Why generation
Why generation
Why generation
Why generation

I remember the morning on my parents' bed
TV screen was burning through my head
There's a bad, bad man in our land
Why'd he do it? Will we ever understand?
And they tell you

Why generation
Why generation
Why generation
Why generation

Why generation
Why generation
Why generation
Why generation

"Fuck, fuck is this?"
"Hello?"
