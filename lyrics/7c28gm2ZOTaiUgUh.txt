If I scale the castle wall, will that do
Win your affection if I fall, call truce
We boys like bells, like gongs
That put the town into a song
Get used to the wrongs
I'm gonna do for you
Get used to the wrong
I'm gonna do to you when you ask
Your move
Won't you come down from your chambers and speak
Nightgown and candle down the staircase to me
We boys like birds, our tongues and words
The guards have never heard
Get used to the wrongs
I'm gonna do for you
Get used to the wrong
I'm gonna do to you when you ask

Horseback
In the middle of the night
I know a route out
We could be far, enough by daylight
Pack quickly, be discreet beneath the night sky
Sweet veil of our relief
We're gone
You're the ire of your father
But the other half of me

Would I define young love in a rhyme, would that suit
We could abscond, be gone, on our way
We boys like bells, like gongs
That put the town into a song
Get used to the wrongs
I'm gonna do for you
Get used to the wrong
I'm gonna do to you when you ask
Your move
Won't you come down from your chambers and speak
Nightgown and candle down the staircase to me
We boys like birds, our tongues and words
The guards have never heard
Get used to the wrongs
I'm gonna do for you
Get used to the wrong
I'm gonna do to you when you ask

Horseback
In the middle of the night
I know a route out
We could be far enough by daylight
Pack quickly, be discreet beneath the night sky
Sweet will of our relief
We're gone
You're the ire of your father
But the other half of me
You're the ire of your father
But the other half of me
