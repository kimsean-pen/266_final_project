Up in the hill
Lover's where you shouldn't go
Up in the hill
High enough to break a bone
Up in the hill
Where you trick yourself to death
Up in the hill
Eyes won't close
And mind won't rest

Where do you go
In your rocket turbo
So far from home
There is no heart
And there is no soul
Too high to know
Are you really there
Or is it just they told me so

Devil knows high
Devil knows low
Jet back to me
You're my wonder and fear
It's always been clear
You're a cosmic dream
Are you really there
Or is it just the wild eyed boy
