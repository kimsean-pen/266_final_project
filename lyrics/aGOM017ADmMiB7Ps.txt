Feeling loose, walk and talk, moving fast, I take it all
...fall, it's aid and done, so hold on, life is rough
I wanna be, in the sky, I wanna be, riding high
Speeding cars, the ... wind, the burning speed, it breaks my skin
I turn it back, a ...sky, moving fast, I wanna die
I feel the wind, breathe the air, driving fast, I still don't care
I start to fall, I loose control, I try to turn, I start to roll
I can't hold on, moving so fast
I wish I had the chance to do it all again
Believe you are the one, but I was riding away
I kinda followed the sun

You are the one
I feel the wind, I feel the rain, follow the road, into the lake
... have it all, now count ... to fall
It disappears into the sky, I'm on road, about to die
I break my face, I break my life,
I wish I had the chance to do it all again
Believe you are the one, but I was riding away
I kinda followed the sun
And it feels so good inside, when you survive
Faster than an engine, feeling right
