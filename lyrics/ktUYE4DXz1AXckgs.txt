I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing
But must have used the wrong line
I been on the right trip
But I must have used the wrong car
Head is in a bad place and I wonder what it's good for
I been in the right place

But it must have been the wrong time
My head is in a bad place
But I'm having such a good time
I been running trying to get hung up in my mind
Really got to give myself a good talking to this time

Just need a little brain salad surgery

Got to que my insecurity
I been in the wrong place
But it must have been the right time
I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong song
I been in the right vein
But it seems like a wrong arm
I been in the right world
But it seems like wrong-wrong-wrong wrong-wrong
Slipping dodging sneaking creeping hiding down the street
See my life shaking with every who I meet
Refried confusion is making itself clear
Wonder which way do I go to get on out of here
I been in the right place
But it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing
But I must have used the wrong line
I took the right road
But I must have took a wrong turn
I took a right move
But I made it at the wrong time
I was in the right trip
But I made it in the wrong car
Head is in a good place and I wonder what it's bad for
