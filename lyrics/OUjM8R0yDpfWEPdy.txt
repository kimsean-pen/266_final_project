Baby behave we'll make it work
Are you with me?

You're not golden and I'm getting tired
Act like you own the place when really you've only just arrived
I caught first glimmers in hides and skins
Look who's all grown up, black swanning about the solar winds

You're gonna lose it all and find yourself on your knees
So get a grip and you might flow reverse the great slow bleed
I've tried patience but you always want a war
This house won't tolerate anymore

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

The cold shoulder, folded arms, the looking up
You've never listened and carry on careless regardless
This is not a fire drill and if we hold any hope
It's harmonic connection, in stereo symbiosis

These Legoland empires choking out mine
Now you're everywhere, everywhere multiplying around me child
A strain on my heart
This rock can't tolerate anymore

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Baby behave we'll make it work
(Do you love me?)

Get only what you give back

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Stop this right away
Put that down and clean this mess up
End of conversation
Put your back in it and make it up to me now

Are you with me?
Get only what you give back
