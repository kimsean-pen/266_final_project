Look up look up im bleeding
How long how long till were in love
Wait by wait by your feelings
Am I am I just dreaming

I want you to stop with me tonight

Look out look out I? m screaming

Lies lies
You? re telling me white lies sleeping with another man.
Lies lies
Your telling me sweet lies sleeping with everything.

Look out look out I? m moving
Don? t stop don? t stop or we will never move
Stand by stand by your feelings
Am I the same or am I changing

Lies lies

Lies lies
You? re telling me white lies sleeping with another man.
Lies lies
