Lose all my control
Don't you know I never had it
When I wallow in the belly if my thoughts
When they're processing your beautiful androgyny
Guess it says a lot to me

I don't feel like,
I'm your first thought

You can do what you want to
But nothing's gonna make me eat
Grinning when it swallows
Sinister is normal, and it's full of men
I got a scissor idea, and it goes on,
And on

And it's full of men
I got a scissor idea, and it goes on,
And on

And it's full of men
I got a scissor idea, and it goes on,
And on

I got a scissor idea, and it goes on,
And on
