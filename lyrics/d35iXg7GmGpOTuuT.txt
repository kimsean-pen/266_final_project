The kingcrawler of mercy
Will sit you in his perch
Death lurks 'round the corner
When the clowns begin to smirk

Glued to the blood are the stains
The scars that trickle your pretty face
Rescue the hands that fiddle the bet
And roll the dice to forget

The kingcrawler
He'll take you down, down, down
The kingcrawler
He'll take you down, down, down

Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Gazing are the stars that light up the sky
When he sees the fear in your eyes
Give up the escape route you're here to stay
Bow down on your shaking knee and you'll go

The kingcrawler
He'll take you down, down, down
The kingcrawler
He's the kingcrawler
He'll take you down, down, down
