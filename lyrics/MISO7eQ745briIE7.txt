Hazy
Like my own
Ache and moan
All your problems
Easy
Oh

The city line
Is twisting
Into another
She's looking for it
An entering
Into another

Easy
Tell me 'bout your karma
Easy
Don't try to push it cause we're in
Oh, no
Easy
Tell me 'bout your place
Easy
Don't try to push it, I can pull you in

Fade in
Another day
Go your way
All my problems
Please me
Oh

I think I need
At least what I can hear
I think I need
At least another

EZ
Tell me 'bout your karma
EZ
Don't try to push it cause we're in
Oh, no
Easy
Tell me 'bout your place
Easy
Don't try to push it, I can pull you in
