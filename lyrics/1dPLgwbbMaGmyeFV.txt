Lived through you
Safe with how we lived our lives
With how it all turned out (but things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout
Will make you change your mind

Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

When I see you, I can read it in your eyes
Fate misunderstood (but things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for
Thinking with your heart

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know
Dark will turn to light
In time I'll be alright, I know, I know

I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold
So black
So alone

Living goes by fast, catch your breath and it will pass you by
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
