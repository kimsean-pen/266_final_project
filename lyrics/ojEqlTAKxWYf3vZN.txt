No control, no surprise!
Toss the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty, I fuck up everything I see
Fighting in futility!

And so the final war, tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
Take the hand or fist, just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

No control, no surprise!
Toss the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty, I fuck up everything I see
Fighting in futility!

I give you what you came for, this is not the same though
Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so
Y'all all get the same flow, I got that insane flow
I ain't shocking, catching, never really in my range, though
It's a half angle, high fried pain, go
All prime time, Imma let the bass bang low
Are you fucking lames go, aiming at my name, no
Careful what you shoot for, 'cause you might hit what you aim for
Careful what you shoot for, 'cause you might hit what you aim for

No control, no surprise!
Toss the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty, I fuck up everything I see
Fighting in futility!

No control, no surprise!
Toss the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty, I fuck up everything I see
Fighting in futility!

I'm not allowed to say certain things
Thank you!
