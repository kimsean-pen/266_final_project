Playin' on your own in a dusty bar
Nobody could tell that you a star
Nobody could feel all the pain you express
Hey, dusty diamond, soon you'll outshine them

Timothy, play your song
Ooh, 'til the break of dawn
Play for the mornin' moon
And let it soothe
Broken parts
Ooh, every broken heart
Play for the lonely one
And let it run

Little blue bird, you will never fit in
That's the biggest gift you ever could get
Passion pull you in, pull you in on the trip
Hey, dusty diamond, soon you'll outshine them

Timothy, play your song
Ooh, 'til the break of dawn
Play for the mornin' moon
And let it soothe
Broken parts
Ooh, every broken heart
Play for the lonely one

Once on the cover of a magazine
Once everybody wanna be your friend
(Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everyone is saying that they knew you back when
Young dusty diamond, soon you'll outshine them

Timothy
Play your song
Ooh, 'til the break of dawn
Timothy, play your song
Ooh, 'til the break of dawn

Sendin' up shivers
Now you're up on the big stage
Girls cryin' rivers
For the same lonely songs you sang
The old black
When everybody laughed and laughed and laughed
Now you're on the big stage, Timothy, yeah
Ooh, Timothy

Everybody said, ooh-wow, ooh-wow
Timothy, yeah
Everybody said, ooh-wow, ooh-wow
Timothy, yeah
Everybody said, ooh-wow, ooh-wow
Timothy, yeah
Everybody said, ooh-wow, ooh-wow
Timothy, yeah
