You just gotta be the one
Gotta be more than a shadow
Turned by a petty note
Drippin' on and out of it
You don't wanna say it tonight, oh
Girls found the alcohol
Made the pictures of their dreams tonight
Move a little closer, baby, you afraid of?
Something out of fire, baby, burn it up!
Tattoo on yo chest, I ask ask you yo name
Move a little closer, baby, you afraid of?
(Fade out)
