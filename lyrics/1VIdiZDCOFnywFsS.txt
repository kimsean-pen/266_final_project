I don't know which way the current flows
But I'm taking with it tonight
And where it goes, well only heaven knows
But you know it's crossed my mine

I can already feel it now
You're closing in
Feel the pressure of your fingertips
On my skin

You don't have to say it, say it
If there's something left I'll take it
I'm no stranger to your to-o-ouch
Visions running through me, through me
I'm living in my memory
I'm no stranger to your to-o-ouch
To-o-ouch
To-o-ouch

We're intimate acquaintances
Tangled up again
Playing ignorant to our experience
When we both know how it's gonna end

I can already feel it now
You're closing in
Feel the pressure of your fingertips
On my skin

You don't have to say it, say it
If there's something left I'll take it
I'm no stranger to your to-o-ouch
Visions running through me, through me
I'm living in my memory
I'm no stranger to your to-o-ouch
To-o-ouch
Your to-o-ouch
To-o-ouch
Your to-o-ouch

Feel the pressure building, my body's aching
When the walls come down I don't need saving
All the stars surrounding, there's no more waiting
I'm not gonna bring it back up
If you're not gonna bring it back up

You don't have it say it
