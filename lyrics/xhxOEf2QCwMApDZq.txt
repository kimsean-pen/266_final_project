Like Elvis, like everyone
We all die, we all live on in photos
And paperbacks, if we're lucky
We're coming back

Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over, over me

We notice
We understand
We throw out all we can

We're on the market
We're up on racks
If we're really lucky
We're coming back

Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over me

Like Elvis, like everyone
We all die, we all live on in photos
And paperbacks, if we're lucky
We're coming back

I would never decide
I would never decide

Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over, over
Mother Mary over, over me
