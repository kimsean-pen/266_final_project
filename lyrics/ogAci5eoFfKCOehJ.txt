She walks into the room
And everybody moves
It's not a day too soon
She stands
And strikes her pose
Yeah, whoa, whoa

She's back
Keep on sayin'
That you want to see her
She's back
Look in the mirror
And you want to be her
She's back
From the beginning
It's a long career
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

She's back
People screaming
That you want your diva
She's back
I always told you
That I'd never leave you
She's back
From the beginning
It's a long career
Guess who's back?
