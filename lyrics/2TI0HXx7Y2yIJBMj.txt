See me in the basement
Watching the water rise
See me in the classroom
Watching the seconds tick by
See me in the attic
Trying out a new disguise
See me in the hallways
Avoiding everybody's eyes

I was on a stoney beach
Watching the sea birds fly
I was looking at a mountain side
From the back of a bus, so high

The past is filled with episodes
No one will televise
