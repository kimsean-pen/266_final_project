Never as a child
Would you give this time of day
You would take it from the shadows
And you give it another name

But now it's all that's left

And though it awful gentle takes you
And it awful slowly leaves
It's a weight I wouldn't wish upon
And I wish I wouldn't have to wait

Now it's all that's left

Never as a child
Now it's so vivid

Given to the wild
While the ways of a child
Are whiled away, whiled away
