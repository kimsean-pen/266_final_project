As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's a cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be lovin' you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
And I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
(True love don't wanna pay)
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever
Another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Always
Always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more
