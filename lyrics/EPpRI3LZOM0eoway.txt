Part of me
You will always be a part of me
And now your ink is stuck onto my skin
Yeah, it will never turn to nothing, no
Part of me
What we had will always follow me
Oh, you will never be my everything
It will never turn to nothing, no

Tell me, can you think of one thing
That keeps on going on forever
And say are you and me that something?
The exception, wish things could be better

But I know we tried
Sorry good things end with fights
Tryna get you off my mind
And now I feel like shit but it's for the better

Part of me
You will always be a part of me
And now your ink is stuck onto my skin
Yeah, it will never turn to nothing, no

Part of me
What we had will always follow me
Oh, you will never be my everything
It will never turn to nothing, no

I try to drink away my feelings
When they tell me to go back, no
Would you say you're still my friend still?
Pour me another, wish things could be better

But I know we tried
Sorry good things end with fights
Tryna get you off my mind
And now I feel like shit but it's for the better

Part of me
You will always be a part of me
And now your ink is stuck onto my skin
Yeah, it will never turn to nothing, no

Part of me
What we had will always follow me
Oh, you will never be my everything
It will never turn to nothing, no

(Part of me)
(Part of me)

Part of me
You will always have a part of me
I wish that you could be my everything
