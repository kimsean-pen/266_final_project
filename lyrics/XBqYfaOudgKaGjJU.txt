Bound for the Blessing
You wouldn't see it coming
I keep you guessing
Watch while you come undone.

You were an island that no one would dare to tread upon.
I came in like the wise men, and ask you to take my gift of love.

Hold me responsible. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.
Hold me accountable. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.

Careful confessions
Can't scare you with my crime
I learned my lesson
Love you a little at a time.

But I'm losing my patience, getting acquainted with the edge.
I'm ready and waiting. Happy to stand convicted.

Hold me responsible. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.
Hold me accountable. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.

I can't change you when you won't change yourself.
But I see you slowly becoming someone else.
I can't blame you for the strength you lack.
Scared to give what you may not get back.

Hold me responsible. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.
Hold me accountable. It's all my fault.
I want you to hold me any way you can.
