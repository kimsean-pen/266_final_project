Lightly fall on me
And stroke my skin, silently
Rest, absorb the heat
Listen to me as I breathe

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

You let night skies shine
Reflecting light onto me

The strongest taste, the guarantee
The sweet and tender memory
A stronger taste that guarantees
A fading memory

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Lightly fall on me
And stroke my skin, silently
Rest, absorb my heat
Melt into me as I freeze

Lightly (Don't go) fall on me (Don't go)
And stroke (Don't go) my skin, silently (Don't go)
Rest (Don't go), absorb my heat
Melt (Don't go) into me as I freeze (Don't go)
