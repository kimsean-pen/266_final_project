Put on your crisp white shirt
I'll wear a bright red skirt
I'll take a taxi ride
So we can drink all night

I know it's been so long
But boy you still turn me on
'Cos tonight I want to
Make love like strangers

No more fighting, no more pain
It would drive us both insane
Let's just do it like we just met
(Do it, do it, do it, yeah)
Write your number on my hand
Sweat it off when we dance
And we'll do it like we just met

Ooh oh mouth to mouth we touch
Resuscitating
What we nearly lost,
I never wanna
Let you go so just
Do it like we never met before
Give me mouth to mouth

Walk through the neon lights
I love this London eye
Come here my big brown eyes
And kiss these lips of mine

Now will you walk me home? (Yeah, yeah)
And if you're wanting more (yeah, yeah)
Just ask I won't say no (yeah, yeah)
Lets make this magic

No more fighting, no more pain
It would drive us both insane
Let's just do it like we just met
(Do it, do it, do it, yeah)
Write your number on my hand
Sweat it off when we dance
And we'll do it like we just met

Ooh oh mouth to mouth we touch
Resuscitating
What we nearly lost,
I never wanna
Let you go so just
Do it like we never met before
Give me mouth to mouth

Oh when you touch me I turn golden
Forgot to remember you could make me feel this
Won't go to work tomorrow morning
Stay in all day and tell the neighbours, know your name
And I know that sometimes baby (sometimes baby)
I can seem a little crazy (little crazy)
Just grab me by the back of my neck
And give me mouth to mouth

Ooh oh mouth to mouth we touch
Resuscitating
What we nearly lost,
I never wanna
Let you go so just
Do it like we never met before
Give me mouth to mouth

Ooh oh mouth to mouth we touch
Resuscitating
What we nearly lost,
I never wanna
Let you go so just
Do it like we never met before
Give me mouth to mouth
