Been torn apart,
got so many scratches and scars,
maybe they wont all go away,
but they'll fade,
maybe time can mend us together. again.
Its not what we've done but, how far we've come.

We will recover
the worst is over, now.
All those fires we've been walking through,
and still we survive, somehow.
We will recover
the worst is behind
and it hurts, but in time, i know that we will recover.
(Yeah yeah)

Got so much to lose,
seems ive lost my power to choose, oh
what to love and when to let go,
that all changed,
get biten once and then your afraid
what a waste,
look what we've done,
how far we've come.

We will recover,
the worst is over, now.

All those fires we've been walking through,
and still we survive, somehow.
We will recover,
the worst is behind,
and it hurts, but in time, i know that we will recover.
Everybodys gotta, a reason to cry,
and everybody fights but, not everyone survives
and everybodys searching, not everybody finds
and im still in recovery, and i'll make it alive?

We will recover,
the worst is over, now.
all those fires we've been walking through
and still we survive, somehow.

we will recover
the worst is behind, and it hurts but in time,
i know that we will recover,
the worst is over, now.
