Fake deals in the supermarket
TVs selling what you can't get
She laughs, "Nowhere is as pretty as this"

Grey cars crawling in the slow lane
Lost stars waiting for the DART train
She smiles, turns and blows the city a kiss

Under the waves I feel her pull my body down
Under the waves she takes me where I wanna drown
I can be miles away, she calls to me
This girl is a beautiful sea

Freeze frame graffiti at the bus stop
Star Wars, chewing gum and punk rock
She says, "What d'you say we give this a miss?"

Let's go, take me where the wind blows
Sail ships far into tomorrow
We can turn and blow the city a kiss

Under the waves I feel her pull my body down
Under the waves she takes me where I wanna drown
I can be miles away, she calls my name
She gets into my veins
And writes my poetry
This girl is a beautiful sea
The girl is a beautiful sea
This girl is a beautiful sea
The girl is a beautiful sea
