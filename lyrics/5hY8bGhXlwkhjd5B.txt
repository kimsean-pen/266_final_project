So here we are
Back to the start again
Trying hard to wait 'til morning

Hey, Rise and shine
And open up your eyes
To give this world some color
Shine on diamond eyes
Seperate the space between love and lies

And as days go by, the memories remain
I'll wait for you
And as days go by the memories remain
I won't let go
These days remain the same.
Pictures fade away

Please don't ever, change.
Please don't change your mind
No matter what they say
I'll always wait

And as days go by, the memories remain
I'll wait for you.
And as days go by, the memories remain
I won't let go.
These days remain the same.
Pictures fade away

I hope you never fade.
As you drip through my veins.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.

As days go by the memories remain
I'll wait for you
As days go by
I swear I'll try until I die
Anything for you
As days go by
I swear I'll try until I die
Anything for you...
