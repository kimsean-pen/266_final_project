Enough to drive a man to drink, I don't do no washing up
I always leave the stuff piled up
Piled up in the sink

(But you will always find him in the kitchen at parties)

Me and my girlfriend we argued and she ran away from home
She must have found somebody new and now I'm all alone
Living on my own
What am I supposed to do?

(That's why you'll always find him in the kitchen at parties)
(You will always find him in the kitchen at parties)
(You will always find him in the kitchen at parties)

Then I met this debutante, I said that I like New Wave rock
She was into French cuisine but I ain't no Cordon Bleu
This was at some do in Palmer's Green
I had no luck with her

(You will still find him in the kitchen at parties)
(You will still find him in the kitchen at parties)

At last I met a pretty girl, she laughed and talked with me
We both walked out of the kitchen and danced in a new way

And now I've done my time in the kitchen at parties
I've done my time in the kitchen at parties

(He's done his time in the kitchen at parties)
(He's done his time in the kitchen at parties)
(He's done his time in the kitchen at parties)
