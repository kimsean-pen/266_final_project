Fly over land and the open sea
Far and away as the eye can see
Dark clouds upon us
Facing our fears in the darkest of times

The power of mind is a mystery
Strong as the word it can set you free
Kneel my apprentice
Surrender your thoughts and you'll enter the light

In a moment of silence
When the forces gathers its violent rage
Wands and witches chanting high

From the north to the Blackwater sea
Nine in the line only one there can be
From the south to the Blackwater sea
Twelve in a row and they're white as the snow
From the east to the Blackwater bay
Land of the dragon from far and away
From the west to the Blackwater bay
The one to rule them all in the Blackwater bay
In the Blackwater bay

A magical stone is the wizard's eye
Bare to the bone he can never die
Master enchanter
Traveling far in the mirror of time

A prophecy held in the keeper's chain
Drawn from afar otherworldly plain
Breaker deceiver
Follow my path to the foreign land

In a moment of silence
When the forces gathers its violent rage
Wands and witches chanting high

From the north to the Blackwater sea
Nine in the line only one there can be
From the south to the Blackwater sea
Twelve in a row and they're white as the snow
From the east to the Blackwater bay
Land of the dragon from far and away
From the west to the Blackwater bay
The one to rule them all in the Blackwater bay
In the Blackwater bay

When the battle is lost
And all our souls have returned to heaven
For the glory of all
Cause my adventure is over now
In twilight shadows fall

From the north to the Blackwater sea
Nine in the line only one there can be
From the south to the Blackwater sea
Twelve in a row and they're white as the snow
From the east to the Blackwater bay
Land of the dragon from far and away
From the west to the Blackwater bay
The one to rule them all in the Blackwater bay
In the Blackwater bay
