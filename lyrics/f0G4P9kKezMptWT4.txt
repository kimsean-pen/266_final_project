A lonely ghost dancing
Through rainy nights and grey days
Yet so fatal and consuming

Loving words and silent strokes
Arm in arm, skin on skin
Arm in arm, skin on skin

The light is shining off the apartment
Hiding affairs and lonely hearts
Lonely hearts

All smoke is gone
And I wait in apathy
You"re not in my room anymore!
You"re not in my room anymore!
