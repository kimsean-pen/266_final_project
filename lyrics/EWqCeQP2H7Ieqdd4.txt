It's time so let's go
It's time so let's go home
Everybody just stares
As we walk right through the door
And all the people that we
And all the people that we used to know
Look like they've been in a war
With themselves, with their friends
They're still the same
It's like a game
But no longer fun
No longer fun, no longer fun

And I used to cry, cry, cry about it
Used to laugh, laugh, laugh and shout it
But it's no longer fun, it's no longer fun

We all think you are special
We all think you are special
'Cause you hang around the places were people go
To impress, dressed to kill so they can steal

Its like a game but no longer fun
No longer fun no longer fun

And I used to cry, cry, cry about it
Used to laugh, laugh, laugh and shout it
But its no longer fun
It's no longer fun

And I used to cry, cry, cry about it
Used to laugh, laugh, laugh and shout it
But its no longer fun its no longer fun
Used to cry, cry, cry about it
Used to laugh, laugh, laugh and shout
But its no longer fun
Its no longer fun
Used to cry, cry, cry about it
Used to laugh, laugh, laugh and shout
But its no longer fun
Its no longer fun
