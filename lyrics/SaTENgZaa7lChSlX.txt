Yeah
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes I need in the night
There's a path there
I'm unknowing
What is back there on the other side
All I can do is the same
That's the price I pay
Because I love her all of the time
When I'm giving
When I'm restless
When I'm waiting for her to signal twice
If this is the last time
I'll make it the best time and crystallize time
I'm tethered

Go ahead
Lead me on
Go and put your head on my stomach
And bring me to life

The pact we made is Faustian and not without heavy head
I'll have what I want but not without consequence
Bought
Sold
Tongue is tied
Lead a different life
Take a different road

And settle...
Settle me down, girl
I'm not meant for stress of this kind and my head hurts
The lesson here
No one ever fall in love again
I guess that if you've got it lock it up

Is it public, the need in my life
Am I desperate and grieving
Constantly stressed for no reason or meaning?
Let me inside
And finally caved on Saturday night
And I think I need to tell my friends about it
How natural it seemed
To be present
In the moment
Not trapped by the past
This will change us
Won't it
And in all honesty
I can honestly say that you'll stand next to me

The mystery is gone
Curtains are gone
Totally
Visibly
Exposed and it seems that I'm outside in darkness
Beyond the trees
I am waiting
Can you see me

How can I tell you where I have been lately
Dimensions away and void of all patience
Bought
Sold
Tongue is tied
Lead a different life
Take a different road

Suffer on
Suffer on
Suffer on...
