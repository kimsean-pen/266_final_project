Just to be here, just to feel, you now
Theres been too much pressure in the boiler
And I need to calm down
Just to breathe here, oxygen in and out
Theres been too much poison in the system
Festering toxins are hangin' 'round
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
We expire but we've got a life to love
And just like live wires, we all need plugged in
It's the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
It's the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
Feel us, stop here, slowly shut-ting down
We need to kick start the engine
To see that we miss the humming sound
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
Got to get this out, out of my head
Out in the air
We expire but we've got a life to love
And just like live wires, that we all need plugged in
It's the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
It's the way we are, the way we are, the way we are
Vibrations run, running, rushing flood, we soak it up
Oh oh oh, and we poured it from our heart
...and we poured it from our hearts
