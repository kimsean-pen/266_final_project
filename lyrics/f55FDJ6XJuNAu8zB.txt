I'm not a cool guy anymore
as if I ever was before
I took a look at all the signs
then rolled it over in my mind
the feelings I could not release
became a bitter part of me
what was I thinking of?
it couldn't stay the way it was
I looked at my reflection
and I saw a stranger's face
I saw where I was going a
and I had to walk away

I lost a girl, it's just as well
she tried to save me from myself
I've still got her on my mind
tossing and turning in my bed
but if she had stayed another week
I would have dragged her down with me
she took it 'til she had enough
is that what I thought love was?
I told her "see you later"
But it's hard to see at all
at the bottom of the barrel
with your back against the wall

I'm not a cool guy anymore
left it behind and closed the door
I know you can't escape the past
now I look back and have to laugh
I was my worst enemy
it almost got the best of me
what was I thinking of?
it couldn't stay the way it was
I looked up one day and saw it was up to me
you can only be a victim if you admit defeat
I looked up one day and saw it was up to me
you can only be a victim if you admit defeat
