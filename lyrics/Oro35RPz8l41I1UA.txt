It's your big day in the north
It's your big day in the north, love

Sha-sher sha-shy pinapple
When you smile en coeur le Big Apple
Attention, get up charge your face
La ou mais ou mon ami

Monsieur- achta st-elle noir
St-elle na tu souries
Elle-st ne gros pas
Elle-st comprends

It's your big day in the north, love
It's your big day in the north, love
Grand jour pour la nord, amour
It's your big day in the north, love

Sticks and stones may break your bones
But love, love will always hurt you
Bloodshot eyes scan the skies
Oh my, oh my, oh my

St-elle na tu souries
Elle-st ne gros pas
Elle-st comprends
