On Vineland past the candle shrine that burns on every night
For someone

She lets herself go like an angel in the snow
She lays down on her back
Down on her back - she goes

Take me over when I'm gone
Take me over make me strong
Take me over when I'm gone
Will they burn for me

On Vineland past the candle shrine that melts into the street design - she waits
For someone

Tonight she'll give herself away
She'll break apart all by her, by herself
So easy how we come undone

Take me over when I'm gone
Take me over make me strong
Take me over when I'm gone
Will they burn for me

She pulls me in and strips me down
She pulls me in and turns me out
She pulls me in and strips me down to the ground

On Vineland past the candle shrine that melts into the street design - she waits

Tonight she'll give herself away
She'll break apart all by her, by herself
So easy how we come undone

Take me over when I'm gone
Take me over make me strong
Take me over when I'm gone
Will they burn for me

Take me over when I'm gone
Take me over make me strong
Take me over when I'm gone
Will they burn
Will they burn for me
Take me over
Will they burn for me
Take me over
Will they burn for me
Take me over
Will the burn for me
