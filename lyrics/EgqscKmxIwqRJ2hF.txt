Pouring in and around the great wellspring
Of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your
Cool, cool fire

Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is as concrete
Doesn't and voices can drown

Why should I? Why should I?
Why should I? Why should I?
Solidify, make me real
So you can see me

I guess you thought I'd hide the sun from
My liquid thoughts and make ice for you
You thought I'd seed my clouds
With the rain of your personal dreams

I guess you thought I'd throw confetti
At your parade of lofty thoughts
I guess you thought I'd shine good mornin'
In some good mornin' jack surprise

Why should I? Why should I?
Why should I? Why should I?
Solidify, make me real
So you can see me

Pouring in and around the great wellspring
Of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your
Cool, cool fire

Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is as concrete
Doesn't and voices can drown

Why should I? Why should I?
Why should I? Why should I?
Solidify, make me real
So you can see me

See me, see me so clearly
Why should I?
I need bearings in the face of your
Cool, cool fire

Why should I?
Why should I?
Solidify
