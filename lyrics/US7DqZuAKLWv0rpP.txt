You told me that you wanted it
I knew it wasn't true
Turned out to be the truth, babe
You know what you can do

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
Goodbye for you

Wrapped around your little finger
Under you thumb too
You know that I'm a singer
I'm singin' just for you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
So much for you
Goodbye

I hope you got my little message
I hope you hear me
I thought you might've been the answer
Obviously crazy

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
But you're a fair screw

I guess I better get movin'
Lots of things I've gotta do
I realise it was a waste of time
Talkin' sense to you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
