I'm closer to the shore
My eyes can see it
It's us against the world
For the eyes who want to know
I can't explain it
It's us against the world

Home is where the roses lay
Any noise can cut through cold
Common days the truth has shown

What do I need to start again
A new millennium
My heart it beats the same as yours

I walked into the storm
Frozen by my feelings
Not a negative thought
A fresh start was needed
After every episode
I find it hard not to provoke
It's a sad sad situation

What do I need to start again
A new millennium
My heart it beats the same as yours

What do I need to start again
What do I need to start again
What do I need to start again
A new millennium

What do I need to start again
A new millennium
My heart it beats the same as yours
What do I need to start again
A new millennium
My heart it beats the same as yours

What do I need to start again
What do I need to start again
What do I need to start again
A new millennium
