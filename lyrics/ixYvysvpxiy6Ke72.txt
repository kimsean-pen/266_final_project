Oh, send me off to war with a gun in my hand
But I won't pull the trigger
Out destiny is here 'neath the red, white and blue
So lead me to the slaughter

Now don't be afraid, come and join the parade
For the ultimate in sacrifice
It's an old-fashioned story of hope and of glory
A ticket for taking life

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero, no

Oh, send me off to war in a far away land
I never knew existed
Subject me to the truth, to the horror and pain
Until my mind is twisted

And what if I fail, will you put me in jail
For a murder I will not commit?
'Cause you don't understand till there's blood on your hands
That it's time to forget and forgive

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero, no
No, no, no, no, oh no, oh, no, no

And those who return, come back only to learn
That they're hated by those who they love
'Cause you're not satisfied till the thousand will die
And your anger is paint for their blood

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero, oh no

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero, no, no

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
