Aunty Rita in my life
Making tracks for me to find
Wheel a running's never done
With Aunty Rita in my life

She will find a bird song
She will set my hands on fire
Hands on fire, over again
Her to me, and me to them

And the feeling stops short
I won't die
I'm a sister
I won't die

When we were driving in her car
Fence between found furniture
And clean clothes
Singing "I've Just Seen A Face" to her

I know why the space I clear
I've seen both sides, I know the drill
I hold the button

And the feeling stops short
I won't die
I'm a sister
I won't die
And the feeling stops short
I won't die
I'm a sister
I won't die
