It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"

Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iiii?)
(I don't seem obvious do I?)

The DJ never has it
J A M C, automatic
(do Iiii?)
If those were Roy's headphones
You bet he'd play "What Goes On"
(do Iiii?)

Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii do Iiii? do Iii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
Do I?

Oh, I'm here that means something doesn't it?
Ah, won't you dance with me a little bit?
Oh, you don't notice 'cause the music's too loud

It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
(do Iiii?) (do IIII)
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"
(do Iiii?)

Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
Say anything you want
Already, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
Honesty or mystery?
Want something else?
Just tell me
I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
