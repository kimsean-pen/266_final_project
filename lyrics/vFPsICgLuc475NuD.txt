He was workin' through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirstin' for knowledge and he had a car
Yaa I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child

One restless summer we found love growin' wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
Funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
I still remember when thirty was old
My biggest fear was September when he had to go

A few cards and letters and one long distance call

We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything

My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothin' time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence

I've been missin' so much yaa
Strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July Moon saw everything
My first taste of love
Oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine aah
(Strawberry wine)
