Way up high.
And you tell me, you tell me not to cry.
Did you understand I can't help it?
Did you understand I don't have a choice?

Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?

Stay.
I'm saving money.
And I know, I don't got the money.
You are no angel.

Because I can't give you what you need.
No, I can't give you what you need, all by myself.

Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?

I am yours.
I am tired.
And I, I... I don't say that you're right, no no...
I know...

Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?
