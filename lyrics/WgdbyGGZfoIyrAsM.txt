Ooh-ooh-ooh
The sky hides what I wanna see
Stars are like eyes, they're watching the dark
Passion and fear run all over me
Night is a ghost accusing my heart
This life can be such a lonely place
I hear the laughter as I fall from grace
I fall from grace
Now I am branded with original sin
World without end

(chorus)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Who's gonna fight for innocence
When we're always denying the proof?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Who's gonna fight for justice
When we wash our hands of the truth

Like to go back to a simple life
Be as a child in the Promised Land
Wish i could sleep when night comes over me
Dreaming of flowers falling out of my hands
But I'm woken by the cries of an angry crowd
Against a man whose love could save me now
Oh, save me now
I'll drink the blood from your crown of pain
And they'll call us insane

(chorus)
