When I was a boy
I learned not to cry
My daddy would scream
I learned how to rhyme
That fool cut off this ribbon of mine
Leading me back before we unwind

If you ever change your mind
If you ever change your mind

I learned how to do better each time
I buried his heart and years went on by
But what do you do when there's nothing inside?
Lost in the day covered in vines

If you ever change your mind
If you ever change your mind
Touch me and then teach me how to cry
If you ever change your mind

This bone will break along a line
Been drawn for a long time
Time

If you ever change your mind
If you ever change your mind
Touch me and then teach me how to cry
If you ever change your mind
