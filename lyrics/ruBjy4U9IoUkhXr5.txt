Broke your heart on your birthday
I would call, but I don't know what I could say
Only skin, only bone and I'm flawed
Crying in your parents' garage
So, I'll sew my eyelids shut
So I don't have to be reminded of us
'Cause everywhere that I go is a photo
Every night I'm in bed with the vertigo

It goes: da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Every night I'm going: da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da

Anxiety inside extremities
I'm losing touch, I got a tendency
To ruin all the things that I love
I could make amends, but you know I've had enough, oh man
Not right now
You would think that I would feel alive by now
Twenty something years and I'm still so down
Comtemplate on moving like my legs tied down, oh no
Tried to go inside, black on my back and the void is inside
I can see my thoughts in the ceiling every night
I can see my thoughts in the ceiling every night

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown

It goes: da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Every night I'm going: da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Da, da, da, da-da-da

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown

So, I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown
