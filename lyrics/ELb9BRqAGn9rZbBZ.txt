You'd never know there was some music playing
Until you talked your way inside the door
And then a sound like rolling thunder
Begins to push you right through the floor
And there's a great white sign with big black letters
That just about explains it all

If you don't like rock and roll
Well if you don't like rock and roll
If you don't like rock and roll
Then it's too late now
Well it's too late now

Of course there was the usual lady
She was dressed the way the stories tell
So being cool I made a move to grab her
But you could see she read the story well
And then she whipped out a card with big black letters
That just about explained it all

Well if you don't like rock and roll
If you don't like rock and roll
Well if you don't like rock and roll
Then you're too late now
Then you're too late now

Well if you don't like rock and roll
Well if you don't like rock and roll, yeah
If you don't like rock and roll
Well it's too late now
Well you're too late now

If you don't like rock and roll
If you don't like my rock and roll
Then you're too late now
Then you're too late now
Then you're too late, too late now
