Teardrop is on my pillow
As waters in my baby's bath
Teardrop is on my pillow
As waters in my baby's bath

Everything I've done for that woman
She went and left me for another man
And I wanna see my baby
Till I'd be crying on my knees
And when I see see my baby
Tell her I'd be crying down on my knees
And when I see see my baby
Tell her I'd be crying down on my knees
I've been praying to the master
Lord lord lord oh send my baby back, if you please

If I had ten million dollars
I, I would just give her every dime
If I had ten million, ten million dollars
Lord, lord I'd give her every dime, yeah
Just to hear her call my name oh
Call, call my name up one more
One more time, one more time
One more time, one more time
One more time, one more time
One more, one more, one more, one more

Mmm
Woah, yeah, alright
Mmm

If I had ten billion dollars
Man, man I would give her
E-ve-ry, every, every dime
If I had ten billion dollars man
I would give her
give her every, every, every dime
Just to hear her call my name out
Call! Call my name out!
Just. One. More. One more time
Oh one more time, one more time

Just to call my name, call my name out
Ow! Call my name out, just, one more time.
One more
One more time
