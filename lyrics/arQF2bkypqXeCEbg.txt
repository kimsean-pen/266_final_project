Fuck, I'm drunk
But I'm on my knees
The police stopped chasin'
I'm her new cool meat

She pops the trunk
And she removes me
And a machine that takes pictures of us
An' my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball

And just before I come to
Move to the back of the car
She make me touch the machine
New murderer, fuck

First untie me
Untie me for now
You said you would, right?
And you were right

Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go

Soon this will be all over
Well, I hope soon
She sang
Soon this will be all over
Well, I hope soon
So she sang

Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
So she sang
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
So she sang
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
She sang
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go
