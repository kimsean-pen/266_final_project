Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help, no one's around
Silently screaming as I bang my head against the wall
Seems like no one cares at all

Always an emotion but how could I explain?
Kinda like the scent of a rose but you can't explain
The same with my pain, caught up in emotion, goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death
Am I living or am I dead?

The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And then I think about all the times that I've had
Some were good, most were bad

I search for personality, and I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind, pain and hate is all I'd find
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony through my eyes that's all I see

If I'm gonna cry, will you wipe away my tears?
And if I'm gonna die, Lord, please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow, well, I just want to say
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?

Today, today, today when I can't even smile today
Today, today, today when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?

You think something? s funny?
Laugh at this

So when I look outside my room, I see the world but not the reason
What is done to me is not fair, you call it fate, I call it treason
But I know not what to do, gimme a sign, I'll take whatever
But if you want me, here I am, ain't gonna die forever

And I tried to hold you but you just turned away
And I tried to tell you but not a word I say
Cried out so loudly but you just covered your ears
I gave you all the signs but you ignored my tears

So if you want me, here I am, I sit here, waiting for your decision
But my body fights my mind and it is headed straight for a collision
So am I getting near or am I still looking in all the wrong places?
But the only thing that seems to change are the looks on the faces

Doesn't anyone? Seems like no one cares at all

I search for personality, I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind, pain and hate is all I'd find
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony, through my eyes that's all I see

How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?

Today, today, when I can't even smile today?
Today, today, when I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today?
