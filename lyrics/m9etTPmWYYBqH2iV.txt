Daddy doesn't think that you'll be good enough for me
Mama says be careful, 'cause he'll break your heart in three
They don't walk in my shoes
They ain't being kissed by you

My sister says she doesn't like the way you wear your hair
But I know that she's jealous, so why would I even care?
I have to lie about
How good you make me feel

So oh, oh
Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart
You won't tear my world apart
That you'll be there, when I need
'Cause I wanna tell them

They just don't know you
They just don't know you
They just don't know you
They don't know you like I do
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you, like I do

Talk is cheap and rumors spread, but they go with the wind
It's not about she said he's sick, 'cause I know where it ends
I know the real truth
And the real truth is you

It's funny, 'cause at times it feels like us against the world
They treat you like a criminal, but I'll still be your girl
I'd ride or die with you
Walk the line, if you asked me to

So oh, oh
Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart
You won't tear my world apart
That you'll be there, when I need
'Cause I wanna tell them
They just don't know you

They just don't know you
They just don't know you
They don't know you like I do
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you, like I do

L-l-l-like I do
They just don't know you

You don't know about our love
You choose what you see
'Cause if you felt the way we love
You'd just let it be
You don't know about the times
When it's just him and me (and me)
'Cause if you felt the way we love
You'd just let it be

Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart (you wouldn't break my heart)
You won't tear my world apart (you won't break my heart)
That you'll be there, when I need (when I need)
'Cause I wanna tell them

They just don't know you (they just don't know)
They just don't know you (they just don't know)
They just don't know you
(No) They don't know you like I do
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you (they don't know)
They just don't know you, like I do
