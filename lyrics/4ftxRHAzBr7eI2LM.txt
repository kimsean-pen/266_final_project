I'm sad, Sandra, cause if I die
I won't see my daughter high
When she'll come home drunk at midnight
Spewing joyfully her prime
We would stare ourselves in worry
Checking the clock twice
Then scurrying to the door
As soon as we hear a sound of keys falling to the ground I'm sad, Sandra, and I'm slowly dying
But I've decided to lie
I won't tell you how I'll miss
The scent of your hair while I kiss'em
I'll disappear as a burning leaf
With smoke and some kind of relief
But in my mind I'm still afraid
I don't wanna die now
Cause if I die, I die alone
And ascending like a drone
I'll be unnoticed in two years
My memory gone with ease, no more tears I'm sad, Sandra, now you know why
Don't worry I'm a tough guy
I no longer want to talk
here it comes the last insulin shock
This life turned out to be futile
My body feels so stupid
Don't forget as I go with the flow
I'm shooting my last free throw
Cause if I die, I die alone
And ascending like a drone
I'll be unnoticed in two years
My memory gone with ease, no more tears
