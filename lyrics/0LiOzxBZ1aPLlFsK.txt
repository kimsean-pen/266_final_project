Time drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads
We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spent the time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed
In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath

In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget
We said that we would call
but we never spoke at all

The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
for reasons that seem so small
If this is the end, let's bury the past
this might be our one last chance
Together until the last grain of sand
has dropped from the hourglass
So open your eyes
open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
If we lose the fight
if we lose the fight your sprit will live through me
It's time we make right

it's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy
All those you've loved

All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky
All those you've loved

All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky
So open your eyes

open your eyes and don't forget to breathe
If we lose the fight
if we lose the fight your sprit will live through me
It's time we make right

it's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy
In darkness we'll rest

Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget
(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(Count the days down to one last breath)
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(So forgive what you can't forget)
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky
In darkness we'll rest
