Waiting, watching
Listening to every little sign I see
You are so bright, shining above all the city lights
You know, it's right when all of the stars in the sky align
If you and I, we are together as one tonight

So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We gotta live life, give in to being
We've got a love like no one knows
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

Saved me from me, gave me everything I need
You'll be forever in my heart
So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We gotta live life, give in to being
We've got a love like no one knows
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

All is quiet at night
We say only things for us to hear

So get up, stand up
What you waiting for?
Let's go, jump in
We gotta live life, give in to being
We've got a love like no one knows

Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you
Now I'm with you

Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world

Sitting on top, sitting on top of the world
