Who put bars across your window of opportunity?
Did you see?
You called me a broken record
But I'll-But I'll never be
I am trying to be honest
If I end up sounding cold
It's the middle of the winter
And I wanted you to

Hear me out! I'm out on the street
And I'm trying to find your building, baby
Hear me out! I'll be in retreat
I been going 'round in circles, lately

I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, thought of you
I though it through and I'm calling you
I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through then I called you

You told me I'm hard to live with
But you said it out of spite
I may put you through some suffering
But I never prove you right
It's a chapter that you're stuck on
And you'd rather read alone
I'm an uninspiring ending
But the best you've ever known

I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I though it through and I'm calling you
I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through then I called you

Hear me out! I'm out on the street
And I'm trying to find your building, baby
Hear me out! I'll be your treat
I been going 'round in circles, lately

Hear me out! I'm back on the street
And I'm trying to find your building, baby
Hear me out! I'll be in retreat
I been going 'round the circles, lately

I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I though it through and I'm calling you
I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I though it through and I'm calling you
I'm not like "Can we just pretend?"
I thought of her, I thought of you
I thought it through then I called you
