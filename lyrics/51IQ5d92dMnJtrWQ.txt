May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May it take no effort in you being generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more, nothing less

May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath

May the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
Whoa-oh
May the road less paved be the road that you follow
Whoa-oh

Well, here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it

Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You don't need money, you've got free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

All (All)
I want you to have it all (Have it all)
I want you to have it (Have it all)
I want you to have it all (Have it all)

May you be as fascinating as the slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions, though immeasurable wealth

May you get a gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes, shining like diamonds
May you really own it each moment to the next

May the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
Whoa-oh
May the road less paved be the road that you follow
Whoa-oh

Well, here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it

Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You don't need money, you've got free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

All (All)
I want you to have it all (Have it all)
I want you to have it (Have it all)
I want you to have it all (Have it all)

Oh-oh, I want you to have it a-all
All you can imagine, oh-oh
No matter what your path is
If you believe it, then anything can happen

Go, go, go
Raise your glasses
Go, go, go
You can have it all

I toast you; here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
