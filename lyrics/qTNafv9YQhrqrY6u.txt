Just when I thought
I had handled solace
I could soften my guard
Behind false confidence
Just when I found
Humble pie insipid
Exempt from this blind-side
And firmly in its grip

'Cause I am seduced by reaction and under the influence

I'm slipping again
I'm up to old tricks, off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence

I get reduced by my own willfulness
As I reach for my usual God replacements
'Cause I am rich with sanction
And lax in my steps

I'm slipping again
I'm up to old tricks
Off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence

If forgiveness is understanding then I
Affirm mea culpa for the millionth time
On this tumbling house of cards of mine

I am beaten by my impulsiveness
By this uncanny foreshadowing of regret
'Cause I'm repulsed by restriction at least that's my excuse

I'm slipping again
I'm up to old tricks
Off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence

I'm slipping again
I'm up to old tricks
Off my wagon
I have no defense I'm
Wreaking havoc
Wreaking havoc and consequence
