Life is an illusion
Time a mere delusion
A cage is a creation
Of someone's imagination

If life makes you glow
Then glow like a star
You're the night,
You're the day

Own the sky,
Live in the clouds,
Defy gravity

A sign, an aberration,
Your road down to damnation
When a restroom illustration
Predicts the tribulation

Let the dreams give you hope
Live in a dream
Let the music flow
With your eyes closed from the vast garden of stars

Sing one rhyme
Wait for the punch line
Notes are blind
But they know when you sing and smile

Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say
But the fact won't wane away
Sing with someone today
When your team makes a game winning goal
Get ready to sing
With a friend who is right beside you
With the friends beside you

Time
Every light on the blue sky
The night will beautify
Time
Cast coins in a waterfall
Two coins, one for each eye

Time
The icy tingle of empty vapor on your hand
Time
A tiny crack's a grand canyon in its command

Just one life
Sing with a feeling
Turn back time
Make all your stars align

The only thing you need
The vanity of happiness
When friends align
They sing in the key of
Life

Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say
But the fact won't wane away
Smile at someone today
If the wall smiles back
You're alive and ready to sing

Life is better alive
It is a dumb thing to say
But the fact won't wane away
Sing with someone today
When your team makes a game winning goal
Get ready to sing
With a friend who is right beside you
With the friend beside you

Life is better alive
It's a dumb thing to say
But the fact won't wane away
Life is better alive
When your team makes a game winning goal
Get ready to sing

It is a dumb thing to say
But your life is better alive
Life is better alive
Life is better alive
