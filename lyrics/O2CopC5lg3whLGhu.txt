I don't know about the legend
My God how we all rambled on
And now Her Royal Empress spreads her arms out
Arresting miserly the sun
And we all thought everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
And we all thought everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
So we all walked around in the yard
We all walked around in the yard
And everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
I don't know about our edges
My God how we all talk them down
[?] spread our arms out
Arresting miserly the sun
And we all thought everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
And we all thought everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
So we all walked around in the yard
We all walked around in the yard
And everyone was gonna make it out
(Alive alive, alive alive)
[?] way too fast
And it's hard getting out just like that
And the other one, he never had a chance
I thought everyone was gonna make it out alive
And everyone was gonna make it out alive
So we all walked around in the yard
And we all walked around in the yard
And everyone was gonna make it out alive
And everyone was gonna make it out
And everyone was gonna make it out
And so we all walked around in the yard
And we all walked around in the yard
And everyone was gonna make it out
[?] way too fast
And it's hard getting out just like that
And the other one, he never had a chance
And we all walked around in the yard
And we all walked around in the yard
And everyone was gonna make it out
