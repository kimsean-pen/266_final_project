I might be be young, or so I'm told
So why do I feel 85?
I should get up, I should get down
I should go out an make all my freinds so proud
But the closer I am to midnight
The further I get from this nocturnal life

I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight

And as a sailor needs the sea
That is how my bed will crave for me
I will go down with the sun
And that is when the owls and bats have just begun
Can't feel the room it's getting loud
And that is when the music's turning up
A million dancing endorphins
While I am only running to catch a dream
But the closer I am to midnight
The further I get from this nocturnal life

I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight
I am sleeping, hybernating
Seperating me from this nocturnal life

I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight
I will get never get older than I am on the inside
When the party gets going wild
I am the first to say goodnight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Drift into my secret life
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hush my baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Drift into my secret life
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hush my baby
