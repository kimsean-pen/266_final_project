What do you want from me?
Just let me breathe a little
What do you want to see?
Me ni mieru mono?

What do you want to believe?
Still nothing can settled
Hold on your words you say
It's no good

Nani wo motome
Soshite nani wo ukeireu?
Futatsu ni hitotsu!
Boku ni wa mada sore ga I don't know
Tonari de warau kimi wa

Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Hey liar, hey liar
Nani ga uso de dore ga shinjitsu?

Must be a dream I see
Marude déjà-vu no you
Trying so hard to know inside of you
Satring your eyes to feel kono omoi ga
Todoku youni to
Negau kedo risou to wa uraha so cold
Tonari de hohoemu kimi

Hey liar, hey liar
Are mo kore mo uso jya mou
I'm tired, so tired
What do you think of living without me?

There is nothing left to bleed
My heart can't take this anymore
There is nothing left to bleed
Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Nee liar, oh yeah liar
Todomaru koto wa muimi
