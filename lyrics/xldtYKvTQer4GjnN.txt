Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field

And mothers hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed, just trying to keep
Clothing on our backs
And all I hear about is
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, stupid

Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that
We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

(Let's talk)
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call her house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there

Right when I'm needing you the most
And now I dream about it

How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that

We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's too bad, stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long

It's too bad that

We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
(Let's talk)
For all those hands are lined with guilt

For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that
We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's so bad, it's too bad, it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that
We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
No time
Last one
Let's go
