With December comes the glimmer on her face
And I get a bit nervous
I get a bit nervous now
In the twelve months on
I won't make friends with change
When everyone's perfect can we start over again?

The playgrounds they get rusty and your
Heart beats another ten thousand times before
I got the chance to say
I miss you

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now
I get a little braver now
And when it gets dark
I get a little brighter now
I get a little wiser now
Before I give my heart away

Well we met each other at the house of runaways
I remember it perfectly
We were running on honesty
We moved together like a silver lock and key
But now that your lock has changed
I know I can't fit that way

The playgrounds they get rusty and your
Heart beats another ten thousand times before
I got the chance to say
I want you

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now
I get a little braver now
And when it gets dark
I get a little brighter now
I get a little wiser now
Before I give my heart away

When it gets hard
I get a little stronger now
I get a little braver now
And when it gets dark
I get a little brighter now
I get a little wiser now
Before I give my heart away
