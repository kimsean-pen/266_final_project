Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling, back to back, I keep on smoking
Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused
I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweating but I'm cold, mouth all dry but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle
Chug that down but I think I need me some more
And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint, but fuck that nigga, pass me that drank
I done drunk too much, I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch, I'm wilding, I'm zooted, can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party, and I don't know what I'm doing

Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly
Bet a million dollars these niggas ain't dipping
Pure MDMA, put it in a shot we talking 'bout crystals
Been dancing hard up all day, rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T, scratch on my face, do the Thizzle dance up in the place
I'm grinding on your bitch while I'm grinding on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck, so right now you don't want beef
I'm blown, I'm zooted, can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party, and I don't know what I'm doing

Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

She licked it off my index, before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend while they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch we ain't done yet, lifting up her sundress
It kicked in she licking, before I blink she undressed
Molly making her feel good, it's a feeling she can't explain
But obvious we got some problems, so bitch, let's kill that pain
I'm blown, I'm zooted, can't believe I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party, and I don't know what I'm doing

Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
