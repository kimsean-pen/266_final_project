Here's another song for the radio

Life isn't fair
For the people who care
Stick your nose in the air
And that's how you'll go far

So go tell your lovers
Your fathers and brothers
Your sisters and mothers
How lucky they are

Light speed, out of my mind
I'm hurt, but I'll be fine
Put your fist in the air
Raise your voice and declare
Singing
We don't care (We don't care)
We don't care (We don't care)

So here's another song for the radio
And here's another line from the heart
Don't pretend you hate us then you sing along
Coz we all look the same in the dark

L.A. temptations
Or music sensations
There's great expectations
That weigh on our heads

So here's to the liars
Who dream and conspire
Against the admired
We hope you drop dead

Light speed, out of my mind
I'm hurt, but I'll be fine
Put your fist on your chest
Raise your voice in protest
Singing
We don't care (We don't care)
We don't care (We don't care)

So here's another song for the radio
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us and you sing our songs
Coz we all look the same in the dark

We don't, we don't care
We don't, we don't care
We don't, we don't care
We don't, we don't care

Here's one for the Radio
Here's one for the radio
Here's one for the radio
(one for radio)
Heres one for the Radio

So here's another song for the radio
And here's another line from the heart
So don't pretend you hate us and you sing our songs
'Coz we all look the same in the dark

So here's another song for the radio (song for the radio)
And here's another line from the heart (wooaaaaaoooo)
So don't pretend you hate us when you sing along
'Coz we all look the same in the dark
(for the radio)
Coz we all look the same
We all look the same in the dark
(for the radio)
'Coz we all look the same
We all look the same in the dark
