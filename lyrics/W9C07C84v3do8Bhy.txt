Walks in the place, hands on her waist
Gun on her thigh, big shooter game
She did this before, murdered to gain
Promised her ma she won't kill again

She got it and she knows she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Spaceship, so high I can't stop it

Like sour diesel
I can't stop the feelin'
Can't stop your feet, no
Feels like I dream her
Didn't feel it seep in
She burn, she burn, she burn

Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like a sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Yeah, she burn, she burn
Like sour diesel

The look's on her face, back in my place
Legs in the air, all dirty again
Smokin' some more, I'm in her space
She touches me there, then I do it again

She got it and she knows she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Spaceship, so high I can't stop it

Like a sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin', no (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like a sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Yeah, she burn, she burn
Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Feels like the heat, yeah
When the flame is here (she burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the heat, yeah
Can't stop the feet
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a sour diesel
Can't stop the feelin', oh (she burn, she burn, she burn)
No I can't stop

'Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you
'Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you

Woo, yeah, yeah

Yeah! Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel
(She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a sour diesel, like a sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Ooh, yeah (she burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Yeah, sour diesel, wow (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn
