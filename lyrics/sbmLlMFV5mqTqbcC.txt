I don't want to power down, but what else can I do?
When life breaks my heart, I pray to God that I fall in love with you

In my favorite dreams, I feel your heat
Though I'm farthest from the sun
But your glowing eyes are cold as ice
You are my Aphelion

And all that time, I thought I walked these empty streets alone
I never thought I'd be with you, heading into the unknown

So far away again, my winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion

I don't want to go offline, but what else should I do?
With a broken heart, I pray to God I can orbit close to you

In my favorite dreams, you feel so real
Like a fire from the sun
But your fallen eyes are cold as ice
You are my Aphelion

And all that time, I thought I walked these empty streets alone
I never thought I'd be with you, heading into the unknown

So far away again, my winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion /x2

In my favorite dreams, you feel so real
Like a fire from the sun
But your fallen eyes are cold as ice
You are my Aphelion

So far away again, my winter has begun
And I can't see when you're next to me
You are my Aphelion /x3

Aphelion, Aphelion, Aphelion
Aphelion, Aphelion, Aphelion
Aphelion, Aphelion, Aphelion
