Just like a match to gasoline
She set the world on fire like I ain't never seen
She got the legs, knows what she's doin'
You know she'll steal the show, when she starts movin'

You got me burnin', hurtin' baby just for you
You got me runnin', runnin' through the fire for you, yeah

That's right, yeah

She got my mind under arrest
Knowing I can't think about not no one else
I'm on my knees
Oh baby, please
Everything you got is everything I need

You got me burnin', hurtin' baby just for you
You got me runnin', runnin' through the fire for you, yeah

My se√±orita, I know how to treat her
Saboreando sus labios

I'm on my knees
I, I'm begging please
Everything you got is everything I need
You got me burnin', hurtin' baby just for you

You got me burnin', hurtin' baby just for you
You got me runnin', runnin' through the fire for you
I keep on burnin', hurtin' baby just for you
Yes I do
