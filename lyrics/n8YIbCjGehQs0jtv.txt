I drive all alone at night
I drive all alone
Don't know what I'm headed for

I follow the road blind
Until the road is dead end
Night's in my veins, it's calling me
Racing along these arteries

And law is just a myth
To herd us over the cliff

I follow the road at night
Just hoping to find
Which puzzle piece fell out of me

I know who you are and I
Open the door and climb in
Hold me real close and do it again
I ache for the touch of my dead end friend

And oh, I gotta know
Is it dead at the end of the road?
I can tell by that look in your eyes
We're the same, my dead end friends and I

Doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo

We drive all alone at night
A never ending begin
Sweet as a curse just out of reach
Awakens the dead end part of me

And oh, no more wandering
Just me and my dead end friends again, yeah

Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
