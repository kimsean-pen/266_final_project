Call me a Spartan
Come from Harlem
Baby said I'm flying like Jordan
Fuck then, shit then
Jakes on us, we got things on us so we parking
KuKu mad run from who
Spartan Ku, jump out the 4 door Ku
Shoot shoot shoot man down see the Spartans loose

Telling me more, cop your skengs
300, now 294 for the 6 that's locked in pen
Jason Bourne, can't cut thru need ID if your not from ends
Bae love cussing me b, treat me or leave get out of my bed
South East step South West
Shinobi men, we drenched dem
Spartan'd off we just hench men
Where's you goons that's a question
4 door truck, they hear engines
Repercussion and vengeance
Sam's are rammed like kitchens
But inch your blade like your section

Feds wanna know, cus the roads be killing it
Scoreboards looking ridiculous
See me on the loose like Phineas
In his back, chest, neck that's brilliant
Shakes from the speare like William
Tryna cat stack to a million
Grub for the cats still dishing it
Cats, cats, cats still dishing it
Catch me in the trap still billing it
That's Ls to the dome still winning shit
Back shook, back bone she feeling it
22 rooms and we digging in
Something like the movie thriller shit
Claim that a opp got got
Civilian, Civilian, CivilianMash house with Miz, misch mash
Pengting brown like sauce she covered in Mac
10 toes with Blancs 2 shanks like I ain't tryna lack
Peng one man rent for the winner, I ain't tryna bash
Opps on the block, Spartans rise
Man bring corn and swords
Bop with me, KuKu killers with me
Harlem Spartans with me
And Moscow too
Phone up my donny OT
Big man got me once
A meter away he got done
Man been riding nuff
Them man running off
All of them chat like man
Feel bad for the man that chat like man
She thought we would've been gone
I had Julz Splash ting come long
JoJo had 2 2, so them running up with nothing long
Look, knock knocking on your door no trick or treat
It's a trick my g

Who, who, step, step and then get them yutes
Narcos, narcos man do Pablo
Whip up the work in two
Feds tryna move like zoos
Tryna throw a bird on my crew
SA got 2, you can't choose
Back out both and do you
Whip, whip in the trap do up kitchen that's food
Cooking up grub fuck these niggas cooking up soup
Slang the crack or the black put the light and dark on the move
Gold and brown and cute
Gyal love me and I love them too
Opps on me and they lost it too
I'm fucking Ku, Spartan'd off and we violent yutes
I love Witney Witney and Bobby
Cats ring ring and they love that too
And I'll bruck back the shotty shotty
The .45 or the 2sWelcome to Kennington
HS, BP Respect
Harlem Spartans we vexed
Sparta riding round with no meds
Brown and leng still giving out neck
Potential bae, throwing up K
I think I'm in love with the way they rep
Bastards wearing them vests
Spartans we be aiming them necks
Don't forget where you rep
Now, Spartans out for your head
Wet, Wet, Wet
Do that beckham ting till it bends
G, G Smarko no meds
Shoot shoot till there's no more left
Jump out gang, jump out gang
Like TSG ran on the ends
Harlem yes, Spartans, Kennington bop on deck
Skid skr to the left run out kick out your back and neck
Tek this pebs
Spartans bust the shots and get bread
Bust the shots and get bread

Call me a Spartan
Come from Harlem
Baby said I'm flying like Jordan
Fuck then, shit then
Jakes on us, we got things on us so we parking
KuKu mad run from who
Spartan Ku, jump out the 4 door Ku
Shoot shoot man down see the Spartans loose
