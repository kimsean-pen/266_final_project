I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage
I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage

And we could do more outdoor things
If we weren't so busy getting busy
So doing laundry finally
The first sign of first light
And still there's nothing to wear between us

And I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage
I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage

And I am so filled with just one girl
My eyes barely open
I can barely read
So this is the end of the past
The first sign of first light
Yeah, now, it's alright between us

I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage

I got my body and my mind on the same page
And honey, now, happiness is all the rage
It's all the rage

And still there's nothing to wear between us

And happiness is all the rage
Happiness is all the rage
Happiness is all the rage
Happiness is all the rage
