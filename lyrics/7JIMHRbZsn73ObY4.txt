He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks what's she running from

Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is played with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies

So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her, it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies
