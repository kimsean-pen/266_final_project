So happy I was invited
Give me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' or dyin' in New York it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins and colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me
I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
Losin' my breath
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party
I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Losin' my breath
