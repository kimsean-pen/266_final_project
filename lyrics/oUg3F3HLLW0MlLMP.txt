What Have We Started?

My eyes don't lie
They show the truth
I've fallen for you
To fight it's no use
I promised myself
I'd never give in
But your love won me around
My feet left the ground
And so here I go again
[Chorus:]
What have we started?
Don't break this heart of mine
Have I been fool enough
To let you walk away with all of me?
What have we started?
I'm so far in this time
That if you hurt me now
I may never love again
Look at me now
I'm under your spell
Where does our story end?
It's for you to tell
See I'm old enough now
To understand love

What it's capable of
And the pain it can cause
Oh but here I go again
[Chorus]
I don't want to waste this chance
You could be well worth the danger
Better to have loved and lost
But it's so hard to say now I've given my heart away
[Chorus]
