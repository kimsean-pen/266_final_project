Watching you watching me
I was hoping you'd be here tonight
Watching him watching you
He'd better watch out too keeps getting in my light

I think he's going overload
Don't know what you're running for
He thinks he's got you where he wants you, babe
But he don't understand
The power of the claw

The claw, the claw, the claw

You know me, I know you
We both know what we came here for
And he thinks he knows you
He thinks he's got you too, gonna make him cry for sure

He's gonna have to make his own way home
I don't know what's he's smiling for
He thinks you're gonna keep your promise, babe
But he don't understand
The power of the claw

The claw, the claw, the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw, the claw

Me walking up to you
And whisper in your eager ear
You whisper back to me
And he begins to see, he feels the claw is near

And so the ballet starts again
Exit stage left through the door
And we begin the horizontal dance
And he begins to know
Just what the claw is for

The claw, the claw, the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw, the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw
The claw, the claw, the claw

You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for

I know what my claw is for
