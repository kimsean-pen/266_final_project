Lying on the sandi let my spirit disappear
From this world
Fly away from you

Forgotten
Vanishing
I wished my mind
Could wander without pain

To the gleaming shelters
Hidden somewhere in the sun
Far away from this world
Far away from you

Lying on the sand I hear
The distant singing sea
And stare at lonely clouds
Fading above me
I wished my mind could join them
I wished my mind could wander free

To the gleaming shelters
Hidden somewhere in the sun
Far away from this world
Far away from you

So far away
