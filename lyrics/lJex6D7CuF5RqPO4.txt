This is everything I ever wanted though
Dreamin' of a candy store
Brother couldn't tell me no, no
So I need moments where I could be left alone
Yeah, she let me ride along
To a place where I belong, woah, no
If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?
Would you still be lying to yo mom and them
Don't you know I do this for your family?
Cause mine ain't believe in me
Left my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, wash sheets, repeat
Watch teachers teach
High and on the damn sidelines where the bleachers be
Always feel like city streets, wish I was back in my sheets, shit
Most days I don't wanna be me, shit
Don't watch this, teens watch TV, shit
My own family look like some OG shit
Shout-out my hood, they racist as hell, shit
I'm 'bout my papers like some damn immigrants, bitch
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas still fed up
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up
I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back
I been dripping candy paint
Grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone
You see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
Shout out to my cousin Mo
He got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary
He ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either
So send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers
Man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood
Besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab
Tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup
I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me
I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster
There's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga
With the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry
Why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million
And one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
Oh, ay, oh, ay
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
Oh, ay, oh, ay
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
Oh, ay, oh, ay
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
Oh, ay, oh, ay
I'm waiting on
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
