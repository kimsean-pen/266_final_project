You've got your eyes closed, such a temper
Been so long that you can't remember
How it started, how they took you down
You got your wings up, now they're laughing
You're the food at the feast that that they are having
And you know running away doesn't prove them wrong

Well have you tried apologising?
Do you know the mess you've made?
You believe you hold the answers
But your feathers are all frayed

Oh well, Icarus, Icarus
Why you so serious, serious?
You know you've gotta let it go
Cause you're flying too close

There in your ego lies your weakness
Wrap it tightly and keep it at your chest
You are only the front that you harness

Cause silence is so underrated
Their voices are a loaded gun
You'll be swallowed up by the sun
Cause you're trying to be someone

Oh well, Icarus, Icarus
Why you so serious, serious?
You know you've gotta let it go
Cause you're flying too close
Oh well, Icarus, Icarus
You're being so dangerous, dangerous
You know the higher you fly
The less you can hide

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Cause they're all waiting in the ocean
With open arms to drag you down
So have you tried apologising
Before you start to drown?

Oh well, Icarus, Icarus
Why you so serious, serious?
You know you've gotta let it go
Cause you're flying too close
Oh well, Icarus, Icarus
You're being so dangerous, dangerous
You know the higher you fly
The less you can hide
