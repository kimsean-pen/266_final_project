Lirik Lagu SONAMOO â€“ CLOSER
I want you
baby I need you to cry
Give me give me
give me a standing ovation
Listen

eodil bwado mallijin mot haji
There ain't no other man
without you

My player get 'em higher

Come and get me closer
You could be my player
Baby rock my body
Shake your body goin' crazy
How to make me better's U
Come and get me closer
You could be my player
How to make me better's U
Baby rock my body
You could be my hero
How to make me better's U
