Help me call you back
'Cause I'm afraid of the ringing
I know I'm fucked, but I'm still steadily fixing
The gears in my guts, 'cause they're all twisted up
I feel tight in my chest through the smoke in my lungs
But hold your tongue 'til you see what I'm making
How everything else ended simple and lonely
But this isn't me, it's my final critique
Of my bones, of my skin, of the hate killing me
I'm cold on skin contact, blue as a newborn's lips
'Cause on the day I was born I was horrified to take a breath
And I miss the water
'Cause it meant nothing without anyone else around
But I thought that it's all that I wanted
I've grown to fear the isolation I chose to take a part of
Now I get how cliches came to be
Though I spent so much time thinking they were below me
Simple, the truth that my father had told
There is nothing to do if you're constantly alone
I'd lose everything
To make up for the person I've been
I'd lose everything
To make up for the person I've been
I'd lose everything
I'd lose everything
