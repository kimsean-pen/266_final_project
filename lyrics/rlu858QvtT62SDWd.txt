We cannot be free until wee see
All that we are
Cosmic math
Don't fear death
Since we can't die

Make use of a computation
Tap into the digits to write
A set of rules to form the universe

Find me the reason
Why are we here
Find the answers in these digitalized times
How do we reason?
In data we trust
Let us focus on the biggest sums of life

It's now a matter of life and math

Find the true reason
What do we fear?
Find the answer why we're deaf while we can hear
How do we reason?
What do we miss?
Find the reason why we're blind while we can see

We're cosmic math
Make use of a computation
Tap into the digits to write
A set of rules to form the universe

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up our quest
Our quest for life

Ask yourself
Why are we here?
Find new answers in the quantum gravity
Unravel the meaning
For in math we trust
Let us dream of how to crack the cosmic code

We're cosmic math
Make use of a computation
Tap into the digits to write
A set of rules to form the universe

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up our quest
Our quest for life

We don't fear death
Since we can't die

Arouse our curiosity
Deep down the rabbit hole

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up our quest

Follow our instinct
Or we'll become extinct
Everything seems logical
Our only salvation
Lies within computation
Don't give up our quest
Our quest for life
