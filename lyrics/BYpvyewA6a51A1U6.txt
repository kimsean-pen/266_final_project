Your eyes don't lie
A pair of daggers cutting through my mind
Your stare it rips a hole into my life
Am I supposed to leave this all behind?
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
It's there with every single breath I take
If this is it then don't resuscitate

I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself
When I know that the fault is not mine
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
(For the very last time)

Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I guarantee I won't be losing sleep
'Cause you're the one that made this end complete

I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself
When I know that the fault is not mine
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
(For the very last time)

Breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing

I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself
When I know that the fault is not mine
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time

I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
