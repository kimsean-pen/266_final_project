Dream on little dreamer,
this is how it all begins,
move your feet,
feel how sweet it is.

Dream on little dreamer,
follow all of your signs,
you gotta gather up what you need,
you gotta chose a direction,
and when the moment is right for you, you got to go.
You gotta keep your ideals high,
you gotta know that the sky belongs to no-one, you got to go.

Keep on little dreamer,
keep hold of all that you are,
move your feet,
feel how sweet it is.
