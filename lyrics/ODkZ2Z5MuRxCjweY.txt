As I am a vessel
Travelling at the speed of light
As I've known deception
Friendship gets me through the night

Every time we move past each other
Causes a massive explosion to occur
Close your eyes
Count to ten
But never open them up again
'Till I say when

Now ashes are falling
From afar it looks like snow
I don't have the answers
Who can tell how far we'll go?

Every time we move past each other
Causes a massive explosion to occur
Close your eyes
Count to ten
But never open them up again
'Till I say when

Tonight we pay our respects to you
Be sure we won't forget you ever, no

Every time we move past each other
Causes a massive explosion to occur
Close your eyes
Count to ten
But never open them up again
'Till I say when
