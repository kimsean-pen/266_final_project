I'm the result of an ageless redemption
A body with a heartless convention
A face with a smile that's been shut down for years
Facing the facts of my generation...
Cause I'm a sinner, a winner
My blood is getting thinner
I might as well get another life cause I've been there
I know what's been said
And I know what's been done
Don't you tell me I'm the only one, cause I.
I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing
Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something

Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
Now put your trust in a solid machine
Filled with words that have never been seen
A plague to insatiable souls left to die
Charged with mankind's raw energy
I rumble, I stumble

My memory starts to crumble

I can't refuse what's haunting my dreams
Have I stumbled?
On my way to a created perfection
I penetrate the gates of rejection
I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing
Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something
Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
There's no determination

Echoes of a failed gallery
There's yet extermination

Inside us all, screaming
-Solo-
I will be there looking for something
I really am waiting for nothing
Coming straight out of something

Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing
Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
