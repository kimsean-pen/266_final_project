See
When you're holding on to all that
You can't be
Know that all there is to gain lies
Within arm's reach
For the flaw lies in your head not in your heart
See
How the darkest night will soon
Bring light again

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again?
Now it's a long way down
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again?
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down

See
When you're holding on to all but
You can't breathe
Know the dawn lies in your hands
Just let your heart speak
And the darkest light will soon
Burn bright again

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again?
Now it's a long way down
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again?
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down

We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it? why end it?
We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it? why end it?

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again?
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down

We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it? why end it?
We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it? why end it?
