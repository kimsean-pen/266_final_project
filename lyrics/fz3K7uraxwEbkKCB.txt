I'm waiting for you to drown in my love
So open your arms
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in my love
I'm waiting for you to drown in this love
So open your arms

Open your arms and let me show you what love can be like
It's all tears and it will be 'til the end of your time
Come closer, my love
Will you let me tear your hearth apart?
Now all holp is gone, so drown in my love

I'm waiting for you to drown in my love
So open your heart
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in my love
I'm waiting for you to drown in this love
And open your arms
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in this love

So, my love, your laughter is finally turning into tears
And you're begging for more, though the end is getting near
Come closer, my love
I'll violate you in the most sensual way
Until you drown in this love

I'm waiting for you to drown in my love
So open your arms
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in this love
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in this love

I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you

I'm waiting for you to drown in my love
So open your arms
I'm waiting for you to open your arms
And drown in my love
I'm waiting for you to drown in this love
So open your arms

I'm waiting for you to drown in this love
You'll drown in this love
Ooohooh
You'll drown, my love
And you'll drown in my love
So open your arms
