Unheavenly skies
Burneth thy souls
Divine suffering eternal
Reborn in profanity

Bleed with me into the abyss
Masters of the pure hellish retaliation

I drain my soul of my holy purity
To endure my true self in blasphemy, in blasphemy!

United in repungence

Deliverance into temptation
As you enter upon a kingdom of darkness

Where lust is fulfilled
Where our body is cleansed of all purity...
Our souls sealed in blasphemy

United in repungence

Unheavenly skies
Burneth thy souls
Divine suffering eternal
Reborn in profanity
