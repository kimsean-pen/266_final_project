Make it up

How you gonna love me if you're never here, never around
Said I need someone
How you gonna love me if you don't even know that I could be
The only one
Leave whenever I want I get to know you better
You sit down
You don't look up
You only ever love me when I don't talk back
Talkin' now
So don't talk back
I know I maybe tried to hold you here too long
Don't worry now
Cos I'll never do that
You never really loved me cos I held you back
I let you go
I put you down
I wanna hear you say that you let me down
I'll make it up
I'll make it up to you
I wanna hear you say you let me down
I'll make it up
I'll make it up to you
Make it up to you

How you gonna love me if you hear you don't listen to me
Talkin' quietly
How am I gonna let you get away from the house
But I can see
You are fooling me
Leavin' whenever I want I'll make you love me better
You walk away
You carry on
You only ever love me when you wanted some fun
I'm laughing now
What d'you think of that
I know I maybe try to call you frequently
But don't worry now
Cos you're boring me
Can never really love me cos I can't stay back
I'll let you go
I'm thinkin' that
I wanna hear you say that you let me down
I'll make it up
I'll make it up to you
I wanna hear you say you let me down
I'll make it up
I'll make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up
I'll make it up
Make it up
I'll make it up
Make it up
I'll make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up
I'll make it up to you
Make it up to you
No love for you
