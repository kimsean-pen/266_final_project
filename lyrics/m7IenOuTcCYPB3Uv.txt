all or nothing
when i sit on the laundry room floor
i bought clothes
and i threw them away
i might die in a day
i might change my name
i wish i could know
trophy case gold

i don't expect much at all
i got things i did wrong
i'm a saint when i want
i'm a saint when i want

i get bad
i get bad
please get back

i don't want you to hate me
