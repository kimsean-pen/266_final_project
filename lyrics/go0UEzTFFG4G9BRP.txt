A hundred dreary nights
Turning, warping in sleep
When the target is sundered
He felt that the prey mured
Rise now

Marching them through the pillars
Where the blinded age
Wandered up to their death
Leading with hearts of horror
Take the body

I!

I am weeping
Life-vengeant stare
For refuge in arms
The blind man felt his way
Cry peace in us

Let no one fear
For thy bless
There's no one left
Don't be afraid to the end
It doesn't taste

This is the valley of death
This is the valley of death
And I am their king

My wrath!
