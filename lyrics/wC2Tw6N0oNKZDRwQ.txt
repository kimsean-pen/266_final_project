Leo woke up in his bed again
Startled by all his familiar friends
Burnt out stubs confectionery wrappers
Bottles spent and empty
Leo felt a terror in the world

He sighs it's not so bad
And goes about his day
As if nothings changed

He finds it so hard to explain
The way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say
Why it's so hard to relate to anyone

Leo quickened his step toward his car
He broke into a sprint at twenty yards
As he guessed the dogs had come
Ripping into his arm for fun
Leo got away in his blue car

He sighs it's not so bad
And goes about his day
As if nothing changed

He finds it so hard to explain
The way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say
Why it's so hard to relate to you or anyone

He finds it so hard to explain
The way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say
Why it's so hard to relate

He finds it so hard to explain
The way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say
Why it's so hard to relate
