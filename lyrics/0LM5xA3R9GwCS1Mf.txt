You're not twenty and detached now
Way too easy to push your chest out
Well, I've been watching you
From way across the room
I like the way your body moves
They're pushing like a riot
Acting like you like it
I would leave if I were you

But I won't let you down
I said that I won't let you down

I wear glasses so that I can see you better
I put shoes on so that we can walk together
Late at night when all I see are spinning faces
I wear glasses so that I can see you better

Wait, don't just sit down
Here's your drink, come and dance now
Well, I've been watching you
From way across the room
I like the way your body moves
You don't need anyone
To tell you that you're done
You know just what you wanna do

And I won't let you down
You know that I won't let you down

I wear glasses so that I can see you better
I put shoes on so that we can walk together
Late at night when all I see are spinning faces
I wear glasses so that I can see you better
I wear glasses so that I can see you better
I put shoes on so that we can walk together
Late at night when all I see are spinning faces
I wear glasses so that I can see you better

I wear glasses so that I can see you better
I wear glasses so that I can see you better
