Sometimes we get confused
We never know quite what we want until the day we do
'Cause we don't get to choose
You can't just run away from love
When love keeps chasing you
They say don't fall too hard
Or you'll just lose it all
They made these rules
They break them too
The same as us
So we don't need permission for nothing
Touch like you wanna be touched, yeah
Kiss like you wanna be kissed, yeah
Oh, we don't need permission for nothing
Drink like you wanna be drunk, yeah
Feel like you wanna feel something
Oh, so we don't need permission

Oh, we don't need permission
To love, to love
To love, to love, to love, to love
To love, to love, to love, to love
We can stay up all night, if we want to
Dance in the dark if we want to
Take off our clothes if we want to
We don't need no-no
We can lose our minds if we want to
Turn up the noise if we want to
Wake-up the neighbors, drive them crazy
So we don't need permission for nothing
Touch like you wanna be touched, yeah
Kiss like you wanna be kissed, yeah
Oh, we don't need permission for nothing
Drink like you wanna be drunk, yeah
Feel like you wanna feel something
Oh, we don't need permission (To love)
For nothing
Touch like you wanna be touched, yeah (to love)
Kiss like you wanna be kissed, yeah
(To love, to love, to love, to love)
Oh, we don't need permission for nothing (To love)
Drink like you wanna be drunk, yeah (To love)
Feel like you wanna feel something
(To love, to love, to love, to love)
Oh (to love, to love, to love, to love)
To love, to love, to love
We don't need permission to love
