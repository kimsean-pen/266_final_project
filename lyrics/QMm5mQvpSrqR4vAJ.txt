Strawberry lip gloss
Sunglasses from oakley
High like Fuji
I wonder if you're lonely
I wish you would touch me
Touching on my touchscreen
Carbonate my water
Put it in the engine
You go to sleep now
Time to make my tea now
Play with my sword, but my axe is with me now
An exlixar, looks like a lighter
Five thousand points do I look like a liar
Energy field
The Blue steel
I'm Unreal, i'm Unreal, i'm Unreal
Blue steel
Got some red monkeys to go with my bapes
My eyes heavy i'm smoking grapes
Swag overlord Bladee came up
What I'm smoking on fuck your brain up
Im on killer mode you are hopeless
Float on top of life like a lotus
My gear is glowing i thing she notice
I'm in the club and i'm gone but i'm focused
I'm unreal

Whatever
