Feeling you with hate
No I ain't your bait
This ain't your lake
I ain't no saint
Will never fuck with it
Feeling you with hate

This ain't your lake
I ain't no saint
May all the pain in them fade away
Oh lord I'm praying
I got more to think
May all the pain in them fade away
Oh lord I'm praying yeah
And you're about to know why
Feeling you with hate
No I ain't your bait
This ain't your lake

Will never fuck with it
Feeling you with hate
No I ain't your bait
This ain't your lake
I ain't no saint
And you're about to know why
Dreams are way too shy
