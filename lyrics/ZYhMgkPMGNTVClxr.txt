Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
Shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark

Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now
Can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night, it's just the same
You leave me lonely, now

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way

You watch them as the fall
Oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night-
Every night, it's just the same

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All my dreams just fall like rain
All upon a downtown train

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night-
Every night, it's just the same

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All my dreams just fall like rain
All upon a downtown train

All upon a downtown train
All upon a downtown train
All upon a downtown train
Downtown train
