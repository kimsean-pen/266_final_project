Would you fly away
On I bleed my home
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'
Can you see under my thumb
There you are
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'
