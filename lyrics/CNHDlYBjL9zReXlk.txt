A thick fog lies ahead
The ocean's deadly calm
Their ship glides on the silent waves
Into the unknown
He cannot turn around
For him it's much too late
He puts his back into the oar
And rows towards his fate

This ship cuts through the milk white mist
Through the blind they clearly hear
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet
Battle's drawing near
His heart pounds loud and wild
He's waited for this day
Then suddenly a dragon's head appears out of the haze

Back on northern shores (northern shores)
Just as he once swore (he once swore)
He vowed to return (to return)
And to make them burn (make them burn)

Then a northern wind picks up
It sweeps the mist away
A mighty viking fleet appears, patiently they wait
"Death or victory!"
Words by which they stand
No turning back! In for the kill!
Led by thy command
"All men grab your swords and shields, the enemy's lay ahead
We'll make this bay our battlefield and fill the waves with dead!"
Darkness then descends
Day turns into night
A massive cloud of thousand arrows fills the misty sky

With violent force the two fleets crash
And battle now begins
Cries of war as weapons clash, uncertain who will win
Thunder rolls 'cross the waves
Lightning cracks the sky
Clouds release hail big as grapes as arrows are let fly
Hear the berserks roar!
They call to mighy Thor!
The fury in their raging eyes will burn forever more
Hear the weapons sing!
Feel the arrows sting!
They climb onto the earl's great ship
And begin to swing
The fight is fierce as they attack
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory!
Arrow pierced, they won't back down
They battle on with heart and fury
Then it turns, the flanking ships give way and soon they are embattled
Standing firm! Fight 'til death!
They refuse to die like cattle

Fighting for his life
No holds barred, so close to revenge
Close but yet so far
Then he stands before him
It's like the battle fades
He sees his father's eyes
As he's struck into the waves

Back on northern shores (northern shores)
Just as he once swore (he once swore)
He has met his fate (met his fate)
In these cold dark waves (cold dark waves)

He looks to clouds up high
A dead and distant stare
She comes out of the light
See the chariot flare
Standing on the shore
He hears her silent call
Freyja leads him through the door, into the Great Hall
