Hey, domino
I am stopping you from falling
One, two, three
Don't you dare go down
Hey, waterfall
Oh, can you hear me calling?
Three, two, one
Don't you dare touch the ground

I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want

Sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when we're alone
Like I might suck your blood

And I could tell you a witch's spell
But it just might blow your top
And you start to run just as I'm having fun
And it's awfully hard to stop
It's awfully hard to stop

Sun in the sky
I am stopping you from burning
All we need
Is stars and moon

Clock on the wall
I will keep your hands from turning
Or this night
Will end too soon

I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want

Sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when we're alone
Like I might suck your blood

And I could tell you a witch's spell
But it just might blow your top
And you start to run just as I'm having fun
And it's awfully hard to stop
It's awfully hard to stop
It's just too hard to stop

I call thee, beloved one
To love me more than anyone
Seven times I pierce my heart
And now you feel the magic start

Bind thy heart and soul to me
As I do will
So let it be, oh

Hey, loverboy
Oh, now do you believe me?
That's not all
That I can do

Sit back down
I'm afraid we won't be leaving
Can't undo
My spell on you

I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)

I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want (I'm the one you want)
I'm the one you want

Sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when we're alone
Like I might suck your blood

And I could tell you a witch's spell
But you just might blow your top
And you start to run just as I'm having fun
And it's awfully hard to stop

Well, sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when we're alone
Like I might suck your blood

And I could tell you a witch's spell
But you just might blow your top
And you start to run just as I'm having fun
And it's awfully hard to stop
It's awfully hard to stop
It's just too hard to stop
I don't think I can stop
