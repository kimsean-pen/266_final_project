Watch out Cupid
Stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out
And let me live my life

You better watch out Cupid
Stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out
Let me live my life
The one I better lead
All the blondes of fantasies

And we looked at them
Eleven ways
You said "look at me"
I looked away
You wrote the song
I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead
Play the lead

Watch out Cupid
Money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out
And let me live my life

She said I'm with stupid
Money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out
Let me live my life
The one I better lead
All the blondes of fantasies

And we looked at them
Eleven ways
You said "look at me"
I looked away
You wrote the song
I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead
Play the lead

I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody
Everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody
Everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead
Play the lead
