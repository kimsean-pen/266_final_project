There's no use trying to undo
Stand here, you're gonna find me
Back where you first found me
IN THE DARK, in the darkest day

Never wonder why I've always felt away
Never feel alone, I need you in the daylight
Sweeping on the sky but I don't want to wake up
I DON'T NEED TO

I don't need you to know where I go
'Cause I'm aware, BEWARE
For tonight has to mean what you saw in the sky

How long we'll never have the same goodbye
Tonight I will meet you in the sky
GOODBYE
