A name uttered with fear
No smile, no tears
They'll crush your skull with a blow
And pile them in a row

The heart of Turisas was forged by four winds
In a smithy high up in the skies
On an anvil of honour, with a hammer of blood
The Four Winds pounded

Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!

As the battle rages the dearest to you, you hold in your hand
And stick in their lungs!

Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!

An iron gaze of a hawk
Out of sight they stalk
Their arrows cut the air as they fly
Death from the sky

Thunder in their eyes
A riding demise
Storming over the men on the field
Breaking their shield

Take this sign into your heart and be brave
Let it lead you to your glory or your grave
Today!

Hear me, my warriors
Soldiers from all the edges of the world
Let us join our forces
To an army, united

Four winds will guide us
The Heart of Turisas will lead our way
Our drums echo: Forward march
Our horns cry for victory

Boldest of them all
They've answered the call
Their arms were strenghtened by the work of their swords
They'll march till they fall

The heart of Turisas was forged by four winds
In a smithy high up in the skies
On an anvil of honour, with a hammer of blood
The Four Winds pounded
