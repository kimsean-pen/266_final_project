Call looking for someone
Look down, maybe she's the best
Baby, you can always be mine
Come, let's get obsessed
We're looking in the dark
Cause we're always mean
Been here so long and my life like a second skin
Can you give a sight of your brighter side?
Can you show me the dark, cause you always wanted
Can you explain me why you're looking for...
You're looking for something, for someone more...
Oh...
You're always so near
We're always far
We come from the dust
Where we hopelessly rise
You're run into fever
Desire's so fine
You come from the fire
You're always mine
Oh...
You're always so near
We're always far
You come from this fight and
You're always round
Maybe you're candle like you...
O-o-oh-oh
You're looking for
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
If you're looking for someone that way
Come on, be my guest
Baby, I will always be blind
Come, let's get obsessed
Fire starts from a spark
Cause you're on my scene
Been here so long and my life like a second skin
Oh...
You're always so near
We're always far
We come from the dust
Where we hopelessly rise
You're run into fever
Desire's so fine
You come from the fire
You're always mine
Oh...
You're always so near
We're always far
You come from this fight and
You're always round
Maybe you're candle like you...
O-o-oh-oh
You're looking for
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
And I just need it
And I just need your love
