I don't know why
Sting in the sky
And they try to steal
All of the life from me

Sorry's a lie
It blinked in the night
But it doesn't see
Although it tries to breath

Stranger in the night
Ill see you in the night
And I don't want to die
Without you

I wanted to be a man but i became your son
And I wanted to be a knot but i came undone
And i wanted to be whats right but I became whats wrong
Well isnt that just sometimes the way life runs?

And i thought i was giving love, but i was being a fool
Now my stiched up, slumbered heart is finally coming too
And the bright side is i finally know my dues are due

And all of the roads
Are my bending my bones
breaking at the bust
Lord I don't want to trust

Can you see it?
Its in the distance
But does it make you feel
The way you want to feel

Stranger in the night
Its time to say goodbye
