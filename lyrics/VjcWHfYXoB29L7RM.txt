Undo these chains, my friend.
I'll show you the rage I've hidden.
Perish the Sacrament.
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven.
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived.

Step inside
See The Devil In I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside
See The Devil In I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men,
Something is tempting the Father.
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you're not what you seem.

Step inside
See The Devil In I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside
See The Devil In I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil
I'm not your Devil anymore

Your station is abandoned, fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation deprivation, you should've burned when you turned on everyone

So step inside
See the Devil In I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside
See the Devil In I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside
See the Devil In I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore
So step inside
Step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I
