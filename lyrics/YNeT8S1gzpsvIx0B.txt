Who's got your head now what do you need
You just keep repeating the same thing obviously
This place is driving you insane
All the little noises spark in you a murderous rage.

Careful what you say oh dear its too late now,
You've woken the guards.
Careful what you say oh dear its too late now,
You've broken my heart

how many times do I have to say it?

Maybe it's my fault for leaving you here
But there's no gun to your head just a flight of stairs
This place is driving you insane
You just keep repeating that as I back away

Careful what you say oh dear its too late now,
You've woken the guards.
Careful what you say oh dear its too late now,
You've broken my heart

Ooo ooo how many times do I have to say it
Ooo ooo how many times do I have to say it

who's calling you out again?
who's calling you out
Careful what you say

Careful what you say it hurts me when you talk that way.
