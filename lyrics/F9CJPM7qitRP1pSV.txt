Heard you're out there tryin' to find me
Heard that you're on your way
Don't think I know you Don't think I own you
What have you got to say
Why do people tell me the things I don't
want to hear
I'm just going to fall asleep and make you disappear
Rather be a sleeper
No one to wake me
No one gets hurt when I forget you
Rather be a sleeper
Under the blankets under the guilt when I forsake you
Now that you lookin' I want to find you
Met you and share somedays
I need to know you I need to own you
I wanna keep you safe
Why do people tell me the things I don't
want to hear
I'm just going to fall asleep and make you disappear
Rather be a sleeper
No one to wake me
No one gets hurt when I forget you
Rather be a sleeper
Under the blankets under the guilt when I forsake you
