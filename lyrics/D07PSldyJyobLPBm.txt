Wrap your arms around me
I'll be still
If it means nothing I could give it up
And then give it all again
Interstates are not what I want
Headlights scare me into visions
I saw an angel fly on bright white wings
Guiding me home
Can you feel me now
Do you know me yet
Can you feel me now
Do you know me yet
Call me back on saturday when I'll be done
Looking out for it is all I do
Did you know it cause we're older now
We were young I was so young
Still I sit with you in parking lots
Acting like I'm not falling for it
Still I sit with you in parking lots
Acting like I'm not falling for it
Still I sit with
You can you feel me now
Do you know me yet
Can you feel me now
Do you know me yet
I saw a meteor burn through the sky
