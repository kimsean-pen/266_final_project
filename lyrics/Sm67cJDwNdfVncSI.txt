I dig my own graves lately
I don't need any help
Just let me sit here quiet
In here by myself

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Meet me at the gates of the cemetery

I've been a zombie lately
I've got nothin' to say
Always too much talkin'
Not enough eatin' brains

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Meet me at the gates of the cemetery

I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune

Right on, Frankenstein!
Youth is in the door
Lazarus push the stone off
Where's the way back to bed

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Meet me at the gates of the cemetery

Chasin' the beast inside me
He pushes and shoves
Says, and he does, and he hugs him
Why do I get no love

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Meet me at the gates of the cemetery

I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune

Right on, Frankenstein!
You don't believe in ghosts
Lightning strikes the body
And threatens life the most
