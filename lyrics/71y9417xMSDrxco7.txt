Said to the man at the railroad station
I want a ticket, just for one
He said
Well, if you insist
But where you wanna go, a miss?

Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world, ain't got no back door

He looked at me with a funny face and said
Are you sure you wanna go just anyplace?
I said, If you ever loved someone, the way I loved that man
Surely Mr. ticket agent, you could understand

Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world ain't got no back door

'Cause if it did, it would swing both ways
And we'd go on back to happy yesterdays
When he loved me tenderly
And all he needed was me

As I stared through the window of the train
I thought I heard my baby call my name
But it was just the conductor saying
Which stop would you prefer?

Oh, destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world, ain't got no back door

Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
