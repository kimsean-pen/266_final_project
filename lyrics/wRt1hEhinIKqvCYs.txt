Your plane is boarding got to cross the ocean alone
my heart is stone
you need to figure out the things that plague you here at home
I'll carry on

sometimes it's one thing
and next time it's nothing
it's more than mistrusting

it ends up just crushing me

stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing

I won't let you do this
we have to get through this

so say something I'm not holding back
before the scene we made goes and fades to black

cuz I can't wait while you think this through
we don't have endless time
remember who left who
cuz I won't wait

won't wait for you
your lifeless eyes don't hold the
same desire anymore
I can't ignore

so long I've wondered but I think now I know
you're not coming home
sometimes it's one thing
and next time it's nothing

it's more than mistrusting
it ends up just crushing me
stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this

we have to get through this
so say something I'm not holding back
before the scene we made goes and fades to black
cuz i cant wait while you think this through
we don't have endless time remember who left who
cuz I won't wait
won't wait for you
put my heart in your hands committed my whole life to you

and all you had to say
see you in a few days

but days turn into months
this isn't what you promised me
I've got to let you go
or just find another way
so say something I'm not holding back
(I needed time to work it out alone)
so say something I'm not holding back
before the scene we made goes and fades to black
cuz I can't wait while you think this through
we don't have endless time remember who left who
because I won't wait
won't wait for you
