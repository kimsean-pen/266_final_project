I never thought
The brain could burn
The senses dull
I haven't felt before
Never touched a storm
Or felt a wind so strong
Never knew
Never felt
Never had something
All the stories say
Something
Something more
More than I ever knew
Something real
Try and see
Something right, truly
And everything
You'll ever need
'Cause you just

Got to find something
To keep you burning through the cold
Well don't forget that one thing
Far from shining, glitters gold
Well, don't forget, just tell me 'bout it
Everything you want to be
No more playing now
Don't you ever

Don't you ever forget about it

Every thought
Always and only
Just enough
They say just around
And I
I want to know
Want to be
Want to see
What this means
'Cause I know that there's got to be
Got to be
Something more
Everything, you'll ever need
'Cause you just

Got to find something
To keep you burning through the cold
Well, don't forget, that one thing
Far from shining, glitters gold
Well, don't forget, just tell me 'bout it

Everything you'll ever need
No more playing around
Well don't you ever
Don't you forget about it

Everyone's got to find, that something
One thing to hold on
Everyone's got to find, that something
Hold on, so long don't you forget about it
Everyone's got to find, that something
One thing to hold on
Everyone's got to find, that something
Oh hold on so long, oh, don't forget about it
Everyone's got to find that something
Don't you forget about it
Don't you forget about it
Don't you ever
No
Everyone's got to find that something
Don't ever forget about it
Don't you ever forget about it
Don't you ever
