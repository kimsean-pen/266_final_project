These are the days in your life
When you cross up, time is free
Like your daddy says the world is yours
So let it come naturally

All the seasons change
And scope you with a kiss
You welcome all those tricks
Select the peach that I'll prepare

Never forget, well, it hurts, doesn't matter
How it felt to me
But how many girls went and
Lost their way?

We were reckless,
So precise, but baby
The joy was the one thing
Leaving right

So look away
You got a thing you wanna see
Just come by me
And we'll just see(?)

If you ever bail
Take a look around
Do I look wrong to you
And that's the truth
