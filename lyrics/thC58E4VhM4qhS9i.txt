Well pale face said
to the eyeball kid
she just goes clank and boom and steam
a halo, wings, horns, and a tail
shovelling coal inside my dreams
there are no laws
she's made of cream
she's such a scream
Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement
a donnie gal from mortal clay
the plow is red
the well is full,
inside the dollhouse of her skull
a cheetah coat fills up with steam
she's such a scream
All crooked lines
her fireplace
a milktrain so clean
machine gun haste
you'll ride the only wall of shame
and drag that chain across the state
her lips are red
she is the queen
she's such a scream...
