Fast asleep, she's been waiting to creep
For a long time
Friendly eyes slowly swallow the vibes
From the waist line

Only dreams can deliver these things
To my bedside
And the shrugs says she's pullin' the plugs
To the outside

Like the days in a lovesick haze
Chemical fire
Lock your face, point to minimum waits
Friends that desire

Lucid nights bring her perfumed sight
To admire
All in all moments to recall
And retire
