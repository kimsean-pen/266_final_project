New moon awakening
Casting light upon a dream
And it starts haunting
The storm is building up

The spirits are awakening
Losing hours to the ghost
And then the rain
It came crushing down

Falling rocks leave the wounded ground
In the doorway they stood
The ghosts are whispering their name, no sleep
Colossus is calling

Destined to swallow the shore
The depths splits the surface
Raised it's cold hands to the sky
To become controller of earth and wood

A constellation of stars embodied
Descent to walk among the pale
Colossus colliding
The coral giant strides along the shore

A constellation of stars embodied
Descent to walk among the pale
Colossus colliding
The coral giant strides along the shore

New moon awakening
Casting light upon a dream
And it starts haunting
The storm is building up (the storm is building up)

A constellation of stars embodied
Descent to walk among the pale
Colossus colliding
The coral giant strides along the shore

A constellation of stars embodied
Descent to walk among the pale
Colossus colliding
The coral giant strides along the shore
