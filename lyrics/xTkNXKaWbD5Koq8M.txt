Uh
Chilling, layin' in the cut doe
Easy, tryin' see what up doe
Brooklyn, home of the cutthroat
Notorious, ya'll know how the rest go
Sleeping, one eye open
Too smart cause I'm always scopin'
Watching, seeing how these lames look
Lazy, that's how you get ya frame took

Money, I got Money
Money, I got Money

Talking, always talking
That's your problem, you always talking
Rockstar, mixed with a ghetto chick
Try me? I wish a nigga would bitch
Hol' up, who gon' hold us?
(La la la la la la la la)
Not the cemetery, or the penitentiary, damn my contemporaries
I'm too legendary, its so

Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
I'm Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
Money, I got Money (Ooooh)

All my life, I had to grind and hustle
I had to work like Kobe just to shine like Russell (Ooooh)
They say, "Glad you made it happen over night" (Ooooh)
They say, "Damn, you changed"
I'm like, "Show. You. Right."

Nigga I be
In the crib, tryna find the bpm
Rehearsing for the next show in my kitchen
Fresh off a tour, but can't tell ya where I been
Maybe after 20 years, I'll start to take it in
Right now, I'm chasing Yen, In Dover Street again
I'm introverted, I'm not open to new friends
But if ya real cute, then I have to think again
Shop the runway, so you can stay off-trend and look like
Money, Money

Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
Money, I got Money (Ooooh)

All my life, I had to grind and hustle (Ooooh)
I had to, work like Kobe just to shine like Russell (Ooooh)
They say, "Glad you made it happen over night" (Ooooh)
They say, "Damn, you changed"
I'm like, "Show. You. Right."
Nigga, I got Money, I got Money (Ooooh)

Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
I'm Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
Money, I got Money (Ooooh)
