Oh, blinded now I see that I
Could not hold you
My orange tree left in the darkened
Room for three of us to share

Oh maybe you were free before my
Blackened wind covered you
I took the sing from your song
I made a bed
Where you don't belong

Oh poor me, she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea, I failed to be a light you found in love
Oh poor me, she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea, the monster killed the melody you loved

Now I'm going places on my own

Blinded now I see the death
Moves amongst us
And with such ease arrived
To surround us
These silent beasts are hard to bear

Lonely, oh no not me
I have a grave to dig
Fast moving feet, you gave me light
Where it once was gone
I made a bed
Where you don't belong
Poor me, she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea, I failed to be the light you found in love
Oh poor me, she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea, the monster killed the melody you loved
Now I'm going places on my own
