I can't find your face in a
Thousand masqueraders
You're hidden in the colors of a
Million other lost charaders
In life's big parade
I'm the loneliest spectator
Cuz you're gone without a trace in
A sea of faceless imitators

I can't take another night
Burning inside this

Hell is living without your love
Ain't nothing without your
Touch me
Heaven would be like hell
Is living without you

Try to walk away
When I see the time I've wasted
Starving at a feast
And all this wine I've never tasted
On my lips your memory has been stained
Is it all in vain
Tell me who's to blame

I can't take another night
Burning inside this

Hell is living without your love
Ain't nothing without your
Touch me
Heaven would be like hell
Is living without you

Nights get longer and colder
I'm down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like hell
Is living without you

Hell is living without your love
Ain't nothing without your
Touch me
Heaven would be like hell
Is living without you

Nights get longer and colder
I'm down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like hell
Is living without you...
