How come what's wrong with you
Darling faces are some we found
Let's do what devils do
Hiding in shadows, no-ones around
Why can't I torture you
Giving pain you take it away
The little things you do
Simply I love your evil ways
Your ways!
Your ways!
Your ways!

Prey for me
I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

This time it follows you
Nothings left, your dead on the ground
How can I covet you
Give you hell and you can't be found
My soul infested you
Blackened thoughts they run through your head
The little things you do
Simply I wish you were dead
Were dead!
Were dead!
Were dead!

Prey for me
I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

I think I owe you an apology

Somehow you bring the violence out in me

I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

Goodbye
So long
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong
Goodbye
So long
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong

Everything is all
WRONG! TOO! WRONG!
WRONG! TOO! WRONG!

Prey for me
I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I'm just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
