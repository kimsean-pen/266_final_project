If I'm a bad person
You don't like me
I guess I'll make my own way.
It's a circle
A mean cycle.
I can't excite you anymore.
Where's your gavel?
Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

Don't wanna hear your sad songs!
I don't wanna feel your pain!
When you swear it's all my fault
But you know we're not the same
(No!)
We're not the same!
(No!)
Oh, we're not the same!
Yeah, that the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept
That the change is good
(Hey!)
It's good
(Hey!)
It's good

You treat me just like
Another stranger
Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!
I guess I'll go
I best be on my way out

You treat me just like
Another stranger
Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!
I guess I'll go
I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend!
Ignorance is your new best friend!

This is the best thing
That could've happened
Any longer and I wouldn't have made it!

It's not a war
No, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person
But you can't take it
The same tricks
That once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere!
I'm not the same kid
From your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself.

Don't wanna hear your sad songs!
I don't wanna feel your pain!
When you swear it's all my fault
But you know we're not the same
(No!)
We're not the same!
(No!)
Oh, we're not the same!
Yeah, we use to stick together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept
That the change is good
(Hey!)
It's good
(Hey!)
It's good

You treat me just like
Another stranger
Well, It's nice to meet you, sir!
I guess I'll go
I best be on my way out.

Ignorance is your new best friend!
Ignorance is your new best friend!
Ignorance is your new best friend!
Ignorance is your new best friend!
