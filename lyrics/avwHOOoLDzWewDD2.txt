Pretty
Let's cease this long-time mockery
without distraught there's no beauty
you're both resplendent and rusty
rusty

Pretty
was your red mouth overflowing
the lightning's path under your skin
the veins that flowed over your chin
your chin

Now these flowers are sold
this lover is cold
the hour is gone
the colour is wrong
And I want more
than just a sip of it all

Ugly
is the black flag you wave at me
nausea to make history
you think i'm lost, you just tease me
tease me

Klaus was
the closest one to embody
this sharpest taste, "ugly-pretty"
it was for love and love only
only

Now these flowers are sold
this lover is cold
the hour is gone
the colour is wrong
And I want more
than just a sip of it all

Ils ont insisté pour me montrer une vidéo
Où les visages s'effondraient
à cause de la mauvaise connexion
Où les pénétrations en gros plan
promettaient des gouffres
J'ai pensé aux creux sur ta peau
J'ai ri avec eux de la vidéo,
alors que j'étais profondément émue

Now these flowers are sold
this lover is cold
the hour is gone
the colour is wrong
And I want more
than just a sip of it all
