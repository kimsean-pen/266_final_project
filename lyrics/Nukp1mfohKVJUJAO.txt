I see a fire in the sky
(Lights go out)
I'm gonna finish what I've started
(Lights go out)
And now you better pray I don't know where you are

Do you remember?
Do you remember just like I always do?
I've been trying to remind you
Do you remember just like I always do?
I've been trying to remind you

There ain't gonna be a jail sentence
No more fucking consequence
No there will never be another sentence
No more fucking consequence
No there will never be another sentence

I see a fire in the sky
(Lights go out)
I'm gonna finish what I've started
(Lights go out)
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
(Lights go out)
I'm gonna finish what I've started
(Lights go out)
And now you better pray I don't know where you are

Fire in the sky (rise)
This is freedom
(I see fire in the sky)
Now you'll suffer
(I see fire in the sky)
This is freedom (rise)
(I see fire in the sky)
Now you'll suffer

I see a fire in the sky
(Lights go out)
I'm gonna finish what I've started
(Lights go out)
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
(Lights go out)
I'm gonna finish what I've started
(Lights go out)
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
