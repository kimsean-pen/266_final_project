Every morning I wake up
One second later
I need to realize
What is my life

Every morning I lose it
Between hope and danger
It feels so confusing
To be trapped between two worlds

Every morning I wake up
One second later
I need to realize
What is my life

Every morning I lose it
Between hope and danger
It feels so confusing
To be trapped between two worlds

Let me recover my eyesight
Let me go over to the light

Between hope and danger
There's the sunrise
Between hope and danger
There's the sunrise
Between hope and danger
