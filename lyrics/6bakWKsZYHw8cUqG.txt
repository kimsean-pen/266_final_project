Why make time
When no one pays a dime
To renumerate a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime
Ch ch cha-ching chime

Creating a crime
Just armed with melodyne
Looking at a mime
The rhymes are all mine
But no one pays no mind
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

In the daytime
Face coverd by the grime
Sucking on a lime
With no one pays no mind
Slamming on a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Superbowl, half time
Anytime is war time
Sucking seeds is pastime
Gonorrhea, overtime
Fuck that it's bed time
No more friend of mine
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

I'll fuck your mind
Over the spring time
Degrading in your prime
A though's so asinine
But no one pays no mind
And no one pays a dime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

Open your eyes
Don't be this way
Tough all your dreams are swept away
The stairs won't rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

Superbowl, half time
Anytime is wartime
Psychic sees his pastime
Gonorrhea, overtime
Put that in sped time
No more friend of mine
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

I'll fuck your mind
Over the spring time
Degrading in your prime
A thought so asinine
But no one pays and dime
And no one pays a dime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

Open your eyes don't be this way
While all your dreams are swept away
The stairs won't rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

The waters will rush but don't dismay
Our smiles will cross the world will stay
The bridge has crossed itself today
Now close your eyes and sway the sway, sway the sway

Open your eyes don't be this way
While all your dreams are swept away
The stairs will rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

The waters will rush but don't dismay
Our smiles will cross the world will stay
The bridge has crossed itself today
Now close your eyes and sway the sway, sway the sway

To remunerate a rhyme over the ching chime
Ching chime, ching chime

Creating a crime

Looking at a mime
The rhymes are all mine
But no one pays no mind
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch cha-ching chime

Sucking on a lime
When no one pays no mind
Slamming on a rhyme
