Take me for a ride,
keep me by your side
We can try to run away.
Walking through the park,
leave you in the dark
You know I'll be back somehow

I'm wherever you go
I'm wherever you go
I'm wherever you go
I'll be there

Feeling so alive,
Wanna see the light
Show me where you're [?]
Beautiful inside,
Make you realize
Make you feel something in.

I'm wherever you go
I'm wherever you go
I'm wherever you go
I'll be there

Feels like I'm driving back home
Like I'm driving back home
Aah aah aah

I'll be there.
