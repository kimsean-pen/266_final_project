Whenever my head starts to hurt
Before it goes from bad to feeling worst
I turn off my phone
I get down low
I put my hands in the dirt
I try to stop the world from moving so fast
Try and get a grip on where I'm at
To simplify this dizzy life

And get my feet in the grass
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work

I'm going back to the Earth
Yes I'm going Back...
The only explanation for our rise
Must be that everybody wants to get it high
Move on up to a deluxe
appartement in the sky
The higher we go, the taller we grow old
We lose sight of our land below

You can have your place up in outer space
Cause my home is where my food is grown
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth

I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)
And we'll start with emotions at the bottom of the ocean
I was feeling from the top of the trees
We are animals (we are animals)
We are wild (we are wild)
And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back to living
with the land in harmony
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth

Oh yeah...
I listen to the whistle in the wind
it's blending with the songs of the birds
The messages remind me who I am
That I'm a child of the Earth
It's where I find spirituality
It's in everything that surrounds me
You can spell God G-O-D
Or you can spell it N-A-T-U-R-E

I'm going back to the Earth

I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going Back!
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going back to work
I'm going back to the Earth
I'm going Back!
