Speeding down the motorway
Let slow life pass us by
Another mile another day
Get some action in our lives
We're on our way
Living for today

C'mon let's go (Let go!)
C'mon let's go (Let go!)
Let's go!

Engines screaming red hot rage
We're gonna reach an all time high
Speed crazed racer rip my mind
'Cause you know you're gonna hit the sky
We make our move
And you know we'll never lose

We're on our way
Living for today
We make our move
And you know we'll never lose

C'mon let's go (Let go!)
C'mon let's go (Let go - hey!)
C'mon let's go (Let go - hey!)
Let's go!
