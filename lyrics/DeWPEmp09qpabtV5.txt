To my mistakes, to my mistakes of cowardice
She shimmy shakes, the jimmy jakes of consequence
Born of the airs and dues, my airs of madness do declare
That it's ok, it's love
It's what you wanted to see, it's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need, she'll make it up

Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love

Machine gun blues, her vacant rush is so steel
I'm unaware, lost inside your visions
I got mine too over, I got mine and I got you
Cause I know you, you're love
It's what you wanted to see, it's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need, she'll make it up

Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love

And when I lost my mind, I knew I was in for the long ride

Can I look up to you as you look down on me
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be
For what I needed to need, she'll make it

Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love it's who you know
Love, Love

Love solves everything. Love
