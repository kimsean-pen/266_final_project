Damn I haven't washed my hair for days
Another day I'm feeling lost
Lock myself in now I lie awake
Can't erase the pain you've caused
It's delicate it's how I'm made
I use these moments to create
Guess I'm an emotional wreck now
Feel another let down
Sometimes I wish I could escape
I guess it's just what I got
No redemption for a weak heart (weak heart)
When it break you take it real hard (real hard)
Won't pretend to be what I'm not
I guess it's just what I got (what I got)
Guess it's just what I got
Guess it's just what I got
If I could rewind to yesterday
I'd eliminate you and restart
'Stead in between these walls I hide away
Can't illuminate the dark
It's delicate it's how I'm made
I use these moments to create
Guess I'm an emotional wreck now
Feel another let down
Sometimes I wish I could escape
I guess it's just what I got
No redemption for a weak heart (weak heart)
When it break you take it real hard (real hard)
Won't pretend to be what I'm not
I guess it's just what I got (what I got)
(I guess it's just what I got)
Guess it's just what I got
Guess it's just what I got
Wake up it's a lighter day
Feel the sun rays for a start
Thinkin' it was just a phase
See the hard days from afar
Then the blue comes flooding my head
And it hurts oh I cannot breathe in this choke hold
Hit me and it's razor sharp
I guess it's just what I got
No redemption for a weak heart (weak heart)
(No redemption for a weak heart)
When it break you take it real hard (real hard)
(You take it real hard)
Won't pretend to be what I'm not
(Pretend to be what I'm not)
I guess it's just what I got (what I got)
I guess it's just what I got
I guess it's just what I got
I guess it's just what I got
I guess it's just what I got
