I'll always remember
It was late afternoon
It lasted forever
And ended so soon, yeah
You were all by yourself
Staring up at a dark gray sky
I was changed

In places no one will find
All your feelings so deep inside
Was there that I realized
That forever was in your eyes
The moment I saw you cry
The moment that I saw you cry

It was late in September
And I've seen you before
You were always the cold one
But I was never that sure
You were all by yourself
Staring up at a dark grey sky
I was changed

In places no one will find
All your feelings so deep inside
Was there that I realized
That forever was in your eyes
The moment I saw you cry

I wanted to hold you
I wanted to make it go away
I wanted to know you
I wanted to make your everything
Alright

I'll always remember
It was late afternoon
In places no one will find

In places no one will find
All your feelings so deep inside

Forever was in your eyes
Was there that I realized

That forever was in your eyes

The moment I saw you cry
Baby cry
The moment that I saw you cry
Oh no no
I think I saw you cry
The moment I saw you cry
I wanted to know you
I wanted to know you
I wanted to know you
