Footsteps in the night
Footsteps in the night, yeah
Echoes through my life
Echoes through my life, yeah
I can't fall far behind
I can't fall far behind, no
Truth is hard to find
Peace is hard to find, yeah

And the rain comes
And the rain comes
Through the streets of love
So give your heartbreaks and feelings up

I've run into love, run into love, yeah
Think you've got enough, you can't get enough yeah

And the rain comes
And the rain comes
Through the streets of love
So give your heartbreaks and feelings up

At the end of the starry night
We'll join hands and see in the light
But you're lonely
Fold your memories and steal away
Let's get ready, here comes the rain it's falling
And it's falling, down
Down, down

And the rain comes
And the rain comes
Through the streets of love
So give your heartbreaks and feelings up

In your heart, that's where we end up
