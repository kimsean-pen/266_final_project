Come on over baby
Whole lotta shakin' going on
Come on over baby
Baby you can't wrong
Ain't nobody faking
Whole lotta shakin' going on

Come on over baby
Whole lotta kickin' in the barn
Come over baby
We got the bull by the horn
Everything's kicking
Whole lotta shakin' going on
Makin' and makin' it shake
Doe and the flow and the gate
Takin' and makin' it shake
Cake then found the plate
Shakin' we shakin' and shakin' the place
Come on over, baby, come on
We done found that ding dong

Come on over baby
Whole lotta shakin' going on
Come on over baby
Baby you can't go wrong
Ain't nobody faking
Whole lotta shakin' going on
Makin' and makin' it shake
Doe and the flow and the gate
Takin' and makin' it shake
Cake then found the plate
Makin' it, makin' it shake
Shakin' in the jams, but case
Sweet, oh, baby come on...
