Do you wanna run away together?
I would say it was your best line ever.
Too bad I fell for it...

And I walked along,
Waiting for you to come along.
Take my tortured heart by the hand.
And write me off.

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...

You forced me to become strong.
And I just cried, being weak.
And you think you know.
And I would like to think so,
But do you know that when you go,
I fall apart.

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind.
No, it's not the good kind...

I'm tired of hiding behind these lying eyes,
I'm tired of this smile that even I don't recognize.

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...

No, you're not the good kind.
Good kind
No, you're not the good kind.
Good kind
No, you're not the good kind
