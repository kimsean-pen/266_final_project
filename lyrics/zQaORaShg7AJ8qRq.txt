Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye my love
I can't hide, can't hide, can't hide what has come
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go

And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know

That I love you so

I love you so

I love you so
Goodbye brown eyes, goodbye for now

Goodbye sunshine, take care of yourself
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know
That I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
La-lullaby, distract me with your rhymes, la-lullaby
La-lullaby, help me sleep tonight
La-lullaby, la-lullaby, la-lullaby
I have to go (goodbye)
I have to go (goodbye)
I have to go (goodbye)
And leave you alone
But always know (goodbye)
Always know (brown eyes)
Always know (goodbye)
That I love you so
I love you so (goodbye lullaby)
I love you so (goodbye)
I love you so (goodbye brown eyes)
I love you so (goodbye)
I love you so
I love you so
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love
