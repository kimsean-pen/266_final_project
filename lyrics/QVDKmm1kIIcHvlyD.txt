Yeah
It's Your boy Barron
Yo
And the place to be
It's crazy
Come rock with me!

Couldn't wait to leave,
But now I hate to go
Last day of camp,
Packing my bags slow

Made so many friends,
Why does it have to end
In the end its a win,
Because we grown so close together

Remember when we first met,
First day
Figured this would be no fun,
No way
And now its time to leave, (leave)
But now we wanna stay, (stay, stay, stay, stay)
Oh!

Hasta la vista
I'm gonna say goodbye to you
Whatever happens I'll be cool with you
Wanna give me your number I'll call ya
Promise I won't forget ya
Hasta la vista
We'll all be going seperate ways
Say everything you didn't say
This is your moment, before you go
Come on now get up and show them

Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
(And I'm gonna do my thing)

There's so much inside of me
There's so much more I just want to be
All the things I've seen, obviously I'm inspired
Got love for all the friendships I've acquired

Everybody put a hand up, put a hand up, hey, hey, hey Everybody put a hand up, put a hand up and say hey, hey, hey

Hasta la vista I'm gonna say goodbye to you
Whatever happens I'll be cool with you
Wanna give me your number I'll call ya
Promise I won't forget ya
Hasta la vista
We'll all be going seperate ways
Say everything you didn't say
This is your moment, before you go
Come on now get up and show them

Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
Keep doing your thing, thing, thing
