I'm just a jealous buffoon
I'm just a jealous buffoon

You can tell that I'm a jealous, I'm a jealous buffoon
You can tell that I'm the only elephant in the room
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon

Sing
I have trouble, so much trouble keepin' eyes off of you
Don't you know that I'm a jealous, I'm a jealous buffoon?

I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon

I'm just a jealous buffoon
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
Used to your body, cruisin' your body
I never think I'll ever get used to your body
I'm just a jealous buffoon
I'm just a jealous buffoon
