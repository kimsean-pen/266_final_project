Beneath a silent stone
In cold caress of the earth
Where timeless sleep reigns
Where world is but a distant toll

No stars shine, no moon roams
No sun broods, no winds blow
No tunes chime amidst the bones
No prayers for the devil's own

Night falls and dawn breaks again
Autumns and winters slowly pass
And all these earthly tremors
But a remembrance for me

Mine is this forgotten song
Buried deep and heard no more
Mine is this unhallowed sleep
Deathless wait under the trees

All the years in vain I fought
All my deeds have gone to nought
Unsung is the tale of mine
Mislaid till the end of time

Hidden deep under the vale of moon
Entombed beneath the white flowers of death

Only the frail words
Written in the stone
Retell my name anymore

Only the frail words
Written in the stone
Recall my days anymore
