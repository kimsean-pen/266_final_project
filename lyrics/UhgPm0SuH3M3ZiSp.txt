I think we're getting kinda distant
So I try to cling onto you
But you had started resisting
And your mind withdrew
Conversations inconsistent
I don't know what to do
Say it's not about commitment
You're just so confused

I need time to think about it
I need time to think things through
'Cause lately I've been drowning
In thoughts of you
Tell me, tell me how you're feeling
Say it's all untrue
Give me a reason for leaving
'Cause I'm so confused

These days it's hard to leave when I see you in every part of me
You're all I see
Boys will be boys, but you're not like the other ones
What will I do without you when tomorrow comes?

All I do is think of you and cry
All I do is think of you and cry

Thirty days since the last call
So I try to get over you
Been experiencing withdrawal
The less I do
Thirty days since you left me
And it's hard to see your point of view
But I want you to be happy
You're just so confused

These days it's hard to leave when I see you in every part of me
You're all I see
Boys will be boys, but you're not like the other ones
What will I do without you when tomorrow comes?

All I do is think of you and cry
All I do is think of you and cry

All I do is think of you and cry
All I do is think of you and cry
All I do is think of you and cry
All I do is think of you and cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
