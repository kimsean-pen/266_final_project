How will we survive
They continue to ask
No one ever does
No one ever does
There's so much grief
In breaking for bread

Hysteria...
All we've ever known
Hysteria...
All we've ever known

No birth without blood
No confusion without us
The book of nightmare carries the moan
Our bodies in a war knot tightening

Hysteria...
All we've ever known
Hysteria...
All we've ever known

Hysteria...
All we've ever known
