I know you're sorry for the shots you've made
I understand those kinds of crooks[?] you have to play
I'd have done the same in your place

I think it's right for you to feel ashamed
But will stand by all the mistakes you've made
I'd have done the same in your place

Bonfires won't rise
Think I'll put myself to bed tonight
Bonfires won't rise, yes
I think I'll put myself to bed tonight

Half lies[?]
Think I'll lose myself, you know? Half lies
Will you get home or not?
Tough line
Think I'll lose myself, you know? Half lies
Will you get home or not?
Who knows, who knows, who knows
Who knows, who knows, who knows

Half lies
Think I'll lose myself, you know, half lies
Will you get home or not, half lies

(half lies)
Bonfires won't rise
I think I'll put myself to bed tonight
(half lies)
Bonfires won't rise, yes
I think I'll put myself to bed tonight
