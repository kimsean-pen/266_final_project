Mmm
This night, no, I don't wanna talk about her
Tonight, I really wanna fix your hurt
'Cause I can see it in your face
Your heart is breaking, heart is breaking
No, this night, no, I don't wanna hear her name
Tonight, no, I don't wanna play her games
'Cause I, I really wanna be the one to take you
One to take you home

Fed up of being the shoulder you cry on
I want to be the shoulder you lie on
Everyday, every night
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
If you're mine
Fed up of being the one that you lean on
I want to be the one that you dream of
Everyday, every night
I'll be fine (I'll be fine, I'll be fine)

If I get my way
I'ma take care of you
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
If you let me try
Just one night, I can prove
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)

(Hey)
(Hey)

This time, no, I'ma make you see me too
This night, I'm never letting go of you
Tonight, I'ma put a end to all the waitin'
All the waitin'

Fed up of being the shoulder you cry on
I want to be the shoulder you lie on
Everyday, every night
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
If you're mine
Fed up of being the one that you lean on
I want to be the one that you dream of
Everyday, every night
I'll be fine
(I'll be fine, I'll be fine)

If I get my way
I'ma take care of you
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
If you let me try
Just one night, I can prove
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)

Don't you know I try
To forget about you at night?
Being more than just friends
Oh I, need you
'Cause I've been on your side
Long before this new girl came by
She does nothin' but tell you lies
I know

If I get my way
I'ma take care of you
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
If you let me try
Just one night, I can prove
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Oh woah woah)

If I get my way
I'ma take care of you
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
If you let me try (me try)
Just one night, I can prove
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)

If I get my way
I'ma take care of you
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
If you let me try
Just one night, I can prove
I can take her place
Let me get my way (Ooh)
