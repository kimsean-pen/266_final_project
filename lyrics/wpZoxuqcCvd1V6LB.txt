At the gates of hell I stand alone
Waiting for the call
Now my time has come to pay the price
For the things I've done

I can see but there's nobody there
I can hear but there's so much I fear
In the dark
I can feel but my senses are gone
I can tell but the damage is done
In the dark

Return your soul it's the end of the line
Return your soul it's the end of time

Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right
The face of a demon with eyes turning black
Nosferatu
Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right
Candles were burning the ritual was on
Nosferatu

I can run but I can not escape
I can hide but I'm bent out of shape
In the dark
I can lie but the truth isn't there
I can die but there's no one to care
In the dark

Return your soul it's the end of the line
Return your soul it's the end of time

Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right
The face of a demon with eyes turning black
Nosferatu
Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right
Candles were burning the ritual was on
Nosferatu
