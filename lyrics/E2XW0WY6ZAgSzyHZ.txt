These arms they never reach
Far enough
These shoulders never strike wide enough
These teeth they never cut
Deep enough in
My skin
To be someone like you
Unable to face basal demands
To be someone like you
Unable to carry
Life's weight

Broken promise
Where's your morals
In this cursed realm
Where hides Jesus

If I could
Leave my body then I would
Bleed into a lake
Dashing away
Disappear

Where's your morals
Where's your morals
Where's your morals
Where's your morals
