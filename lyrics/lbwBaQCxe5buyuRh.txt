While the crowd is waiting for the final kiss
The one which allows them to sleep well
We'll walk along our own path
The one which will lead us to our own bliss

But we need hints
Before we get tired
But we need hints
Before we get tired

Now we need hints
Before we lose pace
We need a hint
To know we're on the right track

We need hints
Before we get tired
But we need hints
Before we get tired

Now we need speed
Before we lose pace
Now we need a hint
To know we're on the right track
