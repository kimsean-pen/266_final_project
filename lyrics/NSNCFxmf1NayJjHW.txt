Shoo be doo be doo doop boo hoo
Shoo be doo be doop boo hoo
(Are you, are you, are you all alone?)
Shoo be doo be doo doop boo hoo
(Right here)

I saw you jump up
You and your friends, baby
And I heard you say they're playing a jam
(There's a jam right here, baby)
So waving your hand from side to side, sugar
Here you're claiming you're a certified man
(Certified)

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissing me in ways I can't tell
(No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance
(Yeah)

Do you have a girlfriend?
(Do you have a girlfriend?)
You're looking real cool
(You're looking real cool)
Can I have your number?
(Can I have your number?)
You don't have a thing to lose

Do you have a minute?
(Do you have a minute?)
What is on your mind?
(What is on your mind?)
I was just thinking
(I was just thinking)
We can spend some time

Shoo be doo be doo doop boo hoo
(Are you all alone?)
Shoo be doo be doop boo hoo
Shoo be doo be doo doop boo hoo
(Are you, are you all alone?)

Heard a slow song
You don't waste time, baby
And you asked me if
I wanted to dance?
(Sure I wanna dance)

Playing hard to get
Takes to long, sugar
So I told my friends
That I found a man
(You're the one)

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissing me in ways I can't tell
(No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance
(Yeah)

Do you have a girlfriend?
(Do you have a girlfriend?)
You're looking real cool

What is on your mind?
(What is on your mind?)
I was just thinking
(I was just thinking)
We can spend some time

Do you, do you, do you have a girlfriend?
You're looking real cool
Do you, do you, do you have a minute?
I was just thinking
Do you, do you, do you have a girlfriend
We could spend some time
Do you, do you, do you have a minute?
(Are you all alone?)
Aha, aha

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissing me in ways I can't tell
(No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance
