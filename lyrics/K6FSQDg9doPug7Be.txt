Party people
Yeah, Tag Team music in full effect
That's me DC the brain supreme
And my man Steve Roll'n
We're kicking the flow we're kickin' the flow
And it goes a little somethin' like this

Tag Team back again, check and direct and let's begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house jump, jump, rejoice
There's a party over here, a party over there
Wave your hands in the air, shake your derier
These three words when you're gettin' busy

Whoomp there it is, hit me

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Upside down and inside out
I'm about to show all you folks
What's it's all about

Now it's time for a nigga to get on the mic
And make this mother fucking party hype
I'm taking it back to the old school
'Cause, I'm an old fool who's so cool

If you want to get down
I'm gonna show you the way, whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Point blank gin and juice I drank
Gettin' bent and bent and as I puff on a dank
Rock a mic, uh oh, I crave skin

Rip shit, find a honey to to dip it in

Slam dunk it, stick it, flip it, and ride
That B O double T Y, oh my

Whoomp there it is, I'm done

Some say I'm crazy, 'cause I'm pushin' up daisies
The underground sound that you have found
Amazing outstanding demanding
Commanding you people dancin'
Shit that's a breath taker, I produce AKA, the Undertaker
You want to come down to the underground old school
Here's a shovel can you dig it, fool?
Can you dig it? We can dig it
Can you'll dig it? We can dig it
W H double O M P as I flow
To the fly shit from the school of old
Hardcore keep the folk lore wreck
Three to the two and one mic-check
Mad skill flow ill on the mesh of steel
That's the grill of the microphone I just killed
Party people, it's your party, Tag Team is through
Whoomp there it is, I thought you knew
