Just forget I ever said
That this true love ain't enough
Got a diamond in my head
And a universal bluff
Got a find a better blue one
Hold this picture of the sun
Gotta find a way to you
Before all of this is done

Once you strip the pain you find it everywhere ya go
You and I should know

That love is enough, love is enough, love is enough
Love is enough, love is enough, love is enough
Love is enough at the end of the tracks so when the car breaks, heart attacks
Love is enough when you don't look back

My country is a cross
And my city's a vice
And so perilous a place
Such a blood forgotten price

Just forget I ever said
This true love ain't enough
There's a killer in my bed
And enough is not enough

Once you strip the pain you find it everywhere ya go
You and I should know
Everything we have seen forever for a day
Don't drive my love away

Love is enough, love is enough, love is enough
Love is enough, love is enough, love is enough
Love is enough at the end of the tracks so when the white flag waves, heart attacks
Love is enough when u don't look back
Love is enough when u don't look back
Love is enough, love is enough, love is enough
Love is enough when you don't look back
