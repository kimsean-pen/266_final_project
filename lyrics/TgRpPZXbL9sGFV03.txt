You got those pet shop eyes
But honey I'm not buying
You look so cute it seems so sad
Oh stop that crying

Well honey if you was mine
I'd give you a happy home
But I must leave you behind
I got a girly of my own

Not sure that you'd get along
My girl could never betray
She wants me all to herself
And I got no reason to complain

Aaah Aaah

You got those pet shop eyes
But honey I must refrain
I'm in no position to buy
I'd better leave you to remain

You got those pet shop eyes
Honey I'm not buying
You look so pretty it's so sad
Oh stop that crying

Aaah Aaah

Pet shop eyes, oh pet shop eyes
Tryin' to [...] all the other guys
Your eyes [...], don't lie

I like to dream about what happen
If I could put you on a chain
If I could give you my everlasting love
We could share the same name
You got those pet shop eyes
Honey I'm not buying
You look so cute it seems so sad
Oh stop that crying
Aaah Aaah
