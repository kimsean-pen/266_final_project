Loose lips sink ships
So I'll keep silent.
Suggest your words stay in your mouth.
It's never ending

The cycles ascending
People keep asking

I'm not here.

I don't really think
That you've ever walked a mile in my shoes.
I don't really think

That you know what I've been through.

What I've been through
All your life

I wish you would have learned

To swallow your pride.
And stop preaching

I know what you're thinking

You're so far above me
In your mind.
All the power and glory forever
We share this together I will never
I will remember what I've become.
I'm finding out
The only thing left to lose is time.
With all these doubts
The worst parts behind me.
Don't forgive me
Please
I don't want this
Only when I'm back at home
I will
Only when I'm back at home
I will
Don't forgive me
I'll forget you
Write this on the wall.
You don't know what I've been through
I've been through
I've been through
I've been through.
