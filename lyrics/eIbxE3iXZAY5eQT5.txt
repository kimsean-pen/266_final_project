Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm ok
Someone take me home

Is this important?
Can it wait a day?
I promise I'll be there
But do you need me anyway?

I could leave this
I have control
I'm fine
That's not lip service
I talk circles all the time

But I know that you know
But I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
Nothing else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm ok
Someone take me home

I could leave this
But I don't want to
And if I fall
I hope it's not in front of you

Because I know that you know
That I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm ok
Someone take me home

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
Yeah, I'm all right
Yeah, I'm all right
Yeah, I'm all right

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm ok
Someone take me home

I'll tell you what you want to know
If you see the hole I'm sinking it
I'll tell you what you want to know
If you see the hole I'm sinking it
