I don't know much about science
my interests don't take me there
but i know this, as dumb as i am
when i was young, and it was winter
in our yard there use to be snow there
i don't know much about jesus
but i feel the need for a prayer
and my secret reason
i don't know much about power, i never learned that
but dumb as i am, i know this
in power rules the world and it's people who die, ache
who die, ache
i don't know much about saviours
but i hope that we share a prayer
in my secret reason, my secret reasons
if no one's right and no one's wrong
in between this we are learning much about evil, it's just evil
i don't know much about praying, but i feel the need for a prayer
and my secret reasons, my secret reason
face among disbelievers, face among disbelievers
