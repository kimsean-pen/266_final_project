Lemme cut on this
Anita ('nita!)
I need her (I need her!)
So flee don't flea from me
(Serving them looks cold as)
Ice cream
(Shoulders)
Chocolate (go)
GoDiva (go)
GoDiva (go)
GoDiva (go baby)

Turn up the vala-yume
This feel like hallelu-jah
Cue the choir too
I'm off the holy oil, fried like El Pollo
I got a chicken coop
Dip out, interior barbecue
I'm fly why she want the cockatoo
And that's on my bird like a beak my guy
Standing ovay how they greet my guys
Straight out the mud like a cleat no lie
Never had time for the teeter kind
On the fence like vines, wanna camouflage
Niggas hotel lobbying
Smelling like loud around republicans
Like why it ain't no niggas working? Obvious
Just hella hmm hmm, smiles and muttering
If you ain't blood to me you bothering
And if you ain't cuz to me you cluttering
And I been really tryna be mo' tolerant, mo' positive
Prolly need to switch up countries (But you know why I'm here)
I might go beast mode
Cop a couple seats out to Heathrow
Out in Shoreditch with the shit, ain't no shortage on the stick
Lil boo I know you gone

Lemme cut on this
Anita ('nita!)
I need her (I need her!)
So flee don't flea from me
(Serving them looks cold as)
Ice cream
(Shoulders)
Chocolate (go)
GoDiva (go)
GoDiva (go)
GoDiva (go baby)

"Bing!" How the spotlight beam on you
Green light, you better go (oh ah ow)
Go (oh ah ow)
"Ch-ch-ching!" How that money 'chine ring
When your feet be pavement to the gold (oh ah ow)
Gold, oh (oh ah ow, oh!)
Don't got no time for delay
Hopping around in a sack race
Bro keep that 'caine like Larenz Tate
He went overload on the Oberweis
Nigga at his lowest gave me word to wise
Told me none of this matter unless, family blessed
Watch all these niggas that beat on they chest
They flex through they stress
I guess
I been raw, It's genetic, it's my denim
I Ginuwine up on you, tryna fit up
Up in em, witcha acting innocent
Bet you're interested, stretch you like a limo
The memo, never switched or slowed the tempo
Zero gang with me every-where I go
I'm cool on, all the friendly shit
It's just business, straight across 12:30 o'clock, uh
1000 miles an hour on a spaceship, maybe we can go to space
(Now I ain't never been to Jupiter before but I- but I'll go witchu baby)
Got that mag'netic love, I can't pull out of yo Milky Way
I'm... in this bih like a implanon
I'm... breaded up like a empanada
She say "Smino I love you"
Nada girl de nada
You giving me Erykah vibes
Bah I do wanna tell you something
You make December feel summer, summer, summer
