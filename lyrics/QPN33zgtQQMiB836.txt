It's made up of lonely moments
There was always a moment there when I knew
You always gave installments
Always knew you concentrated and grew

And I believe in reinvention
Do you believe that life is holding the clue?
Take away all the lonely moments
Give me full communication with you

Your smile, shine a little light, alright
And dont hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Do you believe in reinvention?
Do you believe thar life is holding the clue?
Any way to face the silence
Any way to face the pain that kills you

Your smile shine a little light, alright
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride (Give up on your pride)
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride (Give up on your pride)

Give up on your pride, the moment's gone
Give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen I bad dream, you were gone
I got bitten on the soul, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment's gone
Give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen I bad dream, you were gone
You're bitter and cold, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment's gone
Give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen I bad dream, you were gone
You're bitter and cold, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment's gone
Give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen I bad dream, you were gone
I got bitten on the soul, my blood will run

Your smile shine a little light, alright
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light, alright
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light, alright
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light, alright
And don't hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride
