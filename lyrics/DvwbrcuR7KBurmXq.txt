Fear
Oh, don't you feel fear
Of all the stupid things
A man could feel
While his freedom rings
He squanders the deal
What am I, blind?
What took me this long?
Can't we hit rewind
On somebody's magic bong?

Come back and touch my face
Feel for fever in the night
You look into my eyes
You don't really recognize me anymore

Passed another pointless year
Foaming at the mouth
I with my hands ever up
And yours stretching out
I know I've run out of luck
This fear is a terrible drug
If I only had sense enough
To let it give way to love

Come back and touch my face
Feel for fever in the night
You look into my eyes
You don't really recognize me anymore
No, no, no
No, no
