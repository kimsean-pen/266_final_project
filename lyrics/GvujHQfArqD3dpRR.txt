Couldn't keep this message to yourself
Soundin' like a cry for help
Try to turn me into someone else, someone else
And it's more than a touch of deja vu
Cause I know what you're tryin' to do
Gotta stay one step ahead of you, ahead of you

And you say I'm playing the victim in this game we're losing together
And so you twist, insist, and turn it around
And this is it, you're like a machine always on and on repeating
So what do you want from me?
And tell me how can you break my trust if you never had it?
But you'll do what you must, becomin' a habit
On and on repeating
So what do you want from me, what do you want from me?

Can't believe that I was so blind
I won't have you messing with my mind
Cause I'm looking at you with my third eye, my third eye
And you think that you're invincible
But you're not the one who's in control
Cause you don't know what the future holds
You'll be out in the cold

And so you twist, insist, and turn it around
And this is it, you're like a machine always on and on repeating
So what do you want from me?
And tell me how can you break my trust if you never had it?
But you'll do what you must, becomin' a habit
On and on repeating
So what do you want from me, what do you want from me?

And you say I'm playing the victim in
this game we're losing together, together
And so you twist, insist, and turn it around
And this is it, you're like a machine always on and on repeating
And tell me how can you break my trust if you never had it?
But you'll do what you must, becomin' a habit
On and on repeating
So what do you want from me, what do you want from me?
