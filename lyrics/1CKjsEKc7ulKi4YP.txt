Yea now... ey

In your eyes you get me hypnotized
In your smile makes me stay awhile
In your touch, no I can't ask for much more
In your laughter has a sweet sensation after

Are you ready to receive I loving
Are you ready to receive affection
So long I've been waiting to give this to you

So I must make a stand, yeah I must take your hand
So come around don't hold me down
Youre shooting me down
Come around don't hold me down
You're shooting me down

In your smile makes me stay awhile
In your touch, no I can't ask for much more
In your laughter has a sweet sensation after

So long I've been waiting to give this to you
And now on I will make sure you know it's true
Cuz I don't wanna wait for it to be too late
So I must make a stand, yeah I must take your hand
So come around don't hold me down
Youre shooting me down
Come around don't hold me down
You're shooting me down

In your smile makes me stay awhile
