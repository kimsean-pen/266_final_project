Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine...

Where you hurt, where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
You got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
Start to sweat, so hold me tight

('Cuz) Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

Well, I'll drink what you leak and I'll smoke what you sigh
Straight across the room with a look in your eye
I got a man to his left and a girl to her right
Start to sweat, so hold me tight

('Cuz) Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine again, again

There's a tiger in the room and a baby in the closet
Pour another drink? Mom, I don't even want it!
Then I turn around and think I see someone that looks like you...

Where you hurt,
where you sleep (Sleep) and you sleep where you lie (Lie)
Now you're in deep (Deep) and now you're gonna cry (Cry)
You got a woman to your left (Left) and a boy to your right (Right)
Start to sweat so hold me tight

('Cuz) Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
But baby it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody's in my head again
Somebody mixed my medicine
again, again, again, again
again, again, again, again

Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine...
