I fell inside my hole again

I tried to figure out what's wrong with me
I felt like falling in the abyss in my mind
How do I figure out this mess that's me?
How did I end up in this hole inside of me?
I felt I knew what's going on with me
How could I not see I became inverted?
How do I find a way out of here now?
Emotions crushing everything inside of me

I fell inside my hole
Where I lay is black and cold
Feel your body fall apart
I'm never getting out of my black hole

(Out of my black hole
Never getting out
Out of my black hole
Never getting out of here
I know I will figure it out
I know I will find a way out
I know I will figure out
I know I will find a way out
I know I will
I know I will
I know I will)

I fell inside my hole
Where I lay is black and cold
Feel your body fall apart
I'm never getting out of my black hole
I fell inside my hole
Where I lay is black and cold
Feel your body fall apart
I'm never getting out of my black hole

I'm never getting out of my black hole
I'm never getting out of my black hole
I'm never getting out of my black hole
I'm never getting out of my black hole
