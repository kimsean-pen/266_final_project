There you are, yeah, you found me
Strong enough to break my sleep
Say it hurt, say you're lonely
Say I forgot to give you what you need
But I promised you gold, yet I have it hold
I was bound to, I was bound to
I couldn't give anymore, 'cause it's already yours
Look around you, look around you

So, do you remember me
In those moments just before you sleep
I know you remember me
Swear to me the memory isn't seen
Promise me
That it doesn't make your heart beat
Doesn't make your heart beat

I know you, you know me
Aw, baby, we don't even have to speak
All you hear, same as you
What you feel, feel it too
All you gotta do is read
Nothing you ever said that could drive me away
I'm inside you, I'm inside you
So if you make a mistake, let me carry your weight
I'm beside you, I'm beside you

I know you remember me
In those moments just before you sleep
I know you remember me
Swear to me the memory isn't seen
Promise me
That it doesn't make your heart beat
Doesn't make your heart beat

I'm here when you want me, when you want me
There's no place I'd rather be
You may not know it, may not know it
But it doesn't end like this, no, it doesn't end like this

I know you remember me
In those moments just before you sleep
I know you remember me
Swear to me, swear to me
You don't remember me
In those moments just before you sleep
I know you remember me
Swear to me the memory isn't seen
Promise me
That it doesn't make your heart beat
No, it doesn't make your heart beat
