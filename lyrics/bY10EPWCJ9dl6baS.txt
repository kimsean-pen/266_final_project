So load your gun
Aim for my heart
You can shoot me but you'll never leave a mark
I never dodge
I never move
The only one that's walking wounded is you

And every time you diss me
I know you really miss me
And if you don't believe it
I'll make a comeback
Expect me when you see me
I know you really need me
Pull the trigger and you'll see

[chorus]
Ooh ladidada
What can I say?
I'm like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet
Ooh ladidada
Don't push me away
Like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet

The more you push
The more you try
The more you turn it all over and around
The more you scream
The more you shout
The more I turn your volume all the way down, down, down

And every time you diss me
I know you really miss me
And if you don't believe
I'm coming back
Coming back

[chorus]
Ooh ladidada
What can I say?
I'm like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet

Ooh ladidada
Don't push me away
Like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet

I'm gonna bring it on now
(bring it on now)
I'm gonna bring it on now
(bringing it, bringing it)
I'm gonna let it all out
(let it all out)
I'm gonna let it all out, let it all out

I'm gonna bring it on now
(I'm gonna bring it on now)
I'm gonna bring it on now
(I'm gonna bring it on now)
I'm gonna let it all out
(I'm gonna let it all out)
I'm gonna let it all out, let it all out

[chorus]
Ooh ladidada
What can I say?
I'm like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet
Ooh ladidada
Don't push me away
Like a bullet, bullet
I'm gonna ricochet

I'm gonna bring it on now
I'm gonna bring it on now
(Ricochet)
I'm gonna let it all out

Ricochet!
