Pardon me for saying so but you look more pitiful
Than I have ever imagined
Despite perfect fashion
And the photographs depict you so differently
I always thought you would be, some sort of match for me

So let's decide who can survive
Stomping feet and racing beats
Of hearts that don't ever slow
Then I'll write letters on white paper
Expressing my deep disappointment

Dripping where I stand from my watery hands
Hoping to get past the open bedroom door
Where her clothes on the floor
Remind me of our conversations
The feeling of slight hesitation
To turn out the lights

14 days now since we started
To complicate the situation
I'm not hiding,
I'm just buying some time for us to find the back door
We will come out when it's safe for us

There's nothing left to say
To excuse the way that I've behaved
I still feel him gripping like a stain to this fabric
Torn in every seam
Then thrown away

(Don't believe me when I say it's over. By the time it's all uncovered)
One without regret, I will not forget
One without regret, I will not forget
Kill me.

Why should I take all the blame for my mistakes?
You were there with every promise made to break
When did you become the one without regret?
Kill me, burn me down, I swear I won't forget
When did you become the one without regret?
Kill me, burn me down, I swear I won't forget
