I section off the petrol with the metro card (Metro, metro)
Days you heard of second hand on rented heart
Cover for me, your tarp is see through, dummy
I patch like iOS and if you question, need that monthly
What a trip, never slipped
I don't miss, I go Gilbert in '06
You more like Adonal Foyle before Curry killed the Knicks
From the back, I lost my grip
Low behold, I caught up quick
Overall, I'm well equipped
Coat of arms, they rep the set
Too prideful for the charity, a blessing scorned
We just want a nigga we can root for, yeah
Cherish while a champ walk you to the door, yeah
Shekels brought on grandeur but your spirit poor
(Poor ass spirit, ayy)
Roaming true predator stare, hone in to regular gears
Regular pair of wings on your toes in the air
I dick for relief and to share
Only fair, I've had no other life
So I do not act as if yours is mine
Why do some act as if otherwise?
Why even ask? We on borrowed time
I'm not wasting ticks
Stick talk, you gon' listen
Brick stock, new edition
How it sing when it's clipping
Every scene that you're missing right here, yeah
Never leave home heavy-handed
Never take your victories for granted
When everything went just the way you planned it
This a lifestyle, not a habit
Some (Some)
Sometimes I'm nice 'cause my daddy wasn't
Just to prove points to myself, no other
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that confidence in my life
Drop my phone at the beach, let the surf in
Don't need it 'cause I'm pretty in person
Wrappin' gold 'round my neck like I'm Xerxes
Broke my phone at the beach, it was worth it
I'ma be who I be, niggas turn quick
Like they rally car racing with good splits
I could beat ya if needed, I'm certain
I don't reach, when you dribble you're aimless
There's no concern, no concern on my face (uh)
Bitch, I'm irked that you even waste (Waste)
Time on that bullshit, time on that bullshit
You know me more than anybody chooses
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that confidence in my life
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that
I bliss out when I need that confidence in my life
