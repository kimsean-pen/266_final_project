She came calling
One early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly
To tell her story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
this is how she carried on
Well I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent
But still I'm silent
When tradegy strikes at home
I know this decadence
Is shared by millions
Remember you're not alone
Remember you're not alone

Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
Maybe we can wash away those years

For we have crossed many oceans
And we've labored in between
In life there are many quotients
An I hope I find the mean

Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years

Maybe we can wash away those years
I hope that you can wash away those years
