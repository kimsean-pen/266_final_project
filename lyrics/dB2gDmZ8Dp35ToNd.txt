Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus
When I see him walking 'cross the room

"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know...

It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and
He wasn't by my side

Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell
If this is just a fling or if it's...

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If you won't be, if you won't be here (Santa, tell me)
(Santa, tell me)

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year
