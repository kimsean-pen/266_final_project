If not now, then when?
If not today,
Then, why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come,
Is as good as none.
You can wait 'til morning comes.
You can wait for the new day.
You can wait and lose this heart.
You can wait and soon be sorry.
If not now, then when?
If not today,
Then, why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come,
Is as good as none.
Now love's the only thing that's free.
We must take it where it's found.
Pretty soon it may be costly.
'Cause if not now, then when?
If not today,
Then, why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come,
Is as good as none.
If now now, what then?
We all must live our lives.
Always feeling.
Always thinking.
The moment has arrived.
If not now, then when?
