Can somebody point me in the right direction
I seem to be losing my way
Im finding it hard to keep eyes on the stars
When im hidden alone everyday
Oh but they don't know i quit twice a day
Can't go back home
Everyones watching and they hope i can be someone they say they know
But nobody tells you when you go chasing your dream
That its much harder than it seems on the screen
Fake magazine on the shelf
You're only left with yourself
Nobody's here to make friend
Killing yourself to make ends meet
I'm tired and all that i see is LA is lonely
Ive tried and ive tried to keep it open mind
But the hands on the clouds never stop
The older i am oh the quicker the
sand in the old hour glass seems to drop
Oh but they don't see i quit twice a day
But i can't leave
Everyone, all counting on me
To be who they want me to be
But nobody tells you when you go chasing your dream
That its much harder than it seems
That its much harder than it seems on the screen
Fake magazine on the shelf
You're only left with yourself
Nobody's here to make friend
Killing yourself to make ends meet
I'm tired and all that i see cause LA is lonely
But nobody tells you when you go chasing your dreams
That its much harder than it seems on the screen
Fake magazine on the shelf
You're only live with yourself
Nobody's here to make friend
Killing yourself to make ends meet
I'm tired and all that i see cause LA is lonely
Im tired in all that i've seen so LA is lonely
