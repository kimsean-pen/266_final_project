I'm cracked from my head down to my spine
Ready to self-destruct at any time
And I'm trying to convince myself
That the way I feel is all I have
It could take a lifetime
To realize that you're all right

But she said
I'd know when you would come back
It's been a summer

It's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you
Now it's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you
Without you

I would try to fix these flaws of mine
If I could just see you for one more time
And I'm trying to convince myself
That the way I feel is all I have
I don't believe in sure things
There's pain in what the truth brings

But she said
I'd know when you would come back
It's been a summer

It's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you
Now it's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you
Without you

I'd be the first one to know
If it's smart for me to just let it go
I'll be the laughing stock of all time
Person most likely to find
Deciding if it's fate that made you aviod me to this day

I'd know when you would come back
It's been a summer

It's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you

Now it's burning up in here
Even though the bed is cold on your side
I'd rather die
Then spend this night here without you
Without you
