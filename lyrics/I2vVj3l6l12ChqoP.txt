I see an ocean of green
When you look into my eyes
Make it so I'll never leave

When you wake up on the wildside

I've really come around to you
I've really come around to you
Do anything you want me to
I've really come around to you

You've got a hold on me
I feel your body taking over me
The kinda crazy like an enemy
You lock me up so there's no way out
When your love comes down
You've got a hold on me
I feel your body taking over me
The kinda crazy like an enemy
You lock me up so there's no way out
When your love comes down

I see an ocean of green
What a sight for my sore eyes
Empty emotionally
So wake me up on the wildside

I've really come around to you
I've really come around to you
Do anything you want me to
I've really come around to you

You've got a hold on me
I feel your body taking over me
The kinda crazy like an enemy
You lock me up so there's no way out
When your love comes down
You've got a hold on me
I feel your body taking over me
The kinda crazy like an enemy
You lock me up so there's no way out
When your love comes down
