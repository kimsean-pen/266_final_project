Follow me into the gutter
It's a long dark road to wher I've been hiding last summer
I fucked up a few frienships
'Cause i stoped writing back 'till my phone stoped its stupid ringing
Your friends might be right now
I'm a mess but I'll get better if you'd stop asking:

How the fuck are you doing?
How the fuck are you doing?
I turned something god
Into something bad
If you'd forgive
I'd Forget
How the fuck are you doing?

I've stopped reading your stories
'Causen I can't see you living happy ever after without me
I stopped watching movies
'Cause I can't concentrate
On anything for more then five minutes
Well I've tried my best but I'm addicted to failure

And how the fuck are you doing?
How the fuck are you doing?
I turned something god
Into something bad
If you'd forgive
I'd Forget
How the fuck are you doing?

In every saint hides a sinner
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every saint hides a sinner
Holy, holy, holy Mary

In every saint hides a sinner
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every saint hides a sinner

In every saint hides a sinner
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every saint hides a sinner
Holy, holy, holy Mary

In every saint hides a sinner
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every saint hides a sinner
Holy, holy, holy Mary

In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every fuck up a holy ghost
In every fuck up a holy ghost

Here's how the fuck I'm doing
