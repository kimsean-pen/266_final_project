Until the dark
I'm searching for my love.
Under the stars
I'm fading all apart.
My heart is stolen,
Taken away,
Like they said.
When I have found
As we stay there,
Turn the faith in love.

I see you here with me,
But I fear the day for you.
Hear, my dear:
I watch the land
And the window falling down.
I feel the pain
Inside of me like a cloud.
No one can save me,
The time will come for my death.
I think of you and wish me into an another life.
I see you here with me,
But I fear the day for you.

I see you here with me,
But I fear the day for you.
Hear, my dear...

I watch the land
And the window falling down.
I feel the pain
Inside of me like a cloud
No one can save me,
The time will come for my death.
I think of you
And wish me into another live.
I see you here with me,
But I fear the day for you.
Feel my tears.
