It's the beat
It's the beat

I get it
I got it
I know it's good
It's the beat

You want it
I got it
You know you should
It's the beat

Give me a mic and a beat
And I'll be straight
It's the beat

You know it's
One for the treble
Two for the bass
It's the beat

It's the beat

It's the beat

It's the beat

So get up out seat
It's the beat

When I get busy
Clap your hands
Move your feet
It's the beat

On the dance floor
I am a world class freak
It's the beat

Your back is to the wall
We waiting for you
It's the beat

2, 4, 6, 8
Let me see what you can do
It's the beat

It's the beat
It's the beat
It's the beat
It's the beat
It's the beat
You don't need no invitation
It's the beat
Cause this is my creation
It's the beat
So get up out ya seat
It's the beat

It's the beat

It's the beat

It's the beat
You don't need no invitation
It's the beat
Cause this is my creation
It's the beat
So get up out ya seat
It's the beat
It's the beat
