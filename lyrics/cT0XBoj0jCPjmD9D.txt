Yeah

Such haunting nightmares from past loves that tried to screw me
But you were the preacher in an exorcism movie, my love
And that corny theme song always plays when you're next to me
Like who you gonna call

The ghosts of my exes they cry
oh-oh
Cause they know that's it's their time to go-o-o-o
The ghosts of my exes they cry
oh-oh
They know that it's their time to go
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

You took my hand and walked me into my dark attic
That's where my heart was lost and frozen in a casket, my love
My soul was mummified
You helped me to unwrap it
It's you I'm gonna call

The ghosts of my exes they cry
oh-oh
Cause they know that's it's their time to go-o-o-o
The ghosts of my exes they cry
oh-oh
They know that it's their time to go
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

I've been saved (I've been saved)
Watch them all fall back into the grave (fall back into the grave)
I've been saved (I've been saved x2)
Watch them all fall back into the grave (into the grave)

Na na na...

The ghosts of my exes they cry
oh-oh
Cause they know that's it's their time to go-o-o-o...
