Are you staying awake for the liftoff, tonight?
You'll never believe the sights tonight
The sights tonight, the sights
Are you staying awake for the liftoff, tonight?
You'll never believe the sights tonight
The sights tonight

Mr. Magpie
You got distracted by the gleam of the diamonds, as you flew by
But their dull glimpse does not impress
When there's a billion stars in the sky
I see you gripping my pen like a bread-knife
As I write, I'm leaving this earth for the stars tonight
And now I'm running to board the flight

Now above we go
Into the great unknown
I like Jacques Cousteau
I give you my mind to be blown
Now above we go
Into the great unknown
Like Marcus Cicero
Well this life is whole

I'm searching far and wide to find a planet to orbit
Far and wide, I wanna scan it and explore it
Far and wide, you're my new planet to orbit
So fire up the rockets

Are you staying awake for the liftoff, tonight?
You'll never believe the sights tonight
The sights tonight, the sights
Are you staying awake for the liftoff, tonight?
You'll never believe the sights tonight
The sights tonight, the sights

Now above we go
Into the great unknown
I like Jacques Cousteau
I give you my mind to be blown
Now above we go
Into the great unknown
Like Marcus Cicero
Well this life is whole

I'm searching far and wide to find a planet to orbit
Far and wide, I wanna scan it and explore it
Far and wide, you're my new planet to orbit
So fire up the rockets

It's over now and I'm a little bit petrified
Of what's to come, yeah my head's a bit stir-fried
It's over now and I'm a little unqualified
But fire up the rockets

(I'm searching) far and wide to find a planet to orbit
Far and wide, I wanna scan it and explore it
Far and wide, you're my new planet to orbit
So fire up the rockets
