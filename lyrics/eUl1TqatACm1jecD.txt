TV playing: (Yes the dangerous black widow is to be approached with caution,
as the black widow's bite can cause death.
The black widow is easily recognized buy her coal black body and red hourglass marking.
She encases her victims with silk,
and then kills with poison from her fangs.
The male spider is not considered to be dangerous)

Hey lady killa, come right in
It's time for you, let the show begin
You're so pretty, dripping sin
(you feelin it? You feelin it?)
Your eyes are screaming, I take the stage
A fatal dance, a primal rage
You pray for me, unlock the cage
(you feelin it? You feelin it?)

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
(Eat the male, Kill, Eat the male)
I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
Love me 'til you're dead, I will not forget
You'll still love me dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)
Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)
(I-I- you feelin it?)

So here we are, make your move
We're going mad, I'll help our groove
You want control, I disapprove
(I-I- you feelin it?)
So watch me close, as I unveil
I'm stripping down, your face is pale
You are the heart, I am the nail
(I-I- you feellin it? YOU FEELIN IT?)

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
(Kills with poison, kills with poison)
I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
Love me 'til you're dead, You will not forget
You'll still love me dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)
Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)
(is dangerous. The black widow is dangerous, will readily attack several times)

Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)

Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(dead or alive, dead or alive)
