How would you feel if I walked up to you one day
And ripped your heart out?
How would you feel if I said to you
That's how I feel you're treating me
That's how I feel that you're treating me

'Cause I feel like I'm losing you
Oh, how can that be true?
I know you want me too

And how would you feel if I walked up to someone else
And ripped their heart out?
How would you feel if I said to you
That's how I feel

'Cause I feel like I'm losing you
Oh, how can that be true?
I know you want me too
Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh, how can that be true?
I know you want me too
How could you lie to me time and time again?
I'm getting tired of everything you say
But I want you anyway

Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh, how can that be true?
I know you want me too
Yeah I feel like I'm losing you
Oh, how can that be true?
I know you want me too
(Yeah)
