Take me for a ride
away from places we had known,
If I stay around I'll just remember I'm alone
There's someone in my memory making me move on,
What was grey and hazy, is black and white now I have gone.

Drive me up to London
now it's got too dark to see,
My waiting is over,
there's no visitor for me.
Never let me talk to you,
destroy the frozen past,
It's a different time now thing's are moving much to fast.

Float by today, now it's turning to grey,
Raining my doubts
let my thoughts slip away.
You must have something and
what it is I don't know,
You must have something 'cause I can't let you go
