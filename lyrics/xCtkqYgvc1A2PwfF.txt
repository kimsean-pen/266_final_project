All of this time
I guess I wish that I had time to say goodbye
She is a ruby and I liked red
Until I disappeared a little too well.

I guess I should have kissed her
That one night when she was leaning in
I guess, I should a lot of things, huh?

But Maurine,
I can't come to your party 'cause I think that I'm dead.

All through the tunnel and onto the tram
I wonder what it's like when your hands stop their shaking
It's as cloudy as I dreamt it would be
It's as empty as I thought it would be

I hope it goes well
And I hope you dance good
I hope you get presents that make you pretty happy
And I hope you grow old
And I hope that you find somebody nice

But Maurine,
I can't come to your party 'cause I think that I'm dead.
