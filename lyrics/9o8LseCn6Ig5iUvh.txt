All I needed was the medicine
And you came knocking like a doctor
Give me the pill to take away the poison
Erase the writing on the wall

You stuck a needle right into the vein
You let me take it like a soldier
And for a while I could ignore the pain
oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

My hands are tied
Behind my back
I'm paralyzed
My heart attacks

It seemed to me
You were the one
Turns out
You shot me up for fun

Thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

Yeah but you thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

I was devastated by the pain
But now I couldn't call the doctor
Gotta stop the forces in my brain
Gotta read the writing on the wall

It isn't easy getting in the vein
When you're doing it alone
No one to tighten up the tourniquet
oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

My hands are tied
Behind my back
I'm paralyzed
My heart attacks

I'm screaming
Begging for the one
That won't just shoot me up for fun

Thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

Yeah but you thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)

(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)

You leave me hanging out here
for so long, when will I catch my breath?
You leave me hanging out here
for so long, when will I catch my breath?

Thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

Yeah but you thought you got away with murder
Left me at a loss for the words
Just wait until I catch my breath
Wait until I catch my breath

(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)

(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)
(wait until I CATCH my breath)
