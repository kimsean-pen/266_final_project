"They're going wild," the call came in
At early morning pre-dawn, then
"The followers of chaos out of control

They're numbering the monkeys
The monkeys and the monkeys,"
The followers of chaos out of control

The call came in to Party Central
"Meeting of the green and simple,"
Try to tell us something we don't know.

"They're meeting at the monument,"
The call came in the monument
To liberty and honor under the honor roll

"They've gathered up the cages, the cages and courageous,"
The followers of chaos out of control.
The call came in to Party Central

"Meeting of the green and simple,"
Try to tell us something we don't know.
"Disturbance at the Heron House"

A stampede at the monument
To liberty and honor under the honor roll
The gathering of grunts and greens

Cogs and grunts and hirelings
A meeting of a mean idea to hold
"When feeding time has come and gone
They'll lose the heart and head for home
Try to tell us something we don't know"
We don't know
Everyone allowed
Everyone allowed
Everyone allowed
