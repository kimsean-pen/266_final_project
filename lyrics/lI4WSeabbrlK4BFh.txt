You've been
With me
A year to the day;
Three hundred
And sixty
Five days watching me decay

We used to talk about girls who play guitars
We used to talk about plans in tiny bars

In the gaps
Between words
Are the things that really intrigue me.
It's the gasps
And the sighs
That say more about what's inside you

We used to climb aboard our high horse every time
We used to talk about boys with missing spines

It's her life and life worth living.
It's her life
It never struck her to pause for one minute
It's her life

The path
Of excess
Just led to boredom
You live
You life
With your mouth wide open...

It's her life and a life worth living.
It's her life
It never struck her to pause for one minute
It's her life

When you lie on my bed and you label me your friend.
Don't you know how much that hurts?

You could pretend and I wouldn't know
I could be who you wanted in the dark

She goes out
She gets drunk
She gets off
She goes home
She gives in

She goes out
She gets drunk
She gets off
She goes home
She gives in

It's her life and a life worth living
It's her life
I neve struck her to pause for one minute
It's her life
And a life is worth living

We used to talk about girls who play guitars
