I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
Too many obligations, I'm trying to keep
Gotta please everybody, except for myself
But like Levon said: ain't in it for my health
Everyone it's no hurt no pain but
A little pain, never hurt anyone
A little pain, never hurt anyone
I come home, I gotta leave
My reality is only make believe
Someone said it's one or the other but
I'm breaking my back and working like a mother
Who's to say just how it's done?
A little pain, never hurt anyone
A little pain, never hurt anyone
A little pain, never hurt anyone...
Baby slow down then hurry up quick
I feel so good that it's making me sick
And I didn't mean to call your phone,
I said I like you the best when I'm all alone
It's been real but I gotta run
A little pain, never hurt anyone
A little pain, never hurt anyone
A little pain, never hurt anyone
Little pain
Little pain
Never hurt anyone...
