Full moon rising
Full moon rising
Don't give away your secrets
Don't give away your secrets

'Cause we all know where this goes
Yeah, we all know the answer
And we all know the antidote
Yeah, nobody knows it better

Full moon rising
Full moon rising
And it walks on water
Talks on water

But the fire started years ago
And we've all seen the embers
But the fire ain't gonna slow

Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away

Full moon rising
(And what did you say)
Holding on for morning
(When you went away)
But the sky is silver
(An immaculate dream)
And I could not forget her
(Nothing as it seems)

So we called Michelangelo
(We walked through the land)
'Cause we all want answers
(The river and the streams)
Maybe he knows the antidote

Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away

Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, don't walk away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
