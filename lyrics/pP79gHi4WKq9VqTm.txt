Yeah-yeah
Whoa...

Oh...
Yeah...
Yeah yeah yeah

It's like your blood runs through me baby
(Baby)
And I can't get you out of my vein
A lust for you electric lady
(Whoa...)
The affliction to my pain

And the skies will fall
Without you I'm inside of a hurricane
I would sell my soul
No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no

I need mercy It's the insanity eating up the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fire's, my burning desire's, for you, see
I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you with them, oh no
I need mercy
I pray one day that you will be with me, girl, I would never let you go

I...
Bloodshot eyes and I'm so wasted
Why...
Why do I fight when I can't make it

I'm at the end of my rope, baby
(Whoa...)
I'm pulled apart from all the strain

I would break the law
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't take
I would sell my soul
But I can't, but I can't, but I can't, no 'cause

I need mercy
It's the insanity eating up the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fire's, my burning desire's, for you, see
I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you with them, oh no
I need mercy
I pray one day that you will be with me, girl, I would never let you go

For you girl I would sell my soul
I would even break the law
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't take, oh yeah

And even if the skies would fall
I pray to God you'll hear my song
Without you I'm inside the hurricane

I need mercy It's the insanity eating out the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fire, my burning desires
I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you with them, oh no
I need mercy
(Oh no)
I pray one day that you will be with me, girl, I would never let you go

Oh no-no
No-no-no no no
Yeah...

I need mercy
I need mercy
I need mercy
I pray to God I'd hold you again
I need mercy
Mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy mercy
I need mercy
Mery mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy mercy
I need mercy
Mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy mercy
I need mercy
Mery mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy mercy
I need mercy
Mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy mercy
I need mercy
Mery mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy mercy me, yeah
