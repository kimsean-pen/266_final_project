I learned quite a lot
Shooting through my mind
Things I never guessed at before

And so I decided
To leave my old life behind
I don't need it anymore

I'm gonna learn to climb the clouds
I'm gonna learn to climb the wind
I wont stop til Ive understood the dark

I'm gonna learn to fly the clouds
I'm gonna understand the air
My mind will listen to the stars

To everyone else I appear quite the same
And I help them as much as I can

But they'll never know that my mind is in the air
O how could they ever understand

I'm gonna learn to climb the clouds
I'm gonna pull upon the rain
I'll learn what lies beneath the earth

I'm gonna learn to climb the clouds
I'm gonna understand the space
I'll even go back beyond birth
