Just keep pouring I'll say when
Walk me further in
Lose the weight that's in these bones
Fly like skipping stones
Cross the surface of the water
Till its arms enfold

These drifts of blue
My gift to you
My gift to you
These drifts of blue
These wild drifts of blue

Now the nest has taken wing
And the tree might sing
I'm the ghost of Christmas past
Peeking through the glass
Like an arrow finds its target
It comes back to me

These thoughts all skewed
My gift to you
My gift to you

What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know
What we don't know

What we don't know it can't hurt us baby
What we don't know sure can't hurt us baby
What we don't know it can't hurt us baby
What we don't know sure can't hurt us baby
