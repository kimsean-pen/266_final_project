Bittersweet comes a comfort
In the dark
Like a soothing fall feels
When summer's gone
With its cold winter ties
The sun shines on
Breathe like you're fine
Just somehow
Even cold winter days come bright

She's doing quite alright without me
Love is a lion looking down
Like the city lights are cold
And streets are empty
She's doing quite alright without me

I know time is going to heal your soul
She prayed
Try to lay it down
And think it over again
But my heart came undone
So long ago

She's doing quite alright without me
And pride is a lonely way to die
Like the city lights are cold
And streets are empty
She's doing quite alright without me

Breathe like you don't remember
Breathe these cold winter days to life

Don't waste your better days
Head away from me
Go the other way
No
I don't want to be
Stealing your history
Either way there's conflict
Loss and pain

She's doing quite alright without me
And pride is a lonely way to die
Like the city lights are cold
And streets are empty
Out of the dark
These shades are haunting me
Ever around
Always around
They're doing quite alright without me
