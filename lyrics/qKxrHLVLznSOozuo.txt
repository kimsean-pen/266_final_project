Great times are coming
Coming down the boulevard
Coming down your avenue
I can see it from a bird's eye view
Great times are coming
Coming to your ghetto too
Coming down the avenue
I can see it form a bird's eye view

Here come the good times yeah
Let the good times just roll, in
We ain't got no time to be slow-in'
Bring 'em on, bring the good times
Let the good times just roll, in
We ain't got no time to be slow-in'
Bring 'em on, bring the good times (hey)

I'm fired up and ready to go
Lit the fuse, I'm about to blow
On the top, come from the low
Plant the seed, Imma watch it grow
Got big dreams like Dr King
Big things to the extremes
I'm a tech feign, checking
Knowledge up on this 'stein
Bread to stack, president's black
Came from the hood, now I'm headed back
To get my people out the trap
Get my people out the trap

We're saying ay-o
If you 'bout that bullshi' get out my way-o
I'm about to do it, do it big, that's the way it go
'Cause baby, I just wanna live my life

Great times are coming
Coming down the boulevard
Coming down your avenue
I can see it from a bird's eye view

Here come the good times
Let the good times just roll, in
We ain't got no time to be slow-in'
Bring 'em on, bring the good times
Let the good times just roll, in
We ain't got no time to be slow-in'
Bring 'em on, bring the good times

I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope you're ready
I see them coming around
I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope you're ready
I see them coming around
