im the kind of girl buses splash with rain
im the kind of girl buses splash with rain
look mom i'm hobbling through
i am gonna be a painter too
i make my canteen so heavy
as if i need anymore water today

but we are not young and this isn't a party

i guess i should leave this party with little bear
im the kind of girl who doesn't care

cause we are not young
and this isnt a party
with a shy grin
and a silent tip of a forty
