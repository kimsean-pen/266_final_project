Tanin'iver Liftoach Nia!

Tanin'iver open your eyes
Hear the cries of aeons rising
To pierce the tyrant's blinding lies
Crush the barriers, crack your shell
Turn the forbidden inner keys
Dynamic overload to serve the wrath
Of my merciless release

Charged with fury - Streaming forth - Acausal energy
Microchaos - Reinforced in concealed purgatory

Black - The flame I bear inside
Black - The flame that never died
Awakened by my will to power
Awaken me to ride the Internal Fire

I am the One to set my spirit free
666
The beast shall break its chains of cosmic tyranny
Internal burst - Electric sight
Atazoth!
Increasing flames of alchemy
Blackest flash - Infernal light
Ignites my soul with flames of ecstasy

Rise with your formless fires
Through the seven gates
Reclaim your sight
That brilliant eye
In rage it liberates

Black - The flame that burns inside
Black - The flame will never die
Awakened by my will to power
Elevate me to ride the Internal Fire

Napalm blood is burning in my veins
The ripping bliss of one thousand pains
Cleanse me from the haze of illusion
In the shining abyss of dissolution

Tanin'iver Liftoach Nia!

Black - The flame that burns inside
Black - The flame that never died
Tanin'iver - The serpent power is rising up my spine
Black - The flame I bear inside
Black - The flame shall never die
It will burn to ash the cosmic lie
Awaken me to ride the Internal Fire
