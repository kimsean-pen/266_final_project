This ain't a test, fuck the rest
Time to set the record straight
Talk your shit behind my back
I dare you say it to my face
I've heard the words fall out your lips
You little tricky fuckin' bitch
The time has come to get you some
'Cause I just do not give a shit

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me you're just a cancer
Motherfucker
War is the answer

As of now the end begins
I want to laugh but there's no joke
To eat with the beast
And run with the wolves
On the ashes you must choke
I know it's got to chap your ass
To think I just won't go away
Forget me not, I'm writing you off
I've got nothing more to say

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
To me you're just a cancer
Motherfucker
War is the answer
Get some

You wanna disrespect me you little fucking punk?
Everything I've done
And who I am
As far as I've fucking come
I'll slap you so fucking hard
It'll feel like you kissed a freight train
Fuck you

Burn
Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
Talk your shit behind my back
See to me you're just a cancer
The time has come to get you some
Motherfucker
War is the Answer
Yeah
