Where's my girl, where has she gone
She once was beautiful and innocent
I can't believe in what she says
I look at her and she looked the other way

Disconnected from feeling all right
Disconnected and it ain't black and white
Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove
Disconnected from the country I love

I remember you when you we young and strong
In your summer dress and legs so long
My memories are only for me
I prefer them to reality

Disconnected from feeling all right
Disconnected and it ain't black and white
Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove
Disconnected from the country I love

You think it's over, but you better think again
Neither grace nor sweetness, just malicious intent
It's you and me baby, so we better watch our back
'Cause if we are standing together, we ain't never gonna crack

And we took the Greyhound into the night
With the city on the left and the country on the right
And I knew when I saw you, I read it in your eyes
I heard your voice break when we're trying not to die

Disconnected from feeling all right
Disconnected and it ain't black and white
Disconnected, there's a sword through the dove
Disconnected from the country I love

Disconnected, disconnected, disconnected
Disconnected from the country I love
