It's everything that I seem to ignore:
The classroom that I treated as a bore,
The pocketbook I say I never I saw,
The hearts I stole, and I'm never caught...

The bed I woke up in that's not my own,
The makeup I applied two days ago,
The night I lost my phone on the way home,
The taxi ride, I don't know where I'm going...

Oh, oh, oh...

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na...
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na...
Oh, I can't help it, baby...
Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah...

And still, I try to pull you into my own hurricane;
It's like you spot me trying from a thousand miles away...
I look down on you so deep down, I know that we're the same...
It's stupid thinking that you were one to come play my game...

Tell me what's wrong;
No, I can't tell you what's wrong...
I can't tell you what's wrong...
I can't tell you what's wrong...

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo, yeah...
I can't tell you, baby...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo...
I-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo...

Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh-ooh-ooh...

Wa-ha-ha-ha, ha, ha, ha...
Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha... hoo, hoo, ah-ha...
Ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-whoo, ooh-whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
Ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh!
Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh!
(Ooh, ooh, ooh...)
