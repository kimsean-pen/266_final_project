The platform on the ocean
I hear the sound of the white caps
Out on the platform on the ocean
I hear the sound of the white caps
Out on the ocean
I hear the sound of the white caps
Out on the platform
The platform on the ocean
I hear the sound of the white caps
Out on the platform on the ocean
High above the waves, the different waves
I looked out I saw the fish
Overnight platform
Overnight wave
I looked down I saw the fish
Which way its tail was pointing and why
I looked down and saw the fish
Close as I came
I looked down, saw the fish
On the wood platform
I looked down I saw the fish
Close as I came
Overnight platform, overnight wave
I looked down and saw the fish, its over I see it
Wide angle, wide angle in a bite
