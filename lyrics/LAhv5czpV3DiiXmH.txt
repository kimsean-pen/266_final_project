Walking alone and dreaming
Dreaming about somebody new
Hoping he's dreaming about somebody too
Walking alone and hoping
I'm gonna spend time with you
Hoping that he is kinda hoping too

It's a day just like every other
In the movie that you call world
When the most exciting, warm vibrating, giving loving man
I've ever seen comes right into view

Walking alone and thinking
Thinking about what I can do
And how I 'm gonna make a friend of you
Walking alone and thinking
Thinking about get through
And how I'm gonna make a friend of you
I come on with an office question
Start to make a fool of myself
He just goes on giving that warm vibrating, giving loving smile
To keep couraging me, all along away
Walking alone together
Thinking about things we could do
Hoping he's thinking 'bout same things too
Walking alone and dreaming
Dreaming about somebody new
Hoping he's dreaming about somebody too...
