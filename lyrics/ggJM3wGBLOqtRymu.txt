Why you hanging in the background
Like a painting that's been turned 'round
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Why you humming with your mouth shut
It's like Aretha singing backup
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You know the words, go write your song

Make it loud
It's your time now
Can you feel it now?

You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it

And let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
You feel it burn when you're knocked down
But let the fire be your crown
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
So go and claim your kingdom
Then slay all your demons

Come on, come on, come on, come on
I know you know where you belong
Don't look now

But you're off the ground
Can you feel it now?
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise

Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

Let's see you show how high you can go
Flying right past the ones who said no
Let's give them all one hell of a show
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

You got the heart of a phoenix
Let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, heart of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, heart of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart

You got the heart of a, heart of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, heart of a...
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
