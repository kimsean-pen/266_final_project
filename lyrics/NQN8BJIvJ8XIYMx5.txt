Race
Life's a race
And I am gonna win
Yes, I am gonna win
And I'll light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes
You won't pull ahead
I'll keep up the pace
And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race

Yes, I am prepared
To stay alive
I won't forgive, the vengeance is mine
And I won't give in
Because I choose to thrive
Yeah, I'm gonna win!

Race

And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race
Yes, I'm gonna win!
