Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming

If I'm dreaming
Then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

If I'm dreaming
Just leave me on my own
Turn off the lights
And unplug the phone

I can't get over
The fact that I'm with you
Now that I have you
I don't know what to do

Girl, if I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout you
About the things
That I like to do

Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights
And unplug the phone

I've been waiting
For such a long time
For you to say
That you would be mine

Now that you're here
Here by my side
I can't control the way
That I feel inside

Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

If I'm dreaming
Just leave me alone
Turn off the lights
And unplug the phone

If I'm dreaming about you
Let's make this dream true
If I'm dreaming about you
Let's make this dream of love come true

Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

If I'm dreaming
Just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

If I'm dreaming
Then leave me alone
Turn off the lights
And unplug the phone

If I'm dreaming
Then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

This dream is just
Just you and me

If I'm dreaming, ooh hoo
I can't sleep dreaming about you
(Dreaming, dreaming)

If I'm dreaming
Then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up
Till my dream is complete

If I'm dreaming
Then leave me alone
Turn off the lights
And unplug the phone

If I'm dreaming
If I'm dreaming
If I'm dreaming
