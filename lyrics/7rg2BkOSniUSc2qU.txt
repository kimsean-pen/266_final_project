Do you see me?
Do you see what I've become?
I'm not the same beast
I leave a scar on all I touch
You think you know me now
Is it better than I know myself?
I know it hurts like hell
Admitting just how you've misjudged
All my life I've been told the same old
Don't step out, don't test the mould
We know your kind, yeah, we know you
So much better than you know yourself
See, the ones that won't engage me
Are the same trying to cage me
But I can't sit still, and I won't be tame
When the lights go out, better know your enemy

'Cause I've spent a lifetime shadowboxing with death
And we'll dance with the Devil till there's no songs left

So do you see me?
Do you see what I've become?
I'm not the same beast, no
I leave a scar on all I touch
You think you know me now
Is it better than I know myself?
I know it hurts like hell
Admitting just how you've misjudged
You don't know me, you cannot own me
The path I'm on don't fit the old me
I bare my soul as I keep evolving
And I chase this taste for blood
See, I learned real young, don't seek no gold
Trust no fool, and you won't get sold
I never feared the dark, no, I just became it
When the lights go dead, you better pray you're safe, kid

'Cause I've spent a lifetime shadowboxing with death
And we'll dance with the Devil till there's no songs left
I try to keep my cool and not let this hate win
I find this mask I wear can't keep the darkness in

The world you know was born to fade
We'll dance upon its grave

You don't know me, you cannot hold me
You should've guessed that you can't control me
I raise my soul like a private army
And I steel myself for war
'Cause I learned real young when you walk through hell
The Devil can't buy what you won't sell
So I took my fear, reshaped and aimed
'Cause when the night caves in, no one will save you

So we'll dance with the devil till there's no songs left
I try to keep my cool and not let this hate win
I find this mask I wear can't keep the darkness in
This mask I wear can't keep the darkness in
