So long sweet summer,
I stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays.
So long sweet summer,
I fell into you now you're gracefully falling away.

Hey thanks, thanks for that summer.
It's cold where you're going, I hope that your heart's always warm.
I gave you the best,
I gave you the best that I had.
You passed on the letters and passed on the best that I had.

So long sweet summer,
I stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays.
So long sweet summer,
I fell into you now you're gracefully falling away.

I hate the winter in Lexington,
I hate the winter in Lexington.
