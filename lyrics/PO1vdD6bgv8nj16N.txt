The saviors are all we seek
Through cracked lips we speak
Of who we used to be
It's the reason we wait for the world to survive
The meaning behind every word that we write
It's time that we started living

This is the only thing left to reality on and feel alive
This is the night in the dark we set it all
We set it a light
Then we're left in the quiet to live a lie
This is the night

It's the reason we wait for the world to survive
The meaning behind every word that we write
This is the night

This is the only thing left to reality on and feel alive
This is the night in the dark we set it all
We set it a light
Then we're left in the quiet to live a lie
This is the night

The light is in line with the life we created, we walk elucidated
The light is in line with the life we created, we walk elucidated

This is the only thing left to reality on and feel alive
This is the night in the dark we set it all
We set it a light
Then we're left in the quiet to live a lie
This is the night
