Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back, ohhhhh
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back

Don't even know what we fighting for
Damn I need a minute, so baby keep your distance
Heard it all, so I'mma just go

Don't bother waiting up, I just need some time alone
Damn where the hell are my keys
I just wanna leave, get in my car, and I'mma just drive, all night
Turn off my phone, radio on, and drive
So I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can't even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Hey baby, I'm back and I calmed down
I'm done with all the cursing
I came to give you a little something
You got me screaming for a different reason now
Why we break stuff turn it up
Neighbors hear you loving me down all night
(Damn) Where the hell are my clothes, I don't wanna go
But it's getting late, so I'm just drive all night
Moving real slow, radio low, just drive
So why I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can't even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Who I think I'm fooling anyway?
Drive around the block just come right back to you
When all along I knew
I should have stayed right where I was in steady love
Instead of drive and think of you
So why I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
'Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can't even deny
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
I've been thinking about you all the way home

Oh oh (Oh oh)
Oh oh (Oh)
I'mma turn right back babe, I'mma come right back to you
Oh
I'mma turn right back babe, I'mma come right back to you
