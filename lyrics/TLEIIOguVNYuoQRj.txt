Shameless sea
Aimlessly so blue
Midnight moon shines for you

Still marooned
Silence drifting through
Nowhere to choose, just blue

Ceaselessly
Star-crossed you and me
Save our souls, we'll be forever blue

Waves roll, lift us in blue
Drift us, seep right through
Color us blue

Wait for me
Shameless you, the sea
Soon the blue, so soon
Soon the blue, so soon
