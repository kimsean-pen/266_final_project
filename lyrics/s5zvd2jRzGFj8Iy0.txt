I forget
just like a kid
cant see straight
Im tired, Im alone

kiss untill
These arguments
Back and forth
I will cut them down my head is through the ceiling

Going up up up up up up ahuuah
Going up up up up up up ahuuah

I forget
just like a kid
I cant see straight
Im tired, Im alone

Kiss untill
These arguments
Back and forth
I will cut them down my head is through the ceiling

Going up up up up up up ahuuah
Going up up up up up up ahuuah
