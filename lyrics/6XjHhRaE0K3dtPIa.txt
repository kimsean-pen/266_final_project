I got a light building up inside of my head
But I'm goin' nowhere down these streets instead
It's a rain swept night I've been travelling far
Know I think I've gone down this road before, yes, I have
Mmm, I got hungry eyes and they're searching for someone like you
But I can only see the graveyard dancers
Who lead me down, down into the abyss
Lady of the dark star, won't you give me your sweet kiss?
Cause far a way in the night, I can sense your smile
I'm hearin' you laugh and I'm cryin' all of the while
I don't know why I need to touch you again, and again, and again
All my farthest dreams, I think you can mend
Lady of the dark star, I love you again
And we'll go on together in our caravan of sin
Why don't you let the wheel turn it can take us so far?
But, please, won't you let me live, lady of the dark star, yeah
