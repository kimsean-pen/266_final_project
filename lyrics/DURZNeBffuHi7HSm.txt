Dark Vibes

We fail to connect
The same old rituals
Face to face
The routine survivor

When strategies fall
Avoiding the eyes
The handshake is trivial
And hollow the words

Is this the point in time
You've waited for?
Is this the pain
You promised me?

Forgotten the liars
Who told you before...
How bitter you are
Undone and revealed:
The past will last

Fruits of evolution
The state of things
Here we are
Here we remain
Today is the day

The heat makes you sweat
Your mouth is dry
You wish you could run
Back th your safety zone
Sit back and breathe
Make it all go
Make them all go
Leave me behind
