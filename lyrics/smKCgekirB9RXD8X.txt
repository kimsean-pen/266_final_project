Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
Suicide
Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
Suicide
Suicide
Slip 'n' slide
Your eyes are wide
Tongue-tied
You slip 'n' slide
Shut tight
Slip 'n' slide
Read the line
The underlined
Slow down
Ease your mind
Time to find
Another ride
Another ride
Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
Suicide
Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
Suicide
Suicide
Look right
Slip 'n' slide
Time flies
You slip 'n' slide
Leave now
Be left behind
Time to find
Another ride
Slow down
Ease your mind
Time to find
Another ride
Another ride
Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
Suicide
Drop that rhythm and you unwind
Keep that feeling and you step in time
All too pretty for a real life
