Her heart, is racing,
And the room is heating up.
And her eyes, are glazing,
But she still can't get enough.

The beat is pumping, now she's blowing up (blowing up)
The last thing on her mind is growing up (growing up)
She'll kiss the sky before she's giving up (giving up)
And oh, oh here she comes.

She's dancing with the stars,
Living in the sky with diamonds.
She's dancing with the stars,
And oh, how the lights are shining.
She has the key in her hand,
Reflection in the moon's the best thing.
She's dancing with the stars, the stars,
Keep dancing.

You can't, change her,
Cause you know you think it's hot.
And that girl, loves danger,
But she don't know when to stop.

The beat is pumping, now she's blowing up (blowing up)
The last thing on her mind is growing up (growing up)
She'll kiss the sky before she's giving up (giving up)
And oh, oh here she comes.

She's dancing with the stars,
Living in the sky with diamonds.
She's dancing with the stars,
And oh, how the lights are shining.
She has the key in her hand,
Reflection in the moon's the best thing.
She's dancing with the stars, the stars,
Keep dancing.

Gonna get you somehow,
You're gonna talk of the town.
Losing control now,
And I won't come back down.
And I hope you come down.

She's dancing with the stars,
Living in the sky with diamonds.
She's dancing with the stars,
And oh, how the lights are shining.
She has the key in her hand,
Reflection in the moon's the best thing.
She's dancing with the stars, the stars,
Keep dancing.

She's dancing with the stars,
Living in the sky with diamonds.
She's dancing with the stars,
And oh, how the lights are shining.
She has the key in her hand,
Reflection in the moon's the best thing.
She's dancing with the stars, the stars,
Keep dancing.
