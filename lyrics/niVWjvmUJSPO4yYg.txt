I'm feeling you like an old school instrumental
I'm getting in the mood, and feeling sentimental
The way you look at me, no, it ain't accidental
Though I ain't clear if it's real, or if you've hit me central
Cause I'm not the type to automatically get complicated
Though your time and affection show nuff appreciated
I understand, real love is underestimated
For such a blessing, gotta know that I really waited
Really waited

Just can't call it love, no baby no, no baby no
Just can't call it love, no baby no, no baby no

Chemistry is dynamite, like Vogel bread and Marmite
But what if we collide like Superman and kryptonite?
Opposite ends, baby of the periodic table
Molecules, when joined, becoming unstable
But I'm not the type to straight jump into the deep end
Though I am feeling you, I cannot pretend
Oh no, I cannot pretend

Just can't call it love, no baby no, no baby no
Just can't call it love, no baby no, no baby no
