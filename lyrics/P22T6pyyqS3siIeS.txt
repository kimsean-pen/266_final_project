You made me smile, dear
Now I never do when I'm alone
Pulling on a thread of life
Just to see what unravels this time,
My love's a clone...
Once upon a time there was a boy who wrote a fairytale
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Where everything would go wrong
And one day then...
He found a girl he fell in love with
Who thought forever is only a myth
They lived the fairytale, prophecy
And since slowly grew apart, but...
One, two, three, one, two, three
She was dancing on their wedding day
Hiding deep the secret in her heart...
Till death do us apart
There's no sign of the love I found
In your heart, no more, no love, no wonder
You have tried to evade my touch,
It is plain to see we're done, my weakness
When snow falls on the ruins once more
You're still acting like a madonna
That you are not
I can hurt you now...
I know the pain, you're already crushing me
By kissing me now...
You never should have loved me
Cause maybe my heart is made of stone
But still I wonder...
If our once forever is done,
Then, leave me.
In the light of the restless night
You fell asleep with the wound, forgot to bleed
For me, won't you bleed for me
For the love, one drop, not more, my weakness
Snow must fall on the ruins once more
If you wish to see it end, you'll have to
Paint your lips with the blood-red tar of my broken heart
Blood-red tar of a broken heart
The taste wears off, leaves a tainted scar...
I am nailed down on the wheel of torment
Spin me again, celebrate ends advent
Beautifully rust, my pain of sadness
Following your bread crumb trail to my madness
The darkest acres of human hearts are
Lit by the cinders of lost perfection
Once in a life time love, affection
Withering tree, most violent passion...
Once upon a time there was a man who lived his
Fairytale
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
And everything did go wrong
And one day then...
He lost the girl he fell in love with
She proved forever is only a myth
They lived the fairytale, prophecy
And were slowly torn apart
He is nailed down on the wheel of torment
Spin him again, celebrate ends advent
Beautifully rusting pain of sadness
Following her bread crumb trail to his madness
The darkest acres of human hearts are
Lit by the cinders of lost perfection
Once in a life time love, affection
Withering tree, the most violent passion...
You made him smile, dear
Now he never does, 'cause he's alone
Hanging on a thread of life
Just to see what'll save him now,
He wonders
You were like a siren,
Living on the island of his love
A drought in the chalice of life, so bitter
He knew it would kill him one day
Once upon a time there was a boy who wrote a
Fairytale,
Ding, dong, ding, dong,
Where everything would go wrong
Seems that he has found you now, so break the seal
And read the card
Ding, dong, ding, dong
"Until death has done us apart."
