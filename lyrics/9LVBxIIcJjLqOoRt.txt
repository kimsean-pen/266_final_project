I came through the backyard
You let the garden die
How did I get here
How did I get here
What did I do to deserve this

The mountain was taller than I could've fathomed
I hardly believe it from here at the bottom
I can't imagine why you'd want to be at the top
Oh my god, what will I do if you ever stop

Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
