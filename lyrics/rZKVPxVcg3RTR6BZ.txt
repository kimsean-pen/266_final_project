I said,? Why do I always
Have to spell it out from you?
Your story is always changing
We change it to hide the pain

And when the truth rears its ugly head
It's all too late
Too late for the omission that you kept inside
Wish it wasn't you

Does it seem like the same man?
Doesn't seem the same at all
I can feel myself fall
Falling down

You can wave goodbye to your bad side
Suppress the stories that could hurt your mind
There's no need for lies
If the news ain't breaking

Framework falling down on the downside
Built on a weak spot
Facts hiding in your mind
Waiting 'til the bomb drops

We have more sense than lies
The story's in our eyes

Does it seem like the same man?
Doesn't seem the same at all
I can feel myself fall

Falling down on the downside
Built on a weak spot
Facts hiding in your mind
Waiting 'til the bomb drops

It doesn't seem like the same man
Doesn't seem the same at all
I can feel myself fall
Falling down
