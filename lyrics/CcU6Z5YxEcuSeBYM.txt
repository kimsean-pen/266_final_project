The Autumn leaves were falling
Hearing nature talking
I thought I heard her calling
Hush now don't you cry
Figure in the sky

Can't stop myself from shaking
My mind at last is waking
Eight minds embracing
Figures in the sky

Hadn't time to analyse
What I saw before my eyes
But nothing would surprise me
Here on our beach
Far away from you all

I thought I heard her calling

Unsure of what we're facing
The precious time we're wasting
I'll always be embracing
Figures in the sky
