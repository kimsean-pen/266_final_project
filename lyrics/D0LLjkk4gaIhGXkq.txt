Hey scum, hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone?
Hey scum, hey scum
What are you gonna do when karma comes

A-calling, and you're falling
And there's nowhere left to run
And you're weeping, and not sleeping
And you're begging for your gun

Pull the trigger

Hey scum, hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone?
Hey scum, hey scum
What are you doing judgement time has come?

You kneel, and you squeal
And you're looking for someone
To bear witness to your goodness
You can't even find your son

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

You wouldn't even offer up your crumbs
To the dying, and the crying
You're dead inside, you're numb
You're hollow, and shallow
Your empty life is done

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
(Hey scum, hey scum)
Pull the trigger
(Hey scum, hey scum)
Pull the trigger
