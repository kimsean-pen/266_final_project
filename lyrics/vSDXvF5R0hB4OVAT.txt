I've got this headache
Never ending
I'm taken over
By the cold dark nothing
Sharp piercing images
A strange familiarity
Parodies
Clouding up your memory
Give into me
The constant chatter
Filling my thoughts with hate
All reassuring me
It's just too late
Nothing but black and gray
Never any other shade

Disarray
Nothing left to contemplate
No escape

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite
Of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

I used to have a name
But I can't even
Remember the first letter
Visions defiantly
Always mouth it to me
Silently
Parodies
Clouding up your memory
Give into me
Waves of static
Nerves
Fear and panic
As quickly as they came
They vanish
Nothing but black and gray
Every single fucking day

Disarray
Nothing left to contemplate
No escape

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite
Of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite
Of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

I've got this headache
Never ending
I'm taken over
By the cold dark nothing
Sharp piercing images
A strange familiarity
I don't want to live this way
Chained up inside this cage
This heart's turned to stone
Rip my flesh from my bones
Let me fade away

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite
Of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time

Nothing can satisfy
The appetite
Of the beast inside
Nothing's going to save your life
You can't run this time
