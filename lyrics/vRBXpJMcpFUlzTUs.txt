If the night is
over by the
morning I will be

Want to tell you
I forgive you
your monstrosity

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that the night is over
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that you're far from sober

If the night is
over by the
morning I will be

Want to tell you
I forgive you
your monstrosity

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that the night is over
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that you're far from sober

If the morning comes
if the morning comes
if the morning comes,
i'll be here forever

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that the night is over
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me that you're far from sober

If the morning comes
if the morning comes
if the morning comes,
i'll be here forever
