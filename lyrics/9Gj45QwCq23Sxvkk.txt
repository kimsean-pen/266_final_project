Mama
Didn't raise no fool
I said, mama
She watching girls like you
You will never catch me slipping
You will never catch me sleep
Girl you must be tripping
Trying to run around on me
Oh, mama
Didn't raise no fool, didn't raise no

You the type that Kanye told me 'bout
You bite your nail until you sell me out, baby
I know the truth about you, air it out
Cause I need somebody who's gonna hold me down
Always accusing me of running 'round (running, running 'round)
You throwing rocks in a glass house, baby
You know I got people all over town
Cause I need somebody who's gonna hold me down

I don't hate the player, oh, I sure don't hate the game
But I'm 'bout to make a movie and I need you out the frame
Cause

Mama
Didn't raise no fool
I said, mama
She watching girls like you
You will never catch me slipping
You will never catch me sleep
Girl you must be tripping
Trying to run around on me
Oh, mama
Didn't raise no fool, didn't raise no

I know the reason why you hang around
You only love me for my bank account, baby
I did the math 'cause it ain't hard to count
And I need somebody who's gonna hold me down
No, we can't work, work, work it out
Swerving, swerving when you come around
You know what goes around comes back around
And I need somebody who's gonna hold me down

I don't hate the player, oh, I sure don't hate the game
But I'm 'bout to make a movie and I need you out the frame
Cause

Mama
Didn't raise no fool
I said, mama
She watching girls like you
You will never catch me slipping
You will never catch me sleep
Girl you must be tripping
Trying to run around on me
Oh, mama
Didn't raise no fool, didn't raise no

Fooled me for the last time, feels good to be free
Must be out your damn mind running 'round on me
Cause

Mama
Didn't raise no fool, didn't raise no
