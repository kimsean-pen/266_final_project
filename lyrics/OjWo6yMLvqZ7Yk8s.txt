I'd like to tell you
What I dream about
I'd like to say
How much I miss you
But
I say sorry
So come my darling
Come to me
I'm sorry
I'm dying on the tree
I'd like to tell you
That it's not too late
I'd like to say
That I won with myself
But I say sorry
So come my darling
Come to me
Sorry I'm dying on the tree
With the world beneath my feet

So you found me after all
Pile of rocks
And two nailed boards

Linger beside me
You're all I have left
Tell me the story of your life
There's so much that
I have got to find out
Until the next darkness arrives
I do not have too many requirements
Only one wish
Before you go
And before I crumble back into the dust
Take me to the river down below
Take me to the river down below

Stay
Sit down
And get some rest
Since you came across my place

Linger beside me
You're all I have left
Tell me the story of your life
There's so much that
I have got to find out
Until the next darkness arrives
I do not have too many requirements
Only one wish
Before you go
And before I crumble back into the dust
Take me to the river down below
Take me to the river down below

And before I crumble back into the dust...
And before I crumble back into the dust...
