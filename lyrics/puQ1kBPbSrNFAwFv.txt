Do do-do do-do do-do-do
Do do-do do-do do-do-do
Do do do-do do-do do-do-do
Do do-do do-do do

A song like you is a ripple of the waves
That rises to a hurricane
Oh uh oh uh
Ah ah, oh uh oh

A song like you is a whispered lullaby
That's drowned out by a baby's cry
Oh uh oh uh
Ah ah, oh uh oh

A song like you would never tell me the truth
It would turn me on, break me down
Make me feel like there is nothing outside this room

A song like you would have me lost in my youth
Oh baby
A song like you

I'd play it every night
I'd play it every night
A song like you
A song like you

A song like you is a ballet black swan dance
That's brought down by a shotgun blast
Oh uh oh uh
Ah ah, oh uh oh

If I wrote a song that was anything like you
It would turn my color into blue
Oh uh oh uh
Oh uh oh uh
Oh uh oh uh

A song like you would never tell me the truth
It would turn me on, break me down
Make me feel like there is nothing outside this room
A song like you would have me lost in my youth
Oh baby
A song like you

I'd play it every night
I'd play it every night
A song like you
A song like you
I'd play it every night

Can't get you out my mind
When I'm alone and
I've been wasting so much time
And it's killing me inside
A song like you

I'd play it every night
A song like you
(Song like you, yeah)
I'd play it every night
(I'd play it every night)
A song like you
(Song like you)
A song like you
(Song like you, yeah)
