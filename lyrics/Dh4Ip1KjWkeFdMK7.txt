Something in the way I say your name
Sends blood rushing too my face
Exiting my legs, I have colder feet
When they're flooded, my eyes won't see

That you've grown from the fairytale and need a little more
You say, "Call off all of the wedding bells
I needed a little time"

Whatever I mean
Well, what's holding me?
If it's the bottom I'm rooted in
You take me by the hand and ball my feet
You say you'll never get rid of me

Till you've broke from the fairytale and just need a little more
You say, "Call off all of the wedding bells
I needed a little time"

Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time, we were meant to be
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time, we were meant to be
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time, we were meant to be
Once upon a time
Once upon a time, we were meant to be
Once upon a time, we were meant to be
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
