And I look ahead
Although some things remains unsaid
There are times we tend
To play along although we're wrong

I'm wanting all your love
Wanting all your love
Your love
Your love
I want to know your love
Want to know your love
Your love
Your love

And it might be hard
To know that there's another
But don't toss your cards
No need to blow your cover

I'm wanting all your love
Wanting all your love
Your love
Your love
I want to know your love
Want to know your love
Your love
Your love

I'm wanting all your love
Wanting all your love
Your love
Your love
I want to know your love
Want to know your love
Your love
Your love
