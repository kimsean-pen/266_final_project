they talk all the time but nothing gets done
the work begins with the setting of the sun
they advise me how to play, how to look that way
see life goes on and on and on and on, on, on

behind the eyes where the beauty is posed
and above the skin where the beauty gets old
all advise me how to play, how to look that way
see life goes on and on and on and on, on, on

oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love
oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love
oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love

oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love

you talk all the time without our love
time is moving times get rough
you advise me how to play, when i'm with you
my favorite letter, you oh

oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love
oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love
oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love
oh, who was one second of love?
one second of love, one second of love.
