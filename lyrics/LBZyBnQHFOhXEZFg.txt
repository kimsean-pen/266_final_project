Annie, told me,
Get out of here, head for the sea,
The sun is hot and the air is clean
The best things in the world are free
And Mister Murphy
Likes his Jackanory
Holsten Export times three
Jimi Hendrix and Thin Lizzy

Annie, Annie, Annie

Met a mate in the afternoon
Holsten shore line pub crawl
Looking for some cold beer
Missed the stone punch drunk Judy
Tony, brandy, M.G., Andy
Vodka, scotch and loads of beer
It's so great we want to stay here

Annie, Annie, Annie
