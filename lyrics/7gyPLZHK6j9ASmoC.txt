INSTRUMENTAL

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

I used to worry I would wake up all day
Only to find you'd nothing more to say

Now I'm letting silence do the talking
Now I'm letting silence do the walking

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

I used to scream when a whisper would do
Only wanted noise, all over you

Now I'm letting silence do the talking
Now I'm letting silence do the walking

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
