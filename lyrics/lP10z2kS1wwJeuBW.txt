"I've been here before, I know this shade of blue, it's you
I've felt your touch before I know your way, a ghostlike sense of state, you're gone
So it seems you know me, I will wait for you, I do

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die

Slowly I relive a better past a time I thought I knew, I blew
Now I'm pacient now I know I'll last, I'll last
I've always known it's true, with you

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die"
