Follow the dead in the dark of damnation
Pious in head and a demon at heart
Sworn to the night, an evangelist nation born
Under the sign of the dark

Gather the wild form the horde of the brave men
Brothers allied fight the storm of this curse
Banners up high as we rise like a legion sworn
All for the light we inverse

Combat ahead and the night calls for heroes
Ready for fire command
Revel in red come and wake up to bring no remorse
Stand up as force

Rise over the dead bring us ahead
Incense and iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red all you can get
Incense and iron
Stand follow the fight doing the right
As we come to defend

Hollow the damned in the art of salvation
Fallen and banned and the angels die first
Servant in life and elated in eden cursed
Slaves in the light from beyond

Bury the night in imperial hunger
Do or die in this fortress of fear
Cannot deny all the wonders are sacred burst
Under the weight of this world

Remedy sent and the sky falls in treason
Torn by the liar's intend
Devil in head come and break out
And raise up the sword
Stand up as horde

Rise over the dead bring us ahead
Incense and iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red all you can get
Incense and iron
Stand follow the fight doing the right
As we come to defend

When we all stand together

Rise over the dead bring us ahead
Incense and iron
Fight all of the night
Banners up high to the top of the land

Right into the red all you can get
Incense and iron
Stand follow the fight doing the right
As we come to defend
When we will last forever
