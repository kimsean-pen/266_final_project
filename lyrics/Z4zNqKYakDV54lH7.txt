I Love Music, Any Kind Of Music
I Love Music, Just As Long As It's Groovy
Makes Me Laugh, Makes Me Smile
For The World When I'm With You Boy
While We Dance Make Romance
I'm Enchanted By The Things That You Do
I Love Music, Sweet Sweet Music
Long As It's Swinging, All The Joy That It's Bringing
I'm So Happy To Be In Complete Harmony, I Love You Boy
And To Hold You So Close In My Arms, I'm So Glad You're Mine
All Mine Mine
Nothing Can Be Better Than A Sweet Love Song
So Sweet So Sweet So Mellow
When You Got The Girl That You Love In Your Arm
Oh Honey I Love You I Love You Yeah
Music Is The Healing Force Of The World
It's Understood By Every Man Woman Boy And Girl
And That's Why That's Why I Say
I Love Music
Any Kind Of Music
Long As It's Swinging
All The Joy That It's Bringing
Music Makes The Atmosphere So Fine
Lights Down Low Just Me And You Baby You Know
'Specially When You Got A Cold Glass Of Wine
Mellow Wine And Song
I Love Music, Sweet Sweet Music
I Love Music, Just As Long As It's Groovy
I Love I Love I Love I Love I Love I Love Music
I Love I Love I Love I Love I Love I Love Music
I Love Music, Any Kind Of Music
I Love Music, Just As Long As It's Groovy
