Late at night,
I'll run through the streets and empty corridors.
I'll find my counterpoint
Inside a red room locked behind a door

I keep holding my head up holding it up.
Holding my head up
Holding it up
And you just don't come back, around.
It seems to me that we will never be.

And tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
Nothing's wrong today.
Just tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
nothing's wrong today.

Late at night
I'll run through the streets and empty corridors.
I'll find my counterpoint
Inside a red room locked behind a door
Behind a door.
And someone tell me,

Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
Nothing's wrong today.
Just tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
Nothing's wrong today.

Everything I know.
Everything I know.
Suddenly gone

And tell me nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
Nothing's wrong today.
And someone tell me
Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong
nothing's wrong today
Today, today, today
