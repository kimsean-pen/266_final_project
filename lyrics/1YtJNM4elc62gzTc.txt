I've driven round in circles for three hours
It was bound to happen that I'd end up at yours
I temporarily forgot there's better days to come
I thought that I would give it just one more chance

'cause I want, tonight, what I've been waiting for
But I found, tonight, what I'd been warned about

You think you are complicated, deep mystery to all
Well it's taken me a while to see, you're not so special
All energy no meaning, with a lot of words
So paper thin that one real feeling, could knock you down

And I've seen, tonight, what I'd been warned about
I'm gonna leave, tonight, before I change my mind

So see you when you're 40, lost and all alone
Being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know
Not sad because you lost me
But sad because you thought it was cool to be sad

You think misery will make you stand apart from the crowd
Well if you had walked past me today I wouldn't have picked you out
I wouldn't have picked you out
I wouldn't have picked you out

Now I've seen, tonight, how could I waste my time
And I'll be on my way, and I won't be back
'cause I've seen, tonight, what I've been warned about
You're just a boy, not a man, and I'm not coming back
