Tell my baby, "I've got to go"
No I won't say, "Goodbye"
Tell my mother, "I love her so"
'Cause this is the day I die

The day I die

Yeah, I'm ready to see that light
No I won't waste time
Straight to heaven or hell, I don't mind
Oh it's all paradise

The day I die

You say I'm "never gonna go that way"
That way
I say, "I'm already on my way, today"
You say I'm "never gonna go that way"
That way
I say, "I'm already on my way, today"
You say I'm "never gonna go that way"
That way
I say, "I'm already on my way, to die"

The day I die
