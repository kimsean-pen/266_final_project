It's the song that just keeps playing on the radio
And you know I haven't seen you for a while
I lie awake at night
And wonder how you are
And I wish that I could see you again

Is it fate or is it luck
That brings us back
Or is it just a common point of view
Time has put a spell on you
You never seem to change
And I wish that I could see you again

I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

It's the light that just keeps shining day after day
When other loves have come and gone
I'll be here with open arms to take you in
And I wish that I could see you again

But I'll be here where the heart
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

And in between
And when I need to see you again
All I have to do
Is close my eyes
Oh the picture's coming in my friend
I'll hold you again
But until then

I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

I will still be here where the heart
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

I will still be here where the heart
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
