Miranda

Miranda, we met face to face and I lost me head
Miranda, I saw your smile and felt something click inside
Miranda, fifteen hours together in Arizona
I cou; dn't stand up, small talk
And no small amount of beer

Last night turned into today
You were one mile high and rising

Miranda, a party for two in your hotel room
I couldn't stand it
The fun came easily, but the next day too soon

Last night turned into today
You were one mile high and rising
My mind is swimming, the bells are ringing in my ears
The sun's peaking through the curtains
Seeing you all too clear

A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye
A wink and a smile and a kiss good-bye

Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
Good-bye, so long, I hope that I will see you around
