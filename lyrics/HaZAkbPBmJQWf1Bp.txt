I thought about it
And we're both so young
I really adore ya
Already found the one
I know she's there for you and you're doing your best
But to tell the truth, I can see you've been stressed

But does she get it?
Are you understood?
And are you ready
To be there for good?
I don't mean to pry, I'm just thinking of you
And I'm sure she's fine and you'll do what you'll do

Now you got someone else, I wish you could
See me watching your belt, I wish you would
Call me up on the phone, I wish you could
Take me back to your room, I wish you would
I wish you could
I wish you would
I wish you could

I thought about him
And the things we felt
I thought I doubt him
But I'm overwhelmed
When he tucks me in, I can fall right to sleep
But I'm losing it, when I walk by your street

I know he gets it
And I'm understood
But am I ready
To be here for good?
I've been up all night and I'm thinking of you
If you read my mind, wonder what you might do

Though I got someone else, I wish I could
Get you all to myself, I wish I would
Call you up on the phone, I wish I could
Take you back to my room, I wish I would
I wish I could
I wish I would
I wish I could
I wish I would

When I stare at you
It's unbearable
I'm not a sucker for higher things
I fear the gods are conspiring
And who am I to deny it?
I never wanted someone like this
Thought I could fight it, but I'm getting tired and

Now you got someone else, I wish you could
See me watching your belt, I wish you would
Call me up on the phone, I wish you could
Take me back to your room, I wish you would

Though I got someone else, I wish I could
Get you all to myself, I wish I would
Call you up on the phone, I wish I could
Take you back to my room, I wish I would

I wish I could
I wish you would
I wish you could
I wish I would
I wish I could
I wish you would
I wish you could
I wish I would
