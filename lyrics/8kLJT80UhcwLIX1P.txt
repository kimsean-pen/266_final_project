Hey man, you know
I'm really OK
The gun in my hand
will tell you the same

But when I'm in my car,
don't give me no crap

'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap at all
When I go driving I stay in my lane
But getting cut off, it makes me insane
Open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away,
Yeah, Yeah
I got a bad habit,

Yeah, Yeah
And it ain't goin' away,
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ohh Ohh Ooh ohh
They say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last
'Cause I got a bad habit

Of blowin' away,
Yeah, Yeah
I got a bad habit,
Yeah, Yeah
And it 'aint goin' away,
Yeah, Yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh ohhh
Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
when I show my piece
Complaints cease,
Something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumb-shit god-damn motherfucker!
I open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away,
Yeah, Yeah
I got a bad habit,
Yeah, Yeah
And it 'aint goin' away,
Yeah, Yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
Ohh Ohh Ooh ohh
