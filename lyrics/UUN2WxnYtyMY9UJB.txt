Lonely little love dog that
No one knows the name of
I know why you cry out
Desperate and in devout

Timid little teether
Your eyes set on the ether
Your moon in a bella luna and
Howling hallelujah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooooooh

Nameless you above me
Come lay me low and love me
This lonely little love dog
That no one knows the name of

Curse me out in free verse and
Wrap me up and reverse this
Patience is a virtue
Until its silence burns you

And something slow
Has started in me as
Shameless as an ocean and
Mirrored in devotion

Something slow
Has sparked up in me
As dog cries for a master and
Sparks are swirling faster

Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the ways of
Where the land is low is
Where the bones'll show through

Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the days of
Where the land is low is
Where the water flows to
And holds you
