Turn around, open your eyes
Look at me now
Turn around, girl Ive got you
We wont fall down, yeah

We can see, forever from up here, yeah
So long as were together
Have no fear, no fear
So turn around, floating
So high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Listen baby, turn around, floating
So high up off the ground

Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Turn around, turn around

Turn around, outer space
We can go there now, yeah
Turn around, theres no
Limit to what we found, uh yeah
Music up, I wanna feel it all, yeah
Well stay up, cause theres no way for us
To fall, to fall
So turn around, floating

So high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now

Listen baby, turn around, floating
So high up off the ground

Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Turn around
Uh baby, were so high now, whoa
Tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Oh, oh, our home is the sky now
So turn around, floating
So high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Listen baby, turn around, floating
So high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together, nothing can stop us now
Turn around
Turn around
Turn around nothing can stop us now
