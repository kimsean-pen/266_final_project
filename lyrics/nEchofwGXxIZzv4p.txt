It's not psychedelic, it's got many merits
It's not psychedelic, nuclear submarine
Darling, I think it's a dream

Your causes, they make me feel so mad
I'm not yellow, oh no, I'm steely black
Oh, I hate peaceniks, I'm ready to attack
Let's take out London, let's take out all of that

'Cause it's not psychedelic, it's got many merits
Nuclear submarine

Thin black sail, oh, thin black sail
Thin black sail, thin black sail
Thin black sail, thin black sail

It's not psychedelic, it's got many merits
So let me make this clear

Nuclear submarine
Darling, I think it's a dream
