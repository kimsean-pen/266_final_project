You wanted a friend, I wanted you back
I knew it would end, our contract was bad
I knew you would go for those obvious obvious people

You knew it was wrong to hold me close
You wrestle my fears without letting me go
But I knew you would fall for those obvious obvious people

I bet your out in his car right now
Lips and hands no longer searching for me
Lost as I need, love is a dream

And I could follow you right down
Through desert sands to the lighthouse
Well the morning crosses your eyes now
Look at me, you pull me close,
Saturate, come undone, overdose
But he's in love with your soft talk
Worked your name in the sidewalk
You will hear him in the parking lot
Friday night, getting close, let it go, live your life

You wandered too deep, I couldn't agree
To follow you back was to give up on me
I spent my whole life
Running from obvious obvious people

You spend more than a year
Trying to forget my past
I laughed at your tears, you're much better than that
But I'm blaming us both
We're just obvious obvious people

I bet you're out in his car right now
Lips and hands no longer searching for me
Lost as I need, love is a dream

I bet you think I'm in love again
With another one of those blonde girls, I call friends
But you're the one that can't live alone
You couldn't wait until I came home

And I could follow you right down
Through desert sands to the lighthouse
Well the morning crosses your eyes now
Look at me, you pull me close, saturate, come undone, overdose
But he's in love with your soft talk
Worked your name in the sidewalk
You will hear him in the parking lot
Friday night, getting close, let it go, live your life
