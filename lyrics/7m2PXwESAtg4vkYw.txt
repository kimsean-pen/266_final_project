Stop being a twatty, brap
Happy, be fucking happy

I admit I've never been broke but I have been broken
Shout inside, she'll switch you for a token of kindness
This one's for you King Charles, you mess with the people
Took the taxes to fund the evil, sound familiar?
Don't mind us, divide us, but when we need guidance, you give us the silence
It's spineless and blindless, we will buy back, not sit here smiling
While they used to attack the student loans and the first time homes
It's time to know
They act the moment, they neglecting the young
It's really scary being under 21

Honey, we want your money
Get out your wallet and give us your
Money and you may as well
Throw in your soul

Sorry, mate
Eh, we're taking your car, brap

I see you just royal pretending, too sober to spend us
You talk about lease but then no one surrenders
From a cynical man, we don't fucking plan
When it all goes wrong, there'll no confession
Only a digression, a concession, a society's aggression
We're create a phenomenal compression, the heads of the youth, what do we do?
What do we do, man, what do we do?
What do we do, man, what do we do?

Honey, we want your money
Get out your wallet and give us your
Money and you may as well
Give us your soul

We're taking your car now, sir
We're taking your car now, sir
We're just taking your car now, sir
We're just taking your car now, sir

Honey, we want your money
Get out your wallet and give us your
Money and you may as well
Give us your soul, brap
Honey, we want your money
Get out your wallet and give us your
Money and you may as well
Throw in your soul
