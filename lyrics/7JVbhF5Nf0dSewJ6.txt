I'll be standing in the corner
Just watching her slaughter them
See you all go wild
I've been dipping in my finger
Testing out the water
See you on the other side

She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I'm sure (woah)
And she's all dressed up and knocking at my door (woah)
She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I know (woah)
But she's got my heart and she's never letting go

I'll be hanging on your heartache
Enough rope for my sake and losing everytime
I'll be wrapped around your finger, let the moment linger
See you on the other side

She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I'm sure (woah)
And she's all dressed up and knocking at my door (woah)
She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I know (woah)
But she's got my heart and she's never letting go

(And we all get a taste for blood tonight) she's never letting go
(Coz we've all had a taste of love) she's never letting go
(And we all get a taste for blood tonight For love) she's never letting go

She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I'm sure (woah)
And she's all dressed up and knocking at my door (woah)
She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I know (woah)
But she's got my heart and she's never letting go

She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I'm sure (woah)
And she's all dressed up and knocking at my door (woah)
She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I know (woah)
But she's got my heart and she's never letting go
