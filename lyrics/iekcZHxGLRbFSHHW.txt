All I hear's the rhythm of my speeding heart
It's getting loud and I can't hide it
Boy you know the distance is just killing me
Even when I lie right beside ya

And I gotta love my body loose
Never really cared for rules
I gotta get it closer to you
I gotta get to where you are
Rip my shirt and let it fall

Baby I just feel like wearing nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Yeah I'm getting warming as you're holding me
But I still feel too far away now
Help me please cause I can't deal with clothes between us
I just wanna tear 'em off, baby

And I gotta love my body loose
Never really cared for rules
I gotta get it closer to you
I gotta get to where you are
Rip my shirt and let it fall

Baby I just feel like wearing nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Baby, let's tie us tighter together
Yeah, we can tear down this wall
We got to get tighter and tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

I gotta love my body
Baby I just feel like wearing, nothing at, nothing at, nothing at all

When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
Nothing at all
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing

Baby, let's tie us tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
We got to get tighter, tighter together
When I'm with you I feel like wearing nothing
