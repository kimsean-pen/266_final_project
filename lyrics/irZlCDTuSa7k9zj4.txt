How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you in my revenge
Which is in everything I do

When summer comes
Your spotlight is the sun
You can do as you please
And get whatever you want

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
You will see traces of you as I avenge
Everything you put me through

In the daytime
When everyone can see
It makes you look so good
Being cruel to me

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
On that day you may have had my jealousy
But in time I will have yours and you will envy me

The summer sun may soothe your pain
As you escape to bathe in its rays
But you'll still come home to drown in me
Or at least where I used to be

The things I've said
The sound of my laugh
My hopes and dreams
Where I lay with you
Your memories of me

How dare you subject me
To Summer's Envy
I will shine brighter than the day you left me
One day I'll be able to make my peace with you
But not until years of revenge come true
