Joy was her name
A life un-wed
Thirty years old
Never danced a step
She would have left these red hills far behind if not for her condition
'would have left these red hills long ago if not for my condition'
Pitiful joy
She looked away
Into a hollow sky
Came face to face
With her own innocence surrounding her until it never was a question
Innocence so suffocating, now she cannot move, no question
No hope for joy
No hope or faith
She wanted to go blind
Wanted hope to stay
'I've been believing in nothing since I was born, it never was a question.'
