Wake up cause the evening's running
Away from the hands of the youth
Hold fast cause the daylight's coming
It'll hit when it dawns on you
Take it if it's yours to take
Go sleep in the bed you make
I know it's never been easy
To say what you never could say

You'll wait so long
You'll wait so long

I've been counting all the passing days
You keep hiding in the back room
It's taken a while to find you
Covered in blue
Hey, been watching as you walk away
From all you leave in the past
I never thought I could save you
Even if it's the last thing i do

Move on cause the world is moving along right in front of you
If you don't stop for awhile you might miss a perfect view

You'll wait so long
You'll wait so long

I've been counting all the passing days
You keep hiding in the back room
It's taken a while to find you
Covered in blue
Hey, been watching as you walk away
From all you leave in the past
I never thought I could save you
Even if it's the last thing i do

I won't stop and go and let another day unfold
I miss the feeling that you get when you can have it all

I've been counting all the passing days
You keep hiding in the back room
It's taken a while to find you
Covered in blue
Hey been watching as you walk away
From all you leave in the past
I never thought I could save you
Even if its the last thing I do
