You feel lonely, nothing worse
Who cares about you?
People treat you like an animal
Nobody gives you a chance

But one night you wake up
Your eyes are full of hate
Confound thinking, strange feelings
This nightmare will show you the way

Insane brain demands for revenge
Expect the sentence of an estranged creature

This night might change your life
You will show them your force
No mercy for your enemies
You act godless and cruel

Will your life end now in chains?
Pain of imprisonment expects you
Death's the price you must pay
Sweetest reality

Insane brain demands for revenge
Expect the sentence of an estranged creature
Insane brain demands for revenge
Expect the sentence of an estranged creature

Insane brain demands for revenge
Expect the sentence of an estranged creature
