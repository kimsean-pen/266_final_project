So now you want the whole world to notice that you've come around,
Now you expect,
We'll see how you're really so much better now,
But I know the truth, I won't waste my youth

On a cad and a bounder, a dog and a cheat
All the lives that you've had, all the hearts you eat
You're a rascal and a rogue, a villain and a crook
Still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook
I should be better, but I'm worse...

What's the point pretending that you could be a better man [oohhooh]
Just give in, since you always end up right back where you began [ohhooh]
Still I know the truth, but I have a sweet tooth...

For a cad and a bounder, a dog and a cheat
All the lives that you've had, all the hearts you eat
You're a rascal and a rogue, a villain and a crook
Still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook
You're rash and you're hasty
You're reckless with my heart, still I wait by the phone
I will never get smart
I should be better, but I'm worse...

[Still I know the truth, but I have a sweet tooth]

For a cad and a bounder, a dog and a cheat
All the lives that you've had, all the hearts you eat
You're a rascal and a rogue, a villain and a crook
Still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook
You're rash and you're hasty
You're reckless with my heart, still I wait by the phone
I will never get smart
I should be better, but I'm worse...
