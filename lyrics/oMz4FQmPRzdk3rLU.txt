I don't know where I am
I don't know this place
Don't recognize anybody
Just the same old empty face
See these people they lie, and I don't know
Who to believe anymore
But there comes you to keep me safe from harm
There comes you to take me in your arms
Is it just a game? I don't know
Is it just a game? I don't know
Pleading eyes that break my heart
So homesick and confused
But I know I must play my part

And tears I must conceal
There comes you to keep me safe from harm
There comes you to take me in your arms
Is it just a game? I don't know
To keep you safe from my world
Take my hand and my heart races
The flames illuminate our faces
And we're on fire
Blow a kiss to the crowd
They're our only hope now
And now I know my place
And now I know my place
We're all just pieces in their games
