The place where I have always been free has begun to consume me
I stand along this windswept shore and feel it more and more

You've made your promises, that I have drowned inside
The windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide

The place where I have always been free has begun to consume me
I stand along this windswept shore and feel it more and more
A spirit frayed, a bond was broken; a sudden switch, words were spoken
Below the waves there is proof that we have never known the way

You've made your promises, that I have drowned inside
The windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide,,, And we stand still, nothing worth changing
No cause to seek within our minds
There will never be another dawn here
A time where I'd feel, a time for taking; and the path to freedom passed us by
Watch the waves and wither away here

In sleep, the sea
In peace, in ruin

You've made your promises, that I have drowned inside
The windswept shore is silent in absence of the tide
