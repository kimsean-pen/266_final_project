I will cover you like ivy
And choke out all the light
Baby, I could be your Doomsday
Let you know we'll be alright

'Cause I've got heaven in my veins
But heaven doesn't numb the pain

I could be your Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare
I could be your Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare

It feels like I could sink forever
And I am anchored in your heart
So down to hell we go together
I was your Doomsday from the start

'Cause I've got heaven in my veins
But heaven doesn't numb the pain

I could be your Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare
I could be your Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare

We can watch the world burn
We can watch the world burn
Smoke will choke out all the light
We can watch the world burn
We can watch the world burn
Smoke will choke out all the light

Baby, I could be your Doomsday

I could be your Doomsday, Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare
I could be your Doomsday, Doomsday
I could be your worst ever nightmare, yeah
