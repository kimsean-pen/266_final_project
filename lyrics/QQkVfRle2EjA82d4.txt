I got some money I'm a blow it all today
They say Michael don't throw it all away
And my reply was there's more on the way
When I said it I was walking in the rain
I did a show in Chicago on the first
Now I'm back in LA like Chicago and First
No sun but I'll father this verse
That's all I'm probably worth
And I'm from sunny CA to reign on all of this earth
Rainy terrain, receive the God sent messages
We know the answer, but dance around what the question is
What is it
It's back to who's on first
It's my dog
It's his tail
It's the chase
It's the search
It's the ignorance that causes all the bliss in my surroundings
Cause dealing with reality's like drawing out your boundaries
And I refuse to be referred as less than a creative so catch me when I'm live in town as I've been demonstrating
That I could find my greatness in the waking of my absence
And absolutely kill it when they're dealing out these bad hands
A player plays what a player's dealt
And carries baggage like conveyor belts
And never fucking saves his wealth
I got some money I'm gonna blow it all today
They say Michael don't throw it all away
And my reply is there's more on the way
When I said it I was walking in the rain
I write to Alchemist cause others don't inspire me
I got my people and they got my back entirely
I kill with Iriscience on the side of me
And by myself I lay em' out and iron out the irony
What a long winding road it's been
With no sign of slowing up around its turns and bends
How many have friends that ain't foes within
Dirty laundry in the wash, but them clothes don't spin
I mean really, I kill two birds with one bullet
The target's when I line it up, the triggers when I pull it
Out the gate a bit late, but the champ is back
I need a third hand to wear my rings and hold plaques
I hit the track like the runners new
Hands high like a stickup Killer Michael running jewels
It's true, the eyes slanted, my fam rock the planet
Don't take fans for granted like the money is due
I got some money I'm a blow it all today
They say Michael don't throw it all away
And my reply was there's more on the way
When I said it I was walking in the rain
I got some money I'm a blow it all today
They say Michael don't throw it all away
And my reply was there's more on the way
When I said it I was walking in the rain
