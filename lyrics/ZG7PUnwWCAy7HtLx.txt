I lost all I had that April day
I turn to my friends
Nothing to say
I wrote down a name

And read it twice
I wallow in shame
I said, that I love eternal schemes
I cling to my past

Like childish dreams
I promised to stay
And held my breath
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Led me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why
Kept inside our idol race
Ghosts of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why
