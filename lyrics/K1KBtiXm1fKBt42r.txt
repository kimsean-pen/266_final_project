You saw me lost in treading water
I looked pathetic and as helpless as a stinger without a bee
But underneath my presentation, yeah
I knew the walls were coming down
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me

Hey what would it mean to you?
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey whatever it means to you?
Know that everything moves in circles yeah

I saw you standing in my headlights blink, blink, blink
I thought I'd run you down for the weight you left on me
Instead I pushed rewind reversed and drove away
And see you disappear in my rearview
Brought to me the word reciprocity

Hey what would it mean to you?
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey whatever it means to you?
Know that everything moves in circles yeah

Round and round we go
We could know it'd end so well
We fall on and we fall off
Existential caroussel

Spin...
Hey what would it mean to you?
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey whatever it means to you?
Know that everything moves in circles yeahhh
Ohhh
That everything moves in circles
Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round
