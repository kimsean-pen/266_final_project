I've seen you on the road
I've seen you on the road
The place they called it home

Coming down beneath the violent sky
Coming down beneath the violent sky
Coming down beneath the violent sky
Coming down beneath the violent sky

These skies where happy kids
The music going loud
To move here under the cloud of screaming
To move here under the cloud of screaming
To move here under the cloud of screaming
