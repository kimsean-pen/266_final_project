Standing on the side of the river
Staring across the great divide
I'd give all my gold and silver
Just to get to the other side
Your love is like a rescue vessel
Carries me through the night
Through these flames of destruction
I know you're gonna make it right
I know you're gonna save my life

But I gotta walk through the fire
I gotta deal with desire
The situation is dire
I gotta walk through the fire of love
Walk through the fire of love

Sitting alone in my bedroom
Thinking about the trip to come
My bags are packed and I'm ready
I think I'm gonna make a run, oh lord
Oh lord, I'm gonna make a run
The red hot coals are calling
And I know it's the only way
There ain't no use in prolonging
The fact that I just can't stay
I know that I cannot stay

But I gotta walk through the fire
I gotta deal with desire
The situation is dire
I gotta walk through the fire of love
Walk through the fire of love

Want you to save me
Cover me when I go
I need you to take me
Take me across the red hot coals

But I gotta walk through the fire
I gotta deal with desire
The situation is dire
I gotta walk through the fire of love
Walk through the fire of love
