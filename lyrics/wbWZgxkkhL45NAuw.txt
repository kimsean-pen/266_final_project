What am I to say?
I'm all wrapped up in apathy
And I don't want to stay this way

There's nothing left to do
Now that I am onto you
All I want to know is the truth

And I don't want to go
But I feel like I should
Cause I'm falling apart, and I might
And I die, and die, and die

How could you be the better part of me?
When we're only half of what we used to be, today
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

What am I to say?
I still remember everyday
Memories don't fade away
And it all falls apart
In the shadows of the past
It can seem to be so hard
But it's time the feelings past

How could you be the better part of me?
When we're only half of what we used to be, today
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

And pull your triggers now
What you waiting for?
I stand accused myself
Sometimes I'm wrong
God help me
And here beneath my life
What am I praying for?
I don't believe in hell
But I just might be there tonight
How could you be the better part of me?
When we're only half of what we used to be, today
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell
Goodbye, farewell
