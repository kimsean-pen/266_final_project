Walking through the streets after dark
And all I see are demons
These neon scenes seem alive
When all the creeps are reaching

If these streets could talk, well they would say
"We hustle all the dreamers"
I'm living like a shadow every night
Hunting down a secret

Walking through the streets after dark
And all I see are demons
I'm feeling like I'm running out of time
Gritting my teeth, yeah

Yeah I'm walking
Night walking
Yeah I'm walking
Are you?

The city cries
It's fading soon too
It's nearly gone
Ten seconds before it eats the moon
