If I could recall
what if feels like
missing you
I'd dig you up
and hold you down
We're like bones cemented in sediment
I shut my eyes to find the sentiment
Like bones cemented in sediment
I shut my eyes to find the sentiment
Cause I'm so gone
I don't feel like anything
without living in someones arms
I hold on tightly to everything
that I've lost
cause I don't feel like anything
without living in someones arms
but I don't hold on tightly
hold on tightly
to what we've lost

If I could recall
what if feels like
missing you
I'd dig you up
and hold you down
Cause we're like bones
and we fall
and we break
and we take too much time to hold
You'll get buried
the deeper you go

Cause I'm so gone
I don't feel like anything
without living in someones arms
I hold on tightly to everything
that I've lost
cause I don't feel like anything
without living in someones arms
but I don't hold on tightly
hold on tightly
to what we've lost

We're like bones cemented in sediment
I shut my eyes to find the sentiment
Like bones cemented in sediment
I shut my eyes to find the sentiment
Lost.
