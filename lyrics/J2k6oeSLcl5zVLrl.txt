Do you even breathe
When I say that it won't be long?
When you watch me leave
You're bloody but sweet, in misery
I'm somewhere between

And from high above
I could never quite capture you
All the bays like blue veins
Crooked as hell, and stretch like birthing scars

I'm just a love letting blood
Letting take place alone

Can it wait a few more days?
This love of mine
Gives and takes like fever shakes
Of a beaten sore leather body
Healthy, still, out of shape
Been here before
Hard to ask life to stay
We try but it just can't bother

It's blinding in this red haze
A negative over exposed

Landing never does the trick
Nothing but talking silhouettes
Pouring on Manchester
Sun now, but it's the same as the last
A drink two fingers high
Idle hands are wrapped around the glass
And I can't settle down
Just bloody but sweet, alone in Missouri
I'm just a love by the phone

Can it wait a few more days?
This love of mine
Gives and takes like fever shakes
Of a beaten sore leather body
Healthy, still, out of shape
Been here before
Hard to ask life to stay
We try but it just can't bother

I'm just a love
I'm just a love
I'm just a love
I'm just a love

I'm just a love
I'm just a love
I'm just a love
I'm just a love

I'm just a love (I disappear)
I'm just a love (Never arrive)
I'm just a love (And you're laying there)
I'm just a love (Barely alive)
