This huge construction project could change the character of areas on this road forever.
That's the worry at least, to people once known as 'tin pan alley'

You found a carousel to ride around
But you get bored, so you tear it down
Like a kid in a playground, putting sand in their mouth
Spit it out, when you're feeling fickle
And I want to say it shouldn't work that way
People's lives ain't a game, just 'coz you can pay
Smoking your big fat cigar
Tweed hat, cravat and four birds on your arm

I'm just a tin pan boy, do you want to take that toy?
Hey! You! Mr. Developer!
Hey! You! Mr. Developer!
You're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy
Hey! You! Mr. Inheritor!
Crook! Hook! Mr. Proprietor
(Booyyy)

You kick the small kid off the monkey bars
Take your mess out of his specs and the size of his arm
Force him to dress in black, then make him hold your holster
Whilst you shoot in the back (back)
You will say I'm only writing songs
Son get off of your are and get a proper job
And snigger at my beat-up boots
But I tell you Sir, I'm coming after you in fiction

I'm just a tin pan boy, please don't take my toys
Hey! You! Mr. Developer!
Hey! You! Mr. Developer!
You're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy
Hey! You! Mr. Inheritor! Mr. Proprietor!
(Boyyy)

I'm just a tin pan boy, you want to take my toys
Hey! Hey! You're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy
Hey! Hey! Boyyy!
