You can't lie
Words stay, once said
Hard to live, so I play dead

I can't drink you gone
I can't you smoke you out
I can't eat away the way that you ate my heart out

Like the sinking ship
While the band plays on
And I dream you're there
I can't even sleep you gone

How do broken hearts get strong?
Tell me how do broken hearts get strong?

I still feel your hand in mine
Think I need much more than time

I can't drink you gone
I can't smoke you out
I can't eat away the way that you ate my heart out

Like a sinking ship
While the band plays on
When I dream you're there
I can't even sleep you gone

How do broken hearts get strong?
Tell me how do broken hearts get strong?

I remember when we used to say
Forever, babe
Forever, babe

I can't drink you gone
I can't smoke you out
I can't eat away the way you ate my heart out

Like a sinking ship
While the band plays on
Even when I dream you're there
I can't even sleep you gone

How do broken hearts get strong?
Tell me how do broken hearts get strong?
Oh how do broken hearts get strong?
Tell me how do broken hearts go on?
