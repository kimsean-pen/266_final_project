Where do I...
Where do I...
Where do I start with you?
I could say you're a bit way-lead, boy.
Where is my heart with you?
I could say I left it on the floor, boy
Are you gonna pick it up
Pick it up? Hey hey.

Things kinda got dark with you,
I drunk your love up too quick, boy.
Where did our love get to?
Don't ask me that's something that you destroyed
Cause now we're burning up,
Burning up,
Burning up, hey hey

Flames race like cars in a haze,
Tears in my eyes but not down my face,
This was a waste,
This was a waste woah-oh-oh.
A shame to embrace the love that we faced,
Hours were days when I was in your grace,
This was a waste,
This was a waste woah oh oh.

Well I'm sorry to be honest
But this love is no good boy
And I'm sorry you're drunk on it
But you're making me annoyed.
Heartbroken heartbreakers that's me,
I accept it, I get the point.
But stop jumping in to fountains
Just to pick up all the coins.

We were rushed we had no foundations,
Explanations were never settled first.
I guess when building something special
You should always use ground work
Cause now we're falling down,
Falling down, hey hey.

I could blame you for a lot but
I guess it was me that let us drop,
You go crying to your friends now
And I'm left looking not so hot
But now we're burning up,
burning up, burning up hey hey

Flames race like cars in a haze,
Tears in my eyes but not down my face,
This was a waste,
This was a waste woah-oh-oh.
A shame to embrace the love that we faced,
Hours were days when I was in your grace,
This was a waste,
This was a waste woah oh oh.

Well I'm sorry to be honest
But this love is no good, boy
And I'm sorry you're drunk on it
But you're making me annoyed.
Heartbroken heartbreakers that's me,
I accept it, I get the point
But stop jumping in to fountains
Just to pick up all the coins.

I let you walk all over me,
Leave your footprints on my heart.
And it's becoming clear to see,
It's been like this from the start.

And I'm sorry...
To be honest

This love is no good,
Boy.
