When I was twenty two
The day that I met you
When you took my hand through the night
It was getting late
And you asked me to stay
And hold you until we see light

Shut the door and turn the lights off
And put up your dukes tonight

'Cause this love is getting dangerous
And I need some more tonight
Your touch is contagious
You know what I need tonight
I can't run and I can't hide
I'll be wasted by the light
I'm undone but I'm alive
Don't ever wanna see the morning light

When I was young in love
When you were everything
We'd stay up and drink through the night
Laying on the roof
I put my hands on you
You said our love will never die

Shut the door and turn the lights off
And put up your dukes tonight

'Cause this love is getting dangerous
I need some more tonight
Your touch is contagious
You know what I need tonight
I can't run and I can't hide
I'll be wasted by the light
I'm undone but I'm alive
Don't ever wanna see the morning light

And if we go down with this ship
We go down together
And if we should die tonight
It's you and me forever

Forever you and I
Together until we die
And I'll be right next to you
Even on the other side

'Cause this love is getting dangerous
I need some more tonight
Your touch is contagious
You know what I need tonight
I can't run and I can't hide
I'll be wasted by the light
I'm undone but I'm alive
don't ever wanna see the morning light

'Cause this love is getting dangerous
I need some more tonight
Your touch is contagious
I need some more tonight
I can't run and I can't hide
I need some more tonight
I'm undone but I'm alive
don't ever wanna see the morning light

When I was twenty two
The day that I met you
When you took my hand through the night
