That feeling is creeping in
Deeper and deeper into my skin
Got a shadow on my soul
And time is taking its toll

I'm alone in my head
With something wishing me dead
It's like I'm hanging by a thread

When the darkness is near
It's like I'm drowning in fear
Everything is up in the air

Tell me something about paradise
'cause I can't help feeling paralyzed

Paralyzed
Paralyzed

That feeling is creeping in
Deeper and deeper into my skin
This void inside
Is haunting me

Tell me something about paradise
'cause I can't help feeling paralyzed

Paralyzed
Paralyzed

Paralyzed
Paralyzed

Paralyzed

This void inside
Is haunting me

This void inside
Is haunting me
Haunting me

I'm alone in my head
I'm alone

I'm alone in my head
I'm alone

Tell me something about paradise
'cause I can't help feeling paralyzed

Tell me something about paradise
'cause I can't help feeling paralyzed

Paralyzed
