I give you all my love and affection now
I show you all my care and protection now
Now you don't even want it
Like you don't wanna notice
So tell me what you put in all the work for?
You swore me as so deep but you're at the shore
Remember you were floating
I used to be the ocean, yeah

Oh yeah, what is it about my mind?
Masochistic by design
Slowly sinking and I know
I want you to go

Don't waste my time
You think I'm blind
Don't waste my time
You're still not mine

I wonder if it's just an addiction now
I couldn't turn the fix of your friction down
I never had a moment
To see I wasn't chosen
So tell me what you put in all the work for?
I'm drowning in the deep but you're at the shore
Remember I was frozen
And now you got me soaking

Oh yeah, what is it about my mind?
Craving things I can't define
Over thinking and it shows
Don't want you to go

Don't waste my time
You think I'm blind
Don't waste my time
You're still not mine

And I wonder who's bed you're in tonight
When the one that's so wrong can love your right
It's becoming so clear to me
It's a role you're playing

Don't waste my time
You think I'm blind
Don't waste my time
Since you'll never be mine
