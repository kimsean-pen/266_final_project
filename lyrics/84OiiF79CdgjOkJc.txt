She's the girl that no one ever knows
And I say hi but she's too shy to say hello
She's just waiting for that one to take her hand & shake her up
I bet I could

I wish my heart was always on her mind
'Cause she's on mine like all day, all the time
Forget me not, forget me now
I've come too far to turn around, I'm here tonight

'Cause I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
Whoa oh oh...

She's the girl that no one ever knows
Works a double just to buy her clothes
Nicotine & faded dreams
Baby, just believe there's no one else like me

'Cause I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
Whoa oh oh...

It's time to fall into my arms
'Cause I've been waiting for too long
You're an angel, grab your halo
And lets fly tonight

'Cause I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me

'Cause I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
I'm never going down, I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave so put your hands up
If you like me then say you like me
Whoa oh oh...
Just say you like me
