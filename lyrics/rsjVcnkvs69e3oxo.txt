As I stare through these tears,
I see your lips start to turn.
This world is so un-perfect,
this love is so un-worth it.

Won't be mistaken for another love song,
I won't go away, I won't be done wrong.
Tell me, tell me to, to live like you,
tell me, tell me, and I'll follow through.

Get up, get up, He's calling your name,
you don't have to be something you're not.
Someday came suddenly and now I'm standing here.
Get up, get up, He's calling your name,
you don't have to be something you're not.
Someday came suddenly and now I'm left standing here.

As I stare through these tears,
I see your lips start to turn.
This world is so un-perfect,
this love is so un-worth it.
When you're here I don't need all the things I had,
Once before I was someone but that's not who I am.

I'll be the best I can for you,
I'll take this chance you will be true.
Tell me your reason why,
tell me why you're alive.

To give to you my sin,
to give myself again.

And this is my call to the faithful,
I'll be for only you.
Doing what you, have called to me,
no one could ever understand,
my shame you took with those nails in your hands.

Get up, get up, He's calling your name,
you don't have to be something you're not.
Someday came suddenly and now I'm standing here.
Get up, get up, He's calling your name,
you don't have to be something you're not.
Someday came suddenly.

Here's to selfish living out the window,
here's to the Holy Ghost, I will be faithful.

Here's to you I bring you new life.
Here's to you I bring you new life
