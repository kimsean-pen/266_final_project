2am, wide awake lying
on my bed, tuning on the radio
trying to make the emptiness go.

I been up, I've been readin' and cryin'
Tryin' to love you a little less but I,
I struggle with my heart on my mind.

There's a tug of war and I keep losin'
cuz my heart has got a really good excuse
She is so, so sad lyin' in her bed,
so, so mad at me.

She says
"I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere
I need my baby, baby
(don't say its over)
baby, baby
(no, no, no)"
She says
"I want my love, just to keep beatin'
we can't go anywhere
without my baby, baby
(don't say the love is gone)
baby, baby
(my heart will not agree to beat alone)"

I was so young and unfocused
let you go, even when i knew that I,
I put you in the way of my pride.

There's a tug of war and I keep losin'
cuz my heart has got a really good excuse
She is so, so sad lyin' in her bed,
so, so mad at me.

She says
"I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere
I need my baby, baby
(don't say its over)
baby, baby
(no, no, no)"
She says
"I want my love, just to keep beatin'
we can't go anywhere
without my baby, baby
(don't say the love is gone)
baby, baby
(my heart will not agree to beat alone)"

Now my heart is having seizures everyday
I dont know what else to do, but send him free
she is cryin' over you and baby maybe
I've gotta go home now.

She says
"I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere
I need my baby, baby
baby, baby

She says
"I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere
I need my baby, baby
(don't say its over)
baby, baby
(oh yeah)"
She says
"I want my love, just to keep beatin'
we can't go anywhere
without my baby, baby
(don't say the love is gone)
baby, baby
(my heart will not agree to beat alone)"
