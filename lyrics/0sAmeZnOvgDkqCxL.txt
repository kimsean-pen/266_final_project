Hear me!

Yeah-ah
Oh oh
Ooh-ooh
Uh, hear what, hear what, hear what

Watch the way that people change
Flip the script and rearrange
Hoping they can just belong
Even when it's wrong, uh huh

Searching for identity
What's the next philosophy?
What's the next big thing in town?
That they can surround?

(Don't feel no shame)
Let them know you're not the same
(Don't feel no way)
You stand tall while people sway
(True to yourself)
Leave them fakers on the shelf
(Heed your calling)
Go and do your thing,
hear me...

Get up, get up and hold your ground
You don't care what goes around
Stand up, stand up and hold your ground
Hold your ground
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me

Watch the way that people go
To the cat that runs the show
Next thing they are rolling thick
Down with that clique, hmm

Soon enough they act the same
Walk the same and talk the same
Until these so called inspired
State the look is tired

(Don't feel no shame)
Let them know you're not the same
(Don't feel no way)
You stand tall while people sway
(True to yourself)
Leave them fakers on the shelf
(Heed your calling)
Go and do your thing,
Let me hear you say...

Get up, get up and hold your ground
You don't care what goes around
Stand up, stand up and hold your ground (stand up)
Hold your ground
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me

(Get up! Get up!)
Yeah
(You gotta gotta!)
(Stand up! Stand up)
Stand up on me
(Get up! Get up!)
Alright
(You gotta gotta!)
(Stand up! Stand up!)
Yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
(Ah-ha-ah-ha-ah-ha)
(Ah-ha, ah-ha)
(Ah-ha-ah-ha-ah-ha)
Get up and
Stand up and
Hold it
Get up and
Stand up and
Hold it
Feel it!

(Don't feel no shame)
Let them know you're not the same
(Don't feel no way)
You stand tall while people sway
(True to yourself)
Leave them fakers on the shelf
(Heed your calling)
Oh, go and do your thing,
Let me hear you say...

Get up, get up and hold your ground
You don't care what goes around (oh no)
Stand up, stand up and hold your ground (stand up and)
Hold your ground
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me (hold on)

Get up, get up and hold your ground (uh)
You don't care what goes around (get up and)
Stand up, stand up and hold your ground (stand up and)
Hold your ground
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
Dem no bigger than us
No bigger than we
No bigger than you
No bigger than me
