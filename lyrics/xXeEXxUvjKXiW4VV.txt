We used to sing, 'We had it all'
And record it on our phones,
But when I listen back now, it's just out of tune
And it's hard to believe because we hardly touch our skin
How did we end up here?
So out of sync

And maybe all the lies were truer than we know
And maybe anti clockwise is the only antidote
And I can't stop dreaming of the night when we begun
And the songs that we wrote when we were drunk

All of the letters that you sent to me
Said that we'd stay the same for as long as we breathe
And we'd shrug off two weeks of rain on our honeymoon
But now you fall asleep in the other room

And maybe all the lies were truer than we know
And maybe anti clockwise is the only antidote
And I can't stop dreaming of the night when we begun
And the songs that we wrote when we were drunk
And the songs that we wrote when we were drunk

We had it all And maybe all the lies were truer than we know
And maybe anti clockwise is the only antidote
And I can't stop dreaming of the night when we begun
And the songs that we wrote when we were drunk
And the songs that we wrote when we were drunk
