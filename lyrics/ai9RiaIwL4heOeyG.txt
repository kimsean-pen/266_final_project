Summer needs shade. Death awaits outside.
The weather reminds me solace can't be found.
I don't like this feeling.
I talk to myself cause no ones listening and I don't care.
My youth stays inside.
Fun is blinding, calms the nervous sight.
But I don't like the sun in my eyes waiting.
The more I stare I feel cheated when aging.
Hey June.
I want to feel safe.
Please stay for a while.
Fear induced my mind into exile.
I know; I just want to be in the shade with everyone I need.
