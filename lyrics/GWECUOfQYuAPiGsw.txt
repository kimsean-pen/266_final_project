I could tell you what you wanna hear
'Cause the truth is always in the way
I never wanna live in fear
I don't wanna hold back all the things I need to say
Say, say

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you
I know you, I know
Tryna tell you now, I've been doin' what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go (Just let me go)
Just let me go (Just let me go)
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

You used to always let me in (You used to always let me in)
Do you even know you've changed? (Do you even know you've changed?)
Now you're my favourite sin, oh
'Cause I'm either on your side or you're a mile away
Oh... Oh...

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you
I know you, I know
Tryna tell you now, I've been doin' what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

Just let me go, just let me go
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go (Just let me go)
Just let me go (Just let me go)
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

Woah, no, oh

I got you figured out, you need to have control
You think that I don't know you
I know you, I know
Tryna tell you now, been doin' what you want
But I won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore

Just let me go (Just let me go)
Just let me go (Just let me go)
Won't be your yes girl, no, not anymore
Just let me go (Just let me go)
