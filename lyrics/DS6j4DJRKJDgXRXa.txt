From my youngest years
Till this moment here
I've never seen
Such a lovely queen
From the skies above
To the deepest love
I've never felt
Crazy like this before

Paint my love
You should Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of
A thousand doves
Baby you should
Paint my love

Been around the world
Then I met you girl
It's like coming home
To a place I've known

Paint my love
You should Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of
A thousand doves
Baby you should
Paint my love

Since you came
Into my life
The days before all fade
To black and white
Since you came
Into my life
(Ooh, into my life)
Everything has changed
(Ooh)
Paint my love

You should Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets
It's the freedom of
A thousand doves
Baby you should Paint my love
(Paint my love)
Paint my love
You should Paint my love
It's the picture of
A thousand sunsets

(It's the picture of)
It's the freedom of
(Ooh)
A thousand doves
Baby you should paint my love
Ooh
