Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Momma take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door

Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door

Momma put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel like I'm knockin' on Heaven's door

Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door, yeah yeah
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
