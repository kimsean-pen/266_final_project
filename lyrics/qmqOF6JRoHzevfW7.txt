We haven't met, and that's okay
'Cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't wanna wait in line
The moment is mine, believe me

Don't close your eyes
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I've got you spinnin'

Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you're like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

You, you need to discover
Who can make me feel free
And I, I need to uncover
The part of you that's reaching out for me
Heyyyyy

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
It's everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you're like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
I got nerve

I know what you're like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
(I got)
I got nerve
