Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
no one has the time
someone is always late

I look for you
and you look for me, whoa, ohh

I don't know why i came down
I hold your phone, don't wake up
I hear a voice, in the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
the hard part is telling me
something that you are not likely to telling

Tell me, don't tell me
the hard part is telling me
something that you are not likely to telling

Wait time is to blame
i thought fame was a trip
we all have the time
someone is always feared

I look for you
and you look away, ohh

I don't know why i came down
I hold your phone, don't wake up
I hear a voice in the ground
Waiting up is so much fun to do
80s movies make out party
(Tell me, don't tell me
the hard part is telling
something that you are not likely to tell you).
