Until the day she told me
That I could be somebody
I was a show of the last thing, oh
Under the ocean we lay
Another violent escape
I was not right
*Oh, oooh*
And I'm not a hero, get it
And you're not a hopeless case
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
And I'm not a hero, get it,
And you don't deserve this place
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
Under an island we sailed
Broken and lost and so pale
I was a drowned and a dead weight
On you I shivered all night
Your eyes were angry and bright
I could not fight
*Oh, oooh*
And I'm not a hero, get it
And you're not a hopeless case
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
And I'm not a hero, get it,
And you don't deserve this place
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
And it's not that hard to explain why you're caught in the middle now
And it's not that hard to open eyes that close when they couldn't have
And it's not that hard to wake you up
And I'm not a hero, get it
And you're not a hopeless case
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
And I'm not a hero, get it,
And you don't deserve this place
And I'm not a hero, get it, yeah
