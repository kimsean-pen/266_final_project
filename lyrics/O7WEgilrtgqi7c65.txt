Here I am again
Talkin' to myself
Sittin' at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel?
So much runnin' through my mind
First you wanna be free
Now you say you need me
Givin' mixed signals and signs
It's so hard to let you in
Thinkin' you might slam the brakes again

Put the pedal down
Headin' out of town
Gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's
Drivin' me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

I can't keep comin' back to you
Every time you're in the mood
To whisper something sweet in my ear
It's so hard to move on
'Cause every time I think you're gone
You show up in my rearview mirror

Is this just a detour
'Cause I've gotta be sure
That you really mean what you say
It's so hard to let you in
Thinkin' you might slam the brakes again

Put the pedal down
Headin' out of town
Gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's
Drivin' me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

To a place where I can be redefined
Where you're out of sight
And you're out of mind
But the truth is, I can't even say goodbye

Here I am again
Talkin' to myself
Sittin' at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel
So much runnin' through my mind

Put the pedal down
Headin' out of town
Gotta make a getaway (a getaway)
The traffic in my brain's
Drivin' me insane
This is more than I can take (I can take)
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away
(Getaway, getaway, getaway)
(Getaway, getaway, getaway)
(Getaway, getaway, getaway)
