Higher, high-

Like we understood
Made with adrenaline
Seeping out through the skin
Like only lovers could
Here's where we begin
Time is the medicine
To heal these needs
That only raise our voices

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

But we can seperate
To form these hearts in stone
Rewrite this pain we own
Caught here in the wake
Nothing but genuine
Built on a skeleton
Of fractured parts
That only raise our voices

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

Better believe the sea of changes
And put these battered bones to rest
Nothing invisible or nameless
Leave no reason to confess

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight...
Higher, higher (Higher, higher, higher)
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

Better believe the sea of changes
And put these battered bones to rest
Nothing invisible or nameless
Leave no reason to confess
And raise our voices
Higher, higher
