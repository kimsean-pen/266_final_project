Show you where show you where... show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Straight from the underground let me kick this quick death and mystic
in other words let the spirits get to you job's better kinda like flue-due
experience the power to be hold strong enough to make space unfold
I'll go back with a single that I'm ready nightmares kinda like Freddie
pleased to pretend that I will jump the mind to make you dance and collect combine
it's time for the foe to go to work drop a bomb and you go for certain
trancing trancing buggle while you buggle while you're dancing
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Collect miles of dough go deep man deliver the miracle noone is so pityful
look in my eyes and all you see is darkness wait a second
white as a spark is bright enough to light a fast unique song
dance and the beat keeps on there's my wife and my voice
driving take control of the way I'm hypnotizing
people in the house to make you move hip hop and do a trance tribe groove
furious thoughts are broken match a compatible skill smoking
heat it up heat it up give me the mic and watch the AK beat it up
a little taste of toping the gift quick why my ways are mystic
my ways are mystic my ways are mystic
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want do what you need
do what you want do what you need
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
