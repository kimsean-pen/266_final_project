You better watch what you're wearing
If you want him to come round and see you tonight
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh
But he doesn't care what it looks like
Just as long it's pink and it's tight
It's what he likes
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh

Oooh
So what should you do
Should you stop being you
Just to be how he wants you?
Oooh
Go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come
And meet me in the afternoon
Oooh
He's got your heart
You got his soul
You might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
But do you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time?
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time
Get it right first time

And now you've done once, now he wants you
To wear your pink glove all the time
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh

Oooh
So what should you do
Should you stop being you
Just to be how he wants you?
Oooh
Go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come
And meet me in the afternoon
Oooh
He's got your heart
You got his soul
You might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
Until you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time
You get it right first time

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh you'll always be together
'Cause he gets you up in leather
And you know what to wear at the end of the day
And I'd laugh if I saw that I'm out of the way
Yeah it's too long ago, shouldn't care anymore
But I wanted to know, is it as good as before?
Yeah it's hard to believe that you go for that stuff, all those
Baby-doll nighties, synthetic fluff
Oh it looks pretty good, yeah it fits you okay, yeah
Wear your pink glove, babe
You put it on the wrong way!

Oh, so
I know you're never gonna be with me
Until you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time, yeah
Oh, I know that you'll never leave him
Ooh ooh ooh, oh, but d'you see yet?
You got it right first time
Get it right first time
