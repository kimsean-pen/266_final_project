And I should have known better to lie with one as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I should have known better to take a chance on ever losing you.
But I thought you'd understand, can you forgive me?

I saw you walking by the other day.
I know that you saw me, you turned away and I was lost.
You see: I've never loved no one as much as you.
I've fooled around but tell me now just who is hurting who?

And I should have known better to lie with one as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I should have known better to take a chance on ever losing you.
But I thought you'd understand, can you forgive me?

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
should have known better,
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
should have known better.

It's true, I took our love for granted all along.
And trying to explain where I went wrong, I just don't know.
I cry but tears don't seem to help me carry on.
Now there is no chance you'll come back home, got too much pride.

And I should have known better to lie with one as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I should have known better to take a chance on ever losing you.
But I thought you'd understand, can you forgive me?

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love you,
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love you.
No-no-no-no-no-no I love you!
No-no-no-no-no-no, yeah!

And I should have known better
to lie with one as beautiful as you
