Well, I wake up something more than what I'm supposed to be
Something more than I have meant to show.
How was I supposed to know
that I've wanted, and I've waited?

I wake up something more than what I'm supposed to be
Something more than I have meant to show.
How was I supposed to know
that I've wanted, and I've waited?

And I can be the one
to show you that lifes not simple enough.
And I can be the one
to tell you I've held this back for too long.
And my heart aches
These feelings I've held inside for you.
Life's not simple enough
And my heart aches
How can I stop the pain?

And I can be the one
to show you that lifes not simple enough.
And I can be the one
to tell you I've held this back for too long.
