Here stands a man
at the bottom of a hole he's made
still sweating from the rush
his body tense
his hands, they shake
oh this, this is a mad boy

Here stands a man
with a bullet in his clenched right hand
don't push in son
for he's got the power to crush these lands
oh here, hear him cry boy

Don't you ever leave me alone
my war is over
be my shelter from the storm
my war is over
I am a sad boy

Here stands a man
at the bottom of a hole he's made
still sweating from the rush
his body tense
his hands they shake
oh this, this is the mad boy

Here stands a man
with a bullet in his clenched right hand
but don't push him son
for he's got the power to crash these lands
oh here, hear him cry boy

Don't you ever leave me alone
my war is over
be my shelter from the storm
my war is over
I am a sad boy

Don't you ever leave me alone
be my shelter from the storm
my war is over
I am a sad boy
