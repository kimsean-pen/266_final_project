You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh

Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

Oh, I want ya
Got to have ya
And I need you
Like I never have loved before

Oh, I want ya
Oh, I need you
Got to have ya
Like I never have loved before

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh, oh
For you oh, oh

Oh, boy
Oh
