I can't believe what is in front of me
the water is rising up to my knees
and I can't figure out
how the hell I wound up here
everything seemed okay when I started out the other day
then the rain came pouring down
and now I'm drowning in my fears

and as I watch the setting sun
I wonder if i'm the only one
Cause everyobody tries to put some love on the line
and everybody feels a broken heart sometimes
and even when I'm scared I have to try to fly
sometimes I fall
but I've seen it done before

I got to step outside these walls
I've got no master plan to help me out
or make me stand up for
all the things that I really want
you had me to afraid to ask

and as I look ahead of me
cry and pray for sanity
Cause everyobody tries to put some love on the line

and everybody feels a broken heart sometimes, yeah
and even when I'm scared I have to try to fly
sometimes I fall
but I've seen it done before
I got to step outside these walls

These walls can't be my haven
these walls can't keep me safe here
now I guess I got to let them down
Cause everybody tries to put some love on the line
and everybody feels a broken heart sometimes, yeah
even when I'm scared I have to try to fly
sometimes I fall
but I've seen it done before
I got to break out...
I got to break out...
I got to step outside these walls
love outside these walls
I feel my heart breaking
but it's a brand new day
I'm going down
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping outside
these walls
{I've seen it done before. i'm walking on, i'll walk it off, oh i'm moving on)
