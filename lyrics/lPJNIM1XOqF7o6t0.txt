From the primordial soup
Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals
By any other name

From the primordial soup
Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals
One unbroken chain

I need to get you out of your cave, man
I need to let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

Out from under a rock
From a prehistoric sea, we crawl
We are animals
Animal, one and all

Out from under a rock
From the prehistoric sea we came
We are animals, animal
One unbroken chain

I know what you're searching for
I pray you find it, on your instinct
I don't need your hurtin', boy
Animalistic

I need to get you out of your cave, man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

I need to get you out of your cave, man
I wanna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

If you call out tonight
And hear the call of the wild, reply
You are animal, animal
Not so deep inside

If you call out in vain
Everyone of us just the same
We are animal
Dare not speak its name

I know what you're searching for
I pray you find it, on your instinct
I don't need your hurtin', boy
Animalistic

I need to get you out of your cave, man
(Primitive)
I'm gonna let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan
(Primitive love for me)
