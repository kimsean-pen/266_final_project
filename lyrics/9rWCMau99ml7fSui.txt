In the darkest storm through the cold of night
We hear the wolves cry at my chamber door
The path of evermore from the dawn of time

In the rain alone with your demons claw
Now, let your brother help if the palace falls
And the dragon dies we'll let the mothers mourn

In the forest old when the moon rises and the shadows fall

Deep Calleth upon deep
And in the forest old
Deep Calleth upon deep

With a fearless heart and no one's dream torn
Just like the fire burns on the hillsides north
You will tear the skies and we will never die

In the forest old when the moon rises and the shadows fall

Deep Calleth upon deep
And in the forest old
Deep Calleth upon deep

In the forest old when the moon rises and the shadows fall
Deep Calleth upon deep
And in the forest old
Deep Calleth upon deep
