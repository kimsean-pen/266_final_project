I can't make you love me
But I'll try
Only the lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me
But I'll try
Only the lord knows how hard I tried
but when the sun starts to set
The skies take your breath
And he just sets you right there
You just wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Well I can't make you love me
But I'll try
Until my dying breath you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it if it's not there
Only the lord knows why it's not there
But when the sun starts to set
The skies take your breath
And he just sets you right there
You just wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
I can't make you love me
I can't make you love me
I can't make you love me
But when the sun starts to set
The skies take your breath
Andhe just sets you right there
You just wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
You just wave goodbye
