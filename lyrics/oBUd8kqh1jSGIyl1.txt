She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side

I've seen a lot of pretty faces
Ain't nobody like you
And I never have a love like
The one we knew
Tell me why I had to play the clown
Always messing around
I can't stop thinking how I can let you down, down, down

She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side

I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side

My friends say that she's a keeper
But I let her go
Didn't know how much I need her
'Til I was on my own
I've been drinking 'bout the truth won't drown
No, the truth won't drown
Bad medicine won't go down, down, down

She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side

Ooh, the cover's over
If I could dream I'd hold you
Can't stop thinking
Am I even on your mind?
Now, the nights are colder
Miss you on my shoulder
Miss you there on my cheek
Every night

She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side

She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night (on my mind)
'Cause she ain't by my side
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night (on my mind)
'Cause she ain't by my side

Oh, the cover's over
Miss you on my shoulder
Miss you there on my cheek
Every night

She's on my mind, she's on my mind
She's on my mind, she's on my mind
I can't sleep at night
'Cause she ain't by my side
