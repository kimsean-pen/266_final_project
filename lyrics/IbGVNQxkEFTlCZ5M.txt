Oh I see your scars I know where they're from

So sensually carved and bleeding until you're dead and gone
I've seen it all before beauty and splendour torn
It's when heaven turns to black and hell to white
Right so wrong and wrong so right now

Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption
No one's gonna catch you when you fall

Oh I see you crawl you can barely walk
With arms wide open you keep on begging for more
I've been there before knocking on the same door
It's when hate turns to love and love to hate

Faith to doubt and doubt to faith

Now
Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption

No one's gonna catch you when you fall
Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption

No one's gonna catch you when you fall
Feel it turning your heart into stone
Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption

No one's gonna catch you when you fall
Feel it turning your heart into stone

Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption
No one's gonna catch you when you fall
Feel it turning your heart into stone

Feel it piercing your courageous soul
Beyond now redemption
No one's gonna catch you when you fall yeah

Beyond now redemption
Beyond now redemption
Beyond now redemption
Beyond now redemption.
