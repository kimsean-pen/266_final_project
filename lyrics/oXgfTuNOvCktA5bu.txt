I'm white water
Oh down upon her
She wants to be pure unsprouted
she wants to be unsprouted pure
she wants to hold unborn child
she wants to be child unborn

I'm white water
I'm white water
She wants to be clean desire
she wants to be naked and never again
she wants to be never again nobody
she wants to be clean desire
she wants to be clean desire
she wants to be naked and never again
she wants to be never again nobody
she wants to be clean desire

I'm white water
Oh down upon her
I'm white wter
I'm white water
