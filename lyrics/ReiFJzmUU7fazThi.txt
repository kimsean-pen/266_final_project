Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

This song lets you in
Gonna get back down and up again
I got you on my side
It's just a roller ride
It's the truth, it's a fact
I was gone and now I'm back, yeah

Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

I got soul, you can check
In my heart, in my head
I got spirit, you can feel
Did you think I wasn't real?
I'm going back and forth
And forth and back, oh

Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, hey

I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me, you don't wanna fight me
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, hey

Here's what I do
When I know what I can do
I let you in into my world
With mouth to mouth
And kiss to kiss and, oh

Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

You sure you can take me in
'Cause this is where the fun begins
I'm gonna feel your heart stop
In my hands
I'm going back and forth
And forth and back

Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, hey

I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me, you don't wanna fight me
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, hey

You know that I'm magical
I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way

The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one

Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?
Oh, can you feel, hmm?
Can you feel me in the stereo?
Can you feel me in the stereo?

I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright
(Alright)

Oh, I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, hey

You know that I'm magical
I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way

The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one
