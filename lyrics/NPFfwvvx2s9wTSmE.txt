I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry, but I sure don't wanna go home

So, 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign right along the dotted line?
What you sayin', are you playin', sure you don't mean me?

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry, but I sure don't wanna go home
(Now, I'll tell you what happened)

They took me to a room without a table
They said, "Blow your trumpet into here"
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin', all the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry and I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun

Now, they tell me that I ain't so fashion-able
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So, I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah, yeah
Back to playin' and layin', I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I sure do wanna go home
Yeah
