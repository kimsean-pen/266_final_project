It's never quite right, is it?
Endless rigors delivered by hair-triggers
Prepared figures and a hollow-point speech
Won't follow, don't preach
Wrote each syllable to be deciphered beneath

Agreed aesthetic is embedded so I'll shatter that
Impaired vision like the world got cataracts
Endured attacks on all fronts, now we pushing back
Aligned thoughts to outflank how they counteract

About the verbs over nouns, actions over states
Struggle over hope, just to quote brother Coates
Mind-scape provoked as we rewrote the scope
Hit divine notes, kept the dialogue dope

Agreed aesthetic is embedded so I'll shatter that
Impaired vision like the world got cataracts
Endured attacks on all fronts, now we pushing back
Aligned thoughts to outflank how they counteract

Agreed aesthetic is embedded so I'll shatter that
Impaired vision like the world got cataracts
Endured attacks on all fronts, now we pushing back
Aligned thoughts to outflank how they counteract

Agreed aesthetic is embedded - I shatter that
Impaired vision - I shatter that
Endured attacks, man - I shatter that
Shatter that

Grasp at straws refuse to withdraw
What some deem offensive, I'm never repenting
Your objectives ain't like mine
Each act perhaps is a slight crime
Willing to lay down life just to write rhymes
I bide my time observing details most overlook
I'm that leather bound first edition older book
I'm that Raw before it's stepped on and cooked
I'm that pawn and rook endgame
60 moves to wag my finger like Dikembe
You can call me Mr. Brooks
You already know my pen-name

Agreed aesthetic is embedded so I'll shatter that
Impaired vision like the world got cataracts
Endured attacks on all fronts, now we pushing back
Aligned thoughts to outflank how they counteract
