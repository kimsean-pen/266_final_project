God of all, you broke my heart
Through the ages I've searched in vain for words
To the thrones of kings in broken temples
Legacies long memory and dust

I've crossed plains and the mountains, traversed oceans
From my home to the corners of the world
And for a moment I thought I heard you whisper
Mistaken for the wind across the stone

The line, the line is broken
The path behind has vanished in the sand
To fires that burn on the horizon
To eternity, to fate, until the end

God of all, I travel seeking knowledge
You scattered it like ashes on the air
At the dawn your children call for answers
Forsaken in a wilderness to roam
The god of war paraded like a saviour
The god of love in exile can't return

The line, the line is broken
The path behind has vanished in the sand
To fires that burn on the horizon
To eternity, to fate, until the end

The line, the line is broken
The path behind has vanished in the sand
To fires that burn on the horizon
To eternity, to fate, until the end
