when I saw you for the very first time,
I thought you are just so advanced.
the colors in your eyes reflected the rainbow,
I couldn't pull my gaze away from you.

I was sure you would never look my way,
but somehow you discovered me.
my face was aflush with a primary red,
but my eyes they were the darkest blue.

I thought this is all there is,
but now I know you are so much more.
I want to upgrade from my simple eight bits,
but will you still love me when I'm sixty-four?

I found out you're made of 64 bits,
something I couldn't even comprehend.
when I looked at myself I felt so small,
and I was afraid I would never understand.

now that I know who you are,
I know I want it all.
I want to live a new life,
I want to enter the blessed land.

I thought this is all there is,
but now I know you are so much more.
I want to upgrade from my simple eight bits,
but will you still love me when I'm sixty-four?
