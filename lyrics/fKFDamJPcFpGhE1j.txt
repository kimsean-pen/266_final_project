Take your time
Back up a little bit
C'mon now, people
Get yourselves out of it

No chains can hold me
No walls confine me
C'mon now, people
C'mon and slide with me

'Cos I'm blind
But not as blind as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing
I wanna do about it
I'm dumb but now
I wanna mouth off about it

Yeah, I'm tired of it all
I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah, I'm tired of it all
I guess that I am through with it all

Take your time
Back up a little bit
C'mon now, people
Get yourselves out of it

No chains can hold me
No walls confine me
C'mon now, people
C'mon and slide with me

'Cos I'm blind
But not as blind as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing
I wanna do about it

I'm dumb but now
I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all
I guess that I am through with it all

Yeah, I'm tired of it all
I guess that I am through with it all
I'm tired of it all

Take good care of it, babe
You know it's goin' slow
But it's comin' your way

You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
But the air's so thin
And you're still polluting it

You know we keep talkin' but it's so frustrating
Well, you know we keep talkin'
But theres no mistaking it

Take good care of it, babe
Take good care of it, babe
Take good care of it, babe
Take good care of it, babe
