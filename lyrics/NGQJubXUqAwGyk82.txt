This is for the ones with words unspoken
This is for the ones dealing with hearts broken
I can't believe everything I see
A world full of hate and of vanity
With so much beauty and love inside me
When does our innocence turn into arrogance?

I am strong, I am weak
I am everything between
I am proud to be me
I am human
I am weird, I'm a freak
I am different, I'm unique
I will love who I please
I am human
You are just like me
You are just like me

Faith is so much stronger than fear
Open your heart to the truth you might hear
Taste your words before you spit them out
Silence can be louder than a shout
There's so much beauty and love inside us
When does our innocence turn into arrogance?

I am strong, I am weak
I am everything between
I am proud to be me
I am human
I am weird, I'm a freak
I am different, I'm unique
I will love who I please
I am human
You are just like me
You are just like me

Rejoice it's a miracle
Rejoice it's a miracle
Rejoice it's a miracle
Rejoice it's a miracle

I am strong, I am weak
I am everything between
I am proud to be me
I am human
I am weird, I'm a freak
I am different, I'm unique
I will love who I please
I am human
You are just like me
You are just like me
You are just like me
