And here I stand
I find myself alone again
The miles I've walked
The loss of hope and loss of friends

Yet I keep on runnin' (runnin', runnin')
And I won't look back
The waters rise
You never know just where they're at

The waters turn, yeah, yeah
The hardships we endure, yeah, yeah
You ain't the only son or forgotten daughter
We have drowned in blackened waters

The sun has set
The endless stream where nothing lasts
Forever damned
Today, tomorrow and all the past

Yet I keep on runnin' (runnin', runnin')
And I won't look back
The waters rise
You never know just where they're at

The waters turn, yeah, yeah
The hardships we endure, yeah, yeah
You ain't the only son or forgotten daughter
We have drowned in blackened waters

The waters turn, yeah, yeah
The hardships we endure, yeah, yeah
You ain't the only son or forgotten daughter
We have drowned
