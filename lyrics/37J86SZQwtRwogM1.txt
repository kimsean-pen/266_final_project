When road is carved up yonder
I hope you see me there
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from

And the crowd begins to wander
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story of where you came from
Your sons and daughters in all their glory it's gonna shape 'em
And when they pledge and come together, and start arising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

The road it was carved from nothing
Never sold yourself away

It's in the water, it's in the story of where you came from
Your sons and daughters in all their glory its gonna shape 'em
And when they pledge and come together, and start arising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from
It's in the water where you came from
It's in the water where you came from
It's in the water where you came from

And when they pledge and come together and start arising
Just drink the water where you came from where you came from
