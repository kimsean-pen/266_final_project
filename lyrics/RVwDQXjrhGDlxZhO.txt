Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's going to happen without warning
Down is the new up
What is a butter cup?
Down is the new up, is the new up

Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us

Caught on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up...
