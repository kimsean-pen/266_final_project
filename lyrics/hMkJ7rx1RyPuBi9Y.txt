You've cast these scars across my face
You can't bring me down.
You think I'll never be the same.

Go!

And I don't know what's wrong with me
I wanted to be all the things you need
All the things you need.

And now I'm standing here alone
I'm waiting for it all to come and go
All to come and go.

Maybe I just have to let it go...

Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, can't you hear the sound of the sun
Rising from the ground

Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, do you always wanna be the one
Running from yourself

You!

And nothing's ever as it seems
When all your dreams exist in memories
Exist in memories.

And all the trauma takes its toll.
I don't remember all our common goals
All our common goals.

Maybe you just have to let me know...

Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, can't you hear the sound of the sun
Rising from the ground

Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, do you always wanna be the one
Running from yourself

You've cast these scars across my face
You can't bring me down.
You think I'll never be the same.
Go! Go! Go!
It's not you i'm afraid of
But I'm not scared of myself
You'll lie with or without me
You'll never need my help
Maybe I just have to let it go
I have to let it go...
Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, can't you hear the sound of the sun
Rising from the ground
Make it up, make it up when you're not around.
Break it up, break it up, do you always wanna be the one
Running from yourself
