Sleep, sleep for a while
Now that I've seen it
And you've done it in style
Rest, it's over mom ami
Lord, I hope you've forgiven me
From wherever you are,
You were a star
We all call from the stars
And return to stars
We hung out in bars for days
But now I'm done with Pigalle
Anyway

Every day I wake miles away
Hoping today's my day
Living in fear,
Same old voice in my ear
End to a real good year
Helplessly detained overstayed
Guessing I can't complain
Wish you were here,
Change of atmosphere
I'll just wait with baited breath
And dream I'm on the frontier

Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end,
How does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end,
How does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end,
How does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end,
How does it feel?
Sleep, you can sleep my friend
Now that you've seen the end,
How does it feel?
