Never want to loose control
Tempted by the cruel I know
Tested by a diction
Never thought I be its victim

I can feel it deep within
Calling out to me agian
should've see the symptoms
Forces faces call reflection

Every breath is mine too take
I wont slip away

After all I've seen
there's so much more to believe
If I'm gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive

Theres no place to hide
I'm feelin' set aside
If im gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive

God iv'e missed so many signs
Wasted years upon my life
Did it by desicion
Councoured by my superstitions

Constant struggles day to day
There's always something in the way
Reminded by my demons
Never would the voice of reason

Every breath is mine too take
I won't slip away

After all I've seen
Is so much more to believe
If I'm gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive

There's no place to hide
I feelin' set side
If im gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive
I'll make it barely alive
After all I've seen
Is so much more to believe
If I'm gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive
Theres no place to hide
I feelin' set side
If im gonna survive
I'll make it barely alive
I'll make it barely alive
