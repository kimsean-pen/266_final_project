Sticking out like a sore thumb
Sipping my whiskey soda
Everyone turns and whispers
Oh my god, i gotta get out
But i feel a hand grab my shoulder
Your hair's a little long
Where'd you say you're from?
You look a little scared
is there something wrong?
Don't look at those
figures in the background
Put your hands up, keep your head down
Put your hands up, keep your head down
Bartender makes a promise
Guaranteed you're gonna love this
But i'm not sure, i'll be honest
Try to run, but i'm molasses
Frozen here in the center
Everyone laughs and laughs and laughs
Your pants are kinda tight
Where'd you say you're from?
You're talking kinda smart
Why don't you bite your tongue?
Don't look at those
figures in the background
Put your hands up, keep your head down
Uh, uh,
Where's the door?
Put your hands up keep your head down
Put your hands up keep your head down
Put your hands up keep your head down
Put your hands up keep your head
