When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man

Manipulate and cause you pain
But lift you up when you're hurting
Screamed goodbye, left when you cried
And buckle the tears when they're burning
I felt it deep inside of me
Like an explosion of crazy
All of this, all you give
I feel it deep

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh, oh

Don't need to hear my apologies
You're being so damn complicated
The ups and downs, the outs and ins
It's what it is

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh, oh

And even when you won't admit
You know you're gonna need
To be next to the only woman who can make you feel that kind of fire
No, you won't get tired
And when you think it's all I got
I'll bring it up a notch
I'll take you on a crazy ride, you'll never get enough
Baby, I'm your girl
And this is how I show my love

'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh, oh
