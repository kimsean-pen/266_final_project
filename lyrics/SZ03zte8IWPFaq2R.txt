Can you hear the sound of the silence?
(hush, hush now)
The spotlights fading away
Like the serenade of the quiet
(drown it out)
The choir leaving the stage

Every time you took my breath away
(I lost something inside)
Every time you threw me a bouquet
(All the roses, they died)
So I think it's time you walk away
(The show is closing tonight)
Yeah I think it's time you walk away, way, way

And don't come back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closing
You can't cut me open no more

Don't come back for the applause, the applause
‘Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that the shower's all over
Confetti all over the floor

But don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore

Can you hear the beat of my heart go (boom, boom, boom)
But it's not beating for you
Like a symphony in the dark
We lost our tune
Don't you think our time is through?

Every time you took my breath away
(I lost something inside)
Every time you threw me a bouquet
(All the roses, they died)
And I think it's time you walk away
(The show is closing tonight)
Yeah I think it's time you walk away, way, way

And don't come back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closing
You can't cut me open no more (no more)

Don't come back for the applause, the applause
‘Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that the shower's all over
Confetti all over the floor (the floor)

But don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore

Can you hear the sound of the silence?
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now

And don't come back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closing
You can't cut me open no more (no more)

Don't come back for the applause, the applause
‘Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that the shower's all over
Confetti all over the floor (the floor)

But don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
Don't come back for the encore
