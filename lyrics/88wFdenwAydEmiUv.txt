Sing Oooh
Said Oooh, Oooh
That lazy love

Oooh my lobby call was 11:30
I'm officially the opposite of early
I gotta go downstairs (downstairs)
Everybody waiting down there for me
But I roll over into your curly hair
And sexy body, oh so nice and curvy
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up baby, let me get it one more time
Before, before, before
I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of, (oh-woah, oh-woah)
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love, hey

You got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna go nowhere, lazy love, hey
You got that, I don't wanna that I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Hey, you got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing, that lazy love
Hey, you got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing

Damn baby that was good, I'm gon' hit the shower
Even though I'm about two hours late
But I can't help it man
If they knew what I know, they would understand
I'm washing last night off, time to boss up

When suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch
She's right behind me
Water glisten off her body
Looking at me like one more time
But baby I gotta go, I got responsibilities
I gotta take care of
That's when you wrap them legs around me
And I fall victim to that lazy love

You got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna go nowhere,
You got that lazy love
You got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Hey, you got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing
You got that lazy love
Hey, you got that I don't wanna
That I don't wanna do nothing

Said Ooh
Said ooh
Oooh that lazy love
Ooh yeah yeah
