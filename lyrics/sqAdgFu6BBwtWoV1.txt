I've seen that look in your eyes
It makes me go blind
Cut me deep, the secrets and lies
Storm in the quiet

oh oh ooh
oh oh ooh
Feel the fury closing in
All resistance wearing thin
Nowhere to run from all of this havoc

Nowhere to hide from all of this madness, madness, madness
Madness, madness, madness
oh oh ooh
oh oh ooh
oh oh ooh

Feel the fury closing in
All resistance wearing thin
Nowhere to run from all of this havoc
Nowhere to hide from all of this madness, madness, madness
Madness, madness, madness
Nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
This is madness, madness, madness
Madness, madness, madness
Madness, madness, madness
