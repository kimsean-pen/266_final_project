Total collapse into a sudden end
Of unimaginable horror into the dark unknown
The old kingdom of prosperity no longer
Now degraded into complete unrest

Horrendous depredation
Haunting echoes of tragedies that befell the kingdom
Under charred embers of what remained
Under charred embers of what remained

The sandstorms smothered all the lands
Starvation followed, as resources diminished
Agony over fear of whom survives
The end of the kingdom that once was...

Horrendous depredation
Haunting echoes of tragedies that befell the kingdom
Under charred embers of what remained
Under charred embers of what remained

Devastating wide spread famine and misery
Was the end of all they knew
The scale of unbearable suffering
The dark age of ruin

The floods subsided into surviÌ‡val
Yet the floods had caused the end
Once resiliant as it vanished into ash
From achievement into total chaos

Through atrocities with suffering of despair
Eating of the young commenced
Blasphemies committed in order to survive
Not of rhetoric, hieroglyphics tell no lies

Streaks of black ash line the ground
As the lands turned into churning dust
Revealing the truth of once was
The lake of truths has now vanished

The lake of truths has vanished...
