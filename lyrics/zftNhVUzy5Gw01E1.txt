I tried but I just can't get out of this
It's got me tied like the waves come in
When this thing hits me I start it again
Cause I could drown just by holdin' it in
I want it, I got it, I'm done hittin' the bottom
I can taste it I'm so close
Tired of bein' haunted
I'm an addict of habit
Don't hide me in the attic
I'm an angel if I can stay plugged in again
I've been diggin' in high and low
To find the world I know
But I can't seem to find a thing
Feel stronger now than I've ever been
So won't you let me in
I feel like I've been born again
Like a time bomb tickin' at the scene of a crime
It's going down if I let it again
Blow the roof sky high like the fourth of July
I'm all or nothin' if I'm lettin' it in
I want it, I got it, I'm done hittin' the bottom
I can taste it I'm so close
Tired of bein' haunted
I'm an addict of habit
Don't hide me in the attic
I'm an angel if I can stay plugged in again
I've been diggin' in high and low
To find the world I know
But I can't seem to find a thing
Feel stronger now than I've ever been
So won't you let me in
I feel like I've been born again
I'm not an easy target
I'm not an angel in disguise
I'm just a man that by grace
Was given a second chance
I feel like I've been born again
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
(Exhale)
I know what you're thinkin'
But I just can't think it
It came alive, now I'm overtaken
Thought I had it all til' my world was shaken
I can't erase it, there's no mistakin'
Cause I've been diggin' in high and low
To find the world I know
But I can't seem to find a thing
Feel stronger now than I've ever been
So won't you let me in
I feel like I've been born again
I'm not an easy target
I'm not an angel in disguise
I'm just a man that by grace
Was given a second chance
I feel like I've been born again
