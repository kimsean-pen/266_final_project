My friend
She tipped over
Out of childhood into sadness
She's always shining
But nevertheless
Her beautiful heart is drowned in grief

Sugar horse, lives inside
Like a friend
In need

Far and wide she'll gaze
Upon the flowers bloom
Jaded, her mind in a daze
From the medicine gloom

They leave her with her friend
A force of nature filled with strength

Sugar horse, lives inside
Like a friend
In need

(Anneke van Giersbergen)
