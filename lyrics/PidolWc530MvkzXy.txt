As soon as you are able, woman, I am willin'
To make the break that we are on the brink of
My cup is on the table, our love is spillin'
Waitin' here for you to take and drink of

So if you're tired of the same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready to roll with the changes
Yea eee yea, woo

I knew it had to happen, felt the tables turnin'
Got me through my darkest hour
I heard the thunder clappin', felt the desert burnin'
Until you poured on me like a sweet sun shower

So if you're tired of that same old story
Oh turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready to roll with the changes
Oh yeah

Oh woo oh
If you're tired of the same old story
Oh baby turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready to roll with the changes
Baby, roll with the changes

Oh you know, you know, you know
You got to (Keep on rollin')
Oh yeah (Keep on rollin')
Ohh, roll with the changes
Keep on rollin' (Keep on rollin')
Oh yeah (Keep on rollin')
Oh now, roll with the changes
Oh babe (Keep on rollin')
Oh babe (Keep on rollin')
Oh you got to learn to roll with the changes
Got to, got to, got to, got to keep on rollin'
Got to keep on (Keep on rollin')
Oh you got to learn to
Got to learn to, got to learn to roll

Keep on rollin', keep on rollin', woo ooh
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin', woo ooh
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin', woo ooh
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin', woo ooh
