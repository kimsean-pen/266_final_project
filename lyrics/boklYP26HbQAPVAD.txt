If I get the call
I'll call across radio America
Right across America I will call
Yes I will call across radio America
Right across America I will call
If call I must do
To take my love, my love to you

And all across Africa, China and Australia
I will call
Call you down in New Mexico, New Brighton and Tokyo
I will call
If call we must do
To take my love, my love to you

For well it may hap that these are they:
Your happiest days
Oh my good old friend
I see you chanced your arm again

The red faced president
Took afternoon tea with her majesty Queen
And they watched old films flicker
Across the old palace screen, crying
"What a shame as she slipped in the rain
Poor dancing girl well she won't dance again"
And they tell me this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to you
And only to you
Yes this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to
You (repeated)
