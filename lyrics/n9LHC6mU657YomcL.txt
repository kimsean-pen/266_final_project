Avenge my name (whoa-oh)

Came here on time
Hope that it's not too late
Seen you at night
Biting the frost of silence
Can you cure us of this fate?
Mock the litany in its face?
Is that you, Moatilliatta?

I've been waiting for so long
For someone to
Mend all the blame
I've been searching for so long

Avenge my name (whoa-oh)

Hex zero rouge
He'll hibernate no more
The altars run dry
Prefect dictate final words
Does it sting of augur truth?
Was your temple left in ruins?
Is that you, Moatilliatta?

I've been waiting for so long
For someone to
Mend all the blame

This is the altar
The one that you let me die in
On your knees
How you wept
Much like Omerta
The quiet has shielded all intent
On the ground
It appears
Like wrath
Avenging the lamb as bait
In a bed of nails you made
Who is this effigy?
Is there straw dressed in these fields?

And now it won't be long

I've been waiting for so long
For someone to
Mend all the blame
I've been searching for so long
