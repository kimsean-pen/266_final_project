I'm standing in the dark
I've been damaged from the start
But I know it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken

You pushed me off to that dark space
Between a rock and a hard place
You hoped you found what would slow me down
But there ain't no stopping my heart rate
It could've been easy to part ways
But now you just feed me this parfait
Of bullshit with your lies mixed in
You can keep your games at the arcade

It's nothing new to me, what you do to me
I've seen it all time and time again
I had to fall for me to find my head
I'm staying true to me, yeah, I know who to be
It might be hard for you to comprehend
That where we are in life is not the end

I'm standing in the dark
I've been damaged from the start
But I know it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken
Be broken
Be broken

Who would I be if I gave in?
Didn't believe in my statements?
I dimmed the lights and I hid from life
And just buried the dreams that I'm chasing?
Who would I be if I wasted
Days and weeks in the basement?
If I up and quit and said: "fuck this shit"
How would I reach amazing?

It's nothing new to me, what you do to me
I've seen it all time and time again
I had to fall for me to find my head
I'm staying true to me, yeah, I know who to be
It might be hard for you to comprehend
That where we are in life is not the end

I'm standing in the dark
I've been damaged from the start
But I know it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken
Be broken
Be broken

When the walls are closing in around me
When the walls are closing in around me
Can I escape from my surroundings?

I was standing in the dark
I was damaged from the start
But I knew it in my heart
That I won't be broken
I was standing in the dark
I was damaged from the start
But I knew it in my heart
That I won't be, be broken
Be broken
Be broken
