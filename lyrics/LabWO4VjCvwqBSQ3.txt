Giving in to what has got me,
Feeling claustrophobic, scarred.
Severed me from all emotion,
Life is just too fucking hard.
Snap, your face was all it took,
'Cause this need is doing me no good.
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me!

Tearing me!
Tearing me!
Tearing me!
Tearing me!

Too far gone, I'm catatonic,
Leaving you to criticize.
Empty shell and running naked,
All alone, lobotomized.
Back and forth between my hang-ups,
It isn't easy to be hated.
Where do you go?
What do you do?
Simpleton, impromptu, crazy eight,
I never cared, not once,
Got to get away!

Tearing me!
Tearing me!
Tearing me!
Tearing me!

I wasn't promised a thing.
You keep mocking me.
But you will never again.
Before you know, after you're gone!
Somos feos apestamos y pero reinamos hoto, motherfucker!
I wasn't promised a thing.
You keep mocking me.
But you will never again.
Before you know it, after you're gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
