It's not good enough
And you were set up to fail
It's not good enough
Keep going back to the well

Scents are rolling in
Truth is sinking in
You are sucking wind
Take the next one, or the next one
Or the next one, or the next one

Six wave hold-down
Innocence is high

It's not been enough
Being pissed but idle
It ain't enough
You get no points for style

Scents are rolling in
Truth is sinking in
You are sucking wind
Take the next one, or the next one
Or the next one, or the next one in

Six wave hold-down
Innocence is high

Scents are rolling in
Truth is sinking in
You are sucking wind
Take the next one, or the next one
Or the next one, or the next one
