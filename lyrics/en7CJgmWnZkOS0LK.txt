Is in every step that I take from you
Is in every move that I make
Is it so much easier to lie?
Is it so much easier to fly?
Everything that I used to have
Is forever gone

You and I must rewrite this song
We chose some words that did not belong
Everything that we used to have is
Enshrined in my memory
I won't give in, won't give up the fight
I sail away from the darkest night
Into the future with what we had
Enshrined in my memory

Deeper and deeper my path is going
Breathing in the air for lasting lie
I bring all the good things from the past
Find a way of how to make them last
Everything that I used to have
I will have again

You and I must rewrite this song
We chose some words that did not belong
Everything that we used to have is
Enshrined in my memory
I won't give in, won't give up the fight
I sail away from the darkest night
Into the future with what we had
Enshrined in my memory

You and I must rewrite this song
We chose some words that did not belong
Everything that we used to have is
Enshrined in my memory
I won't give in, won't give up the fight
I sail away from the darkest night
Into the future with what we had
Enshrined in my memory
