close my eyes
Pull my heart strings
Pour my tears from your hands
'connections are never easy,'You said
Empty words, empty soul
"I believe that we are afraid of one another"
"And I, I believe that you have died within me"

... I fade from myself
I miss you again
I fade from myself
I miss you again... again
what have we got?
what have we got?

Bloody broken and hidden away
I seek the rope from which we will hang
Or so it seems
Or so it seems

The dance of flesh on flesh has rendered us blind
I look into eyes, I look into stone
It's better to be stepped on than left all alone.
It's better to be stepped on than left all alone. alone

So now I choke on yesterday when I was someone
And I wonder where 'forever' went
And how our 'everything' came undone
I opened my eyes and the heaven beneath us died.
