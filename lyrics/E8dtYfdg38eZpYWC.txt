Keep in the darness and need to die
see my face and collapse in red
Everyday I'm loosing time, reading my brain
and collapse in red
Keep in the darness and need to die
see my face and collapse in red
Everyday while I'm coming home I see you again
and collapse in red
Something wrong
Liberty was hard
But Sunday everything's OK
All systems intact
In our chest
