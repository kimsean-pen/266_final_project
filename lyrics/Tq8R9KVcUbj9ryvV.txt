A field, desolate
And underfoot, a tarmac river flows
I wait to depart, an inconceivable aught
When you're no wings and all elbows
Oh, it's so cold
I watch my breath unfold
It wraps us in a cloud of gloom

Through adversity
Hope must not become the casualty

It's common for people to believe
Everything happens for a reason
I'm sorry that's false, and it's poison

Even if there is no purpose
To the things that you have gone through
An ordeal can reveal an airfield

Stop, disown fear
And I'll be here
If you need a friend, my dear

So you're down on your luck, you're down
Yeah you're down on your luck, you're down
But that don't mean you're out
No it don't mean you're out, now

So you're down on your luck, you're down
Yeah you're down on your luck, you're down
But that don't mean you're out
No it don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out

So you're down on your luck, you're down
You're down on your luck, you're down
But that don't mean you're out
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out
No it don't!

So you're down on your luck, you're down
Yeah you're down on your luck, you're down
But that don't mean you're out
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out
(No it don't!)

So you're down on your luck, you're down
Yeah you're down on your luck, you're down
But that don't mean you're out
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out, now
It don't mean you're out

When the wind's against you
Remember this insight
That's the optimal condition
For birds to take flight
Now the wind's against you
Don't give up the fight
