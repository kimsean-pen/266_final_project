I had a dream when I woke up today in bed
I crawled around the ground, yeah, looking for my golden egg
I lost my feet, I lost my hands, I lost my head
When I looked up I saw a girl and this is what she said

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away
And I said
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away

Three times we climbed the stairs that never went nowhere
Tied up in basket and she carried me to February
Three times she marries me, but I was never there
Can't keep the family from changing me to what I am, yeah

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away
And I said
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away

Oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh
Nobody wants me here

We saw a better life that came another way
Another set of eyes, surrounded me so natural
I trust the things in life that come another way
She has Velouria, a pile of bones is all I am

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away
And I said
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away

Oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh, oh, oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh, oh, oh
Nobody wants me

Oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh, oh, oh
Nobody wants me here

Oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh, oh, oh
Nobody wants me
