Standin' on the ceiling, it's alright
Suspended by the dreams you seem to lose
You've been floatin' for a while, a while, can't hold on
Standin' on the ceiling, it's alright, it's alright

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now your'te flying like you wanna be
Right where you belong

Starin' at the wall like it's window, don't know
Blinded by the dreams you seem to lose.
You've been starin' for a while, knock it down
Starin' at the wall, you don't know, don't know...

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you wanna be
Right where you belong

Runnin' from the sun again, it's alright, alright
Runnin' from the dreams you seem to lose
You've been runnin' for a while, a while...
You can't slow down...

Runnin' from the sun again, it's all right, all right Somebody is
tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you wanna be...
