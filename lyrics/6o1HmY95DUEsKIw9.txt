It seems some story was told
But what is there to tell?
Well, some song had been sung
But none of it sings
So let's spell it out
A, B, and C
Up and down from A is to Z
You meant zed, you said zed

From nothing to something
And something for nothing
From no one to someone
From someone to same one
Same old thing
The only way out
Leads to no way back
What can you do?

Easy
You shove it back where it came
Easy
You never let yourself down

So you got up
And you ran
And you run to get up
Through Chinatowns
To slip right down
Soho's a town in every downtown

Drinking friends
Who've drunk in bars
Whose drunken friends
In drinking bars, waiting
For the lightning man to strike

Icing on your cake
Well, if I knew you were coming
I'd cut you you a piece

Baby, come to daddy
Baby, come to daddy
Baby, come to daddy
Daddy's come to baby
Daddy's come to baby
Come to daddy
Baby
Baby, come to daddy

Easy
You shove it back where it came
Easy
You never let yourself down

You better be careful out there
You be careful out there
You better be careful out there
You be careful
You ain't gonna get far
You better be careful out there
You ain't gonna get far
You ain't gonna get far
You be careful out there
You ain't gonna get far
You ain't gonna get far
You be careful out there
You better be careful out there
We're gonna pluck you off
You better be careful out there
You ain't gonna get far
You ain't gonna get far
We're gonna pluck you off
We're gonna pluck you off
We're gonna pluck you off

Baby, come to daddy
Daddy's come to baby
Daddy's come to baby
Come to daddy
Come to baby
Baby, come to daddy
Daddy's come to baby
Come to daddy

Easy
You shove it right back down
Easy
You never listen to this
