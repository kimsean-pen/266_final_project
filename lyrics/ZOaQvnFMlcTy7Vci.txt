The Historian:
A silence so deafening
As the stillness surrounds us
A rush of fear is surging through our veins

A shadows so menacing
Darkens our horizon
What have we done
Is this the end
When death descends

The Opposition Leader:
Don't say I didn't warn you
You'll recall my words
The day that the world breaks down

Don't claim you didn't see it
Are you prepared to die
The day that the world breaks down

The Chemist:
I can't believe we're in danger
I can't believe that we've let it come this far

The Counselor:
We must prepare for the changes
We must prepare for
The day that the world breaks down

The Opposition Leader:
Don't expect we will survive this
There will be no way back
The day that the world breaks down

Don't assume it's all a nightmare
Won't stand a chance
The day that the world breaks down

The Chemist:
I can't believe this is happening
I can't believe we are headed
For a fall

The Counselor:
We must prepare for the blackening
We must prepare for
The day that the world breaks down

The Prophet:
I can feel it in my heart
I can see it in the stars
Behold: It's all been foretold
The future unfolds
The day that the world breaks down

The Captain:
I always knew this would happen
Not many believed in my cause
I'm sure they will all turn to me now
I'm sure I'm the only one
Who can save us

TH-1:
(Star fate)

The Captain:
From this fate

The Captain:
I always knew they would need me
Not many showed faith in my plans
I'm sure they will ascend to me now
I'm sure that I'm the only one
Who can save us

TH-1:
(Star fate)

The Captain:
From this fate

The Astronomer:
Yes I believe you are the answer
Yes I agree you are the key
Your future lies in the heavens
Our future lies beyond (the stars)

We will save them

TH-1:
(Star fate)

The President:
I must've been blind
I mean it should've been obvious
Straight out of my mind
To rely on a cold machine

The signs were strong
I know I was wrong
I know they will hate me now
But I will come clean
And destroy this cold machine

The Diplomat:
This is not over
Not as long as we're alive
If we join our forces
We will make it

This is not over
As a race we must survive
And in the end we will
Cross this bridge... together

The President:
We're losing this fight
And yes - we got ourselves to blame
I guess it seems right
In the mind of the cold machine

I'll fix every flaw
I'll break every law
I'll tear up the rulebook
If that's what it takes
You will see
I will crush this cold machine

The Diplomat:
This is not over
I am sure we will find a way
Out of this desperate situation

This is not over
Even if it all seems hopeless
For in the end we'll cross this bridge
Together

The Biologist:
I can feel it in the air
The signs are everywhere
Communications' ground to a halt
Traffic has stopped
Defenceless and frail
Planes crashing down
We're getting closer to
The day the world breaks down
