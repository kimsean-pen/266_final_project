Dear citizens of the New Fallout
For too long, our society has succumbed to the tyranny of our own actions
Wars, riots, we have tolerated the scum and have graciously cleaned up the mess
Well, no more

You have all been a consequence of the disease known as freedom
And now it is time to take that freedom away
As of today, you will be stripped of your identity and anything you hold dear in life
For it is your individuality that has led to your destruction

Your children will be left to rot as punishment for your indiscretion
And the lives you have lived until now will be nothing but a memory
This is for the survival of the race
This is for the New Fallout, this is the end

In the darkest night, the faintest light is blinding
In the darkest night, the faintest light is blinding

For my fallen stars
Banner men, ready for your call to arms
And for my broken heart
It's time to take back what we thought we lost

For my fallen stars
Banner men, ready for your call to arms
And for my broken heart
It's time to take back what we thought we lost

This is the resistance, it's a call to arms
The anthem for all those who don't belong, we're here to take our stand
This is the resistance, it's been far too long and we put all our faith into the corrupt
It's time to start the end
