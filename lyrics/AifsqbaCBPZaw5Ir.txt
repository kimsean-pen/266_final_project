I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
I have a fireball inside of my head
True from the flesh to the bones I drain
And whenever the darkness knows your strike
And I survived with the burn to the ground
