When I saw you in the morning
You were on your way to work
I bought you coffee cause I like the way you talk

It's kinda funny that the things
I know there made of your perfume
Never dreamed be here lying next to you

Strawberry afternoons by your side
We feels it flowers blue
In the sunshine
And when we kiss
Is there place?
Strawberry afternoons

Strawberry afternoons by your side
We feels it flowers blue
In your sunshine
And when we kiss
Is there place?
Strawberry afternoons

One step, two step, freeze too much
One step, two step, that's enough
One step, two step, freeze too much
One step, two step, that's enough

Cause I love the way you are
When you're here lying in my arms
Close to my heart

Strawberry afternoons by your side
We feels it flowers blue
In your sunshine
And when we kiss
Is there place?
Strawberry afternoons
Strawberry afternoons
