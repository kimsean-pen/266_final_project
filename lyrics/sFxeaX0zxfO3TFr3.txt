What does that whispy little brat have that you don't have double?

She can't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile

How about a pulse?

Overrated by a mile

Overbearing

Overblown

If he only knew the you that we know

And that silly little creature isn't wearing his ring

And she doesn't play piano

Or dance

Or sing

No she doesn't compare

But she still breathes air

Who cares?

Unimportant

Overrated

Overblown

If only he could see
How special you can be
If he only knew the you that we know

If I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
If you cut me with a knife it's still the same
And I know her heart is beating
And I know that I am dead
Yet the pain here that I feel
Try and tell me it's not real
For it seems that I still have a tear to shed

The sure redeeming feature
From that little creature
Is that she's alive

Overrated

Overblown

Everybody know that's just a temporary state
Which is cured very quickly when we meet our fate

Who cares?

Unimportant

Overrated

Overblown

If only he could see
How special you can be
If he only knew the you that we know

If I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
In the ice or in the sun it's all the same
Yet I feel my heart is aching
Though it doesn't beat it's breaking
And the pain here that I feel
Try and tell me it's not real
I know that I am dead
Yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed
