Now put your money where your mouth is
You have the method but will you move mountains
This has become quite a vehicle
With a room for aggrandized egos

You have adapted to the role
Your portrait betrays your soul
Wherever you may go
May your heart's dream bring you home

I can see the sequence
Transhuman influence
I maintain observance
Focused on radiance
You remain in silence
Language omniscient
Driving us to violence
Devoid of intelligence

They backed you into the corner
Provoked your will
For them brink, you return to them stronger
Here and when you're willing
The sound of one hand killing

The sound of one hand killing
... killing

You are being hunted
Subject to summoning a landslide
You have adultered the alter
Of a faceless serpentine coil of a riddle

As you can imagine
We are pulling every last stop
We will not falter, you offer
To the people consistently caught in the middle

I've sent for you and the coast is clear
(How long will I be waiting
waiting, how long will I be waiting waiting)
Climbing up to the top, gonna meet you there
(How long will I be waiting
waiting, how long will I be waiting waiting)
For you

Up on your feet
Darling dear
May the gods guide you right back here
Without you here
It's not home
May you find what you're looking for
An inner peace
The infinite
May it burn through your deepest fear
Without punch
There's no show
May you hold them accountable

They backed you into the corner
Provoked your will
For them brink, you return to them stronger
Here and when you're willing
The sound of one hand killing

They backed you into the corner
Provoked your will
For them brink, you return to them stronger
Here and when you're willing
The sound of one hand killing

(How long will I be waiting
waiting, how long will I be waiting waiting)
