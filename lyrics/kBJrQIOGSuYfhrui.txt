Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shining once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run
Every time I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
The sweeter the brew
The feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun

I can be your trouble
Shivering to you
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
The sweeter the brew
The feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

When it comes to closing in
Reject
'Cause I gotta move
And the simple things
Get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
The sweeter the brew
The feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
The sweeter the brew
The feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black
