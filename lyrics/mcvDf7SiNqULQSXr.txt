Run to the water and see
No one knows except for me
And I know time has come
So run to the water, baby run

Take my hand, I'll give you strength
Guide you home to your forgotten lands
See the world that's at your feet
If you close your eyes, you'll never see the deep

Run to the water baby, run to the water
Run to the water baby, run

Run to the water baby
Run to the water baby, run
