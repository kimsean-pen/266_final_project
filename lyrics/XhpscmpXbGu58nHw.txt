If I had ever been here before
I would probably know just what to do
Don't you?

If I had ever been here before on another time around the wheel
I would probably know just how to deal
With all of you

And I feel
Like I've been here before
Feel
Like I've been here before
And you know it makes me wonder
What's going on under the ground
Do you know?
Don't you wonder?
What's going on
Down under you

We have all been here before
We have all been here before

We have all been here before
We have all been here before

We have all been here before
We have all been here before
