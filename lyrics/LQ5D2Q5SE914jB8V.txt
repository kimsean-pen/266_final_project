Oh I know sometimes you want to give it up
And I'm trying to hold you down but it's getting rough
And the rug burns on my knees won't be enough

I'll lay you down and feed you Poland Spring
I could build a home
Restore the high ceiling
But the potted plants and succulents will mean nothing

Oh your eyes keep spilling oceans onto me
You bawl like you just want a whole new team
I come by you chuck deuces and you leave

You slide in close and stroke my fingertips
The taste of mango dripping from your lips
I close my eyes and watch your routine flip (flip)
