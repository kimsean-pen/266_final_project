I see a blue lake folding, I hear a new age dawning

There's a new direction in the way we see our lives to be
Mysteriously everything's changing making way for spring

I see a new day dawning, I feel a new wave forming

There's a new place we can take among the leaves, among the trees
But until we leave all in all, all is all that we perceive
