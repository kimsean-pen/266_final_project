Gone
Gone

On two legs, but my feet never touched the ground
I got my head in the soil, leave no prints to be found
The nature's strength, the wonder who I am
(Gone)
A weakening force, all echoes from my past

Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

(Shala)
And the battle goes on
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the songs that you sang
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone

Sh!
(Will be here when you are gone)

This mouth on me, and this voice against time
(Gone)
Be brave and free or be wing clipped and grimed
(Gone)
This weakening noise will fade softly to silence

(Shala)
And the battle goes on
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the songs that you sang
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the battle goes on
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the songs that you sang
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the hurt that you felt will be here when you are gone

One final moment as I stay awake
As the air I breathe will make a change of space
(Gone)
They'll never know, they'll never feel the ache
The drips of salt you're tasting off my face
The nature's strength, the wonder who I am
(Shala, shala, shala)

(Shala)
And the battle goes on
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the songs that you sang
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the battle goes on
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
(Shala)
And the songs that you sang
(Shala, shala, shala)
And the hurt that you felt will be here when you are gone

Gone
(And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt
Will be here when you are gone
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt
Will be here when you are gone)
