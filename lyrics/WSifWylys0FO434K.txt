Sick and tired of getting older
I keep getting lost trying to find my way
Looking for love in every corner
night after night
but every street light looks the same

So I'm taking the chance, walking away, breaking the rules
nobody here can tell me what to do

I'm out on my own, making my way
trying to be someone that I can be proud of one day
Im out on my own, doing it my way

I gotta be tough, gotta be stronger
and take the time to understand
This city cant get any colder
stab you in the back while shaking your hand

So I'm taking the chance, walking away, breaking the rules
nobody here can tell me what to do

I'm out on my own, making my way
trying to be someone that I can be proud of one day
Im out on my own, doing it my way
doing it my own way

Taking the chance, walking away, breaking the rules
nobody here can tell me what to do

I'm out on my own, making my way
trying to be someone that I can be proud of one day
I'm out on my own
doing it my way
doing it my way
doing it my own way
