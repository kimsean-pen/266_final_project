Don't you worry 'cause it's alright
Don't you worry, child of the night
'Cause in the morning
Come with the new day sun
Love, an everlasting light

We are the seed of the new breed
We'll succeed our time has come
We are the new, these words are true
Let the light of love shine through

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's really, alright, it's alright
It's really, alright

Alright, alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright it's ready alright

No, don't be so sad
'Cause love is by your side
No, don't be so sad
'Cause life is too short to live

No, don't be so sad
I'll be mad if you're this
It's alright
The message that I give

Listen to me
Dreams can come true
Call out to love
It will answer you

Forget your trouble and smile
Let your heart speak awhile
Let the light of love shine through

Take your nightmare
Change to dream
Flow in the rhythm like a stream
Fear no evil, fear no man

Open up the mind
And the beats goes bam
Rhythm rolling, running smooth
Just like a little love

Sent to soothe
Ease the pressure, let it all go
Don't be afraid, let the feeling flow
