And it's slipping through your hands
As the weight comes crashing down
And the pain is hard to take
As your world it starts to break

When you run against the grain
Every step is hard to make
the heat it takes its toll
When there's nowhere safe to go

Well you ran against the grain
And there's only you to blame
And this life takes its toll
When you're a face that no one knows

And it's slipping through your hands
As the weight comes crashing down
And the pain is hard to take
As your world it starts to break
