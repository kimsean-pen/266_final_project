(Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah!)
(I want more)
Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I
We don't need to over think this
Nothing's gonna bring us down
(Let's) show them what we're all about

All the way. 101 percent. touchdown
We gonna kill it. lead the pack. gon' take this town
()
Let's go whatcha wanna wait for
Let's take everything we asked for

C'mon and turn it up. let's tell them what we want
More More More
Let's go take over the dance floor You be mine and I will be yours
C'mon and let it play. and let me hear you say
More More More
Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothing's in my ear
Till the walls just disappear
Feel the music take you higher
Feel my heart beat like a drum
baby you're the only one

All the way 101 percent touchdown
We gonna kiss it. lead the pack. gon' take this town
