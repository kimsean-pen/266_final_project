I gotta bone to pick something I started noticing about you
I get suspicious
You switched up all your lipstick for something new
You claim you're innocent, you say I'm losing it and you're right
But I saw you getting out of a Mazda Miata last night...
That ain't your ride

I'll never get by on just enough
I'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
You got me on the side with half a love
But now can't see that it's...

You and me and somebody else
Is it two or three, I never could tell
Something's just not adding up between
You and me and somebody else
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out

And in the bedroom you're trying all these new tricks I don't know
(Where'd you get that from?)
Phone blowing up, but none of your friends are 310

I'll never get by on just enough
I'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
You got me on the side with half a love
But now can't see that it's...

You and me and somebody else
Is it two or three, I never could tell
Something's just not adding up between
You and me and somebody else
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out

Give you one reason why I should stay, cuz girl I feel played
I thought it was me and you, not the two of us and some dude
I know that you were free,
But I never knew a couple was supposed to be three
What am I waiting for, another heartbreak I can't afford, no more

I'll never get by on just enough
I'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
You got me on the side with half a love
(a love, a love, a love)

You and me and somebody else
Is it two or three, I never could tell
Something's just not adding up between
You and me and somebody else
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out, count me out
Count me out
