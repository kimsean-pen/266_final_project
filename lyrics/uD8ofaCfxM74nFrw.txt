Tell me
How can one live
When all they hear is
Useless, worthless, give up?
Defeat
Coursing through a shattered heart
Will he ever find love again?

And then I heard your voice
Time
Won't change the way I feel
Changes
They're telling us to trust what's real
Show us what is real

Once unclaimed
Once unloved
This is where we make our stand
Nothing can hold me back

I've met my Father
I've met my Maker
Left alone at birth
Wanting to feel something real
Bearing the scars to show
That abandonment won't be his ending
He met his Father

Time
Won't change the way I feel
Changes
They're telling us to trust what's real
Time
Won't change the way I feel
Changes
They're telling us to trust what's real
