For all the homies doing time, look alive
For every tear your momma cried, look alive
The way the five 0 arrive, look alive
Everybody look alive, look alive

You ain't ready
Some always on the run
Steady chasing us for fun
When the neighbourhood in pieces
They say to pray and look to Jesus
Light a candle with the son
Because we lost another one
Got us pledging our allegiance
To a hand that doesn't feed us
Preach

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands just like Ali
Black Panther, white walker
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire
You know sometimes you gotta

Burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down
When no one's innocent
Burn it down
I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run

If we live behind the lines
That they be keeping us aside
And if heaven knows the devil
Then the hell is where we'll settle
If I had to pick a side
It's either one until I die
We the necessary evil
For all these fake angelic people

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands just like Ali
Black Panther, white walker
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire
You know sometimes you gotta

Burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down
When no one's innocent
Burn it down
I am a gun on the run

Fight for survival but he was dead on arrival
So we gon' fight for survival until we're dead
Put me in front of the gun

Fight for survival, but he was dead on arrival
So we gon' fight for survival until we're dead
Put me in front of the gun

Bang, ang
Put me in front of the gun

You know sometimes you gotta
Burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down
When no one's innocent
Burn it down

We point our fingers while they point their guns
Bullets they miss us, we guns on the run
So burn it down
And build it up again
Burn it down
I am a gun on the run

We still killers
I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run
