Many too many
Living their fears
Only few won't fade away.

Not too many
Facing their tears
When sunrise outshines the grey.

Che couldn't see the world within her hands,
So beautiful
No one could hear the silence calling her.

Missed forever, wonder why
Close and far, as you and I
Like ice flowers trapped in time.

What if I could rescue us
If I could fight back life
Break my pride
For a moment in time.

Many too many
Living their fears
Only few won't fade away.

Not too many
Facing their tears
When sunrise outshines the grey.

He coludn't heal the broken memories
A sacrifice
No one could read the silence in his eyes.

Just a canvas in the sky
Perfect sunset long denied
Spirit's flying
Birds that cease their wanderlust
Fall.

What if I could rescue us
If I could fight back life
Break my pride
For a moment in time
I could reach the sun
I could touch the stars
And you'd stay
For a moment in time.

Many too many
Living their fears
Only few won't fade away.

Not too many
Facing their tears
When sunrise outshines the grey.
