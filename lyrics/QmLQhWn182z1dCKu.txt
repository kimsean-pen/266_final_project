Slow down
Slow down
Do you see
Through me?

There's no doubt
There's no way out
For you & me
Eternally

Wake now
Sleeper
I heard an echo through
A universal truth

Break down
You're going to break down
Cuts straight through
I'm gonna break down too

Just come back
Halo

So long
So long
It's only
temporary

Hold on
Won't be for long
Longing to be
In your memory

Wake now
Sleeper
I Heard an echo through
A universal truth

Break down
You're gonna break down
Cuts straight through
I'm gonna break down too

Just come back
Halo
