I feel a strange sensation
Taking over from my head to my toes

I got the shakes by rippling
And it's enough to shatter my bones
Is it all a dream 'cause I don't wanna stay awake
But I won't remember a thing
And now it's running through my veins
I don't know what's happening, beat's so sick

Running from the madhouse
They won't take me back
Ain't got the medicine to give me what I need
Yes, I'm burning up
But music is my drug
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream
They're coming for me
They're coming for me

Everywhere I look, I'm sI got blood-shot eyes

I'm like a fugitive trying to climb the walls
But my hands are tied
Just one touch
And I'm infected by the sound
Crawling all over my skin and the sky is falling down
I don't know what's happening, beat's so sick

Running from the madhouse
They won't take me back
Ain't got the medicine to give me what I need
Yes, I'm burning up
But music is my drug
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream
They're coming for me, they're coming for me
They're coming for me, oh
Men in white coats

(Coats)
Getting so close
(Close)
Saying my prayers, don't take me back there
Men in white
(Coats)
Getting so close
(Close)

Saying my prayers, don't take me back
Take me back
Take me back there

They're coming for me
Running from the madhouse
They won't take me back
Ain't got the medicine to give me what I need
Yes, I'm burning up
But music is my drug
Doesn't matter if I shout
Or if I scream
They're coming for me
It's like I'm running round
I just can't find my way
(I don't wanna go there)
And they can't hear my voice
Don't matter how I scream, they're coming for me yeah
