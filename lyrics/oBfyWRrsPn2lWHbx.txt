Try to imagine a house that's not a home.
Try to imagine a Christmas all alone.
That's where I'll be
Since you left me.
My tears could melt the snow.
What can I do
Without you
I've got no place, no place to go

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold.
It'll be cold so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas

Each time I remember the day you went away.
And how I would listen to the things you had to say.
I just break down, as I look around
And the only things I see
Are emptiness and loneliness
And an unlit Christmas Tree.

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold.
It'll be cold so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas

You remember last year, when you and I were together
We never thought there'd be an end
And I remember looking at you then
And I remember thinking that Christmas must have been made for us
'Cos darlin', this is the time that you really need love
When it means so very very much.

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold.
It'll be cold so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas

Merry Christmas darlin', wherever you are.
