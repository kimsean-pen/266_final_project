Geology is digging through my brain
A manta engulfing the world
To throw it up once again
To a guild of lifted daggers

Neo-wolf, but older again
Than the Lupus itself
Linked its fur to the Gyroscope of time
A collection of failures

A diabolical sequence of stabs
Written in cutting stone
From the fossilized den of thieves
Our lives die

Neo-wolf, but older again
Than the Lupus itself
Linked its fur to the Gyroscope of time
A collection of failures

I see the nursing all mother
Spitting out a trail of termites
In the mouth of her first born hope
With smog-filled rebellion

Apathy dressed in violence
White, insectoid legs
Curse her lips and her mouth receptive
Only to pain

Neo-wolf, but older again
Than the Lupus itself
Linked its fur to the Gyroscope of time
A collection of failures
