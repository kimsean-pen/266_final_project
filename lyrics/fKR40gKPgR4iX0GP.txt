When hail and fire
Falls down to the earth
It turns the world into dust,
smoke and debris

When the burning mountain
Plunges into the sea
As the ocean fill with blood
There's no way to flee

Help, help, help!
Help, help, help!

The trumpets are playing
Announcing the end
And while we are praying the heavens descend
The land that we walk will be swallowed by sea
With seven waves we'll cease to be

By the sound of thunder
The prophecy is complete
As the ground under our feet
Slides into the deep

Help, help, help!
Help, help, help!

The trumpets are playing
Announcing the end
And while we are praying the heavens descend
The land that we walk will be swallowed by sea
With seven waves we'll cease to be
