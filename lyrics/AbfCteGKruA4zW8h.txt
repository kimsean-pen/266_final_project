You take a piece of me every time you leave
and never realize that way I feel about you
my tongue gets tied and my mouth gets dry
I wanna tell you but I don't know how to

But through every night I dream
hope and pray and believe
that someday you and I will live in ecstasy
the world for you and me

One love, one life
everything would be alright if I was your lover
one soul, one life'
everything would be alright if I was your lover

Another day goes by and it blows my mind
if I didn't know that you were meant for me
under the moonlit night when the time is right
you hold me in your arms from here to infinity

But through every night I dream
hope and pray and believe
that someday you and I will live in ecstasy
the world for you and me

[With ad lib]One love, one life
everything would be alright if I was your lover
one soul, one life'
everything would be alright if I was your lover

[SPOKEN:]
If I was your lover I'd hold you in my arms from dusk 'til
dawn
if I was your lover one night would last for eternity if
we were together

But every night I dream
hope and pray and believe, yeah
so happy cause you're mine
we'll live in ecstasy, the world for you and me

One love, one life
everything would be alright if I was your lover
one soul, one life'
everything would be alright if I was your lover

One love, one life
everything would be alright if I was your lover
one soul, one life'
everything would be alright if I was your lover
