Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
Cause you're out of view

Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying, but I cannot save you

I can't
City to city, a young legend fulfilling my dreams shattering ceilings
It got me feeling myself
Look how I'm fitting the belt, they never give me a chance
I never give 'em a breath, keep a foot on they neck
I go deep to the depts, submerged in it
I'm getting the urge, nigga
I'm killing these niggas off, call me the purge
I just been peelin' the feelings off
Layers of inner thoughts, you're playin' 'em in your car
But really you're in my head like Yamaka synagogues
Bassy been a problem they probably never could solve
Like me at the bottom, they probably got
Better odds than knockin' the rings off of Saturn
Find it hard to settle, I want it all forever
The speech, it don't get me bothered and the streets
You ain't get involved in
Y'all sweet like some kindergarteners
I got heat and I'm feeling heartless, heartless
I been making all these songs just for you to hear
Get these niggas outta here like the Uber here
'Bout to switch another gig, kill another year
Gang Dreamville run the game and we come for anything, man
If we ask, they abide, pain from the sacrifice
Had to leave my other half on the side
I just laugh when my stock on the rise
Stack all this cash, couldn've overdraft if I tried

I need to reset myself (without you)
I won't neglect myself (with-without you)
I had to test myself (without you)
I think I'm at my best (with without you)
Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (you)

I can't
These pups ain't war-ready
Getting lost in the city like Doc Gooden, Strawberry
When the block hottel Cosby I got puddin' already
In the drop top, bitch hop in it all ready
Yelling "fuck the cops," middle fingers to the opps
Stop with it already, our efforts get nothing but aftershock
Crampin' my style but I got hot with already
This for the phony in his sleep
Throwin' up goat emojis, niggas lookin' like some sheep
Presidential Rollie on me, bitch, I'm rollin' like a sheik
You ain't know, gettin' low, I coulda caught you on my sleeve
Took my girls to Japan, do some shopping' and, man
I could show you new options
Do what you want when you poppin'
Made a few loan to my partners to out a hole in your top
Just to spend a week in Colombia fuckin' hoes, eating tapas
Damn, if we ain't home they adopt us
[I live round here, I live round here]

I need to reset myself (without you)
I won't neglect myself (without you)
I had to test myself (without you)
I think I'm at my best (with without you)

Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying but I cannot save (you)

Caught up with the audience
Caught up with the audience
Cause you're out of view

Boom, like a tidal wave
I'm trying, but I cannot save you
