he lies, but she smiles when she cries, because she was fine
she washes her sorrow away with the cyanide
lay flat on the floor, there was nothing she sacrificed
sadly it takes years for her to realize, darling
he lies, but she smiles when she cries because she was fine
she washes her sorrow away with the cyanide
lay flat on the floor, there was nothing she sacrificed
sadly it takes years for her to realize, darling

now just turn it off, she screams.
turn it off please
she kicks and she pounds at the door, until her knuckles bleed
she never recalls the time, she made her mother cry
they say she'd be still if we realized before, darling
