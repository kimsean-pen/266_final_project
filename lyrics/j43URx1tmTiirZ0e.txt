H-a-a-a-a-a...
Shadows falling baby
We stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet
Got a heartache of their own
(it oughta to be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad...
(it oughta to be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine... we take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love
Will climb any mountain
Near or far
We are and we never let it end...
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we... got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
A-a-a-h...
O-o-o-o... W-o-o-o... h-h-h...
Pulse's racing darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
(it oughta to be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
(it oughta to be illegal)
You got a reason for livin' you battle on
With the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine we take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love
Will climb any mountain
Near or far
We are and we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we (that we) that we
Got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love, our love
(will climb any mountain) Near or far
Near or far
We are we are and we never let it end
O-o-o-h... we never
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for, sorry for
Our love, our love
(is one in a million)
Eyes can see that we (that we) that we
Got a highway to the sky
We got a highway we got a highw... ay...
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of guilty of
Our love, our love
(will climb any mountain)
Near or far
O-o-o-h...
We are
That we never
