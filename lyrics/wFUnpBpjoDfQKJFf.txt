Sleep now under my skin
Make sure you'll try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind

Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Ooh ooh ooh
You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fcked up by the blame

You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
Let it pass away

Sleep now under my skin
Make sure you try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind

And I said
Ooh ooh ooh...
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Ooh ooh ooh
You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fcked up by the blame

You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
Let it pass away

You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
Let it pass away

Wait there
Pull yourself out of this state dear
Acknowledge you were a fake here
From there on you might just grow
Oh oh oh

Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Ooh ooh ooh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Ooh ooh ooh
You couldn't help out your own neighbor
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fcked up by the blame
