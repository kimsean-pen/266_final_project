To my love,
You will see me fall down into trenches but just go on and leave me.
You don't leave me that way
you'll find a love to blind you.

To My love,
You will find that wounds are a plenty and as they heal you'll find
the beauty in the scars. My love,
you will find that wounds are so empty.
Just leave my love love behind you 'll find a love to blind you.

I just want you to know that I do not feel nothing when I say
I've got to go and leave you this
way you'll find a love to blind you.

If I go away I won't go far 2x
I won't go far 2x

Still our days,
they are so many we're still young. Just give into now.
And how will you ever see all of the things you
could have done when you find a love to blind you.
When you find a love to blind you
When you find a love to blind you
When you find a love to blind you
