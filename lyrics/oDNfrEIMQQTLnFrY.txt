Here comes the flood again
Watch it fall from the sky
Feel it soak through my flesh and my blood
Feel it burn in my eyes

When I say how much more can I take
I know the water's rising up
Watch the waves crest and break
And though I may not make a sound
I fear that I may drown
I fear that I may drown

Here comes the wind again
Cold that cuts to the bone
Pack my bags and I'll head out the door
Here I am on my own

When I say how much more can I stand?
I know my walls are falling down
I let the rocks who chose the sand
And though I know one left to blame
Still I cursed your name
I cursed your name

So now the end
What I've been running from
Though I've tried I cannot lift my head
Oh what have I become

When I say how much more can I take?
I know my time is running short
I am broken and I'm breaking
Though I've worn myself so thin
Coming home again

And though I do not know my heart
But I know myself into my bones
But if my bones should come apart
Then I'll have nothing left to give
But if you take me in
Coming home again

And if you take me in
Coming home again
