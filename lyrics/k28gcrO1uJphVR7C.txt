You felt the coldness in my eyes
And something I'm not revealing
Though you got used to my disguise
It can't shake this awful feeling
It's the me that I let you know
Cause I never show, I have my reasons
I hate to say that I told you so
But I told you so
Yeah!

There's blood on my hands
Like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So, don't make me, don't make me
Be myself around you

Straight from you eyes
It's barely me, beautifully so disfigured
This other side that you can't see
Just praying you won't remember
Feel the pain that I never show
And I hope you know, it's never healing
I hate to say that I told you so
But I told you so

Yeah!

There's blood on my hands
Like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So, don't make me, don't make me
Be myself around you

Straight from your eyes
It's barely me; beautifully so disfigured
This other side that you can't see
Just praying you won't remember

There's blood
There's blood
There's blood, blood, blood

There's blood on my hands
Like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So, don't make me, don't make me
Be myself around you

(There's blood) There's blood on my hands
(There's blood) Like the blood in you
(There's blood) Some things can't be treated
(There's blood) So, don't make me, don't make me
Be myself around you

There's blood!

([Whispering:] Is it really that hard for you to believe?)
