Tonight
I feel like
I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
You found my heart
Tonight
I feel like
I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
Yeah, you're my oasis

I am stuck in quicksand
And I am trying not to drown
Fell in deeper this time
And I'm struggling to get out
And doubt creeps into my soul
And now, I found there's nothing left to hold

Tonight
I feel like
I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
Yeah, you're my oasis
Oasis

I thought I'd die, I had no fight, I had given up
Thought I was done, I was savaged by the sun
I thought I'd die, I had no fight, I had turned to dust
When I came to your arms
I knew I would make it through

Tonight
I feel like
I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
You found my heart

Tonight
I feel like
I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
Yeah you're my oasis
