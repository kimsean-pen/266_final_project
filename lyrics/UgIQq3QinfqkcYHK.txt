Behold!
this ancient ritual, this divine act.
The one clear way to transcend the boundaries of the corporeal plane is to merge our flesh.
The co-mingling of our physical beings opens the doorways to the ethers, to vivid truth.
I consume you and, in turn, I am consumed by you.
Love is the law, love under will.
The purest connection, the strongest bond.
All of the struggles, the weaknesses and faults, slip away.
All of the masks, the anger and secrecy, slip away.
Essence unveiled.
The universe revealed*
