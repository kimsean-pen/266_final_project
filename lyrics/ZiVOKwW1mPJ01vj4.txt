You can ride
High atop your pony
I know you won't fall
'Cause the whole thing's phoney
You can fly swinging
From your trapeze

Scaring all the people
But you'll never scare me

My Bella donna
And we fight for the Northern Star
No speed limit, this is the fast lane

It's just the way that it is here
And you say

I never thought it could
Bella donna
And we fight for the Northern Star
And the lady's feeling
Just like the moon that she loved
Don't you know that the stars

Are a part of us?
Oh, and the lady's feelings
Like the moon that she loved

And you say
That I never thought it could
My Bella donna
Come in and out of the darkness

You are in love with

And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
Sort of captures your soul
Bella donna

And the woman may be so awestruck

And the woman may truly care

But the woman is so tired
So the woman disappears
Come in, out of the darkness
Bella donna, my soul
Don't change, baby
Please don't change
And you say and your face becomes thin
And you never thought it could
Come in out of the darkness
Bella donna
You are in love with
I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
