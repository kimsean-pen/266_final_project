Open eyed oversight led me to here.
Looking for an avenue to simply appear.
One too many steps into the wrong direction leading me to throw up my hands.
Soon I'll know exactly where I stand.
Found in a flood of incendiary plans.
Oh, I've been falling fast into the rhythms without rhymes.
I won't be giving up again.
Yeah, I'll be getting up again.
I heard a voice it said "E dolor e magna gloria".
Bring me your heart and then you will awake in a state of surprising euphoria.
But don't tell anyone.
I wasn't wrong to fend their ambiguity.
Then I learned to turn emotions into weaponry.
One too many word said with the wrong inflection leading me to throw up my hands.
Am I giving up the ghost again?
Surrendering so that my evils will amend.
Oh, I've been falling fast into the space between the lines.
But I'll be getting up again.
I won't be giving up again.
I heard a voice it said "E dolor e magna gloria".
Bring me your heart and then you will awake in a state of surprising euphoria.
But don't tell anyone what you saw here.
Now I never heard that sound before.
I am nothing but an infant wave stuck in a savage ocean.
