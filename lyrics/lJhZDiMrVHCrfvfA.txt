Retaliator born from a wrath and raised by rage
Courageous and fearless with vengeance ahead

Retribution ferocious and dire,
Hatred like fire
Ignite the flames of detest and with strength ablaze

Rise
No kneeling or repentance
No self sacrifice
It's an eye for an eye

Blood for blood
From suffering into submission
Towards total reprisal

Desecration with no remorse, violate and defile
The ones who spilled the blood of the innocents
Acts so dreadful and vile

Sacrilegious deed, sin against the life
Sacred and hallowed

I am the nemesis
I am the destroyer
I am eternal fire
