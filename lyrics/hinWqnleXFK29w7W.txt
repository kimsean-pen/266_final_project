Don't you know that
I'll be around to guide you
Through your weakest moments
To leave them behind you

Returning nightmares
Only shadows
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
For now

Crosses all over
Heavy on your shoulders
The sirens inside you
Waiting to step forward

Disturbing silence
Darkens your sight
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now

Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard

The streets outside your window
Over flooded
People staring
They know you've been broken

Repeatedly reminded
By the looks on their faces
Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright
Cast some light and you'll be alright
