I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front proch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with two stroke
I got some 'guaranteed make ya laugh' jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk

I got a girl, her name's Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
I got a job, it gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on the wall for a good time call
I'm a local legend on Friday night
With past blue ribbon and a neon light

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk

I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk

I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down to the honkytonk
I go down
I go down to the honkytonk
