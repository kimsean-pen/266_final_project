i travel around the world
just to kiss you
through airport terminals
and neon lights, i sift through
one hundred thousand miles
of swift motion and devotion
in taxi cabs, i ride
through traffic and commotion

touching your perfect face
i fall into you
as our love fills the reaches of space
i dive into you

i'm channeling heat waves
of electricity
hitch-hiking on the noise
with melting frequencies

as snow caps tease the sky
i call out your name
and the land begins to fall
under my waking dreams

no amount of distance can ever come between us
