I am letting you go
I am letting you go
I am letting you go awry

It was more than a race
More than the wind
Chasing the flood
You opened the gate

And fate is a sundress
Ripped at the thigh
Thigh high and safety net
Swarmed by the hornets' nest
To cover my eyes

It was more a mirage
In sickness and health
I showed you a body
Like a cluttered garage

I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
Humbled by breaking down
Humbled by breaking down

I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
I am humbled by breaking down
Humbled by breaking down
Humbled by breaking down
