Two roads split off from here
and my life goes running in opposite directions.

Exaggerating the barrier between who I am
and who I want to be.
I wanted to be the breath of fresh air

When everything smelled so insincere.
But this taste still lingers in my mouth
Deceit has ways of sticking around
And I'm ready to disappear
Vacation seems so far (so far) from here.
Note to self:

I miss you terribly
This is what
we call a tragedy.
Come back to me

Come back to me
To me.
Note to self:
I miss you terribly

This is what
we call a tragedy

Come back to me
back to me
To me.
I can feel my mind
wandering again.
Into what I don't know.
And will I ever get home?
Time starts moving
faster than I can.
And I'm sick of this scene
I need to break the routine.
I can feel my mind
wandering again.
Into what I don't know.
And will I ever get home?
Time starts moving
faster than I can.
And I'm sick of this scene
I need to break the routine.
Two roads...
split off from here
and my life goes running in opposite directions.
Exaggerating the barrier between who I am
and who I want to...
Which part of me is left?
I feel so close
And yet I am so far.
Which part of me is lost?
I feel so close
And yet I am so... FAR!
