Every Tuesday and every
other Friday or so,
She says meet me
in the garden boy (yes maam)
Miss Caroline

The softest boy in Mississippi
would like to know,
why you so pretty?
wow oh oh

Out by the pond a beautiful
blonde waits for me

Just say the word and
I'll be there (be there)
I'll fly like a bird
We can travel through the
air

Every Tuesday and every
other Friday or so,
She says meet me
in the garden boy (yes maam)
I only hurt you cause I love you

Now All the birds and flowers will
go in time
Tonight that I was with
Miss Caroline

Under the oak,
she's having a smoke
just for me

Just say the word and
I'll be there (be there)
I'll fly like a bird
We can travel through the
air

Awa
Meet me alone in the garden
Excuse me I beg your pardon,
I'm young but I can do things
I'll fly away with my wings

Well Out by the pond
a beautiful blonde waits for me

Just say the word and
I'll be there (be there)
I'll fly like a bird
We can travel through the
air

La La La,
