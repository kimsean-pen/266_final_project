The sun goes down and the colors are replaced
In the darkness I await your invisible embrace
I lead a double life, secretive ways
We're following the lights but we're lost in the haze

Sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins

I drive through the trees to the hiss of your name
I'll meet you in the moonlight to experience again
Nothing lasts forever, we don't need much
To take us to the sun is just a midnight touch

Sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins
It's a one way ticket to the city of sins
The sun goes down and the double life begins

I'm thinking of the night through the middle of the day
I'm dying to escape and I just can't wait
Love is replaced by a bright burning light
It's pulling me in to the city tonight

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins
It's a one way ticket to the city of sins
The sun goes down and the double life begins

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins
It's a one way ticket to the city of sins
The sun goes down and the double life begins
Double life begins

We don't care, we don't sleep, we don't think, we don't feel
We don't dream, we don't hide, we don't cheat, we don't lie
We don't care, we don't sleep, we don't think, we don't feel
We don't dream, we don't hide, we don't cheat, we don't lie

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins
It's a one way ticket to the city of sins
The sun goes down and the double life begins

The sun goes down and the double life begins
Sun goes down and the double life begins
It's a one way ticket to the city of sins
The sun goes down and the double life begins

Double life begins
