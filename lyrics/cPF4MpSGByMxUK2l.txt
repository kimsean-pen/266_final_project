Would you believe this
Do you even have time for me
There is something I want to say
But the question is, do I ever dare to ask
Disable the mire of our souls
Who do we think we are
Who do we think we are

I'm praying for that day to come
I'm praying for a sunrise
The great awakening
And I'm praying for you to come

How much does it cost
What are the losses
Give me the files of our sins and I will erase them
Neutralize everything that got in your way
You got lost in the loop
You got lost in the loop

I'm praying for that day to come
I'm praying for a sunrise
The great awakening
And I'm praying for you to come

I'm praying for that day to come
I'm praying for a sunrise
The great awakening
And I'm praying for you to come

The last day of our great creator
