How much do I love you?
How hard must we try
To set into motion
A love divine?

I should really give it up sometime
Should've known by the way things started
But I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometime
Nor agree for the broken hearted
Yeah, I should really give it up sometime

Hey, there it goes
Into sun, steam, and marigolds
I am yours, you are mine
Through a lifetime of disagreements
Take me high, take me low
Take me nowhere my poor heart can't follow
Reckless hearts soon collide
Break through a lifetime of stress and evil

I should really give it up sometime
Should've known, couldn't last forever
That I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometime
All I wanted was to love you better
But I should really give it up sometime

Oh, come and get lost, love
I wrestle the tide
Oh, set into motion
Our love divine

How much do I love you?
How hard must we try?
How deep is the ocean?

Rollin' down the way
Rollin' down the way into the fire
