Hey, Monday morning see what you're missing
I can't live my life like this boy
I said, "Hey, little lady see what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love"

She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
Out all alone and out on her own

How many times do I have to say this
Your match is a light for me, babe
I said, "Hey, little lady see what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love"

She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
Out all alone and out on her own

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

The people, the people, the people
Change the way you live now
The people, the people, the people
Change the way you live now

Hey, Monday morning see what you're missing
I can't live my life like this boy
I said, "Hey, little lady see what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love"

She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
She goes out all alone and out on her own
Out all alone and out on her own

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

The people, the people, the people
Change the way you live now
The people, the people, the people
Change the way you live now

I'll never burn in your fire, I'll never burn in your fire
I'll never burn in your fire, I'll never burn
I'll never burn, I'll never burn
I'll never burn, I'll never burn
