You treated me bad,
Now what can i say,
You told me you loved me,
But it never felt that way
I tried so hard to carry on,
But you left me, left me there alone,
Now you're trying to say,
Don't treat you this way

But don't you know, i don't need, i don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh,
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh,
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh

Life doesn't mean nothing to you, (nothing to you)
Cheating and flirting, is all your fit to do
I tried so hard to carry on,
But you left me, left me there alone,
Now you're trying to say,
Don't treat you this way
But don't you know, i don't need, i don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh,
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh,
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh

Don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't
give me your life
Don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't
give me your life oh no

I tried so hard to carry on,
But you left me, left me there alone,
Now you're trying to say,
Don't treat you this way
But don't you know, i don't need, i don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh,
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life,
heyeyeyehuh
Don't give me your life, your life, give me your life.
