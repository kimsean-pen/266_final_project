It's been too long
Maybe now it's time I bite your tongue
Maybe now I do what you've undone
Cause I've forgotten that I used to be someone
And you never seem to listen

You know, you know nothing
Why are we doing anything

I could
I could be your someone
You could be my somebody
Twenty four seven
And it feels like heaven
In your company

It's what I want
Better beat me before I pull the gun
Not submissive like I always was
In your head you think that I won't run
Do you need a definition?

I know body language
Why does he need convincing
(Need convincing)

I could
I could be your someone
You could be my somebody
Twenty four seven
And it feels like heaven
In your company
You could
You could be the problem
I could be the remedy
When you say you're feeling so much better
No apologies

Call it what, call it what
Call it what you want
I am so caught up in all your drama
Leave it out, leave it out
Leave it out, let me go
Maybe now, maybe now
Maybe now you'll let me go

I could
I could be your someone
You could be my somebody
Twenty four seven
And it feels like heaven
In your company
You could
You could be the problem
I could be the remedy
When you say you're feeling so much better
No apologies

You never seem to listen!
