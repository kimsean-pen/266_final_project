Fear tomorrow's adversary
And the wealth of uprising
The final storm will be released
And the unmerciful will erect

Hidden from the eyes of your god
I will proclaim original sin
And have you all purged and purified
From the lies that remain within

Cleansed and draped in sulphur linen
Black and pure since the beginning

Mercy is not truth
Your sins are next to mine
Mercy is not truth
All your sins are next to mine

My soul's ablaze
Inflamed with rage and isolated
In whirlwinds of hate
My soul's ablaze
Yet camouflaged in the haze

Why did he not see this coming
What did he not understand
One time forsaken
But forgotten I am not

I will win this war
But never the peace
I am my own free spirit
Hence I will not rest
