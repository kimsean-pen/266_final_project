Yeah
Hillbilly in Beverly hills
And so?
Drama beats
Hold up
Damn rich, peanut butter guts and a Lamborghini, woah
You must have white bread, lets make a sandwich
Now, I aint never seen money you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks
So if you take me up show me the Balcony look over
The hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you, you need a dude like me
to appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
but with me you appreciate the steps
act like you don't wanna see
how much it is Jack Daniels you can handle
you can drink and get cut like Rambo
let me drive your Daddy's Lambo
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I see you party and would kill entertainment channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
You're young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast?
Girl, you aint never been to Waffle House
Always hanging in Guys and Dolls
If you came to the South,
I'll put you in a Chevrolet and we'd drive to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and a DTA hoodie
But I'm off to the party with rogue
status looking for Beverly Hill goody's
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I can take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
let me see hollywood for real
lights, camera, action
I see you party and kill entertainment channels
one thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your dadda made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping
cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the chart
Money, money, money, money, money
Aint it funny what a hunny and a Lambourghini will do
Some will run into a a hundred dollar bill
and drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with them 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyse my swing
Yeah
It's slick Rick E. Bobby baby
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
let me see hollywood for real
lights, camera, action
I see you party and kill entertainment channels
one thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo
Just whip it around you know
up the hills
I aint gon wreck it, I promise
Sit your drunk ass back
Drama beats
Yelawolf ghetto vision
What's up bro Benee
Fan of fashion Bitch
Holler at G
