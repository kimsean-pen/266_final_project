I don't want control of you
Doesn't matter to me
The very heart and soul of you
Are places I wanna see

Every day I look in a different face
Feelings getting stronger with every embrace

I don't want a world of pain
Sparing every tear
Don't want this love to stay the same
But grow with every year

Every day I look in a different face
Feelings getting stronger with every embrace

Tired of situations
That mean nothing to me
You've been an inspirational figure for me

Every day I look in a different face
Feelings getting stronger with every embrace

I don't want control of you
Doesn't matter to me
Don't want this love to stay the same
But grow with every year

And every day I look in a different face
The feelings getting stronger with every embrace
