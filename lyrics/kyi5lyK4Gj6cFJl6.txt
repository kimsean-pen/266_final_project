My mind makes noises too much
I feel like I'm slowly losing myself
I'm afraid that I need help
Why do I stare so much at my body?
I'm falling, I'm crawling on the floor at night
I know it's not right but you can't fix me this time
What do you see when you look at me?
I can't control my emotions lately
I'm excited, I'm sad
And baby, I've had it
Heather, you're stupid
I think you might've overdone it again
And the faces that you love are slowly giving up
What you gonna do?
What do you see when you look at me?
I can't control my emotions lately
I'm excited, I'm sad
And baby, I've had it
Am I still the same?
'Cause I hate to admit things
Years go by and nothing really seems to change
Is this me?
Tell me who I can be
I look at myself, see what I hate
Create an illusion to melt ya' brain

(What do you see when you look at me?)
What do you see when you look at me?
I can't control my emotions lately
I'm excited, I'm sad
And baby, I've had it
Oh, tell me
What do you see when you look at me?
I can't control my emotions lately
I'm excited, I'm sad
And baby, I've had it
I've had it
I've had it, no
