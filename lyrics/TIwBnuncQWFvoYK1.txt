Man and woman try to keep a tie
While looking at what passes by
Village thieves and all the tramps
Somewhere someone left some gaps
Look before you leap my friend
Should God take you in his hand
It's a very small price for your sins you spend
And there's a man with a pitchfork around the bend
Alright!
The evil churns, you'll start to burn
But will you crack, You can't turn back, oh no
Review all of your choices now
There's no one 'round to show you how
But the hand comin' down has-a reached it's end
You know who's still around the bend
