why don't you take a look in my mouth
why don't you take a look at yourself
so why don't you take a look around
so why don't we take a look inside

roll out the shock parade
free falling from a stage
performance and cocktails
roll up and shine

i hang the devil from a circus wire
face up seats four in love spittin fire
so why don't you take a look around
so why don't we take a look inside

roll out the shock parade
free falling from a stage
performance and cocktails
roll up and shine

it's time to live it's time to love
it's time to do what's afraid of
it's time to breath time to relieve
it's time to shine

so why don't you take look around
so why don't we take a look inside

roll out the shock parade
free falling from a stage
performance and cocktails
roll up and shine

bring on the shock parade
freaks falling from a stage
performance and cocktails
roll up and shine
