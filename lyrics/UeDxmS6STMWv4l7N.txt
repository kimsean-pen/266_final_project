Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey

She was a wild child on the dance floor far away here
I was dragged into her spell
She came to me, an explosion of mystery
Was she real, I couldn't tell

Okay she made me
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay

She was a whirlwind blowing life into the party
Dancing me down the road to hell
She came to me and changed my whole story
My secret love, I couldn't tell

But okay she made me
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
She makes me feel like I could party all night
You can, you can, you can

Will she get there when the night turns to morning?
Be there to pick me up again, up again
Or take me down that path of destruction
No chance of getting home today

Okay she made me
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
She makes me feel like I could party all night
You can, you can, you can
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
She makes me feel like I could party all night
You can, you can, you can, you can

Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey
Eya oh eya oh, eya oh ey

Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
She makes me feel like I could party all night
You can, you can, you can, you can

No stopping now, we move around
And I was down to...
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day-ay-ay
Party all night, party all day, party all day
