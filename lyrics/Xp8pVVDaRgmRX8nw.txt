Hey good lookin', how ya do'in
Would you like some, company
I would like to, get to know ya
I would like to, know your name

Tell me darlin', what's the reason
For such a beauty, to be alone
Can I take you, out on the dance floor
Can I take you, and spin you around
Oh be my lover girl
Oh be my lover girl

Well if I only knew just where to start
I'd tell you how I fell apart
Wound up in this hotel bar
Standin' here right where you are
If I could have a moment of your time
Oh be my lover girl

Tell me baby, what's your secret
Are you new here, to the town
Can I take you, out to the movie
I would like to, hold your hand
Come on and be my lover girl
Come on and be my lover girl

Well if I only knew just where to start
I'd tell you how I fell apart
And wound up sleepin' in my car
That's broken down in the parkin' lot
The scars upon my heart won't hide
But now I found your sparklin' eyes
If I could have a moment of your time
Oh be my lover girl

Hey good lookin, how ya do'in
I know the scene here, is kinda lame
Why don't we ride out, to West Texas
We can get stoned, and blow up some cars
Come on and be my lover girl
Come on and be my lover girl

Well if I only knew just where to start
I'd tell you how I fell apart
Wound up in this hotel bar
Standin' here right where you are
Oh be my lover girl

Be my lover girl
Be my lover girl
Oh be my lover girl
Be my lover girl
Oh won't ya be my lover girl
Oh won't ya, be my lover girl
Be my lover girl
