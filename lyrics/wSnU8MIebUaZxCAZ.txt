Look through me because I am transparent
Her to know me, but why even know yourself
I'm beginning to need all that I can't have
I'm succeeding to speak like I'm fucking mad

Looking at the autumn shade
You am I and I am great
Looking at the autumn shade, oh yeah

Look through me because I am transparent

Looking at the autumn shade
You am I and I am great
Looking at the autumn shade, oh yeah
