I nearly lost you on our wedding day

It was early afternoon, and you were leaving from lunch with your best friend
when your vehicle careened into an SUV as it turned out in front of you,
violently flinging you into the waiting airbag

You were shaken and dazed,
but otherwise ok

and still determined to get married

When I watched you walking down the aisle,
you were glowing

The scrapes and bruises only made you more beautiful
