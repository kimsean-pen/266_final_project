Could a body close the mind out
Stitch a seam across the eye?
If you can be good, you'll live forever
If you're bad, you'll die when you die
Hearing only one true note
On the one and only sound
Unzip my body, take my heart out
'Cause I need a beat to give this tune

Taking a picture of
Taking a picture of
Taking a picture of
{Bang, bang}

Oh, the body swayed to music
Oh, the lightning glance
I would give it all and all
Maybe you would hear me
Ask for half a chance
Hearing only one root note
Planted firmly in the ground
Undo my heart, unzip my body
And lend to my ear a clear
and a deafening sound

Unzip my heart

And if I need a rhythm
It'll be to my heart I listen
If it don't put me too far wrong
And if I, and if I

And if I need a rhythm
It's gonna be to my heart I listen
If it don't put me too far wrong

Everybody smile please
Nobody pay no mind to me
Finger in position on the switch
A little flash photography

Taking a picture of you
(To my heart)
Taking a picture of,
taking a picture of me
Taking a picture

Ramalama bang bang
Flash, bang, big bang
Bing bong, ding dong
Dum dum d-dum dum

With a hammer, bang bang
Flash, bang, press gang
Bing bong, ding dong
Dum dum d-dum dum

With a st-stammer, bang bang
Crash bang, big bang
Boing boing, boing doing
Dum dum d-dum dum

With a st-stammer, the bang bang
(With a st-stammer)
With a st-stammer
(Crash bang, the bing bang)
Crash bang, big bang
(Boing boing, boing doing)
Bing bang, crash bang
(Dum dum d-dum dum)

And if I, and if I need a rhythm
It's gonna be to my heart I listen
And if I, and if I need a rhythm
It's gonna be to my heart I listen
And if I, and if I need a rhythm
It's gonna be to my heart I listen

Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
Need a rhythm
(And if I, and if I)
And if I, and if I need a rhythm
