He wants to be, he wants to be, with everything under the sun
He wants to be, he wants to be, with everything under the sun

Chorus:
And like a legend that rises and unfolds I cannot be his only one

He makes me feel, he makes me feel, like you used to
(Whoa) like you used to
He makes me feel, he makes me feel, like you used to
(Whoa) like you used to

Chorus:
And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
I cannot show just how I fight
And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
I cannot show just how I fight

Babe I saw you walking, it was after midnight
Carrying nothing except for a flashlight
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
For I do not think you low though you bow to me so-so
I do not think you low though you bow to me so-so

Bridge:
I know you want to drink from the purest wine
But the drink is far more sour then you would ever think
He wants to be, he wants to be with everything under the sun
And she wants to burn, she wants to burn hot like that sun
(Whoa) hot like that sun

Chorus
Just like a legend that rises and unfolds I cannot be his only one
And like a callous, cold, callous woman she'll never know what she did done

So like this legend that rises and unfolds I'll never be his only one
