Of all the things they taught you i'm telling you this son
all the wars fought before won't compare to this one.
Giant spiders prepare...
to take over...

Here comes another mutant Suicide-Squad
you blast them out but now you're way off course
you start to shiver and shake
I'm calling you houston...

Am I following... all the right leads?
or am I about to get lost in Space?
when my time comes they'll write my destiny...
will you take this ride?

Communication's lost we crash to the earth
too late to see the giant Spider Monster giving birth
the future is here... and here is the future

Am I following... all the right leads?
or am I about to get lost in Space?
when my time comes they'll write my destiny
will you take this ride with me?

Am I following... all the right leads?
or am I about to get lost in Space?
when my time comes they'll write my destiny
will you take this ride with me?
