I'm taking my time
I'm trying to leave the memories of you behind
I'm gonna be fine
As soon as I get your picture right out of my mind

I wanna feel the way you make me feel
When I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand
You need to hold on to
But every time I call you don't have time
I guess I'll never get to call you mine

You're nothing at all
I know there's a million reasons why I shouldn't call
When nothing to say
Could easily make this conversation last all day

I wanna feel the way you make me feel
When I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand
You need to hold on to
But every time I call you don't have time
I guess I'll never get to call you mine

Another lesson
I didn't get to learn
You're my obsession
I've got nowhere to turn

I wanna feel the way you make me feel
When I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand
You need to hold on to

I wanna feel the way you make me feel
When I'm with you
I wanna be the hand
You need to hold on
I wanna feel the way you make me feel
When I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand
You need to hold on to
But I guess I'll never get to call you mine
