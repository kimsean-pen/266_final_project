Yeah, we were halfway off the farm, set back
Bank loan blowing out, red flag in the yard
All the burnt kerosene and the time in between
The light chit-chat in the dark
You were sitting on a chair, pretty girl with no hair
And your nine-mile stare, yeah
And you said, "All the paintings are losing all their colour
Darling, do you wanna take 'em all down
To the ground?"

And was it Jenny, or was it Annie, or was it Lily
That changed your point of view?
Oh, your pretty face is curling up in anger
Just keep in mind, my darling, I did it all for you
And I was sitting in my lair, working on my stare
Trying to make our dreams come true
And I wonder what's the use when you're pointing at that noose
And you're looking at me that way, okay

Long night, half right
Get straight, talk it out
Long night, half right
Get straight, help me
