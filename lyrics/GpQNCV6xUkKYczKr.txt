Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

You take a drug, I take a sip
I want your legendary kiss
You know I got designer taste
And your design's too good to waste
When the beast comes out at night
Yeah, it always wants a bite
And I try, try to the resist
But then the devil always wins, yeah

Time, time, time
Time to close your eyes (close your eyes)
Time, time, time
Time to say goodnight (say goodnight)

I feel it coming on
You've got nowhere to run
There's no way you'll make it out alive
Oh, when it's after dark
I'm gonna eat your heart
Don't try to fight it, just close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes

Go on and say, say your last words
Sometimes the best things kinda hurt
'Cause this is real, it's unrehearsed
My fatal touch, you'll feel cursed, yeah

Time, time, time
Time to close your eyes (close your eyes)
Time, time, time
Time to say goodnight (say goodnight)

I feel it coming on
You've got nowhere to run
There's no way you'll make it out alive
Oh, when it's after dark
I'm gonna eat your heart
Don't try to fight it, just close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes

Woo-ah!

I feel it coming on
You've got nowhere to run
There's no way you'll make it out alive
Oh, when it's after dark
I'm gonna eat your heart
Don't try to fight it, just close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Close your eyes

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
