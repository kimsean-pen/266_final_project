And then, when there is just one woman left standing in the room
Then she will be yours
Disintegration

You, you and me
Hold our breath and count to three
I want so much to give you my everything

Disintegration, suffocation
My life is taken, my annihilation

Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you

There's a fear inside of me
Open up and take it slowly
Less it's all my reality
Imma be, Imma hard my heartbeat

I'm, I'm so afraid giving to you endlessly
Look for for your touch
Never have I died so much much

Disintegration, suffocation
My life is taken, my annihilation

Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you

There's a fear inside of me
Open up and take it slowly
Less it's all my reality
Imma be, Imma hard my heartbeat

Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you

Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you

Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you
Take my love for you

Disintegration, suffocation
My life is taken, my annihilation
