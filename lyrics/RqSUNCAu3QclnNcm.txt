Fires in the distant north and the pale, pale moon lies beside me.
Only my lonely love to consume this illuminated sky.
What they can't see on the other side we look upon in awe.
I've waited so long.
And the waves reach your back.
High above, we need to react.
You watch me sink somewhere lost.
Kindness in your eyes, farewell.
Fires in the distant north.

Harboured sorrow, I'll fall behind as I watch you
Watch you shine
She is the sun and she will sing to me tomorrow.
This open sea is much lonelier than it seemed.
I embrace each fruitless day and still I drift away.
I hope again to see the sun.
The sun.
My sun.
My sun.
I'll wait for you always and I hope to live again.
To live again.
