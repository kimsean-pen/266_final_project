Who ever said roses don't bloom in the wintertime?
Who ever said raindrops don't turn into sunshine?
I'm running away with my baby (with my baby)

Huh uh uh

Bang Bang, we the talk of the town
You already know what they talking about
Hit the block with the top let down
Pull up on the scene and we shut it down
Fire it up, blow me in the wind
Deuce in the air, we ain't worried bout them
Do the time, I'mma do the crime
You can give me life, I'm a ride or die for ya

All of the police, couldn't catch us together baby
We never go slowly
If they take you, they take me

I'm running away with my baby (with my baby)
Huh uh uh

Huh uh uh

Bang Bang, it's a shotgun love
Pedal to the floor, we can never get enough
Every time they talking, why they gotta bring us up?
Haters gonna hate, but we keep doing us
Light me up, take me higher baby
Pull the whip over, let me drive you crazy
Back seat with the system banging
Back seat with the system banging

All of the police, couldn't catch us together baby
We never go slowly (never go)
If they take you, they take me

I'm running away with my baby (I'm running away)
Huh uh uh
