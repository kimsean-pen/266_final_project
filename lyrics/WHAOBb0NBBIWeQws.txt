And I feel it running through my veins
And I need that fire just to know that I'm awake
Erased, I missed till the break of day
And I need that fire just to know that I'm awake

Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down
Until we go down

And I feel it running through my veins
And I need that fire just to know that I'm awake
