Sorry
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry
Like sorry
Forgive me
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me
Forgive me
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be mine
I love you
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like I love you
I love you
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be mine
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Maybe if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'd be mine...
You'd be mine...
You'd be mine
