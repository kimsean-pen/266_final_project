You draw me in disguise
And paint me paralyzed, it's true
You trace me as you see
The darkest color, deepest blue
I'm heavy in this chair
Sharp corners frame my back
While you draw me in disguise
And paint me paralyzed, it's true

When they come to find me
Then please burn my body
When they come to find me
Then please burn my body

A broad stroke extinguishes this fire
Paint me screaming into the sprawl
A broad stroke extinguishes this fire
Paint me screaming into the sprawl

I tried to draw you too
But in bad taste and with poor choice
And I can't paint like you do
Tragic precision, perfect void
I'm sleeping in this chair
While you sleep in the hallway
You draw me in disguise
And paint me paralyzed, it's true

When they come to find me
Then please burn my body
When they come to find me
Then please burn my body

A broad stroke extinguishes this fire
Paint me screaming into the sprawl
A broad stroke extinguishes this fire
Paint me screaming into the sprawl
