Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
And if I'm hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
I scream Mom and Dad:
"Why can't I be who I wanna be?"
To be

I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hair
Free as my hair

Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
A chance

I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hair
Free as my hair

I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bear

I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (all the glory that I bear)

I'm my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, I am my hair

I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
My hair, yeah

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair (this is my prayer)
I am my hair
I am my hair
Ooh, I'm my hair, I'm my hair
