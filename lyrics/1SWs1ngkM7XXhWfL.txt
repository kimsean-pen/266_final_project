Lord is tired and resigned
A new sign of the times
Two moons in the sky
A morning star like a third eye

Lucifer smiles
A new sign of the times
Pick up the stone and throw it in his smile
Red waves are in the sea
Red clouds are in the sky

Oh a slow rise, fast decline
A new sign of the times
Two moons side by side
And Venus in the sky

Lucifer smiles
A new sign of the times
Pick up the stone and throw it in his smile
Red waves are in the sea
Red clouds are in the sky

A slow rise, fast decline
A new sign of the times
Two moons, side by side
And Venus like a third eye
Red waves are in the sea
Red clouds are in the sky
