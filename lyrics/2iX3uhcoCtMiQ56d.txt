You can ride my wave, my wave, my wave

Baby, when you're all alone
Feeling like you never know what's going on
And I know it's driving you crazy, crazy
Baby, when you're all alone
Feeling like you never know what's going on
And I know it's driving you crazy, crazy

You ain't gotta deal with all the stress
You know I've been working and I can't get no rest
You know you've been fucking with the best
And I don't mean to say it but I can't have you ride all the way
Maryland to LA
Get these hoes out the way
They're tryna ride on the wave

But I've been thinking about us
Tryna say what's up
I don't need much
This could be enough
I'ma pick you up with my foot on the clutch
Switching up lanes like we always in a rush

Everything I do you know I do it with a purpose
I used to tread around but now I'm surfing
They tell me that they used to doubt but now I know they certain
I'ma hold you down, yeah I'ma put the work in

Baby, when you're all alone
Feeling like you never know what's going on
And I know it's driving you crazy, crazy

You can ride my wave
Top down, going 100 in a 50 on the 95
You can ride my wave
I'ma hold you down 'cause you know that you're my ride or die
You can ride my wave, my wave, my wave (On the 95)
You can ride my wave, my wave, my wave (You my ride or die, you my ride or die)

If you wanna ride, I gotta gas
You and I can slow it down when your life is going fast
Know you've been through it, I ain't tripping 'bout your past
Girl we've got 0-0-0-0 miles on the dash

(Skrt, skrt) I'ma pull up on ya, hop inside the coupe
(Skrt, skrt) I know all about the shit you going through
(Skrt, skrt) You and I, now that's one hell of a time
(Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt) Going down that 95

Hey, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Fuck it baby we can get inside a whip
You know I say fuck a home, we should go and take a trip
I ain't never with the lease, you're the one I wanna get
Fuck a rent

Hey, if you wanna go and catch a vibe with me
Then the honesty is number one a must
I know we can never work if we never built the trust
Girl, you know I gotta drive so we never take a bus (Skrt, skrt)

Baby, when you're all alone
Feeling like you never know what's going on
And I know it's driving you crazy, crazy

You can ride my wave
Top down, going 100 in a 50 on the 95
You can ride my wave
I'ma hold you down 'cause you know that you're my ride or die
You can ride my wave, my wave, my wave (On the 95)
You can ride my wave, my wave, my wave (You my ride or die, you my ride or die)
