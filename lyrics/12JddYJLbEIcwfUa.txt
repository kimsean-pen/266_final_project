A boy gone astray, deceived by a god
Remembers the day, bereft of his blood

Might to your dismay now equal we meet
Self righteous repay, you kneel by my feet, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I seek what you took, I promise you'll pay
By hook or by crook, a boy gone astray I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I hold the final truth of all eternity
Happens to include my own superiority
Mischief of the past has come to seal your destiny
Kneel before me now or I will have your head for heresy

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I hold the final truth of all eternity
Happens to include my own superiority
Mischief of the past has come to seal your destiny
Kneel before me now or I will have your head for heresy.
