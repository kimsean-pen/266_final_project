Traveling somewhere,
could be anywhere
There's a coldness in the air
but I don't care
We drift deeper life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound

Traveling somewhere,
could be anywhere
There's a coldness in the air
but I don't care

We drift deeper into the sound
life goes on
we drift deeper into the sound
feeling strong

So bring it on
So bring it on

Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes

So bring it on
So bring it on

We drift deeper into the sound
life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound
feeling strong

So bring it on
So bring it on

Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
