Mh yeah

Boy I would have thought that,
When you left me I'd be broken,
With my confidence gone,
So gone.
Hey boy I would have thought that
When you said that you don't want me
I'd feel ugly as if something was wrong

Standin' in front of the mirror
My skin's never been clearer
My smile's never been whiter

I look so good without you
Got me a new hair do
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we were through
Done with your lies
Baby now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye

I look so good
I look so good without you
I look so good
I look so good without you

Hey I never would have thought that
When you left me
I'd feel sexy and so good in my skin again
And I never would have known that
I'd be dreaming so much better
Without you in my head

Standin' in front of the mirror
My clothes never fit better
My laughs never been louder

I look so good without you
Got me a new hair do
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we were through
Done with your lies
Baby now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye

I look so good
I look so good without you
I look so good I look so good without you

Now baby my body's lookin' better than before
Ain't biting my nails since you walked out of that door
I realize now I deserve so much more
Than what you give
Than what you give
Than what you give oh

I look so good without you
Got me a new hair do
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we were through
Done with your lies
Baby now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye
