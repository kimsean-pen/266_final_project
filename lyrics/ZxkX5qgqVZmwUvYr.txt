Oh, we're doing circles on the west side
Driving like we on a back road
We're listening to landslide
You're the only place I call home

You say I got a face that could stop an army
Got a love strong enough to start a war
Things change, not the same as I was in Texas
Now I know what all that shit was for

Oh, we're listening to landslide, oh oh
You're the only place I call

Back water driving
Forever falling in you
Fuck who I was
I forget her when I'm with you
And you hold me like a Glock
When you take the safety off
Red, white kissing
When we're misting up the rear view
Back water driving
Forever falling in you
Fuck who I was
I forget her when I'm with you
And you hold me like a Glock
When you take the safety off
Red, white, kissing
When we're misting up the rear view

Twilight in the [?]
Small town Connecticut
Lick your teeth, cherry mouth
Playing on cassette
I'm singing in your ear
Never thought we would be here
Fast forward two years
Now I'm a believer

Oh, we're doing circles on the west side
Driving like we on a back road
We're listening to landslide
You're the only place I call home

Back water driving
Forever falling in you
Fuck who I was
I forget her when I'm with you
And you hold me like a Glock
When you take the safety off
Red, white, kissing
When we're misting up the rear view
Back water driving
Forever falling in you
Fuck who I was
I forget her when I'm with you
And you hold me like a Glock
When you take the safety off
Red, white, kissing
When we're misting up the rear view
