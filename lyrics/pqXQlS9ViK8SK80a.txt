If you had seen
You'd understand
If you had seen
You'll break like me

If you had seen
All the things that I've seen
You'd scream like I screamed
I know

If you had seen
You'd feel like I feel
Empty and broken
I know

I've seen the sky on fire
Seen the oceans dry
Seen the mountains fly
Seen the whole world die
