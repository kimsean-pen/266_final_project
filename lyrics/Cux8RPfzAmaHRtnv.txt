I put my faith in your heart
Now it's tearing me apart
You're all gone and
I could use a new religion
i'm paying the price of my mistakes
now you're a thousand miles away
all i've got are my regrets of my decisions

here we go again
it's the same old situation
and it's really getting out of control
you've got my world turned upside down
and i blame it on love
it's too much complication
but i can't seem to let it go
You're the only one i'm thinking of

And I blame it on love
the love we made
tell me, was it all in vain?
i was blind, i guess i took it all for granted
if i could turn back time
babe i know i'd get it right

the punishment of mine, i don't fit the crime
it's the same old situation
and it's really getting out of control
you've got my world turned upside down
and i blame it on love
it's too much complication
but i can't seem to let it go
you're the only one i'm thinking of

and i blame it on love

here we go again
it's the same old situation
and it's really getting out of control
you've got my world turned upside down
and i blame it on love
it's too much complication
but i can't seem to let it go
you're the only one i'm thinking of
and i blame it on love
it's the same old situation
but i can't seem to let it go
you're the only one i'm thinking of
and i blame it on love
