Walking the line and lift the veil
All from my vision
Always in time we swore we be
Someone that's different

I can't believe that I'm saying this out loud
You pulled the same shit that they did
All of your lies get lost in the crowd
What a fool I guess I still am

For who am I trying to kid? I'll give forgive him
The feeling is gone
For who am I trying to kid? I'll give forgive him
The feeling is gone

And cut the old scars that others left
And now you're filling them up with salt
'Cause no matter the rhyme or the reason
I'm always believing that everything's my fault
Even when it's not, it's not, can you say it back to me?
'Cause you should never point the finger at feeling
So let's give up or give in
Then you'll never be like the rest of them

And I hope you know you've got me in your corner
And I hope you know you've got me in your corner

And all I could hear was the smallest of voices
(And I hope you know you've got me in your corner)
Pulling from my ear and telling me the choice is mine
But there's still time
(And I hope you know you've got me in your corner)
And all I could hear was the smallest of voices
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
Pulling from my ear and telling me the choice is mine
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
But there's still time
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
And all I could hear was the smallest of voices
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
Pulling from my ear and telling me the choice is mine
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
But there's still time
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
And I hope you know you've got me in your corner
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
And I hope you know you've got me in your corner now

(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-ba)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da-da-da)
(Ba-ba, ba-da, ba)
