Lord forgive me for what I've done
I'm the only child of the only son
And the land that raised us was full of wheat
Now the fields lay fallow and the blood runs deep

But look at you now
You're running out of things to wear
Still playin' all your hits, all the hits, all the hits
But that won't take you anywhere

I don't wanna play your song
I don't want those heroes

Can you trust the future that never comes?
You seem so old, I feel so young
And I hear your anger and your howls of hate
With so little reason with so little faith

But look at you now
You're running out of things to wear
Still playin' all your hits, all the hits, all the hits
But that won't take you anywhere

I don't wanna play your song
I don't want those heroes

Look at you now
You're running out of things to wear
Still playin' all your hits, all the hits, all the hits
But that won't take you anywhere

I don't wanna play the song
I don't want those heroes
Your heroes anymore
No heroes anymore
