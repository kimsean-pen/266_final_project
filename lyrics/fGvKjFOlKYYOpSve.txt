All you're gonna do for all that you do
Is all you're gonna do all
And when I'm coming home tonight.
Do you think you can do
The people away to do it all?
I'm coming home and away you go
To the all and all you go.

I just think that room's to end,
How commend them from their dreams?
Send that money for a rainy day
For the sake of future days.
You better have nothing for me,
You better move year on your face,
You hide behind a borrowed chase
For the sake of future days.

You're spreading that lie, you know that,
You're getting down, breaking your neck,
When doing that was breaking home.
What have you done, free the night?
With all that breaking home
Was breaking that break up home,
Was rolling up, break the wall,
And the tall wind did break your home, roll, roll on.

I just think that room's to end,
How commend them from their dreams?
Send that money for a rainy day
For the sake of future days.
You better have nothing for me,
You better move year on your face,
You hide behind a borrowed chase
For the sake of future days.

And the night you're losing,
Light down from your dreams,
Send the money for a rainy day
For the sake of future days.
You better have nothing for me,
You better move year on your face,
You hide behind a borrowed chase
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
Said it's all for the sake of future days.

I just think that room's to end,
How commend them from their dreams?
Send that money for a rainy day
For the sake of future days.
You better have nothing for me,
You better move year on your face,
You hide behind a borrowed chase
For the sake of future days.

For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days,
For the sake of future days.
