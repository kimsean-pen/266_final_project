I don't even know you anymore,
But I think you know what you mean to me.
Things will never be the way they were before,
I guess you can't count on anything.

And your brand new friends,
They won't care about you,
When the party ends.
They'll leave you in the dark,
Saying woah, tell me where you're hiding,
Whoooaaah,

I think it's time you come back home.
You taught me everything I know about poetry,
I still pretend I know what it means.
Remember picking out who we wanna be,

Back when we didn't know anything.
And your brand new friends,
They won't care about you,
When the party ends.
They'll leave you in the dark,
Saying woah, tell me where you're hiding,

Whoooaaah,
I think it's time to come back home.
Every night since you've been gone,

I still leave the light on.
I know it's wrong to wait so long.
You say you're getting on just fine,
But you still stutter when you lie,

I know you better, oh,
Tell me would you come back home.
And your brand new friends,
They won't care about you,
When the party ends.
They'll leave you in the dark,
Saying woah, tell me where you're hiding,
Woooaaah,
I think it's time you come back home,
Woah,
Come back home,
I think it's time you come back home.
