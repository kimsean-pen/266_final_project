It's been so long since I have got you lady
Since I have had yo brown legs wrapped around me
The smell of her just drives me crazy
Imagine what the sight of her can do

Suitelady don't worry
Ain't no end to what this ring
Wants to begin with you
I've waited suitelady
'Cause no man can tear asunder
What my love can groove

I never thought myself the kinda guy
The kinda man that would ever want to settle down
Statistics say it's crazy passion won't survive
But something says nawh deep down deep down inside

Groove love can groove me and you awhh
Suitelady
(chorus)
I don't mean to be dramatic baby
I only wanna understand you baby
So will you marry me?
(chorus)
