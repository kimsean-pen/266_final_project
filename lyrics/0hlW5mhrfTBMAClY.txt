Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo

In a world full of heartache
Seems like everyone's burning out
You and me we did it our way
And this love ain't running out

We got that fire, that glow (Oh)
And I just need you to know

You're my favorite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go
Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
You still make my crazy little heart go Boom!

Don't worry about tomorrow
Cause these walls will never fall
I just wanna let the world know
What we've got's unbreakable

We got it under control (Oh)
We're good, we're solid, we're gold

You're my favorite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go
Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
You still make my crazy little heart go Boom!

You make my crazy little heart go
And now I never wanna let go

(Hey) You make my crazy little heart go
And now I never
I never
I never wanna let go

Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo

You're my favorite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go
You're my favorite song
My sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity
The best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go
Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-Boom!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo
You still make my crazy little heart go
Boom!
