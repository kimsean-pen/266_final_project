Keep moving, keep breathing
There's no time to rest your head
Keep moving, keep breathing
Sometimes help seems so hopeless

Pack up your things, run for your lives
In hopes of finding a place to hide

The ground quakes, the trees shake
They uproot all you know
The ground quakes, the trees shake
You can't make it on your own

Imagine watching your heroes cower
Your father's face sink lower
As he tries to save you for one more hour

Cover your tracks in the earth
Let's hope they take the wrong turn

From one torched home to another
Could you understand the terror?
From one torched home to another
Could you understand the terror?
Watch them turn to ashes and disappear into the breeze

Can you empathize with their bloodshot eyes?
They're fire red from the teardrops shed
Can you empathize with all those who tried
To pull their loved ones out of harm's reach?

No, we have our own burdens to bear
No, we have our own burdens to bear
No, we have our own burdens to bear
We have our burdens to bear

Keep moving, keep breathing
There's no time to rest your head
Keep moving, keep breathing
Sometimes help seems so hopeless

With your gaze turned towards the west
We all turn the other way
Relief is unattainable with words no one will say
No one will say

The ground quakes, the trees shake
They uproot all you know
The ground quakes, the trees shake
You can't make it on your own
Can't make it on your own
Can't make it on your own
It's time to reclaim your home
