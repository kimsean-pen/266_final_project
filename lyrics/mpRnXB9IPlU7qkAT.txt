Wake up wanting but don't know what
Night rider waiting
How can you still be on my mind?
The truth is overrated too

Something about the way you held me tonight
Something about the way you kiss
No one can be blamed
We're the light arrived
Something we can't heal this time

Faux suede drifter, you never moved
Silence eroded
Touching you with a loaded gun
The eyes follow eyes and assume
