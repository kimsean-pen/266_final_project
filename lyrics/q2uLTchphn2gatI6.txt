Jackie Cane was everybody's sugar
She gave it all wherever it took her
They used her up before the sell-by date
To be so sweet was her only mistake

The only flower in a concrete garden
Destined to be the rock that wouldn't harden

Jackie Cane was everybody's sugar
She'd melt away if only she could of
Taken for granted, abused and drained
They ran her dry and then it never rained

She was the queen of the 25th hour
They looked so sweet but the after-taste was sour

Salty days for Jackie Cane
