I woke up drunk in a cab out the front of my house
"Hey man, this is your stop, yeah, it's time to get out"
What I wouldn't give to be standing at your door
When I can't find the words to stop the hurting no more
Through the nights I wake up alone in my sheets soaking wet
The sound of your voice saying "come home" still ringing in my ear
This world's got a funny way of being cruel to me
Still I raise my chin, fuckin' eat it with a smile on my face

If you blink, you're gonna miss me
If you blink, you're gonna miss me
I'm gonna burn up in the atmosphere
If you blink, you're gonna fucking miss me

Sometimes I forget my life is bigger than this city block
But when I turn on south ward I feel the curtains call
I can't shake the feeling
If I can't run, I'll grow
Nothing can hurt me now
I'm home now
I said nothing can hurt me now
I'm home now

Baby, why don't we get out of here?
All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear
(Disappear, just disappear)
Baby, why don't we get out of here?
All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear
(Disappear, just disappear)

You never know what your heart's for until it breaks
But when you got no one to mend it, you're left with an empty space
I got a song in my head for all of the places I go
I can hear you singing in the shower now, baby I'm coming home

If you blink, you're gonna miss me
If you blink, you're gonna miss me
If you blink, you're gonna miss me, baby

Baby, why don't we get out of here?
All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear
(Disappear, just disappear)
Baby, why don't we get out of here?
All I wanna do is take your hand and disappear
(Disappear, just disappear)

If you blink, you're gonna miss me
If you blink, you're gonna miss me
I'm gonna burn up in the atmosphere
If you blink, you're gonna fucking miss me

Think of me when you're alone and you can't sleep
I'm on the other side of the world doing the same thing
Think of me when you're alone and you can't sleep
I'm on the other side of the world doing the same thing
Think of me when you're alone and you can't sleep
I'm on the other side of the world doing the same thing
Think of me when you're alone and you can't sleep
I'm on the other side of the world doing the same thing
