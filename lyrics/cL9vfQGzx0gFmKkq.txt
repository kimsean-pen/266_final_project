Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days, consuming your breath
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

You told me life was long
But now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below

Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat, is that healing that your hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of the man who's built his life on love

You told me life was long
But now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below

I be locked up in store in the lavender ward 'cause my mind is just like her's
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned
And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be wrong for those below
