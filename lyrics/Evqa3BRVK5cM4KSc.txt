This is weep beyond the water
Winter signing in my heart
Don't see my eyes, ... slowing me down.
Can't pass through to your decide

She knows I'm the one who sought her.
When we fought, we fought so hard.
She holds the secret, won't show me how,
How to break the riddle in her eyes.

This is TREASON!!!!
There's no reason
Why'd you go?

Aaaah...

Inside ghost of love is laughing
When marks frusted where I go.
It tells me nothing has belong that whispers
You've seen darkness before...

In time, heard the will subside
Longing is so overthrown
What's left, boy, the cross inside
When the air go, What a failure

This is TREASON!!!!
There's no reason
Why'd you go?

And you never have a feeling of the sorrow inside
And you haven't been the reason why hole-up subsides
And you've never seen the aftermath of giving up.

And we giving up...
It's over
And you giving up...
It's winter,
Hiding
In your...
Heart...
