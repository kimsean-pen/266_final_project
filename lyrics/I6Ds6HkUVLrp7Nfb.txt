If you can I wish you would
Only if you feel you should
Bring your loving over
All adds up with circumstance
All stood up with taking stands
Bring your loving over

Highlights glisten
Silence listens
Days that found you
Embrace that found you

Here is a sunrise Aint that enough
True as a clear sky, ain't that enough
Toy town feelings here to remind you
Summers in the city do what you gotta do

Time can only make demands
Fill it up with grains of sand
Bring your loving over
Highlights glisten
Silence listens
Days that found you
Embrace that found you

Here is a sunrise Aint that enough
True as a clear sky, ain't that enough
Toy town feelings here to remind you
Summers in the city do what you gotta do
Toy town feelings whose gonna argue
Summers in the city Summers in the city
