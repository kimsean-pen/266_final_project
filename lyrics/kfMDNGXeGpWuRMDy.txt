Everyone will go with you
Listen for a way out as you
Cut me to the chase til I'm
On the other side and when
It all comes out
We're as empty as a brick house that we built without the sides

Everyone is crazy with their own life, lies in existential
You ever want to find your way out?
Turn into yourself again and reach on out to become your true self

You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking

All the skies are falling and the sun is movin' up and down
Even when you're in a dark way
Some decisions shield you from the positivity until
You reach out to me
You say why you hate it as you pry your way in
I need another investigative mind
Tell me that you're injured yourself and you've been healing
And I will see this through

You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking

I told you then
I'd hold you when you need it
And there you are
Looking... away

You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
