Chosen to hear. His mark on my Soul
Blackened and strong, scorched by the Flame
That burns deep in my Soul Venomous God
I shall carry Your Black Light forward

Destruction and rebirth, I am Enlightened
In the Darkness of your Shadow I see Light
Night and Darkness, Blood and Carnality
Esoteric knowledge of the Forbidden Arts

The Majestic Nightspirit
Bring us the Light of Dawn
That rises from the limitless depths
