It's always the same as always
It's a game that we play
No one's safe

Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure

Does sex even sell anymore?
I feel like I've seen it all
Or maybe I'm just old
Or maybe I'm just bored

Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure

'Cause this world makes a lot of noise for me
Makes it hard for me to hear what I'm thinking
Sometimes I don't understand what I say
So it's fine if you gotta get away

Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
Maximize all the pleasure
Even with all this weather
Nothing can make it better
Maximize all the pleasure
