Pull on the new flesh like borrowed gloves
And burn your fingers once again

I must have died again, nobody lives forever
This psycho machine
The buzz, the cut, the pain, the love of undercover
When the code breaks we swim

Wake me up when it's time to breathe in
A cameo off-world

You are like digital thunder
The right kind of girl to steal my dreams away
You are electric head
You're out of control
Temptation girl

We've got a genetic warning to push this further
It's time to begin
World to world, mind to mind, sleeve to sleeve
Gone interstellar
Time to Merge Nine

Make no mistake, I ain't got time to bleed here
A cameo off-world

You are like digital thunder
The right kind of girl to steal my dreams away
You are electric head
You're out of control
Temptation girl

Get out darkness, get out, darling
There's a shadow in the ice tonight (get out)
There's a shadow in the ice explore the echo (darkness)
There's a shadow in the ice tonight (get out)
Where we gonna run? Where we gonna ride the echo? (Darling)
Just let your eyes drift under the skies that rip
Hot like my gun
Now I have begun infusion

You are like digital thunder (digital, digital)
Just steal my dreams away
You are electric head
You are out of control
Temptation girl
Broken angel
