(Alright) [x2]
Scary monsters
And super beasts
The more you dream the less you sleep, ah
Life as we know it
Has gone away
Unbound
Unwound
Who's here to stay, alright

Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
Nobody's real but they'll feel it

Nobody's real

Could you predict?
Could you forsee?
Artificial by necessity
Rockets and robots
Can save your life
When you don't care about what's real it's alright, alright

Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
Nobody's real but they'll feel it

(Alright) [x4]

How do you sleep with the time that's left you?
It's all been done there's no need for the rescue
So let's just get out
I swear there's no doubt
You can't be ready cause there's nothing left to do, OK

Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
Nobody's real but they'll feel it
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight
(Feel it tonight)
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go
Nobody's real but they'll feel it

Nobody's real

Nobody's real
