It's like a song
It's like a prayer
It's like a dream you had one night
And put it over there

You wear it like a face
You never seen before
You keep it with a key you thought you found
Was lyin' on the floor

Wipe away the tear
That only comes with peace
Wipe it with a rose of love you saw
Was falling on the leaves

Do it like a dance
Do it for a while
But when it's gone, you know it's gone
You walk another mile

It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
It's a beautiful world
When we dance in the light
All that is real
And all that is mine is right
It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
It's a beautiful world
And all that is mine is right

I'm blinded by the light
I try to catch my breath
I sing a song of love, and you can teach
Me what you know of death

It's walking in your dreams
It's written in the sky
And when you feel the heat, you know
You've found the reason why

It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
It's a beautiful world
When we dance in the light
All that is real
And all that is mine is right
It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
A beautiful world
And all that is mine is right

Attention, attention!
Mesdames, messieurs
Accrochez-vous bien et faites vos adieux
L'humanité est en train de fondre aux deux pôles
Attention, attention!
Mesdames, messieurs
Les frontières se referment
Inspirez, expirez monoxyde de carbone
Détendez-vous et reposez en paix
C'est juste la fin du monde

It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
It's a beautiful world
And we dance in the light
And all that is real
And all that is mine is right
It's a beautiful dream
A beautiful night
It's a beautiful world
When we dance in the light
All that is real
And all that is mine is right
All that is mine is right
All that is mine is right
All that is mine is right
All that is mine is right
