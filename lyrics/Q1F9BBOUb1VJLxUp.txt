You can shoot me down.
You can drag me round.
Girl, I'll get you,
It won't be long.
You can smash my heart,
You can trash our love.
But my desire for you
Is much too strong.

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills.

You can waste my time
But you can't change my mind.
I will stop you, so just go on.
You can play your games
But it's all in vain
Cause my desire for you
Is much too strong.

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
To be with you in heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.

Girl, I'm on fire,
Heaven seems so close tonight.
Girl, I would die
For your love.

You can shoot me down.
You can drag me round.
Girl, I'll get you,
It won't be long.
You can smash my heart,
You can trash our love
But my desire for you
Is much too strong.

To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven
There's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven...
