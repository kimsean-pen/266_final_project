The prison of mirrors... we can't see,
Yet trapped we are... by its reflection,
It sees all fear and watches our downfall,
It will rip all lies and pride from the soul.

You are all... all that you hate,
Force fed memories, suffer humiliation,
Victim of darkness, of the inner hidden kind,
I am the eye within the gleam,
Shatter before a mirror that stares into (a shallow soul).

Poison yourself... revel in waste,
Poison yourself, in the name of evil... destroy yourself.

I will always be the reason to hate your self,
Mirrors... will oppress your mind,
And follow all... all that you hide,
Blind, step inside a subconscious warfare to guide the oblivious,
Mirrors of torture, unforgiving expose your sins,
Your suicide by the mirror's shattered blade.
