After years of waiting, nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes, you realize
I'm a reasonable man, get off, get off, get off my case

I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting

After years of waiting, nothing came
And you realize you're looking in, looking in the wrong place
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

After years of waiting
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
