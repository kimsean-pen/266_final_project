Get you through the water
Keep the new car up all night
Had you in the city
They're watching, so I'll take my time
When the lights go out
Behind the bridge, last exit
Through the highway's yellow glare
Have we been out this far?

When you think you're falling
You can change your face again
If you think you're falling,
Know I'll catch you just the same

Hit the North 400
The highbeams slowly kiss the lake
The trees are dark, it's just as well
The fog shines off the hospital
As the night goes past,
A similar light begins to show
As if you could prevent a call
Your hair, it begins to smell like fall

When you think you're falling
You can change your face again
If you think you're falling,
Know I'll catch you just the same
Just the same

When you think you're falling
You can change your face again
If you think you're falling,
Know I'll catch you just the same
Just the same
