Crossing paths defending faith
Face the truth I'm balancing a razorblade
Time has come, the game is on

Step inside a world of pain
I'm divine, I fight so I can break these chains
Let me be the enemy
The rules will never change

Nothing will stand in my way
Adrenaline runs in my veins
Justice prevails and my name
Has entered the scene, I

Going up to the top, never stop
Never give it up, never fall, never drop
You gotta give it up to the beat of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start
Going up to the top, never stop
Never gonna fail, if you fall you get up
Surrender to the beat from the pulse of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start

Ticking clock a life in vain
Left alone the die is thrown, a clashing pain
Just a brick a false charade

Crushing down like heavy rain
Time has come, the ticket to eternal fame
Against all odds I rule this play
There's a darkness in my veins

Nothing will stand in my way
Adrenaline runs in my veins
Justice prevails and my name
Has entered the scene, I

Going up to the top, never stop
Never give it up, never fall, never drop
You gotta give it up to the beat of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start
Going up to the top, never stop
Never gonna fail, if you fall you get up
Surrender to the beat from the pulse of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start

See through the endless array
With the lights that are guiding our way

Going up to the top, never stop
Never gonna fail, if you fall you get up
Surrender to the beat from the pulse of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start
Going up to the top, never stop
Never give it up, never fall, never drop
You gotta give it up to the beat of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start
Going up to the top, never stop
Never gonna fail, if you fall you get up
Surrender to the beat from the pulse of your heart
And if you don't, we take it from the start
