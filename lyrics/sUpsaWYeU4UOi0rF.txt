Woo, woo, ah
Woo, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh huh
Yuh

Yeah, it's true, the Lamborghini truck light blue (true)
The shotty down my leg and we stuck like glue (true)
My shorty like, "Damn, nobody fuck like you" (I ain't know)
One love to my uptown crew
This new shit swing like Tiger at the Masters (uh huh)
Man, I don't fuck with none of these bastards (none of 'em)
I'm like a fucking father to these bastards (uh)
Shut the fuck up and eat your pudding (pudding)
Twenty alligators die for this shit I put my foot in (foot in)
You barely got your footing
Everything I do, they said I couldn't (uh)
Now it's middle finger up with the hoodie (uh)
Eyes dumb low blowing goodie goodie (uh)
Baklava, bestseller (true)
How we celebrate?
Went to 125 and bought a red leather (another fact)
Man, your boy is on another planet
He just sitting in the whip by himself bumping Janet
Rhythmation, living life without no limitations (uh)
Tryna have enough money that'll fill the basement (please)
And enough drugs to fill my face with
And enough to give the M6 a facelift (damn)
Turn that motherfucker to a spaceship (woo, yup)
All these women calling me Tay Diggs (uh, woo, yup)
It's me (yeah, yup, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I'm just out here living my best life
(It's true, oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm just out here living my best life
(Yeah, uh, uh huh, whatever, yeah)
And I'm just out here living my bes tlife
(Uh, whatever, whatever, whatever)
But somebody always tryna fuck it up
