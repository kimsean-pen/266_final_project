Shorty wanna get herself sponsored (How?)
Hangin' 'round villains and monsters
Big Benzos, not Hondas
All of them man are imposters
Wrists on drought
Tings come 'round
Live in the woo, flesh, flesh, ayy

Ayy, little charity case
Had to make money for my family's sake
Had to make money, now I start on the beach
And if I say wait, bitches gonna happily wait
Call out my niggas on fuckery
You don't wanna be a GoFundMe
Twitter woulda had a man cancelled (If what?)
If they saw how I came up, trust me
I might slide out, Gucci, iced out
I might ride a hoopty, nike pouch (Right)
They wan' wile out, Bookey, wine out (Wile)
Better mind that we don't find out
Why you bein' shy, girl? Come here (Wassup?)
You know man like us don't come here (Wassup?)
More time, we just wan' have fun here
But we might five, four, three, two, one here

"H," what? "You been goin' to the gym?"
One chow-chow courtesy of ching-ching
"H," what? "You been gettin' any tings?"
Hoes engaged, 'til they all ring, ring
New ting thick, but she ain't thick shinned
Bust one joke and she start whingin' (She cryin')
I was like ra, got a sibling?
My Asian hitter calls me win-win
White girls with lip fillers that skip dinners
Wanna come 'round some lit niggas
Thick girl look so fake, she fictitious
Big figures wanna leave with big figures
Tings in the C-U-T wan' get a real nigga in their G-U-T (Okay)
Y-A-K in my C-U-P, do I gotta spell it out? I'm a T-U-G
