No profits go to those who battle
To protect their kind from us.
And are they not better off
Beyond their mortal kingdom of overflown carrion?
Sate the acrid hunger in you as you gaze into the drip.
Stare into it's blackened film and do not take your eyes away.

The contents of our inverse alter
Will mutate your skin and your mind.
Breeding ample mental lucre,
Far exceeding any other oddity on this curetted old land.
Breathe in with your pupils.
Then expel the cadence that it gives you.

Cast your voice like line and hook,
Reeling out your deepest fears.

Relentless mutation.
Relentless mutation.

Eons rendered in one view.
Binding your sight to the evermore.
One second in it's void will evoke a phobia of time.

All the grim within each thought
Will echo all throughout the liquid.
It's current emanates repulsive imagery.

Ludic sanguine orb, heaving sable.
Incarnation of every witnesses hallucination
Raveling and breeding into it's hyper kinetic makeup.

Relentless mutation in the retinal burrow of A.U.M.
Relentless mutation of your mind.
Now describe what you see.
Relentless mutation in the retinal burrow of A.U.M.
Relentless mutation of your mind.
Now describe what you see.
