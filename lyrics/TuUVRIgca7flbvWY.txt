If you forget it all, I will bring it with me
If you can't find the sea, I will take you there
If you forget it all, I will bring it with me
If you can't find the sea, I will take you there

Green... you still know me by name

Even though I'm losing
Doesn't make me a loser yet
You still know me by name, Green
I'll still be Lady Daydream

She took it all from me
Now I can't find my place
Do you 'member me
Do you know my face?

It could all be a dream, Green
