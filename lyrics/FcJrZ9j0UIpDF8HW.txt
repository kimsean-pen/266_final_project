Do you hear the mute men calling?
We're waiting in the line
I feel the cold wind blowing
Sending shivers down my spine

And all I need to know is how we got here
We're waiting in the line

Come on talk to me
Words are meant to drown
And hush that noise, hush that noise of sounds

I see the sunset glowing
And I remember how it shines
You need to tell me, mister
Why are we running out of time?

And all I need to know is how we got here
We're waiting in the line
Waiting in the line

Come on talk to me
Words are meant to drown
And hush that noise, hush that noise of sounds
So answer me
Words are meant to drown
I am shaking
I am falling down

Why should we give up
And follow them down the line?
Why should we give up
And follow them down the line?
Why should we give up
And follow them down the line?

Talk to me
Words are meant to drown
And hush that noise, hush that noise of sounds
So answer me
Words are meant to drown
I am shaking
I am falling down
