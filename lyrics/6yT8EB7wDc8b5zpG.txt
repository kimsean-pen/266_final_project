Oh... And I don't want to see no more

It was saturday when I got that call
Far away from feeling tall
I know, I know, I know what the truth is, yeah
I tried to look away from what you did
Heartache became my friend oh...

You walked away from me baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so.

I don't want to wait for you
I don't want to wake up thinking, hopin
You'll it get right this time
'Cause you know that you're so cold
And I don't wanna see no more

And I can't get away from you
That's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more

It was so easy to trust you baby
Guess I was so stupid baby heah yeah...
Oh how did I ever think this would come
You run right to another one oh...

You walked away from me baby
You threw it all away

So, I don't want to wait for you
I don't want to wake up thinking, hopin
You'll it get right this time
'Cause you know that you're so cold
And I don't wanna see no more

And I can't get away from you
That's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more

I used to be afraid of letting go
The fragile part me, I'm here right now
I need you to set me free
I can see it in your eyes
You won't blame on me this time
No, never
You want me back but I won't look back, nooooo...

I don't want to wait for you
I don't want to wake up thinking, hopin
You'll it get right this time
'Cause you know that you're so cold
And I don't wanna see no more
And I can't get away from you
That's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
I don't wanna see no more uh oh
Girl I don't wanna see no more
