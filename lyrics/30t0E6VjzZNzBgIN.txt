There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both 16 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day staying up all night
Staying up all night

There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both 18 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day staying up all night

Staying up all night

If I could find you now things would get better

We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

There's a piece of you thats here with me
It's everywhere I go its everything I see

When I sleep I dream and it gets me by
I can make believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight
If I could find you now things would get better

We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky

And keep pretending the sun will not rise
Well be together for one more night somewhere somehow
If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
