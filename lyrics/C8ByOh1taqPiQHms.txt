You know I'm tired
Of living like a ghost
God only knows
I've giving more then most
I cover up scars
That emptiness has caused
When the chemicals take
Will it be me you dream of
...
There's a heartbeat
Somewhere
Love, I'm gonna find you there
In the darkness
Sleepless
Love, I wanna have you near
We never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
...
(Never sleep alone)
...
(Never sleep alone)
...
You shake me up
The moment before sleep
You're calling out
The demons inside me
And when they're gone
The hours I'm awake
I take these pills
And pray to god they'll take
There's a heartbeat
Somewhere
Love, I'm gonna find you there
In the darkness
Sleepless
Love I wanna have you near
We never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
...
(Never sleep alone)
...
We never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
