This rain has eaten the day rushing around folks
Fopping up grey domes above
The withering crowds rhyme the lonesome and grim
Clouds are all melting down, fall apart

Asked you, come see me again, take the earliest train
Marigolds in your hands, I want you to be here my friend

The mist creeped from the east stepped
Down and walked in settled on low trees
The grove all in the haze nothing but
Your face's seen through this fog's veils

Asked you, come see me again, take the earliest train
Marigolds in your hands, I want you to be here my friend
