Tired eyes, barely open

Crippled by a promise broken

I have seen an empire falling
Hopeless, can you hear me calling?
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me

Light the way and I'll Follow
Where you go
Can you tell me what is Real?

Cause I've lost my way again

Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

Searching through the darkness below
For a light in seas of shadows
Far from you, but I could never

Abdicate, I'll fight forever

Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll Follow
Where you go
Can you tell me what is Real?

Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again
I will not run
I will not fall
I will not bury it
This is war!!!!
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here
Tell me what is real
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again
