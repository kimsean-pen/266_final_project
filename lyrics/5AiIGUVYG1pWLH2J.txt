Julia, I tried
Tried to make it right
Julia, I'm leaving tomorrow
Maybe it'll be tonight
I remember...
Yesterday
September rain was keeping me awake
While you were asleep
I wondered what was in your dreams
And what got in the way
Julia, I tried
Tried to keep you warm
Watched you fall into a depression
That we've seen before
I don't remember...
Ah ahh ahaaahaaaaa
Ah ahh ahaaahaaaaa
Ah ahh ahaaahaaaaa
Ah ahh ahaaahaaaaa ahahaaa
Yesterday
September rain was keeping me awake
When you were asleep
I wondered what was in your dreams
And what got in the way
I feel that this was wrong
But I had to see it for myself
There's always new ideas
They're not always the right ones
I don't know what's good enough
But I know I need to change my mind
Maybe all you needed was
A little more of my attention
