Forever rolling on, the wars we wage unknown
Eternal is the blessed end
Destruction overdrive, disregard of life
Obsessed throughout the end of time

Oh yeah!
Throughout the end of time
Throughout the end of time
Throughout the end of time
Throughout the end of time

The masses gather 'round, the drug of choice is found
The hate machine keeps moving on

Oh yeah!
It keeps rolling on
It keeps moving on
It keeps rolling on
It keeps moving on

It keeps moving
It keeps moving
It keeps moving
It keeps moving
It keeps moving on, oh yeah!

Oh yeah!
Destruction overdrive
Destruction overdrive
Destruction overdrive
Destruction overdrive

Destruction overdrive
Destruction overdrive
Destruction overdrive
Destruction over...
