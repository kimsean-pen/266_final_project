Getting ready for bed at a regular time is
one of the most important habits you can learn
David has probably never stopped to
think what a wonderful thing sleep is
Dreams are normal too Going to bed at a regular
time each night makes it easier to go right off to sleep

Rest your head, here's a lullaby A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Get to sleep it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Getting my revenge from the shallow Grave where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

Night comes creeping
I'll kill them and rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare Yeah,
I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver screen
Sweet dreams

Fell in love with hate cause evil fit
like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man but Sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened
No! They all think its just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
Tell your friends they're fucking dead
You can't turn down your own deathbed

Night comes creeping
I'll kill them and rock you to sleep
I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the
golden age of the silver screen
I'm the American nightmare
I'm the man of the dreams
With the coldest cut (?)
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver screen

One, two, dreams do come true
Three, four, see you at the morgue
Five, six, he'll get his fix
Seven, eight, you'll get the twisted end of fate
No!
You'll get the twisted end of fate
No!
Tell your friends they're fucking dead

Night comes creeping
I'll kill them and rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare
From American dreams
I've counted my bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream I'm smashing my
way through the golden age of the silver screen
I'm the American nightmare I'm the
man of your dreams
With the coldest cut (?)
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver screen
