Demian poor child was raised on the gutter
Digs in thrashcans to kill the hunger
When your mouth is so full of promisse
All I see is one empty hand

The world may turn
But some things never change!

Uptown princess, a life inside cages
Wearing diamonds around the neck
I know bibles are full of fair words
But nothing's worth more than what to care

The world keeps turning
And still things stay the same!
You look away while I see the-

Eyes of Christ on a devil's face
Eyes of Christ on a devil's face
Wait for your heart to show the way
Turn your old mind from flesh to clay
I beg for a miracle

We've made'em heroes
We've made'em warriors
We've made their mothers cry

We've got our defence
We've got our difference
We're playing different sides!

You'll die someday
And still the world will be the same
You understand when I see the-

Eyes of Christ on a devil's face
Eyes of Christ on the devil's face
Driving a knife in your despair
May become blind the ones who stare
Look to the-

Eyes of Christ on the devil's face
Eyes of Christ on a devil's face
Setting on fire those who pray
Blinding the eyes of human race
Please beg for a miracle!
