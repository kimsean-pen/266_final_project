Ancient earth work fort and barrow
Discreetly hide their secret abodes
The most fearful hide deep inside
And venture not there upon Yuletide

For invasion of their hollow hills
The music hold and Oberon fill
Is surely recommended not
For fear of death in fear of rot

Hollow hills
Hollow hills
Hollow hills
Hollow hills

Baleful sound and wild voices ignored
In luck disaster the one reward
Violated sanctity of supermen's hills
So sad

Hollow hills, love lies there still
Hollow hills, so sad
Hollow hills, so sad
Hollow hills, hollow hills, hollow hills

Witches too and goblin's too, too
And speckled sills
Lament, repent
Oh mortal you

So sad
Hollow hills
So sad
So sad
So sad
