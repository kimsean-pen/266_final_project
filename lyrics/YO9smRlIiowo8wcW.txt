The lover held her love
She begged him not to go
The fighter wrapped his gloves
The fighter said I know I know I know
Just this one last time
I swear you'll still be mine
But he can't promise much
He goes for one last touch, one last touch

Maybe we were meant to be lonely, lonely
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
Loneliness has always been with me, with me
Maybe we don't have to be all alone

The fighter goes inside
The dawn is creepin' in
He swings with all his might
At all that mattered then
And she's in love with him
But lovers don't always win
He never even saw the swing
She calls out his name, calls his name

Maybe we were meant to be lonely, lonely
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
Loneliness has always been with me, with me
Maybe we don't have to be all alone

What breaks your bones
Is not the load you're carryin'
What breaks you down
Is all in how you carry...

The lover held her love
She begs him not to go
She unwraps his gloves
The lover said I know I know I know
Kissed his trembling lips
She touched his fingertips
Somehow they both know
He's not comin' home, comin' home
Loneliness has always been with me, with me
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
But I gotta try or it will destroy me
'Cause baby we don't have to be all alone.
