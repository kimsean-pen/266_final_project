I need somebody to pull me
Away from this bitter love
The taste on my lips every
Time that we kiss, I can't get enough
Heaven knows that I've tried
But I never can seem to give you up
Guess I'm out of my mind
So go 'head and pour me another one

Got me singing oh, oh

I wanna run
But baby I drink you up
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love
I'm paralyzed
You give me the sweetest high
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love

You got me wasted and boy
I've been chasing you every night
Roses and wine and you're
Body on mine got me feeling right
Got that magic in you
And you've been possessing my piece of mind
I don't know what to do
I can't get away even when I try

Got me singing oh, oh

I wanna run
But baby I drink you up
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love
I'm paralyzed
You give me the sweetest high
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love

Feel it burning my veins
Loving you through the pain
Baby, I think that I'm going a little insane, oh
'Cause I can't get enough, you're all that I want
And you know I need your bitter love, hey

Baby I wanna run
But baby I drink you up
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love
I'm paralyzed
You give me the sweetest high
'Cause I need it, want it
Can't get enough of this bitter love
