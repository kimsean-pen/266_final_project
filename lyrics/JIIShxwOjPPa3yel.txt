Pardon me, summer scene
You found me and finders keep
You're why I'm sitting here making up songs in my room
Ad-libbing around like bum bum bum bum
You're why I keep my Texas sleep hours on tour
Instead of sleeping around like bum bum

Mind your head, I've lost my mind
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
Mind, your head, has lost its sight
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
The la-la-la-lobotomy
Has taken all of, all of me
The la-la-la-lobotomy
Took all but you
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down

Pardon me, cutting sleep
I'm taking up grinding teeth
You're why I'm sitting here,
hating myself for needing someone so bad
And feeling dumb dumb dumb dumb
If why I'm sitting here all goes wrong
Just push me back to Texas walking bum bum
God damn

Mind your head, I've lost my mind
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
Mind, your head, has lost its sight
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
The la-la-la-lobotomy
Has taken all of, all of me
The la-la-la-lobotomy
It took all but you
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down

So let me go, let me go down
Let me go, let me go down
Let me go, let me go
So let me go, let me go down
Let me go, let me go down
Let me go, let me go down, down, down, down
So let me go, let me go down
(Let's both talk in circles like infinity signs)
Let me go, let me go down
('Cause this won't last forever if we both want to die, right?)
Let me go, let me go

Mind your head, I lost my mind
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
Mind, your head, has lost its sight
From thinking about, thinking about you all the time
The lo-lo-lo-lobotomy
Has taken all, all of me
The lo-lo-lo-lobotomy
It took all but you
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
So let me go, let me go down
