Doctorie
give me a
for this
babaloo

opiate me
with that
key doctor
babaloo

Please
Don't you
laugh doc

Manos arriba
bien

With springs
tickling
less than two
feet
from your
chin

Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola

gonna sponge
you down
gonna sponge
you down

Save the crops
and the bodies
from illness
from pestilence
hunger and war
I journey each
night like a Saint
to stand on this
straw floor
our uniforms
are loose
they look
flimsy night
black shadows
under the peaks
of our caps
shaved up to
Augost I still
hear them singing

babaloo
babaloo

Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola

gonna sponge
you down
gonna sponge
you down

Hey you
hey you

This isn't
through

Opiate me
just for
me
with my
babaloo

please don't
you laugh?

Manos arriba
bien

again and again
again and again

Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola
Lemon Bloody Cola

gonna sponge
you down
gonna sponge
you down

I journey tonight
I'm a saint
to stand on this
straw floor

The tiles speckling
darker and
darker

around
my feet
