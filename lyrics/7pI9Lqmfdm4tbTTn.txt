i changed my mind
by clearing the room

i changed my mind
by clearing the room

ball, chain, kick the dead pen
blackness on the field, inhalers rush in
all the trippy yuppies expand in the lights
looping in their corners like truly whatever

met the ex-ravers at the mega-church
they improvise life
no reception in here

i changed my mind
by clearing the room

yesterday, it was tomorrow again
you were on the cover, dripping, it's nothing
i dont understand their numbers
the colors dont change
when the light doesnt live on the lane

i changed my mind
by clearing the room
