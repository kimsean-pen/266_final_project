But they can't say nothing was doing right
Cause government trash keeps you up all night
Simple press so hard they break their backs
Don't step on the gun cause you know about that

Twenty-one, twenty-one,... twenty one
Twenty-two, twenty-two, never made sense at twenty-two
Alright, it's alright

It's not a secret, anyone can find it
Look in the mirror, don't look in the fire
Cold start to feel again, pass it on
I said do what you want but just leave me alone

Nothing is free, call the police
Say trust to care, I dress to die

It's not a secret, anyone can find it
Look in the mirror, don't look in the fire
Cold start to feel again, pass it on
I said do what you want but just leave me alone
