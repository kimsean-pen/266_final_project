What did I clearly say?
Children should listen
No, no, please!
What were you not to do?
Childrem must see-
No!

And learn
Why could you not obey?
Children should listen.
What have I been to you?
What would you have me be?
Handsome like a prince?

Ah, but I am old.
I am ugly.
I embarass you
No!
You are ashamed of me
No!
You are ashamed.
You don't understand
It was lonely atop that tower
I was not company enough?

I am no longer a child. I wish to see the world
Don't you know what's out there in the world?
Someone has to shield you from the world.
Stay with me
Princes wait there in the world, it's true.
Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too.
Stay at home
I am home

Who out there could love you more than I?
What out there that I cannot supply?
Stay with me
Stay with me,
The world is dark and wild.
Stay a child while you can be a child.
With me.
