there's no quick fix
you gotta take your licks
strange times long lines
there are no clean cups
you gotta mess it up
to see why you cry

Chorus:

i can't stay home at night
i'm drawn out like a moth to lamplight
do I speak or hold you tight?
the words were voted out by a landslide

come on now
you've got to try it out
you're killing time
you're killing mine

don't go
i'll never know
when you're away
i sleep all day
nothing works
and thinking hurts
you belong to me
in my dreams

Chorus (x1)
