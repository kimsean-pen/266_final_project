Velvet of moonrise
Flowers float and downsize
Naruda's dream sky

On the way to nowhere
Fuel for a trip to nowhere
The yellowhammer flock here
Like you care

The tongue of a river
Speaks poems of pain
Aren't we all made in
Rings of rain?

We look up for something
Find nothing but endings
It's funny how it all seems
To be leaving.
