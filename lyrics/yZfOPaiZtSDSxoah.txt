Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the sacred wunder-kind
You took me behind a dis-used railway line
And said: "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped

I'm spellbound but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your room
They meant more to me
Than any, than any living thing on earth
They had more worth
Than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind

You will leave me behind
