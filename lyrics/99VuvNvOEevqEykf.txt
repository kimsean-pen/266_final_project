I don't wanna go there
I don't wanna go there anymore
I don't wanna go there
I don't wanna go there anymore

'cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

You're the one who told me
You're the one who told me what to say
Would you come and hold me
Would you come and show me right away

'cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it
And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it

I don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it anymore
Can you help me face
Help me 'fore I run right for the door

And I'm gone, I'm gone

Should I walk alone
Should I take it home, should I tell
It's not gonna know
It's not gonna go well

'cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone
'cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it
And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it
