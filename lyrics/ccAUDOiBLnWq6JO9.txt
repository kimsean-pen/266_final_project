Paperhouse
(Can)

Take a light shining on the land
Off the wall
Honeymoon, think anything
Make you feel so bad
You can make everything
What you want with your head
You are here and they are there
Everywhere with your mind

Sometimes in my life
It's too hard to hear
Too many savage songs
Itch out for their sound
Forgetting everything
You in your mind
Your flying paperhouse
Reach out for the sky

You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more ...

You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more
You just can't get back no more ...

Honeymoon, think anyhing
Make you feel so bad
You can make everything
What you want with your head
Honeymoon, think anyhing
Make you feel so bad
You can make everything
What you want with your head

Honeymoon paperhouse
Let's fly out of the sky
Honeymoon paperhouse
Let's fly out of the sky
Every day my paperhouse
Coming in, reaching out
