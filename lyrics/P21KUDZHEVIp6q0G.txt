I don't wanna leave
You and me
Suddenly
It's gon the wrong direction
Turn
Don't get burned
You're my girl
I need that deep affection too
Here with you
Yeah, it's cool
But do you really want me babe
Just to say
Ought to change
Whatever makes you happy

I don't want to take
That is yours to give away
When you're out I see you around
if you're calling another name

I don't want to take
That is yours to give away
When you're out I see you around
if you're calling another name

Let's have another go
Take it slow
Yeah you know
That we can make it happen
Then
Here again
At the end
You give me something difficult
Made a fool
But it's cool
It's nothing I can handle us
But it's tough
You're enough
To make it all worth while

I don't want to take
That is yours to give away
When you're out I see you around
if you're calling another name

I don't want to take
That is yours to give away
When you're out I see you around
if you're calling another name
