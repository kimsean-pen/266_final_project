I smile, you laugh, I look away
I sigh, you ask me why, I say
It's okay and I'm just feeling down

Your hand on mine I hear the words
If only love had found us first
Our lives, they would be different, oh

But that was not the plan, oh

Where would we be now, baby
If we found each other first?
What would you do now darling?
If I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait
as long as you want
Where would we be now baby?

And now I must confess
That I'm a sinking ship
I'm anchored by the weight of my heart
'Cause it's filled with these feelings
But I keep my true thoughts locked
Beside my hearts black box
And it won't be found, it won't survive
Through the smoke or the wreckage
So I guess I'll crash and burn, oh

Where would we be now, baby
If we found each other first?
What would you do now, darling
If I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait
As long as you want
Where would we be now, baby?

I'll wait
I'll wait

Where would we be now, baby
If we found each other first?
What would you do now, darling
If I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait
As long as you want
Where would we be now baby?

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
