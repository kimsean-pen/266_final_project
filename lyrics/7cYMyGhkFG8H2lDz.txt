Submerge to their temples,
All ye children of the sea
Sinister sea sabbath!

Bow to their altars,
All ye children of the sea
Sinister sea sabbath!
A dreadful gathering, a nautic spectacle.
Adoration of the Old Ones beneath the surface.
Find absolution in eldritch temples below.

Abyssopelagial glow—amphibian race
Drawn down by their alluring grace.

Roars of Dagon echo
Through lifeless ears!

Mesmerized,
Obedient to the deep, submerge to their temples.
Blood for their altars!

Dawn has set, silence on blood-soaked shores
Eerie summonings still resound from dying throats
Adoration of the Old Ones, lurking in the deep
Absolution is granted in eerie temples below!

Descent into the deep blue sphere.
Subjugation—the ultimate gods are here!
Deep Ones escort the reborn
Evolution reversed

Mesmerized,
Obedient to the deep. Submerged to their temples.
Blood for their
Altars!

Deny all false idols,
All ye children of the sea
Sinister sea sabbath!

Dare speak their names,
All ye children of the sea
Sinister sea sabbath!
