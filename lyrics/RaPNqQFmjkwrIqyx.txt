Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you
No no no no no no no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do

Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Well, you can spare a kiss or two
And still have plenty left

No no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right

You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
But I ain't greedy, baby
All I want is all you got

No no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right

I got wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit's foot 'round my wrist
You know I'd have all the things my lucky charms could bring
If you'd give me just one sweet kiss

No no no no no no no, baby
I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do
That's right

Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
That's right
Just a big-a big-a big-a
