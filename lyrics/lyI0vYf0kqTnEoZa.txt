What we're living in?
Lemme tell ya...

Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be

And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And, now that things are changing for the worse, see:
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in!
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, all that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the color
Of her child
That's not Nature's way

Well, that's what they said, yesterday
There's nothing left to do, but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane!
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures
That we have to be told

Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, all that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Oh!

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
Nothing so bad, happy man
Oh, yeah
I know, yeah
(Take it to the dance floor)

I know I can't know of

Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change
Yeah
Things
Will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh
Oh, virtual insanity

Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual
Virtual insanity
That we're living in
That we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what we have
Yeah

Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, all that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Oh!

Futures made of (now) virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless, twisting, all that new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Yes, we do!
Oh!

(living in)
Now, this life that we live in
(virtual insanity)
It's oh so wrong
Out of the window
(living in)
You know that there is nothing worse than
(virtual insanity)
(living in)
A medley man
(virtual insanity)
Still there's nothing worse than
(living in)
A foolish mind
(virtual insanity)
Hey!

Virtual insanity is what we're living in
Yeah
Well... It's alright, now
