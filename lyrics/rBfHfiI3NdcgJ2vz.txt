Sometimes, I wake up, forget myself
Then I myself, had to pinch myself
Then count my wealth, then count my blessings
Then make them count, then count my blessings
Then make them count

If you think you're gonna string me along
You got another thing coming, whoa
I ain't never play 2nd fiddle for nathin'
I mean, God never bowed down to Satan
Tell me how I'm supposed to be patient
Gotta get it how you get it, no waiting
Time waits for no one, fuck your excuses
Jesus or Judas, which one are you with?
I had to get up, get on my grind and go get mine
But I'll be right back, I'll be right back
(Sing it now, sing it now)
Sometimes, I wake up

My dreams give me wings, I reached the stars last night
My imagination is now real life
No more stressing, just success and switching new addresses
Agent Provocateur and Donna Karen dresses
You losing ground throwing dirt
Even when I ain't have shit
I always knew my worth, and I still kept God first
Played the back of the church, ski mask under my hijab
As I pray to Jesus for a few early releases and

I had to get up, get on my grind and go get mine
But I'll be right back (I'll be right back)
I'll be right back (I'll be right back)
(Sing it now, sing it now)

Don't take it the wrong way, I just wanna be great
I'm running in my own race, I'm just tryna keep pace
My real friends are still my friends
Fake ones, they came and went
Ricky Bobby daddy told me long time ago
If you ain't first, you're last, y'all can all kiss my ass
