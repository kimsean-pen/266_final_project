I see you holding my place again
When you brushed by my sun burned skin
It turned me white to feel you there
So come on, won't you follow on the path near me
You took my hand and nobody could make up this feeling now
I think of how you arrived on a summer day
Take me where you want to be
We would burn in the summer rain
Now take me back to that summer day
Tell me how you took ahold of me
It feels like yesterday
Now take me back to that summer day
The young still have their ways
Foolish and fumbling through their days
Until the winter of their summer love
But without you a colorless pane
Stretches past what my eyes can strain
Cold again, I think of when you arrived on a summer day
Take me where you want to be
We would burn in the summer rain
Now take me back to that summer day
Tell me how you took ahold of me
It feels like yesterday
Now take me back to that summer day
You know we carry the same load, and we hold it close
Could we be running the same road?
I know you're sharing the same love
Do you think of me?
Do I haunt your dreams?
I remember when you arrived on a summer day
Take me where you want to be
We would burn in the summer rain
Now take me back to that summer day
Tell me how you took ahold of me
It feels like yesterday
You arrived on a summer day
Take me where you want to be
We would burn in the summer rain
Now take me back to that summer day
