Based one got them bands, ho

Blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
On an island, we party straight off the private jet
'Cause I got blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
On an island, we party straight off the private jet

Yeah, Billy Jean, my life a movie scene
I give her cock, she scream, wipe off that Maybelline
You tryna join the squad, you tryna join the team
No, he can't ride with us, we hit him with the beam
I left that nigga stuck, he can't roll with the posse
He tried to stunt on us, but that boy a nobody
I got on Number (N)ine, she tryna touch my Johnny
Hop in, you wanna race, I take off like a jockey
Had to put my teeth on ice, when I talk, see this light
Why you wanna know the price if you won't come and buy?
Caught the game by surprise, now they all fuck with Skies
I read between those lies, life sweet like apple pie

Pop like a trunk, nigga, 'cause we up now (We up)
Your girl get fucked nigga
While I'm wearin' my bustdown (She suck)
You think these hoes loyal
When they get passed 'round
When you come from the soil,
You'll never go back to ground

'Cause I got blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
On an island, we party straight off the private jet
'Cause I got blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
On an island, we party straight off the private jet

Yeah, yeah, private party, smokin' like Bob Marley
All of my niggas gnarly, we prolly take your shawty
I'll let you take that L, I got the clientele
No, I don't need your help, my trap, it ring like bells
A private location, I got these hoes waiting
I'm with the woes chasin', cup got me so faded
We at the top spot, haters can kick rocks
You never was hot, somebody tell him stop
Magic like Houdini, get bread like zucchini
She wanna come see me, wearin' her bikini
She tryna give me neck
She slid through with a text
Baby I been a threat
Lately she been obsessed

Pop like a trunk, nigga
'Cause we up now (We up)
Your girl get fucked nigga
While I'm wearin' my bustdown (She suck)
You think these hoes loyal,
When they get passed 'round
When you come from the soil
You'll never go back to ground

'Cause I got blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
On an island, we party straight off the private jet
'Cause I got blue strips, I just make checks
I don't want lil' shorty if it ain't great sex
Take 'em out like Hardy, we like to break necks
