Smother me, choke my persistence
Underneath the surface cold
And in my mind there's no resistance
No defence, there's no stronghold

I gaze into deceiving mirrors
They stare back hard, so vile and cold
Within their grasp, hangs my submission
They cling on tight, they won't let go
I can't take no more

Hold on to me, I'm led adrift in deceitful seas
My limbs turn numb as the waves subdue me
Can't breathe, I can't breathe
I'm at the mercy of the vile and deep blue sea
Can't breathe

Eventually I lost my grip
And through my hands this life slipped
Although it felt, like it was long gone
No future there, for this life undone
I can't carry on

Hold on to me, I'm led adrift in deceitful seas
My limbs turn numb as the waves subdue me
Can't breathe, I can't breathe
I'm at the mercy of the vile and deep blue sea
Can't breathe

Hold on to me, I'm led adrift in deceitful seas
My limbs turn numb as the waves subdue me
Can't breathe, I can't breathe
I'm at the mercy of the vile and deep blue sea
Can't breathe

Let go of me, I'm led adrift in deceitful seas
My limbs turned numb as the waves subdued me
Couldn't breathe, I could not breathe
Drowned in the arms of the vile and deep blue sea
Won't breathe
