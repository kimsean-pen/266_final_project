Please read it in my pale face,
ask me if I'm a goth or a manic depressive,
but please don't be disturbed.
Why ever since I left our friendship breaks to pieces,
because I'm tired of your sad lives,
how everyone made it without romance in this city,
can you not see,
that we can beat the cold with our closest friend,
as long as we're together we're an avalanche,
as long as we're together we're an avalanche.

No one likes each other.
In the 21st century.
I want to lose the others,
because I have to think about me.
