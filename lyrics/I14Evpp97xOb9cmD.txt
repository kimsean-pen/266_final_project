She thinks I'm crazy
Judging by the faces that she's making
And I think she's pretty
But pretty's just part of the things she does that amaze me
She calls me sweetheart
I love it when she wakes me when it's still dark
And she watches the sun
But she's the only one I have my eyes on

Tell me that you love me
And it'll be alright
Are you thinking of me?
Just come with me tonight
You know I need you
Just like you need me
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming

And she moves in closer
Whispering to me, "I thought I told ya"
And oh, she's playing games now
And I figured it out now that we're, now that we're closer
Two kids, one love
Who cares if we make it up?
Her voice is sweet sound
All our clothes lay on the ground
She moves in closer (She moves in closer)
Whispers, "I thought I told ya"

Tell me that you love me
And it'll be alright
Are you thinking of me?
Just come with me tonight
You know I need you
Just like you need me
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming

Remember the day when we started this
And you made the shape of my heart with her hands
We try to make some sense of it
But she called me on the phone and said...

Tell me that you love me
And it'll be alright
Are you thinking of me?
Just come with me tonight
You know I need you
Just like you need me
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming

Go on and tell them that you love me
And it'll be alright
(I must be dreaming)
Are you thinking of me?
(I must be dreaming)
Just come to me tonight
She moves in closer
(I must be dreaming)
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming
