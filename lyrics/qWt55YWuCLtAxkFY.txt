Should have known at the end of summer
The innocence fades and the weak become stronger
Should have known at the end of the summer
I'd be lost without you

The skyline looked like a stained glass window
The city sang such mad crescendo
Four bare feet on a rain soaked street
Summer airbrushed fever dreams

Disappeared in a camera flash
Why do the bad girls never last
Lost in gin and lemonade
Elecrospins and the mermaid parade

Four quartets and no regrets
Except for the polaroids I left
You were just some spell i was under
That endless summer
