I really love your dark dark eyes especially with that charming smile of yours
I really love that messy hair you get when you just roll out of my bed

But there's one thing I haven't told you yet
I'll love you even more when things are bad
You said I don't deserve to have someone like you
Im only human and you're the moon
I'll never know how to treat you right
Sooner or later you'll leave my side

If I could go back in time
I would still say yes I do
Cuz i would go through hell
Just to be with you

I really hate it when you lie especially when you're seeing her again
I really hate it when you say you love me while you're laying next to her

But there's one thing that will never change
Is the love from me that you've been taking for granted
You said baby I'll change I'll come back to you
This is just a phase all these girls and booze
Please believe me when I say
My heart belongs to you

If i could go back in time
I would still say yes I do
'Cuz i would go through hell
Just to be with you

I know things aren't looking good but I'm not giving up on you on us on our love
Maybe you don't see it working out for us right now
But I'll show you how beautiful love can be

If I could go back in time
I would still say yes I do
Cuz i would go through hell
Just to be with you
Cuz I would go through hell
Just to be with you
