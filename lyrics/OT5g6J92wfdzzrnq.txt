The beauty that you gave
Has turned upon itself
And all the things you said
Evaporated, evaporated

Was I blind
Deaf and dumb
To the words slipped
From your tongue?

Honestly
(Alone in my bed)
Honestly
(The things that you said)
Honestly
(Go round in my head still)

Honestly
(It seems to be true)
Honestly
(That nothin' I do)
Honestly
(Can influence you)

(I tried and tried again)
Don't you know I tried and tried again
To make you listen to me
But everything I said it always seemed to go right through you
(To make you notice me)
I turned myself into a person that I didn't like
But please believe me when I say, "I know it wasn't right"

(But talking to myself)
I never thought that things would get to be so complicated
I never thought that you and me would end up so frustrated
(Won't catch you attention I see)
You'd think that something had to come from all those good intentions
But in the end I needed something more than intervention

Was I mad?
Foolish me
To succumb
So easily

Honestly
(Alone in my bed)
Honestly
(The things that you said)
Honestly
(Go round in my head still)

Honestly
(It seems to be true)
Honestly
(That nothin' I do)
Honestly
(Can influence you still)

Fools like me
Get so easily taken
But fools like me
Can be so mistaken

Honestly
Honestly
Honestly

(The promise that you gave)
Don't you know the promise that you gave just turned it's back upon me
I stopped believing but you couldn't take the whole thing from me
(Has turned it's back)
I never thought I'd have to pay the price to set you free

(And all you represented was just my projection you see)
You know I never thought I'd ever live a day without you
And that's the reason why it makes me sad to think about you
And you know I never thought I'd make it if you wasn't there
And now I'm tryin' to eject myself from this despair

People come
People go
Never say
"I told you so"

Honestly
(Alone in my bed)
Honestly
(The things that you said)
Honestly
(Go round in my head still)

Honestly
(It seems to be true)
Honestly
(That nothin' I do)
Ya, honestly
(Can influence you)

"Honestly", I said
(Alone in my bed)
Honestly
(The things that you said)
Honestly
(Go round in my head still)

Told you honestly
(It seems to be true)
I said, "Honestly"
(That nothin' I do)
Honestly
(Can influence you)

Everything I know you said
Goin' round inside my head
Never thought I'd see the day
Always got a price to pay
Nothin' that I ever do
Ever seems to get to you
