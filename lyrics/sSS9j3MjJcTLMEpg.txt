Sunday night, I'm lying on
Your body with my legs
Locked 'round you like the safest
Kind of sorry I could give
'Cause I know I let you down before
Dimmed light coming in from the hallway
You're in you black jeans
I'm in white lingerie and it's 3am
I'm lying awake thinking

That when I'm sad, my eyes run like streams
But yours stay dry as you clench your teeth
And that's how I know that you're the one for me

'Cause I think about you on the train
Love how you say my second name
It seems without you, I'm insane
Now you're asleep and I'm gonna say it anyway
I love you
I love you
I love you

Moonlight on a sun kissed body
Put you're ink on my skin
'Til it comes off on me
Oooh, ooh
The T.V.'s on again, they're dead
There's zombies in the bed, oh

When I'm sad, my eyes run like streams
But yours stay dry as you clench your teeth
And that's how I know that you're the one for me

'Cause I think about you on the train
Love how you hate what's in your brain
Watching you sleep like I'm insane
Telling you things that I find hard to say
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you

Remember when we sat out by the graves
Laughing and talking about life
You took me to Heaven when I had no faith
And showed me what love is really like

I think about you on the train
Love how you say my second name
Watching you sleep like I'm insane
Telling you things that I find hard to say
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
