Words get broken, cut me open
Love confound me, kill me quickly
Breathe out, breathe in, throw me living
Off the deep end while I'm sleeping

I'm a crazy fool, I'm a fool addicted
To the touch of you, to your poison kisses
What you got to lose? What do you think this is?
Nothing left to prove and we know that love is

Overrated, overrated in this goddamn world
Overrated, overrated in this goddamn world
Overrated, overrated, overrated in this goddamn world
Overrated, overrated, overrated in this goddamn world

Stars are magic, life is tragic
Crime of passion, I'm just asking

Offered up my wrist and you thought you hit it
But your arrow missed, couldn't kill me with it
All I asked of you was to free my pain
So you couldn't do this to me again

Overrated, overrated, overrated
Overrated in this goddamn world

Overrated, overrated (Words get broken)
Overrated in this goddamn world (Cut me open)
Overrated, overrated (Breathe out, breathe in)
Overrated in this goddamn world (Throw me living)

Overrated, overrated (Words get broken)
Overrated in this goddamn world (Cut me open)
Overrated, overrated (Stars are magic)
Overrated in this goddamn world (Life is tragic)

Overrated, overrated, overrated in this goddamn world
