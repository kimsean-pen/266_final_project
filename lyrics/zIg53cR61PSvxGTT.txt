Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth...

I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak we can peak from the windows of their mouths

To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun.
You never think you know
Know, you never think you know
Know, ever think you know why

Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings
Trying to soar, being a whore of life and almost everything
Sheep that ran off from the herd, maybe dead

Now's a bird, able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your mother's earth.
You never think you know

Know, you never think you know
Know, ever think you know why
On the other side, the other side
The other side.
Do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly?

Have you ever wanted to die, have you ever want to die?
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, you ever try to die.
Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
