Dethroning the dream
Of noen night in rain
I stripped from the skin
But kept it in

Same remains the same
Cold sheets and mattress stains
There's no telling you
To want me to

You miss the disco lights
It's all pleather now
A synthetic world without end
Sheds a tear of plastic deception

The last dance
With the rain
On the nod
On the train
Hunting the haunted with shame
I will remember your name
I had hoped my love alone could outlive my past
I had hoped a to thread the black hole
With no strings attached

Thorn to finger again
A head in a strange hand
I prayed for some truth
'Til my face turned blue

To fill the void between
Your youth and lust
You'll cross the bridge between
My knives and trust

You miss the neon lights
It's all plastic now
A sympathetic world without end
Hums a hymn of misdirection

The last dance
With the rain
On the nod
On the train
Hunting the haunted with shame
I will remember your name
I had hoped my love alone could outlive my past
I had hoped a to thread the black hole
With no strings attached
