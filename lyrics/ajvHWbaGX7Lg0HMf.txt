Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
I thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights the TV and the radio
but still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all
Crazy some would say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
Pride will tear us both apart
Well now, pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What has happened to me
Crazy some will say
Where is my friend when I need you most
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

What has happened to it all
Crazy some would say
Where is the world that I recognize?
Gone away

And I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world
Is my world (I will learn to survive)
Every world
Every world
Somehow (Somehow I have to find)
