There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Sussusudio oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Sussusudio oh oh

Oh if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Sussusudio, just say the word
Oh Sussusudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Sussusudio oh oh
Ooh give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Sussusudio oh oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Sussusdio just say the word
Oh Sussusudio, oh

Ah, she's all I need all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Sussusudio I just say the word
Oh Sussusudio I just say the word
Oh Sussusudio I'll say the word
Sussusudio oh oh oh
Just say the word
Just say the word
Sussusudio oh oh oh
Sussusudio
Sussusudio
Sussusudio oh oh oh
Sussusudio
Just say the word
Sussusudio oh oh oh
Sussusudio
Just say the word...
