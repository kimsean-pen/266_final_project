The time has come again where I am tied
She's tying my arteries as if she were tying her shoes
She's given me a taste
But she won't give me none
She tasted really sweet
But now she's gone

She lives on my block so I just ride by
I haven't had the opportunity to stay high
She lingers in every dream I feel so insane
I really miss her purple presence and her purple stain

On my pillow sheet
Left by her purple hair
Left me with a purple gaze
A heavy haze that makes her photographic
Placed on a pedestal
In the crack in between my brain
Tagged in Braille writing in my cerebral wall

So just climb a tree
and spend some time with me
Climb a tree
I wanta kiss ya
Climbing creating collages
like the fluidity of our speech
I hope you're in my reach

She lives on my block so I just ride by
I haven't had the opportunity to stay high
She lingers in every dream I feel so insane
I really miss her purple presence and her purple stain
