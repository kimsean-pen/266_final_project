Turn it up
To the beat under your feet
Music we trust, Keep it going
Now you're showing signs of lust
Keep it steady don't stray off too far
Feeling heavy that just comes with all this what
Do you mean you cannot see what's in your cup
You take way too many but it's not enough
For you to get this just be patient it will come
And we can have fun, When we get there

So we can meet back all just don't get lost
Then we will be again. now show you off
The point of keeping time where off the charts
So we can just pretend we're on the clock

Calls are coming through my telephone
Can't answer right now I'm gone
So much in me, I can't feel my tone
So they can just keep calling

We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we get there
We can make luh when we

Oh we're floating it's so potent
Now we're moving in slow motion
And I hope when I come in down
Girl Stay focused stayin' here
All I care about the motive
You should know this
You saw this coming
We keep it going
Hope We don't stop till morning
I feel this coming I can notice that you're gone
Where did you go?
I wanna know, I wanna know
I thought we had fun
When we got there

So we can meet back all just don't get lost
Then we will be again, now show you off
The point of keeping time where off the charts
So we can just pretend we're on the clock

Calls are coming through my telephone
Can't answer right now I'm gone
So much in me, I can't feel my tone
So they can just keep calling

We can make luh when we get there
