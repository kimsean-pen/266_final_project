Sat suffering, I knew him when
Fair-weather friends of mine
Try not to think, I merely blink
Hope to wish away the lies...

Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive
Yeah...

(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)

I choose the day, one damp and gray
Thick fog to hide our smiles

Clear all your sins
Get born again
Just repeat a couple lines
Lines...
Lines...
Lines...
yeah

(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)

Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive

I choose the day,
One damp and gray
Thick fog to hide our smiles

Sat suffering
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Get born again
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Sat suffering
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Get born again
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Sat suffering
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Get born again
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Sat suffering
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Get born again
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Sat suffering
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
Get born again
(Who denied all... And tied all the lies)
