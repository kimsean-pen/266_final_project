And meet me there
Bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours of cold
Winter shall howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time
Shelter as we go

And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
Surface, far below these birds

And maybe, just maybe, I'll come home

Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?
Going to tell you stories of mine
Who am I?

Oh, who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Could be a burden in time, lonely
Who am I, to you?

And who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Will be a burden
Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?

I come alone here
I come alone here
