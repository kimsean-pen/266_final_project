Plastic skin, imitation grin, to find a soul not left inside
Androidic man and he sells what he
can, while we're all just set to die
By our own hand we draw a line in
the sand and recreate a soulless life
Our creator we don't fear you
Do your maker we don't care who
You put us here to serve you
You put us here to help who?
Who?
Demutanize,
and now their line is curse, and bring an end, all left to fry
Speak not a word about he castrated herd and being man i now a crime
The robotize and now we're finalized part of the mechanized decline
Total eviction the situation fits you, or a chosen time to rise?
Our creator we don't fear you
Do your make we don't care who
You put me here to serve you
The put us here to help who
Stupid man, I'm chained and slaved to
Stupid man, my help will scourge you
