Maybe I'm a dreamer.
Maybe I'm misunderstood.
Maybe you're not seeing, the side of me you should.
Maybe I'm crazy (Maybe I'm Crazy)
Maybe I'm the only one (Maybe I'm The only one)

Maybe I'm just out of touch.

Maybe I've just had enough.
Maybe it's time to change,
And leave it all behind,
I've never been one to walk alone,
I've always been scared to try.
So why does it feel so wrong,
To reach for something more?
Don't want to live a better life,
What am I waiting for?
'Cause nothing stays the same,

Maybe it's time to change.

Maybe it's hopeless (Maybe it's hopeless)
Maybe I should just give up(Maybe I should just give up)

What if I can't trust myself?
What if I just need some help?

Maybe it's time to change,
And leave it all behind,
I've never been one to walk alone,
I've always been scared to try.
So why does it feel so wrong,
To reach for something more?
Don't want to live a better life,

What am I waiting for?
'Cause nothing stays the same,
Maybe it's time to change.

And maybe it's time to change,
And leave it all behind,
I've never been one to walk alone,
I've always been scared to try.
