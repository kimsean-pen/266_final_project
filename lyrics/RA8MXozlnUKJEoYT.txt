I don't know what to feel
I don't know what to say
Oh, I don't know what to do
What makes me treat you this way
Oh, I get numb in my bones
Or I get numb in my heart
Why don't you leave me alone
Before I tear you apart?

I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake
That you love to hate
I apologize
It's your destiny
To get the devil out of me

Oh, I don't know what to do
It always ends the same way
Though I have been here before
I know the rules to this game
And though I try not to lose
In the end I will fall
Better to have you in tears
Than not to have you at all

I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake
That you love to hate

I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake
That you love to hate
I apologize
It's your destiny
To get the devil out of me

If you think I'm hard to handle (you give up so easily)
I just need a good example (to be what I used to be)

Get the devil out of me!

I'm no Jesus Christ
I'm the one mistake
That you love to hate
I apologize
It's your destiny
To get the devil out of me
