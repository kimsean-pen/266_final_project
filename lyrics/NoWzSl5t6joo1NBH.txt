Twelve divisions of the day
Introducing a manufactured sky
Polished prophets speak in rhyme
Narcissism on the net
Holy water shower me

Daylight sanction, bayonette bulb
Useless speech on the surface
Lack of emotion, sanities rule
Narcissism on the net
Holy water shower me

Feeling slightly indifferent to unnatural human existence
And the day consists of copied routine
Social logistics, speed, same creed

Waking up, body clock, an imitation, self forgot
Venus parachute, incest work
It's common grounding for an introvert

Twelve divisions of the day
Some things aren't testament to living
Set alarm to identify
