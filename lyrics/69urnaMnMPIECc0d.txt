Oh no, bye bye
So we have another year
But do you think that we have the time?
Oh no, bye bye
So we have another year
But do you think that we have the time?

'Cause I wanna know
I would want to
Does it still get cold outside?
Do you think we can make it together?
Do you think it would be all right?
'Cause it'd be a shame
It would be a
If the end did come inside
Well, at least we would have each other
And I think it would be all right

Oh no, bye bye
Well, I thought that I heard someone laugh
I think that I heard a lie
Oh no, bye bye
Well, I thought that I heard some laughter
I think that I heard a lie

And I wanna know
I would want to
Does it still get dark at night?
Do you think we can make it together?
Do you think that we have the time?
'Cause it'd be a shame
It would be a
If the end did come inside
Well, at least we would have each other
And I think it would be all right
And at least we would have each other
And I think it would be all right
It's over now, over now, over now, over now
