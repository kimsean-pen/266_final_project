It's unclear now, what we intend
We're alone in our own world
You don't wanna be my boyfriend
And I don't wanna be your girl
And that, that's a relief
We'll drink up our grief
And pine for summer
And we'll buy beer to shotgun
And we'll lay in the lawn
And we'll be good

Now I'm laughing at my boredom
At my string of failed attempts
Because you think that it's important
And I welcome the sentiment

And we talk on the phone at night
Until it's daylight
And I feel clever
And I hear the slow in your speech
Yeah you're half asleep
Say goodnight

Now I've got friendships to mend
I'm selfishly dispossessed
You don't wanna be my boyfriend
And that's probably for the best
Because that, that gets messy
And you will hurt me
Or I'll disappear

So we will drink beer all day
And our guards will give way
And we'll be good
