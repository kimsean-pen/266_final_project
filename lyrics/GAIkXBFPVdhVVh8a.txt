Here I am
There you are
Why does it seem so far
Next to you is where I should be
(Where wanna be)

Something I want so bad
Know what's inside your head
Maybe I can see what you see
(Tell me what you see)

I gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine

If you're staying or leaving
I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending
Open your eyes
I can be what you need

Any kind of guy you want girl
That's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind of guy you want girl
You know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide, change your mind
I will be there

Won't you try
One more time
Be my any kind of girl
You decide, it's alright
I will be there

You seem so
Hard to know
Say goodbye, say hello
Then you say that it's time to go
(Now it's time to go)

Changing my point of view
Everyday something new
Anything to get next to you

I gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine

If you're staying or leaving
I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending
Open your eyes
I can be what you need

Any kind of guy you want girl
That's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind of guy you want girl
You know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide, change your mind
I will be there

Won't you try
One more time
Be my any kind of girl
You decide, it's alright
I will be there

Let me know if I'm getting through
Making you understand
If it's wrong, I'll try something new
Don't look away
'Cause I'm here to stay
If it's a game
Then I'm gonna play

Any kind of guy you want girl
That's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind of guy you want girl
You know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around
(Yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide, change your mind
I will be there

Won't you try
One more time
Be my any kind of girl
You decide, it's alright
I will be there

(Bring it back)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide, it's alright
I will be there
