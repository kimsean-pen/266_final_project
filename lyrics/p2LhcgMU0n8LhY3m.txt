Ingest, where it goes
Nobody sees but me
So perfect and so sweet
But the rest feels incomplete
Oh, like the rabbit's foot I keep
In the locket, with no key

And I can't take it, I can't take
This world without, this world without you
I can't take it, I can't take it on my own
On my own

On these roads
Out of love
So it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control
On these roads
How it sings as it goes
Flight of field, driving snow
Knows the cold
Ran round the wailing world

And what's a song without you?
When every song I write is about you
When I can't hold myself without you
And I can't change the day I found you

On these roads
Out of love
So it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control
On these roads
How it sings as it goes
Flight of field, driving snow knows the cold

Out of love
So it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control
On these roads
How it sings as it goes
Flight of field, driving snow knows the cold
Ran round the wailing world
