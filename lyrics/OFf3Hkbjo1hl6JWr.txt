Blue, blue, blue
Bluer than the night
You can't change the colour of your pretty eyes
But I, I, I
I have seen the clues
Leaving something dirty on me, like tattoos

Do I have to keep you safe and warm tonight?
Didn't no one ever teach you wrong from right?
I don't wanna be something objectified

Listen, baby, it's you
How you gonna keep afloat?
Baby, it's true
Water's rising, then I choke
Now I think you're losing something critical
Maybe our love is just a physical rendezvous

Shade, shade, shade
Shading in the lines
I'm just staying steady whilst you're in disguise
Buy, buy, buy
Buy some extra time
You can fool the world before they realize

I don't wanna be something objectified

Listen, baby, it's you
How you gonna keep afloat?
Baby, it's true
Water's rising, then I choke
Now I think you're losing something critical
Maybe our love is just a physical rendezvous

Ooh
So be a man and take my sympathy for granted
Just take it, just take it, oh
Ooh
Now wash your hands of all the little lies you planted
Just take it, just take it, oh

As I remember, you told me the first time
I was just your rendezvous
Oh

Listen, baby, it's you
How you gonna keep afloat?
Baby, it's true
Water's rising, then I choke
Now I think you're losing something critical
Maybe our love is just a physical rendezvous

How you gonna keep afloat?
Baby, it's true
Water's rising, then I choke
Now I think you're losing something critical
Maybe our love is just a physical rendezvous
