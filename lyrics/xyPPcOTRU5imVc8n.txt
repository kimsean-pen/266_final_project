What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care?
What do I got to do when lighting strikes me?
And to wake to find that you're not there?

What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
And what do I say when it's all over, babe?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over, babe?
Whoa, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

Whoa, whoa
Sorry seems to be always the hardest word

What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
And what do I do when lighting strikes me?
What do I got to do, what do I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word?
