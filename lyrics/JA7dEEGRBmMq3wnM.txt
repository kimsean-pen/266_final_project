You see my baby sends your love around
Just to use it on another like a trick now
Only comes like a thief in the night
But you know that it's not right
Now I know that it was foolish of me
To give away such a pivotal part of me
It's only sad because it could've been easy
Yeah, it could've been easy

I know I'm not the only one who listened to ya
Billie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal
Maybe if I was young, unpredictable
He's got her heart and I

And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all

I used to think that she could've been an angel
But you left all her demons on my front step
It's creeping up on me like it never left
Like it never left

You know I lost my mind
About a thousand times
Because it could've been easy
You know it could've been easy

I know I'm not the only one who listened to ya
Billie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal
Maybe if I was young, unpredictable
He's got her heart and I

And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all

You know I lost my mind
About a thousand times
Because it could've been easy
You know it could've been easy

I know I'm not the only one who listened to ya
Billie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal
Maybe if I was young, unpredictable
He's got her heart and I

And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I
And I want it all back, and I (want it all)
And I want it all (want it all)
