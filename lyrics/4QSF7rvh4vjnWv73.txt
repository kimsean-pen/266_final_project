Doesn't really matter what you say
Nothing's gonna stand in my way
Waiting for the truth to come out
And I just don't know how

I needed you from the first kiss
You know I just can't help it
Can you be my witness
Coz I'm still

Needing this boy
Breaking my heart
Taking my money
Tearing me apart
Needing this boy
Breaking me down
Using my love whenever he's around

Doesn't really matter what he does
Coz he knows he's getting my love
Waiting for it all to fall apart
Coz he's breaking my heart

I needed him from the first kiss
You know I just can't have this
Can you be my witness
I'm going crazy

Needing this boy
Breaking my heart
Taking my money
Tearing me apart
Needing this boy
Breaking me down
Using my love whenever he's around

Needing this boy
Breaking my heart
Taking my money
Tearing me apart
Needing this boy
Breaking me down
Using my love whenever he's around

B.O.Y.
B.O.Y.
B.O.Y.
B.O.Y.

Coz I'm needing this boy:
Coz I'm needing this boy:

Boy
Breaking my heart
Taking my money
Tearing me apart
Needing this boy
Breaking me down
Using my love whenever he's around

Coz I'm needing this boy
Breaking my heart
Taking my money
Tearing me apart
Needing this boy
Breaking me down
Using my love whenever he's around

B.O.Y.
B.O.Y.
B.O.Y.
