Hey God, have you been looking for me?
Hey God, have you been trying to make me see?
I've been hiding from you, cuz I didn't know what to do
I've been hiding from you, cuz i was scared to seek the truth

Didn't know, didn't know if I could deal
If I found out heaven wasn't real
Walked away, took some drugs did some reading
But I never ever found a valid reason

I never heard a good reason for me to stop believing

Hey God I've been talking to you
Hey God, I'm not sure if I'm getting through
Have you been hiding from me, trying to test my unbelief?
Have you been hiding from me, trying to help me see thee clearly?

I don't know, I don't know if I could deal
with all the silence and all the violence
I don't know, I don't know if I could deal
With all the crying and all the dying

I never heard a good reason for me to stop believing
So I just don't think about it

I'm in a Wavy Daze
But I'm finding my place

I never heard a good reason for me to stop believing
So I just don't think about it
