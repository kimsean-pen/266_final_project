It's too hard to begin when we know it will end
And if you got a friend, better leave with him
Well if you only want us to dance, I can stand up
I know that I need love, but I CAN'T PRETEND,
I CAN'T PRETEND

One day the moon will set for the last time
Maybe we'll become part of a mountain
We've always learned these things
You know I'm not crying
But you know I'm not trying to get

It's too hard to begin when we know it will end
And if you got a friend, better leave with him
Well if you only want us to dance, I can stand up
I know that I need love, but I CAN'T PRETEND,
I CAN'T PRETEND, I CAN'T PRETEND

Remember when you first touched my hand
We sparkled inside at the same time
And now it doesn't even matter

It's too hard to begin when we know it will end
And if you got a friend, better leave with him
Well if you only want us to dance, I can stand up
I know that I need love, but I CAN'T PRETEND,
I CAN'T PRETEND, I CAN'T PRETEND

I see the sky, high on a mountain
It's too hard to begin when we know it will end
I see the sky, high on a mountain
I see the sky, high on a mountain
