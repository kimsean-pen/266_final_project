In every corridor that shifted the maze,
No single part of you was ever the same.
Now we're so tired by the things we have seen,
All we've forgotten only visits in dreams.
How I misunderstood.
Here I stand undressed,
Here I confess my doubt,
Did you know that I would?
From this fractured lens,
We're unveiled again and again.

Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost,
Just hiding it is never enough.
Now I find in every mirror a ghost.
Only once I saw the killer,
Once I saw the killer up close.

Heaven's over now.
I know it's gone,
I know it's over now.
If colder heavens come,
Carry me further down,
Where our madness rests,
Where I'll have less to doubt
All I misunderstood.
My abandoned friend,
Our parade has already left...

Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost,
Just hiding it is never enough.
Now I find in every mirror a ghost.
Only once I saw the killer,
Once I saw the killer up close.

Sometimes I get the feeling I'm lost,
Just hiding it is never enough.
Now I find in every mirror a ghost.
Only once I saw the killer,
Once I saw the killer up close.

Heaven's over now, gone away.

Heaven's over now, gone away.
