Carve your name in my heart
Love will tear us apart
Unavoidable the break
Carve your name in my heart
Love will tear us apart
We both realised from the start

All our expectations the same
So why do I take the blame?
You yourself were king of the game
So why do I pay for your pain?

If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood, where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood, where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood?

Undeniably yours
I'm forever and more
Do you buy these lies you said?
Undeniably yours
I'm forever and more
When I caught you in the act

All our expectations the same
So why do I take the blame?
You yourself were king of the game
So why do I pay for your pain?

If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood, where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood, where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much

Can you believe
I still think of you
Can you believe
I still dream we could turn around
But I forgave, forgot too many times

Can you believe
I still think of you
Can you believe
I still dream we could turn around
But I forgave, forgot too many times

If I hurt you so much
If I hurt you so much
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood, where is the blood?
If I hurt you so much
Then where is the blood?
