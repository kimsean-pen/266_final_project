Beware of this promise
Believe what I say
Before I go forever
Be sure of what you say

So he paints a pretty picture
And he tells you that he needs you
And he covers you with flowers
And he always keeps you dreaming

If he always keeps you dream in
You wont fear the lonely hours
If a day could last forever
