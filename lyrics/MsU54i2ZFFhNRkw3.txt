Take a trip you'll never forget
Let's rock
Take a trip you'll never forget
Let's rock

Ooh you must be lucky

Same place, after midnight,
Saw you looking so nice,
Hot stuff, pants on fire,
Please me, I want you now,

I'm born to flirt, you're born to run
Let's get together and get it on.

Come home with me baby
Ooh, ya must be lucky
No I don't do this for anyone
Come home with me baby
Ooh! ya must be lucky
I was looking for somebody
And you got the body I want,

You got the body
you got the body I want

You got the body I want

I'm not complicated
Please don't keep me waiting
Hold me, then undress me
Smooth talk, don't impress me

Ask me once, and I say yes
I want the pleasure of your flesh
I see the look inside your eyes
Like what you see come try me

Come home with me baby,
Ooh, ya must be lucky,
No I don't do this for anyone,
Come home with me baby,
Ooh! you're just too lucky,
I was looking for somebody,
And you got the body I want,

Come home with me baby
Oh you must be lucky
No I dont do this for anyone
Come home with me baby
Oh you're just too lucky
I was looking for somebody
And you got the body I want

Touch me, baby touch me

My love will take you to the top
Among the stars, let's rock

Come home with me baby,
Ooh, ya must be lucky,
No I don't do this for anyone,
Come home with me baby,
Ooh! you're just too lucky,
I was looking for somebody,
And you got the body I want,

You got the body
you got the body I want

You got the body I want

Come home with me baby
Ooh, you're just too lucky
No I don't go home with anyone
Come home with me baby
Ooh! you're just got lucky
I was looking for somebody,
And you got the body I want,

You got the body
you got the body I want

You got the body I want, rock!

Come home with me!
