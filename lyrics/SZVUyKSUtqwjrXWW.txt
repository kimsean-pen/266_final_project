I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed
Yeah, Ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Yeah
That's why I'm easy, Huh
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it
No.

Ooh, that's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things
I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me
Ohh, babe
Ohhhh.
(Instrumental)
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin', yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Woo.
'Cause I'm easy
Ohh
Easy like Sunday mornin'
Yeah
'Cause I'm easy
Yeah
I'm easy like Sunday mornin'
Ohh.
