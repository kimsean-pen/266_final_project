I'd like to tour the 80's
But I got sideswiped and came right to '78
My life is pro creation
Well if the mood's right, there's some hype, some currency
So, deep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing

Well I like, my life is pro creation
So I make time to rewind those memories and play
'Cause you and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You're on...

You get high like you chase the natives
And you tried then to show them your come-and-see face
I like this elevation
The mood's right, the dim light, and we can see them
Deep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing
Well I like, I like to change the station
'Cause these thoughts are those thoughts that cover me in grey

You and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess

You're always shattered
Lately something has come over all of me
My welts all undressed, no longer seem to weep
That no longer meets their needs
I like the stage so please
Holla at The Weeknd for me

You and me, you and me make a fine mess
'Cause you and me make a fine mess
You're always shattered
