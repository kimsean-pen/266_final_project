Lord, I'm gonna get so high tonight
I'm gonna let the floodgates open wide
I'm in open water
It's what I need
Though I try to get you off my mind

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
I can't let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I right giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you (ain't nobody) I can hold onto (ain't nobody)

Hey, Lord, I'm gonna bring you back tonight, girl
Oh, you're running circles round my mind
I think your works have been my problem
How can I search for someone new?
What I really want, you by my side

And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
To let you leave

It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you (ain't nobody) I can hold onto (ain't nobody)
So am I right giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you (ain't nobody) I can hold onto (ain't nobody)

Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking till I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out

Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking till I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out

Wouldn't be right letting you go running away
Ain't nobody but you
I can hold onto

So am I right giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you (ain't nobody) I can hold onto (ain't nobody)
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you (ain't nobody) I can hold onto (ain't nobody)

Ain't nobody but you
