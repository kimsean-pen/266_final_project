My victims are rich or poor, young or old, strong or weak
I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I take what you love and leave you in tears
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames

I bring poverty, sickness, and death
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

(Evil) More evil than violence
(Violent) More violent than death
(Deadly) More deadly than man
(I am) Yeah, yeah, I'm evil, I am

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love and leave you in tears (leave you, in tears)
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games (your hopes, my games)
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain (promise, in vain)
While you burn at the stake (at the stake, at the stake), I dance with the flames

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness
Your satanic highness
Prince of darkness
The most beautiful angel

Prince of darkness
The devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness
Unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darkness
