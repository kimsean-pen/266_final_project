Fatal, this attraction
Yeah we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothing back

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

My eyes wide open, fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burning like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back

Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance

Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it? Oh

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
