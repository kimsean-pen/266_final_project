You should know by now really
(By now)
That this could end, really
You should know I could never make it work
Wake up, let's pretend, really, babe
(Really)

Do you like the way the water tastes?
Like God's fire
For you but you could never say
Then come forth 'cause it's coming 'round
(Do you like the way the water tastes?)
'Round the water

Beware, the water

You should know, babe
At least pretend you did know why
It's not like you watch
So go on, take a drink, really, babe

You like the way the water tastes
Like gunfire
You knew but it was never safe
Take one more 'cause it's coming 'round
(Do you like the way the water tastes?)
'Round the water

Beware, the water
Beware, the water
(Beware)

Teeth are dry
The wind blows
If you come drinking
There you go

Beware, the water
Beware, the water
(Beware)
Beware, the water
(Beware)

Do you like the way the water tastes?
Do you like the way the water tastes?
