Uh, check it out
In the place to be
As it is plain to see

Rock shit, grab my dick
Walk up in, banana split
Yes shirt, yellow, purple
Bodies rocking in the circle
I gots to show some love at the AM ladies in the place
I say, "What up?", he said, "Oh, yeah" and then I see her face

She's the cutest I've ever seen in my life, my life
The way she clicked her heels and threw her fist in the sky, too tight

Drink mode, freak mode
Takin' a seat is obsolete-lete-lete-lete
Freak a nice booty to the beat, beat, beat
Two step, bump 'n' grind, fancy footwork all the time
I break dance in this place
Back spin, ohs
That's when I see her face

Uh, check it out
In the place to be
As it is plain to see

She's the cutest I've ever seen in my life, my life
The way she clicked her heels and threw her fist in the sky, too tight

She's the cutest thing in the world
She's my lil' hipster girl

Uh, check it out
In the place to be
As it is plain to see
He is DJ Red
And I am DC
Funky fresh from 1983

And we are (?)
Nobody move it
And the record pick it
And it goes a little something like this
