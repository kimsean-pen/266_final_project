It feels good
It feels good

I'm waking up this time
Like I've never been tired
Of making up my mind

It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh
It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh

I lit my last one
Then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits
But the feel is so sublime
Another drag in and
My mind goes on a climb
That's where you'll catch me
Cuz' it happens all the time

Always on the move
Always living proof
I'm just trying to prove
What you disapproved
All this residue
Don't know what to do
Facing down the truth
Tell me where were you

These are the hands that built me up
Oh where were you
(Oh tell me where were you!)

I'm waking up this time
Like I've never been tired
Of making up my mind

It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh
It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh

I lit my last one
Then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits
But the feel is so sublime

And now I'm
Ready to deploy
Ready to exploit
Can't express my joy
My life I didn't destroy
I will not recoil
Dope inside the foil
Problems I can't avoid
I can not employ

How's it look now
Staring with your eyes to a fire
I won't look down
Staring with my back to a liar

Feels good oh, feels good oh
Feels good oh
(Of making up my mind)
feels good

It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh
It feels good
Feels good oh, feels good oh

I lit my last one
Then I fell asleep in slime
Work at my habits
But the feel is so sublime
Another drag in and
My mind goes on a climb
That's where you'll catch me
Cuz' it happens all the time
