It can be born anywhere
In the last place you'd expect
In a way you'd never dream

It can grow from nothing
And lost within a second
A single glance is all it takes
To get inside you

Invading every thought
and every beat of your heart
Love can make you scream
and it can leave you speechless
Love has a thousand stems
but only one flower

It can grow alone till it turns into dust
it can tear your world apart or bind you forever
It can grow in darkness, make its own light
Turn a curse into a kiss
change the meaning of your world

Love makes no sense, Love has no name
Love drops you in tears and it sets your heart on fire
Love has no fear, Love has no reason

So infinitely fast stop standing on the edge
Take my hand, erase the past forever
My Love is you, My love you are

Love makes no sense, Love has no name
Love is never wrong and never needs a reason
I'm drowning in my tears but my heart is on fire

It can make you better, it can change you slowly
And give you everything you want, ask for nothing in return
In a blink of an eye, a hint of a smile
In the way you say goodbye, and everytime you find me

Love makes no sense, Love has no name
Love drops you in tears and it sets your heart on fire
Love has no fear, Love has no reason
Love makes no sense, Love has no name
Love drops you in tears and sets your heart on fire
Love has no fear, Love has no reason
My Love is you, My love you are
My Love is you, My love you are
