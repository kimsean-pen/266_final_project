Poke me in the side
I turn around and see your face
Didn't think that I would see you
In this place
Next thing you know
We were good to go
Slipping out the back door
to get back home

Back into your arms
Like there was no lost time
Back in your mouth like a love crime

I missed.
Your kiss.

Said: I love you and I always will
I wish you didn't
Stand still
Sometimes I cannot
stand your fear
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here

Don't be a fool
And play it too cool
So cool that you can't see
How much you mean
to me

Too cool for school
He's too cool for school

Turning off our phones
Taking off our clothes
Because
this is how we do it
Keeping tension tight
Confirmation on the night
If you don't have it
You can't lose it

Tears running.
They keep coming

Said: I love you and I always will
I wish you didn't
Stand still
Sometimes I cannot
stand your fear
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here

Don't be a fool
And play it too cool
So cool that you can't see
How much you mean
to me

Too cool for school
He's too cool for school
Too cool for school
He's too cool for school

Sunlight's comin' up
To surprise me
I couldn't get to sleep.
The thoughts of you
keep me awake
The thoughts of you go deep.

I love you and I always will
I wish you didn't
Stand still
Sometimes I cannot
stand your fear
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here

Don't be a fool
And play it too cool
So cool that you can't see
How much you mean
to me

Too cool for school
He's too cool for school
Too cool for school
He's too cool for school
