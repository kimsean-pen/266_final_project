Don't hang on so tightly
You'll strangle all romance
Seduce me, surprise me
Pretend we met by chance

Dealt the ace back to me so I played it
Feeling the odds were for once on my side
What a lie, no I'm not where I thought I would be and I'm naked

Love is my labour of life
Love is my labour of life
Love is my labour of life
Is my labour of...
Love is my labour of life

We'll tear it up
We'll tear it up
We'll tear it up

Over the open sky we're higher and higher and higher
Under the cover of night we always find each other coming down
All of the endings and beginnings are rough
There are so many kinds, there's never enough

Love
Love is my labour of life
Love is my labour of life
Love is my labour of life

We'll tear it up
We'll tear it up
We'll tear it up
