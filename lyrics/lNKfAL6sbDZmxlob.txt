Red, red wine, goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need you so

Red, red wine, it's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
