Can't explain the things you do to me
When we touch I get excited, baby, instantly
And when you speak of love, no place I'd rather be
Then rocked up in your arms explaining jurassee

Sweet and tender love
That only you bring to my world
And you can be sure
That when you need me I'll be right there

'Cause, baby, you've got the best love
Anyone else can ask for
And I just want you to know
To my heart you hold the key

Baby, you've got the best love
And there's nobody better
And I just want you to know
How much you mean

Each moment that we share I realize
That it's more than just a feeling passing through my heart
'Cause every time you're here I start to lose control
I can't wait until I hold you, 'cause I'm longing for

Sweet and tender love
That only you bring to my world
And you can be sure
That when you need me I'll be right there

'Cause, baby, you've got the best love
Anyone else can ask for
And I just want you to know
To my heart you hold the key

Baby, you've got the best love
And there's nobody better
And I just want you to know
How much you mean

Sweet and tender love
That only you bring to my world
And you can be sure
That when you need me I'll be right there

'Cause, baby, you've got the best love
Anyone else can ask for
And I just want you to know
To my heart you hold the key

Baby, you've got the best love
And there's nobody better
And I just want you to know
How much you mean, yeah

Oh, oho
Oho, best love
Oh, oho
Ohoho, can trust in me, ow!
