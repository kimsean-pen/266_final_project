Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

Been running with the rude boys
For much too, much too long
You think you are one of them

Every time that we kissed
It seems you were holding back
Don't be so quick to pull away
Away, away, away, away

I know you're thinking murder
Driving in your father's car
I will not let you disappear

Not your fault, not your problem
Not one to apologize
If you want tough, I'll give you tough

And you were born for greatness
She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness

She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness
She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness

You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness

You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness
You were born for greatness

She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness
She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness

She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness
She said she was even more than this
And you were born for greatness
