Speak chain lightning
Words of blue glass
Smash the sound barrier
Steal the speed of light
Bury the sun
And drink up
Drink up the night

Please don't sell your dreams
Please don't sell your dreams

Speak chain lightning
Paint a new sound
Strike a new colour

Catch catch catch a thought
Tears of dust, swallowed by the air

Please don't sell your dreams
Please don't sell your dreams
Don't live in somebody else's dream
Don't live in somebody else's dream
