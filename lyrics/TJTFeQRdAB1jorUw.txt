You can break throw yourself away
Leave it behind
We come
Undone
And if you need to, you can break me too
You can disappear
Please just take me with you and you go!
Or let me follow!
Let me follow!

Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Left our time...

We can run,
Forget ourselves
Leave them behind
We can make,
Believe
Tell our story with another life
And some reappear

Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Take me with you
Take me with you
Or let me follow!
Left our time...

We can disappear!
