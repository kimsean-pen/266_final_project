I never should have let my guard down.
I wish I never knew all the things I found out.
(I wish I would've been more careful.)
And maybe I wouldn't be running from misery.
Oh no, in the beginning gave me everything i need and more
I'm tired of dealing gotta figure out how to even the score.
(It's payback, gotta make him feel it)
Playing with my feelings, ladies, I'ma tell it all.

(Be on the lookout when he's coming to your area. I fell in love with him once, girls, I'm telling ya)

I wish I knew what I know now. I swear it never would've went down.
Dangerous. He'll steal your heart away, then run away.
He's dangerous. Protect your heart, he'll tear it apart.

I didn't see the crash that burnt the bridge.
I didn't see the missle that sank my loveship down.

(Oh, I felt the hit, it was as hard as a brick. It made me shift, and left me damaged.)

Dealing with the pain was so hard.
I can't believe the things that he did to leave me scarred. And now...

(It's payback, gotta make him feel it.)

He wish he never did it, but it's too late to turn it around...

I wish I never fell in love and maybe it wouldn't hurt so much.
Inside, I tried to keep it in, my heart is screaming for revenge.
(Caution me before you cross that path, you never know, what's up ahead.)
Don't let him trap you up and get your love because...

He's dangerous.
