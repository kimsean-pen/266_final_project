From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix
Halo of fire falls from the sky
Burning a thousand sins, purified
Freed from captivity, shake off the demons of unreason
Child of fire, born again
Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
Another life begins sanctified
Freed from a thousand sins that have died
Fear no uncertainty, anxiety or unbelievers
Spread wings of fire, born again
Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix
You are Phoenix
Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise
From the ashes you will rise
You are Phoenix
