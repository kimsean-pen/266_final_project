I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Gave you up 'bout 21 times
Felt those lips tell me 21 lies
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Loving you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you saying darling
Your kiss is like an antidote
I'm fighting like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Couldn't hear the thunder
But I heard your heart race
Couldn't see the rain
We're too busy making hurricanes (yeah)
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way
But it gets hard
When you ain't here makin' me crazy

Baby, say the word darling
You know just how to hold a sucker down
So I'll see you in the morning
I can't watch you walk out

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Cry
Cry
Cry

Hear the thunder
See the rain

Keep on making me cry
Hey, ey, yeah
Keep making me scream and holler
Keep on making me cry
You don't know what you do to me
Hey, ey, yeah

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me
