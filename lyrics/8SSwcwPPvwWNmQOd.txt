I'm strapped into my bed, I've got electrodes in my head
My nerves are really bad, it's the best time I've ever had

I'm a sick boy, and there's no cure
I'm a sick boy, there should be more

But I'm happy the way I am, like a sardine in can
People taking notes, people in white coats

I'm a sick boy, and there's no cure
I'm a sick boy, there should be more

But I'm happy the way I am, like a sardine in can
People taking notes, people in white coats

I'm a sick boy, and there's no cure
I'm a sick boy, there should be more

I see school girls everywhere, short skirts and pig-tailed hair
But why must I suffer, for being a gym slip lover?

I'm a sick boy, and there's no cure
I'm a sick boy, there should be more
