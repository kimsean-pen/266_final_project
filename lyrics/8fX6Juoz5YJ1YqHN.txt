Cheer the sad puppeteer,
who constantly tugs as he snickers and sneers
Frantically wiping his tears

I'm always dancing in tandem with his teardrops so pained
To the weeping, I shamefully lend out my frame
Contortedly pulled to the centre of stage

A re-enactment of his tragedy, Again and again
Some abstracted form of attraction Over and over again

A marionette, I play my part
The crowd have all gone, but the show must go on, I play my part

Dance to the beat of his tears

His story had chilled me, haunting my guilty ways
He wept for days over a picture frame,
scrawling to pages, his play

A marionette, I play my part
The crowd have all gone, but the show must go on, I play my part

Dance to the beat of his tears
I watched his comfort turn to pain as he scowled his reflection
How long had he been locked away? Had it turned him insane?

"Shatter the frame. It mirrors my pain It's not me it's not me, I say"
A reflection of age, "Watch me shatter and break"

"This world was never meant for me, Keep me locked away
This world was never meant for me
The show must go on"

The sad puppeteer he will stay
