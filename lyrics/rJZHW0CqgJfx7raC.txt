Let me tell you about my girlfriend
My girlfriend Mona Lisa
She let somebody take a picture
So she can be a fashionista

She said she wanna be a model
But what she wanna be a model for?
She told me that she want to travel
Walk the rumors in Milano

But I tell her that I loved her
Adored her, I need her, my Lisa
She told me trust her
I want to, I wanna trust her

And I don't know why it hurts me, it hurts me, it hurts me
I get jealous when she workin', workin', workin'
All the fellas they be lookin', lookin', lookin'
They lookin' at my Lisa, Lisa, Lisa

Let me tell you about my baby
My baby Mona Lisa
She told me that I'm acting crazy
She said I need to free her

She said she feel like she in prison
But why she feel like she in prison?
We always going to the ocean side
And a mountain top we be living a good living

She wanna be a model and travel
And walk in the rumors of Milano
She says I'm jealous, I know I'm jealous
Because I want her only for me and not them fellas

And it hurts me, hurts me, hurts me
All the time she be workin', workin', workin'
Them boys be flirtin', flirtin', flirtin'
Flirting with my Lisa, Lisa, Lisa
