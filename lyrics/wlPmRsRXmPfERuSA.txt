Calling Elvis
Is anybody home
Calling Elvis
I'm here all alone
Did he leave the building

Or can he come to the phone
Calling Elvis
I'm here all alone
Well tell him I was calling

Just to wish him well
Let me leave my number
Heartbreak hotel
Oh love me tender
Baby, don't be cruel
Return to sender

Treat me like a fool
Calling Elvis
Is anybody home
Calling Elvis

I'm here all alone
Did he leave the building
Can he come to the phone
Calling Elvis

I'm here all alone
Alright
Why don't you go get him
I'm his biggest fan
You gotta tell him

He's still the man
Long distance, baby
So far from home
Don't you think maybe
You could put him on
Tell him I was calling
Just to wish him well
Let me leave my number
Heartbreak Hotel
Oh, love me tender
Baby, don't be cruel
Return to sender
Treat me like a fool
Calling Elvis
Is anybody home
Calling Elvis
Here all alone
Did he leave the building
Or can he come to the phone
Calling Elvis
I'm here all alone
Calling Elvis
Is anybody home
Calling Elvis
Here all alone
Did he leave the building
Or can he come to the phone
Calling Elvis
I'm here all alone
