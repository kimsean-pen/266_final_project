Talk, I guess we need to talk
Talk, I guess we need to talk

I didn't know what I was doing
And I was doing it way too fast
It's getting worse than I expected
You know how it goes now

I guess we need to talk about it
If we don't want to live without it
I guess we need to talk about it
Everybody knows why
You know how, you know how
You know how it goes now

You know how it goes now
Where the wind blows now
A gut feeling there's something wrong
Woke up on the wrong side
We'll be getting so tired
A gut feeling we're not as strong
A gut feeling
A gut feeling there's something wrong

I can't complain when no one's listening
Need to fix it like it used to be
I can't understand what got into me
You know how, how, how it goes now

I guess we need to talk about it
If we don't want to live without it
I guess we need to talk about it
Everybody knows why
You know how, you know how
You know how it goes now

You know how it goes now
Where the wind blows now
A gut feeling there's something wrong
Woke up on the wrong side
We'll be getting so tired
A gut feeling we're not as strong
A gut feeling
A gut feeling there's something wrong
A gut feeling
A gut feeling we're not as strong

You know how, you know how
You know how it goes now

A gut feeling there's something wrong
A gut feeling we're not as strong
You know how it goes now
Where the wind blows now
A gut feeling there's something wrong
Woke up on the wrong side
We'll be getting so tired
A gut feeling we're not as strong

I guess we need to talk about it (A gut feeling)
If we don't want to live without it
(A gut feeling there's something wrong)
I guess we need to talk about it (A gut feeling)
If we don't want to
You know how, you know how
You know how it goes now
