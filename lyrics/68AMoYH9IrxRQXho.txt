I am soft and silly and my name is Lillianaloo
And Sir your grace in action, to my satisfaction
Well, my Mama, she's savin' 'cause my Daddy's a ravin' crazy gambler
But you my Captain, are grace in action, to my satisfaction

Come along now and I'll be your woman, if you'll be my Captain
See, I'll be your woman if you'll be my Captain
See, I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless Captain
Die, I would lay me down and die, for my Captain

I am soft and silly and my name is Lillianaloo
Sir you're fair black fashion, for this winter's passion
I've been sold by sailors, I've been worn by tailors, soldiers wound me
But you my Captain, are medication for my reputation

Come along now and I'll be your woman, if you'll be my Captain
See, I'll be your woman if you'll be my Captain
See, I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless Captain
Die, I would lay me down and die, for my Captain

Captain, say, "Yes"
Captain, say, "Yes"
Captain, say, "Yes"
