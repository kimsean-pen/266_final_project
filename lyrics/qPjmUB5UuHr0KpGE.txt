Your burning bright star, my old friend the sun
Through our windows your rays shall burn on us
Go tell the peolpe that the storm will rise
Death from above, no love on their side

Eyes won't agree to see
Skin won't agree to burn
Open the gates to hell
The blinding light of the sun
Won't stop us from merging as one
Reborn majestic being

Our eyes will not see the sun go down
I was the fire, a flame upon man
I could explode and cloud them like the rust
All life once known will be buried in dust

Blood won't agree to bleed
Sins won't agree to burn
Stand at the gates of hell
The flaming death of the sun
Won't stop us from merging as one
Reborn majestic being

This life ain't mine
This old decaying body will shine
And we will fly, back into the sun
But still we bow for no one

I have lived thousand centuries
My death will be glorious

You burning bright star, my old friend the sun
Through our windows your rays shall burn on us
I could explode and cloud them like the rust
Death from above, you'll be buried in dust

This life ain't mine
This old decaying body will shine
And we will fly back into the sun
But still we bow for no one
