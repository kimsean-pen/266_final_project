Little doll I can't forget
smoking on a cigarette
In my life a real queen
prettiest thing I ever seen
Uh-huh
You're the one who makes me sing
Bring happiness and everything
you're the only real one
A real way to have some fun
Uh- huh
But I don't know you little doll
I don't know you little doll
Come on shake
Come on shake
Come on shake you little doll
Shake you little doll
Come on... shake
come on shake
Shake you little doll
