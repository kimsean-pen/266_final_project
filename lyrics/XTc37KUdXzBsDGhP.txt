Sipping on a bottle, 'til the bottle's staring back at you
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Pick a case of water, 'til the poison makes my body move
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can, then we can't be weird forever
Sipping on a bottle, 'til the bottle's staring back at you
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E

Woah, if you ain't leavin'
You better D-N-C-E
Don't fight the feelin' now
You better D-N-C-E
Dance, dance, D-N-C-E

Sipping, and I'm slipping even further into make believe
Whiskey got me wishing that you'd come D-N-C-E with me
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can then they can't be weird forever
Sipping, and I'm slipping even further into make believe

This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E

Woah, if you ain't leavin'
You better D-N-C-E
Don't fight the feelin' now
You better D-N-C-E
Dance, dance, D-N-C-E

(Dance)
Dance, step left foot, then the other foot
(Dance)
Shake, right hand, then the other hand
(Dance)
Shake your head like you don't understand
How to dance, how to dance, how to D-N-C-E

Woah, if you ain't leavin'
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Woah, if you ain't leavin'
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now
You better D-N-C-E, dance
D-N-C-E, dance
