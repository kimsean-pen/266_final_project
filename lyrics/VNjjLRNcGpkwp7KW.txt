Life, life will never be
Life, life will never be the same

Time is getting cold
What is going on?
What is on your mind?
Are your feelings gone?

Need to see it clear
Where do we go?
Why are you doing things?
All the things you do

Life will never be the same, life is changing
Life will never be the same, life is changing
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love

In the name of love
You should draw the line
Got to feel secure
That you? re still mine

Life will never be the same, life is changing
Life will never be the same, life is changing
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love

Life will never be the same, life is changing

Life will never be the same, life is changing
Life will never be the same, life is changing
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love
Everybody needs somebody to love, to love
Everybody needs somebody
