When I forgot you, you came to mind
Every trouble, back in your eyes and
It's so cyclical, so why even try?
Why even try to change?

Know yourself way more than I can
Being friends was in the palm of my hand
But I let it fall and break, so why even try?
Why even try to mend?

On and on
The feeling's bursting in my thoughts
'Till later on
We walk it back and patch things up
On and on
The feeling's bursting in my thoughts
'Till later on
We walk it back and patch things up

Soon it will all disappear
Maybe I will miss your voice in my ear
But I can't go back now, so why even try?
Why even try to hear?

You know I'm alright
You know I'm right here
You know I'm alright
You know I'm right here

On and on (you know I'm alright)
The feeling's bursting in my thoughts (you know I'm right here)
'Till later on (you know I'm alright)
We walk it back and patch things up (you know I'm right here)
On and on (you know I'm alright)
The feeling's bursting in my thoughts (you know I'm right here)
'Till later on (you know I'm alright)
We walk it back and patch things up

When I forgot you, you came to mind
Every trouble, back in your eyes and
I can't go back now, so why even try?
You can't go back now, so why even try?
No, we can't go back now, so why even try?
Why even try to change?
