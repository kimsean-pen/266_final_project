After being for so many years
The life and soul of the party it's weird
I'm invisible
Whatever I have said and done
Doesn't matter in this chatter and hum
I'm invisible

I'm here
But you can't see me
I'm invisible
It's queer how gradually
I've become invisible

Look at me the absentee
Disappearing finally
Goodbye
Is it magic or the truth?
Strange psychology?
Or justified
By the end of you

Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Am I really even here?
I'm invisible

Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Am I really even here?
I'm invisible
I'm invisible

It's too late to find an excuse
The party's over and I'm not much use
Tonight
Am I tragic or a joke
Wrapped in my invisibility cloak?
Well, quite.

I'm here
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Am I really even here?
I'm invisible
It's queer how gradually
I'm here
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Am I really even here?
I'm invisible
I'm invisible

It's a journey so they say
But in this desert I was only a hazy, lazy mirage anyway
I'm invisible
