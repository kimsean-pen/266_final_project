Everyone seems to be servin' for satan
Guess I will too
What a joke, you make me laugh
'Till I turn blue
Any tale goes out to there

What a manly lookin' crew
I don't think I'll tease my hair
I'd rather sit here teasing you
Cast your eyes, my snakes down on the floor

Out you go and in come one and hundred more
I seem to lost my cowboy boots

With green fringe runnin' down the side
My soul machine has made me green
'Cause my jeans didn't turn out tight
And all these ruins I turn for you

Ya keep my livin' alive
Your smile overweighs the miles
And your kiss makes it worth the ride
Cast your eyes, my snakes down on the floor
Out you go and in come one and hundred more
