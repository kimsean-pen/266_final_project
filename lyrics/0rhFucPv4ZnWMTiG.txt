So Here We Are Again
I'm Almost Giving In
I'm Over Listening Bout Who Your With Or Where You Been

I Got Drunk With My Friends
A List From 1 To 10
Are You The Man That I Need

If I Was Doing This
Would You Put Up With It
Do What Your Mama Said; Love Or Leave Alone
I'm Gone
Cause All You Ever Do

You Promise Me Me Me The The The World,
You Promise Never To Let Down A Girl
But Now I Know
It's Time To Go

Tonight I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh Without Out You

I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh
Without You

Your Womanizing Ways
Although You Say You've Changed
I Guess I'll Always Be Your Option, Not Priority

The Best You'll Ever Have
One Day You'll Wish Me Back
There Wont Be No One Like Me

If I Was Doing This
Would You Put Up With It
Do What Your Mama Said; Love Or Leave Alone
I'm Gone
Cause All You Ever Do:

You Promise Me Me Me The The The World,
You Promise Never To Let Down A Girl
But Now I Know Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It's Time To Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Tonight I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh Without Out You

I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh Without Out You

Promise This, Promise That
But You Always Get Me Back
You Wont Find Me Home Alone

(I'll Be Partying)

Promise This, Promise That
But You Wont Get Me Back
Someone Else Will Love What You Don't

Me Me Me The The The World World
Tonight I'm Gonna Go
I'll Be Partying
Oooh, The The The World World
Tonight I'm Gonna Go

You Promise Me Me Me The The The World,
You Promise Never To Let Down A Girl
But Now I Know Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It's Time To Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Tonight I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh Without Out You

I'm Gonna Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
And Party Party
Go Oh Oh Without Out You
