Days that I went missing
Stumbled on a long walk somewhere
So many places we don't belong
So few we do
But you
Came around the corner with your arms wide
Said your favorite words to me despite everything
Lift to the clouds on haze or lantern flames
Shuffling off to sleep

To dream I'd never leave again
Shuffling off to sleep
To dream I'd never leave again
Summer shifting like a dream
Summer shifting like a dream for me

You go shuffling off to sleep
To places where you're hiding out
The anger in your eyes
Bright your life of lightning striking
I was afraid to find
An older me alive in you
Afraid that I'd be blinded by the lightness
Of a good you never knew

And in the summer
When I was angry
When I was tired
When I was scared
I just stared into nothing
I just stared into nothing
When I was worried
When I was tired
When I was angry or afraid
I just stayed in the same place for days
In the same place for days
In the same place for days

Shuffling off to sleep
Dream I'd never leave again
Shuffling off to sleep
Dream I'd never leave again

Silent by your own hands
You shake now when you speak
Hold tightly to your sleeping
On the concrete of my dreams
And you go silent by your own hands
You break down and you leave
You go nightly with my panic
I get angry, I can't sleep
But in the summer I wasn't angry
I wasn't tired, I wasn't scared
I just stared into nothing
I just stared into nothing
I wasn't worried, I wasn't tired
I wasn't angry or afraid
I just paced while the days ran away
While the days ran away

To places where you're hiding out
The anger in your eyes
Bright your life of lightning striking
I was afraid to die
A better you inside of me
Afraid that you would go
Before I had the chance
To show the good I know

And in the summer
We'll get a new home
I'll get a new start
I'll get to be
A new better me now
A new better me
I won't be guilty, I won't be sorry
I won't feel angry every day
We'll just wait while the days run away
While the days run away
While the days run away

Shuffling off to sleep
To dream I'd never leave again
Shuffling off to sleep
Dream I'd never leave again
Shuffling off to sleep
