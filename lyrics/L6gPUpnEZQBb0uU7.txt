I've been going through (some) changes
And trying times
I just need to face it
Wasted time, Waste this time
I've been going through (some) changes
And trying times
I just need to face it
Wasted time, Waste this time
I just need to face it
Before this time is wasted
Cause I been going through it
This trying time
And I just need to
Move on, let go
Move on, let go
Move on, let go
Move on, gotta let you know
(And) I've been going through (some) changes
And trying times
I just need to face it
Wasted time, Waste this time
(And) I've been going through (some) changes
And trying times
I just need to face it
Wasted time, Waste this time
