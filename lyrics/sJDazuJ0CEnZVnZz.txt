We're gonna have to draw the line. We're gonna have to free our lives. It's time for us to fight and die. This time for us and you know why. With revolution in the air and people changing everywhere. Step forward now, no need to hide. We can't lose with Jah on our side. Oh bring down the walls, Bring the Walls down.
