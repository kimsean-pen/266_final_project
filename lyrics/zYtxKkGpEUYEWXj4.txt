I thought I was cool
But I just looked a fool
For so long
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Yeah...

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me

I recall all our fights
Most of all, all the times
You would lie in my arms
Now you're gone
You're gone
Yeah

Don't speak to me
Don't be my aim

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
'Cause our love won't survive
Yeah
Our love won't survive
Don't speak a word

Don't speak to me
Don't speak to me

There's a lot that you don't notice
When you read between the lines
The future's out of focus
When you're blinded by the light
It's the hope for all the hopeless
In the worst of trying times
I resort to being speechless
'Cause our love won't survive
