I want you around
When we make noise anguish flees like a breeze spread out thick
While everyone's spinning I'm stuck thinking about
Wishing these moments would last forever and always somehow
'Cause we get on, our whirl is waiting
So we should be around each other now
I want you around
When we seduce the night life we'll be at peace side by side
While everyone's sleeping I'm up thinking how
The way we are spinning feels like
time is slowing down
Yeah we get on, our whirl is waiting
So we should be around each other now
I want you around
