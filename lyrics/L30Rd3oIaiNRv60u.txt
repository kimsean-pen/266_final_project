Oh Satan, you're the God before whom I stand
Live your life in me,
See how I erase my name from the lamb's book of life
And reject the benefit of the holy wounds
I will walk before thee, lord, in the land of the living
For you teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight
And sow seeds that do not proceed of the natural order
They shall grow to columns of the holy lair
That which harbours the dragon with seven heads.

Ita est putrefatio Dei similes,
sive materialis substantia spiritus Domini in orbe terrarum.

How long will ye halt between two opinions?
Realise! That your body is the temple of the living God!
Thou shalt open my lippes, (O Lorde) my mouthe shal shewe thy prayse.

Ita est putrefatio Dei similes,
sive materialis substantia spiritus Domini in orbe terrarum.
