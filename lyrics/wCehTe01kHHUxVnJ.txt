This is not about me
I can see you taking it personally
I see you put your pride aside
I'll wait a minute while you try to compensate
No, this is not about me
I see you thinking I'm a missing piece
To the puzzle that you use for life
I'll wait a minute while you try to come for mine

All this distance
Treated all bad
And I've been covered
Second
Don't want to live a lie
Beaten, battered
And it don't matter
Don't deny I've said too much
Don't ask me why

Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm

This is not about me
Or the way that you could never play it cool
I could see you wanting me to say
That me walking away was a big mistake
No, this is not about me
I see you clinging to your pinch of hope
Trying to get up in my bed
You should be thinking of a way of moving on instead

All this distance
Treated all bad
And I've been covered
Second
Don't want to live a lie
Beaten, battered
And it don't matter
Don't deny I've said too much
Don't ask me why

Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about

What you told me
It never mattered
I never needed it
(This is not about)
That you were tongue-tied
And what you sold me
I never bought it
(This is not about)
How I found out
That you were vacant
You never stood up
(This is not about)
All the times I tried to prove to you

Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us
Mmm, this is not about us

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
