Let me be your devil, sign your soul to me
I will keep you warm, mine for eternity
You blew up like bubblegum
Shot into me like a magnum gun

There is no pretending when it's you and me
I'll be your creator if you plant the seed
I'll be the sweet tooth in your mouth
Once I'm in, I'm not coming out

My bubblegum and I go
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
Hey
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I, I, I
My bubblegum

I can show you loving in the first degree
I can be the poison to your ivy tree
Finger prick on a spinning wheel
Quick lips and a look to kill

I won't be your honey for a wager
No, I won't be your honey for a wager, no way
I won't be your honey for a wager
Blow it up like bubblegum
My bubblegum and I go

My bubblegum and I go
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
Hey
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I, I, I
My bubblegum

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
My bubblegum and I go
I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I
I won't take no
I, I, I, I, I
I want it right now
I, I, I, I, I, I
My bubblegum
