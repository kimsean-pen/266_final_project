Sunrise
Sunrise
Looks like morning in your eyes
Cuz the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said
oooo, oooo, oooo
To you

Surprise
Surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise
Surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

Then I say
oooo, oooo, oooo
To you

And now the night
will throw its cover down on me again
And if I'm right
It's the only way to bring me back

oooo, oooo, oooo
To you

oooo, oooo, oooo
To you...
