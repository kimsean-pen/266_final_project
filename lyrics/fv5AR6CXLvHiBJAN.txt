I saw myself soundly sleeping
Supine, divine, lost in dreamtime

Leave me here, in the reaches
Cut the silver cord to ribbons

Slow wave slumber tears asunder
Subtle bodies travel higher

Leave me here, in the reaches
Cut the silver cord to ribbons

Wake me, I'm falling
Between two spaces

Wake me, I'm falling
Between two faces
