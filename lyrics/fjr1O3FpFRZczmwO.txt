Hard bodies
Soft emotions
So fast
So smart
The world is at your feet
But what about your heart?
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late late hours of the night

How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

You've had success-
Lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the good life
You thought it would never end
One day you're too young
Then you're in your prime
Then you're looking back at the hands of time

How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

How do you stop a runaway train?
How do you stop the driving rain?
How do you stop the ripening corn?
How do you stop a baby being born?

How do you stop
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
How do you stop?
You're lost if you hesitate ...
How do you stop
Love from slipping away?
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
