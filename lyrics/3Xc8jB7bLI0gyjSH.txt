Yeah, wait, think about it
She might be something irresistible
The one you've been waiting for
Stay, yeah, dance around it
You know that dress is unbelievable
I lost my keys I can't go home
Hotel rooms and wasted views
My eyes only focus on you
I could just leave, but that would mean goodbye-ye-ye
Yeah
Gin or juice, just useless moves
My taken heart's no use to you
But it still feels good just laying by your si-i-ide
But your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Close, enough to kiss you
I take my chances in another life
Cause in this one, you can't be mine
Don't, you look at me that way cause I
I need your help just to resist your touch
A little bit is way too much
Hotel rooms and wasted views
My eyes only focus on you
I could just leave, but that would mean goodbye-ye-ye
Yeah
Gin or juice, just useless moves
My taken heart's no use to you
But it still feels good just laying by your si-i-ide
But your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Your dream of us is magic
Yeah
(Magic, magic)
(Magic, magic)
(Magic, magic)
(Magic, magic)
