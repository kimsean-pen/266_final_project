On my way, so it seems, blooming flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passing time, got to get outside the city
In the morning all will see, just how crazy young love can be
On our own away again, don't get down my darlin'

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock and the mornin', they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window I'm on your street

Miles away, so unclear, almost lost it in Montana
Lets pull over, have us a choke
I love to watch you when your dancin'
I wonder if they ever dream, they would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in feel 19, chasin' stars that are fallin'

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock and the mornin', they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window I'm on your street

When that train heads home
They're gonna be so gone gone, you ain't never gonna see me
I'm a gone gone, you ain't nothin' to me
When they shine them streets, they're gonna find our song

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock and the mornin', they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window I'm on your street

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
3 o'clock and the mornin', they all cry to me
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels and your cherry red lipstick
Look out your window I'm on your street
Come on [Incomprehensible]

I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your

I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
