Erasing these two photographs
Is just a waste of time
The danger's in the subtlety
Between the evening and the night

Two hearts beating
One beats the other
While the other just looks away
Two hearts dreaming nightmare together
Leaving nothing more, nothing left to say

Replacing every part of me
It's in between the lines
The promise is just a shade of gray
Between the darkness and the light

Two hearts beating
One beats the other
While the other just looks away
Two hearts dreaming nightmare together
Leaving nothing more, nothing left to say

Two hearts beating
One beats the other
While the other just looks away
Two hearts dreaming nightmare
Nothing more, nothing left to say
