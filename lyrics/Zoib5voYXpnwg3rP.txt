Here I am again
Honest and afraid
Doubting who I am
The reason I was made

Here I am again
Vulnerable and lost
Hanging from the edge
So close to falling off

Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can i get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up

Here I am again
Sleepless and confused
Have I met the end
Or am I being used

Here I am again
Ugly and alone
Searching for a sign
Tell me where to go

Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
I know there's no one left to blame
I know I've pushed you all the way
I have no further left to fall
I know there's no one left to blame
I know I've pushed you all the way
I have no further left to fall
Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
Can I get myself back
Back up from the bottom
Can I get my life back the way it was
Before I got torned up
Before I got torned up
Before I got torned up
