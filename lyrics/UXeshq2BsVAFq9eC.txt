In the heart of the night
She smiles like Mardi Gras
Spinning in a dizzy haze
Her circus head giggles
It's a friendly disease
Catching colors from the air

So with your hands upon the hips
Of the dancing flesh
She's a carnival
And when it's lip to lip
In a surprise-time kiss
She's a carnival
She's a carnival
She's a carnival

Mosaic eye, gypsy eye
Glowing as it dazzles
She's a portrait of a poison
For you to quench your thirst
A portrait of a poison

So with your hands upon the hips
Of the dancing flesh
She's a carnival
And when it's lip to lip
In a surprise-time kiss
She's a carnival
She's a carnival
She's a carnival
