I should have known better than to let you go alone
Times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again
I find I spend my time waitin' on your call
How can I tell you, babe, my back's against the wall
I need you by my side to tell me it's all right
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me
Can't stop this feelin', I've been this way before
But with you I've found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love (is this love) or am I dreaming
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love (is this love) or am I dreaming
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love (is this love) or am I dreaming
Is this the love that I've been searching for
(is this love) Or am I dreaming
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love (is this love) or am I dreaming
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love (is this love) or am I dreaming
Is this the love that I've been searching for
(is this love) Is this love (is this love)
