Why should I have to stand up and have to die for your sins?

All power/She was surprised/All power
All power/She was surprised/All power
All power/Lay in her eyes/All power
All power/Lay in her eyes/is it me/is it me
Could I lay here, could I be free
I see again/I see again
Everything goes/ everyone know
Is it me/Is this me
I go away/I see you say

And I die/could I be free
Or am I just what you see
And is just what I give
Everything and this what I see anything
and this what I give in my brain and this why I feel so much pain
or could I be you.
I see you say and I die
could I be free or am I just what you see
and what I give everyday...

...could I be you, could I be you
oh

she was surprised... 14'00"
