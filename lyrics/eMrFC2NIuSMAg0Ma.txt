I can never calm you down
And I can never turn you around
And I could never bring you flowers
And I could never turn you around

I could be there when you're sleeping
I could be inside your dreams
And I can be there when you're sleeping
And I can be inside your dreams
Oh yeah I, oh yeah

Stand at the kitchen sink
Feeling a plastic mood
Buildings have gotta change
'Cause baby, you're a lunatic

I could be there when you're sleeping
I could be there in your dreams
And I could be there when you're sleeping
And I could be inside your dreams
Oh yeah I, oh yeah

Stand at the kitchen sink
Feeling a plastic mood
Buildings have gotta change
'Cause baby, you're a lunatic

I could be there when you're sleeping
I could be there in your dreams
And I could be there when you're sleeping
And I could be inside your dreams
Oh yeah I, oh yeah
