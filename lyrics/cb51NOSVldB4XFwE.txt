The world is always some kind of daydream
Another message that they just don't see
I won't forget
The day you said
The simple things
They are the best
I'm just a kid
An alien
Among the people

For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys

For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys

Another statement, another daydream
Why do you always say what you don't mean?
I won't forget
The day you said
The simple things
They are the best
I'm just a kid
An alien
Among the people

For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys

For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys
For the girls and boys

YEAH
