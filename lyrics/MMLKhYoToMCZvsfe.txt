I believe in
Eye deceivin'
Bob 'n weavin'
I can breathe in
Make a wish in
Flower fishing
Moving vibration
Mild relation
I'm jamaican on your radio station
Got a curse in
Could be worse in
You first
In a hearse in
Good as dead in
Nothing left in
Nothing left in
Some be heading
I need a head rest in
And a feed from a warm breast
A man making hits
With my child-bearing hips
Underground like
Who's it sound like
You all sound the same
But you don't know my name

I believe in people lying
I believe in people dying
I believe in people trying
I believe in people crying
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

We all sound the same
You don't know my name
Rearrange and
Things don't change
Things remain
Feel the strain
Stress
Catch my breath
(There'll be a new tale of)
Get some rest
(He and I)
From the mess
(In fact any time)
I couldn't care less
(Every day)
Sugar cane
(Write fictional stories)
Is like smack to my vein
Shook fame
(If you want to)
But I don't complain
(On the street)

I believe in different reasons
I believe in breath through seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall
I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running
Keep living
Keep living

You gotta ask
(There'll be a new tale of)
Before he attacks
(He and I)
You got the flats
(In fact any time)
Dub my sacks
(Every day)
You've got the city
(Writing fictional stories)
Move out of the country
I'm scrunching
(If you want to)
Friends that are punchy
(On the street)

I believe in people falling
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that's why I'm running
I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being
Keep living(X6)
