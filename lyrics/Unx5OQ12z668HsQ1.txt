Don't put your faith in my heart
I will only let you down
Don't let your love grow too deep
I don't think I'll be around
There is a curse in my bones
That'll breathe and fly again
Until when we both are ghosts
I will miss you like a friend

But they'll never take the good years
There are some that never burn
No they'll never take the good years
God I wish I would've learned

Don't be afraid to move on
You were meant to bear a child
Don't look for me when you're gone
It'll only hurt a while
