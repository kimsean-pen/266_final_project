Here I sit surrounded by white
My arms wrapped around my back real tight
What did I do that was so wrong that I had to pay
I don't think anyone's gonna miss her anyway

I just couldn't take anymore shit
So with a swing of my knife her stomach was split
Putrid bile and guts all over the floor
Couldn't help but laugh at this vision of gore

Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disembowel

Twitching... Violently
Dying... In agony
Blood... Comes flowing forth
Eyes... No longer see

Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disembowel
