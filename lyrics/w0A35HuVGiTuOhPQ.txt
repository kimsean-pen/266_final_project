I stuck her arms in a forever tied noose
You build a touch sends me back to the moon
Daddy's comin home but mama's lookin guilty
Brother's in the basement telling spanish
Book jots heavy with the weight of the world
Stowing all his love in an adolescent girl

The sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide goin in deep
Singing to the drunks like our mama did
All we ever did is what we didn't

Never really know if I did something wrong,
All I ever heard was it wasn't my fault
But what good is truth if you don't understand
Nothin but a path of calloused hands

The sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide going in deep
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth

Singing to the drunks like our mama did All we ever knew was what we didn't
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth

The sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide livin it deep
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth

The sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide goin in deep
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth

Singing to the drunks like our mama did
All we ever knew is what we didn't yeah
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
I'll save the Earth I'll save the Earth
