Heather I'm sorry that your mother
Deceased in the brain
Cannot recall your name
Heather I've dreamt that I forgave
That only comes in waits
I hate you all the same

I was all for being real
But if I don't believe then no one will
What's mine isn't really yours
But I hope you find what you're looking for
Beg her, blow in her face
Toward changing, never take
But I'm with you, I deflate
I love you all the same
I love you all the same!
I was all for being real
But if I don't believe then no one will
What's mine isn't really yours
But I hope you find what you're looking for

Strange hellos are not my beg
Better never having that
Strange hellos are not my beg
Better never having that

I was all for being real
But if I don't believe then no one will
What's mine isn't really yours
But I hope you find what you're looking for

I was all for being real
But if I don't believe then no one will
What's mine isn't really yours
But I hope you find what you're looking for
