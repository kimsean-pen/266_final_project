I guess you're right
And there's nothing I would say to you this time
You told me just what I had to live for
And there's no flight in my fight
And more than that it's so all right, it's so all right

If I meet more than your eye
I guess you're right
If I wake up in your mind
I guess you're right

I guess you're smart
Cause I'm taken by you taking me apart
I could best believe I died to live for
For the hour dictates the need and I am speaking like I'm spoken only for

If I meet more than your eye
I guess you're right
If I wake up in your mind
I guess you're right
If I sink into your sleep and make it deep
I guess you're right
If I never let you go I'll know you so and oh so right

If I meet more than your eye
I guess you're right
If I wake up in your mind
I guess you're right
Can I crawl around your bones and make my home
Would that be right?
If I never let you go I know you so
And you're so right

Take it as a sign
Take in every sound you hear, take every sigh
Take my desire, take it all, take it as proof
Take me in this life I've taken you
