I go not to find
The one with whom I've seen
all hour's moons

Once the curtains lifted

And he said I will swim
to you
Language is such a play -
He called his exit,

but his eyes are irresolute
What pasts still sit today?
I feel I'm walking around
in blue

He can hear me sing
He can hear me sing
Though he is far
I'll never lose sight of him
He turned to me

Then looked away
A silhouette
A silhouette
Still returns to me
I'll hand him his coat
It's exactly where he left it long ago
We'll fall all over floorboards
I lose my breath just envisioning the scene
Mysteries that wake up late
The table's set and the painting of his face
No time to hesitate
I cede all my love and play your abandoned fool
