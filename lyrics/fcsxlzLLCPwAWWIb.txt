Now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been paying
Future's coming much too slow
And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Now you're climbin' to the top of the company ladder

Hope it doesn't take too long
Can'tcha you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
Come a day when you'll be gone
Ohh, ohh

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lot's of people out to make believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be
Oh oh

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind
Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Look ahead
