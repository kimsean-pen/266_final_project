The city street, the desert heat
Burns my mind and forces my feet to keep moving
Three in the afternoon
Wasted, feel my father disapproving
There's a desperation in this town
Vultures flank the fools and clowns are crying
Shell-shocked and landlocked
Don't know if I can leave but I feel like trying

And I'd better run into the sun
Until I hit the ocean

Words and tears have long dried up with my emotions

Just 'cause you don't see the way I feel
Please don't question my devotion
Blistered and broken
This hearts for sale but no one's a buying
Something still burns inside of me
But I can feel it dying

And I'd better run into the sun
Until I hit the ocean

And I better run until I hit the ocean
