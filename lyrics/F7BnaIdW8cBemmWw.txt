You found me in the dark, babe
You found me in the dark, babe
You say that I can be real crazy, you say that I can be real crazy
You're looking for nirvana, you're looking for nirvana
Say you'd want no drama, say you'd want no drama
Prayed all the prayers that I could pray, hmm-mm
Not even God could give me this feeling
Never going back I'm gonna stay, hmm-mm
Gonna stay with you until the morning, every morning, every morning
You ain't gonna right baby coming around here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
'Til you came around, came around here
Now we ain't got the right to have a love this good
But they have it one if they could
Bless the mind without the tears
Open their eyes and have no fear
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You found me in the bar, babe
You found me in the bar, babe
Drinking 'til I was hazy, drinking 'til I was hazy
Now you lying in the bed on, see you lying in the bed on
I'mma give you no drama, I'mma give you no drama
I'll answer all the prayers that you could pray, hmm-mm
Not even God could give me this feeling
Pull you in when you're straight, hmm-mm
And I'll ride with you until the evening, every evening, every evening
You ain't gonna right baby coming around here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
'Til you came around, came around here
Now we ain't got the right to have a love this good
But they have it one if they could
Bless the mind without the tears
Open their eyes and have no fear
I'll be honest
All of this got me blind
Has forgotten
But I don't even mind
Oh I'll be honest
All of this got me blind
Has forgotten
And I don't even mind
Oh I don't even mind
You ain't gonna right baby coming around here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
'Til you came around, came around here
Now we ain't got the right to have a love this good
But they have it one if they could
Bless the mind without the tears
Open their eyes and have no fear
(Hey, hey, hey, hey),
