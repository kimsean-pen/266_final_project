Driving. pulling our precious chariots
Which carry the moon and the sun
Running, pursuing day and night... tirelessly
This is the lot of my brother and I
It's unbelievable to see how trivial the Gods can be, sometimes...
But their spite grew so strong that we were both sentenced to death
I saw him
Watching
No other choice but flight
Running nad running away
This is our duty to prevent the thwilight of the Gods
Some foretell that the offspring of the
Famous One will finally catch you, someday...
If one of us slows down then thus would begin the End Times
I saw him
Yelling
No other choice but flight
I saw him... with his eyes piercing the darkness...
Hati is getting closer... He who hates...
Don't ever let him come to you! Run!
We both have become nothing more than simple prey
Left to become flesh and bones to the Moon's Dog
Keep running!
Some say they will seize the blood of all men in agony
While the wind will break loose and roar with fury
And the sun would lose its brightness and its rays would turn black
So don't let him catch you and
splatter the entire sky with your blood!
Keep running!
I saw him
He's watching
No other choice but flight
I saw him, yelling...
