Boys dont cry they just want to die
Stumble and cough and grin a lie

Would you look into my eyes eyes eyes eyes
Will you be my new?

Box up all of your things with tape
Write your address that won't remain.

Can I still be your pessimist?

Boys dont cry they just want to die
Stumble and cough and grin a lie

Will you look into my eyes eyes eyes eyes
Will you be my new?
