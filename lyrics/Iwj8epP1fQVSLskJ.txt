Do you think my eyes should be wider?
Do you think my expressions should match?
How it is on the inside, to say
Do you think my words should be wiser?
Do you think my expressions should match?
How it is on the inside, to say

Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Angry for no reason, twisted up inside
You used to say

You used to say: Don't be angry
I finally understand why
Everything that you taught me
Got twisted up, on the inside
Wicked roots that take me under
Are twisted up on the inside

Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Angry for no reason, twisted up inside
Holy fuck, I'm about to die
Holy fuck, I'm about to die
You used to say

Holy fuck, I'm about to die
