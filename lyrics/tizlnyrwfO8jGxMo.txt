Monday morning I go to work, same old story
Putting in time with a bunch of jerks
And all their fame and glory

It's such a
What I go through day to day
I guess that's just the way it goes
What it's come to, to make my way, eh

But when my work day's done
I get the greatest feeling
'Cause when I get back home
I'm gonna be...

Hangin' with my baby
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Alright
Said I'm gonna be
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Well

Sunday morning, we're laying up
Just relaxing, ooh
Doing nothing all alone

There's music on the stereo
Something sexy, sweet and smooth
This is the only way to go
Me and my lady back in the groove, ooh

(Yes this is where it's at)
Oh yeah
It's really very simple, oh
'Cause there is nothing that
That can't compare, ow

Still hanging with my baby, yeah
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Oh
Said nothing can comparing
To hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Woo! Come on

Ooh!
Coming to get 'em
I'm coming to get 'em
Woo!

All this pain

Yeah, yeah

(Yes when my work day's done)
I get the greatest feeling
('Cause when I get back home)
I'm gonna be...
Hey! come on, say it dawg
I'm gonna be

Be hanging with my baby
(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Woo! yeah...
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)

Y'all don't understand what I'm saying
(It's alright) It feels so good to be
(Hangin' with my baby)
Ha! Yes it does
Woo!
Hangin' with my baby
(Hangin' with my baby)
Ow!

(It's alright)
(Hangin' with my baby)
Hey!
I feel the beat
(Hangin' with my baby)
Hanging, feels so good girl
(Hangin' with my baby)
Oh

(Hangin' with my baby)
