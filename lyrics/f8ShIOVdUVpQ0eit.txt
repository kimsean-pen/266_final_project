When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself any more

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just fun
Those days are gone
Oooohhhoooooooohhhhhhoooooooo
Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore, anymore (by myseeelf)
