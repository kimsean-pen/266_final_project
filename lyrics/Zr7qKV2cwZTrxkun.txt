Black days
No headlights on the freeway
(Fuck) everything and run, run, run
It's just a shot away

So blurry
Why is everybody worried?
Cause I'm just having fun, fun, fun
There's nothing wrong with me, ayo

You look like you'd be heaven for a night
Make me wanna die, it's a hell of a...
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride, it's a hell of a life

It's a hell of a life

It's a hell of a life

Dreamer
Or maybe I'm a make-believer
Or a fighter in a stone cold war
Against the colour grey
It gets heavy
Tryna take it slow and steady
Oh, I can't use a quick fix, a hit
There's nothing wrong with me

Ayo
You look like you'd be heaven for a night
Make me wanna die, it's a hell of a...
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride, it's a hell of a life

It's a hell of a life

It's a hell of a life

Naked and unafraid
Washing it all away
Come pick me up (Oh, what you waiting for?)
Burning another day
Wasted and feeling grey
Come get me now (Oh, what you waiting for?)

You look like you'd be heaven for a night
Make me wanna die, it's a hell of a...
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride, it's a hell of a life

It's a hell of a life
(Ayo, ayo, ayo)
(You know, you know yeah)
(Ayo, ayo, ayo)
It's a hell of a life
(Dadum, dadum, dadum)
It's a hell of a life
(Dadum, dadum, dadum)
(Dadum, dadum, dadum)
It's a hell of a life
