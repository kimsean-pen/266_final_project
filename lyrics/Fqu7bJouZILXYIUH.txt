I can see the time I've wasted
And my life is passing by
It's so hard to keep on living
Tryin' to keep this dream alive
Try to tell myself it's worth it
But the words never come out
'Cause I wanna find the truth so tell me now

Where do I begin
I was lost at the edge of dying in a world so cold
Where do I begin
Now I'm alive I can see I'm ready to be on my own
One more step to take
Before it's too late
I just wanna reach the end

So where do I begin
Where do I begin

Hold my breath and keep on searching
For a life I haven't found
'Cause I wanna know the truth so tell me now

Where do I begin
I was lost at the edge of dying in a world so cold
Where do I begin
Now I'm alive I can see I'm ready to be on my own
(Yeah)
One more step to take
Before it's too late
I just wanna reach the end

Where do I begin

All the regrets I've kept inside
(I'll let them go)
And all the things I never tried
(I'll let them go)
I wont rest until I see
(The truth in me)
I need it

I was lost at the edge of dying in a world so cold
Now I'm alive I can see I'm ready to be on my own

Where do I begin
I was lost at the edge of dying in a world so cold
Where do I begin
Now I'm alive I can see I'm ready to be on my own
(Yeah)
One more step to take
Before it's too late
I just wanna reach the end
So where do I begin
Where do I begin
