Selfishly relying on myself
To fill all of the holes you dug inside my brain
There's no escape
With no frame of time
I'm losing track of mine
You crush my priceless gift
Right in front of me

I sink into unconsciousness
Dissociating from the world outside my head
It's not so hard to hide from you
(In my fortitude)
(In [?])

I'm stuck in place
My [?] space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through
Pick up the pace
I feel misplaced inside this null space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through

My strongest link leads on the chain
Yet it's cracked, rusted and cold
But there's not much else to show
That's where I [?], I guess
But every good thing came from some type of convalesce
Don't question it

A distant memory
Draw me back and forth between the lines I couldn't read
I should've seen

I'm stuck in place
My [?] space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through
Pick up the pace
I feel misplaced inside this null space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through

Watch me sink into unconsciousness
There's nothing in it for the world outside my head

I'm stuck in place
My [?] space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through
Pick up the pace
I feel misplaced inside this null space
'Cause you never wanna speak the truth
And I never wanna see you through
