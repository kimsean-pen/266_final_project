Your heart is eternal
Like a bee in amber
The distant words in your gaze
Drops of blood in honey-stream
The memories of these days and times
When moments became eternity

Fallen
No drums echo on waves
Sunken
Long-lost the kingly message
Fallen
Fallen is the herald
Sunken
Is the oaken ship

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

Floating scraps
That search their form
Shards sinking to the bottom
Wealth and knowledge buried by mud
The magic blade covered by sand

Fallen
No drums echo on waves
Sunken
Long-lost the kingly message
Fallen
Fallen is the herald
Sunken
Is the oaken ship

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

If, by a chance, a mussel
Or a playful odder
Would take one shard ashore
Maybe someone, sometime
Should find the amber
And lift it to the sun

Your heart is eternal
Like a bee in amber
The memories of these days and times
When moments became eternity

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The marsh swallows up the treasures
The death-rimed peat and mould
The bridge falls to the ground
