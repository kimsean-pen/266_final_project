ln my head
There's a parallel life
Slowly growing
Softly haunting
Through my window
A tropical light
Mesmerizing
Tantalizing me
l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, come on down here
Yeah, l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, l need you right here
Someday l know
A phoenix will rise
From the ashes
Of my past life
You and l
On a rocket to Mars
Far beyond this
Summer crisis
l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, come on down here
Yeah, l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on here, l need you right here

Restless hours
Awake every night
Turn around me
Swirl above me
Hoping to bring
The temperature down
Fever falling
Fever rising
l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, come on down here
Yeah, l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, l need you right here
Yeah, l sense heavy weather moving my way
So come on down here, come on down here
Come on down here, come on down here
Down here
Down here
Down here
