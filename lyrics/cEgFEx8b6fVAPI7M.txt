Birds fly around while the dividends pay
Birds fly around while I'm picking up change

Crapping out tokens and live in a haze
Build lights in the dungeons and plumbing in the grave

Something was in concert, some song was played
But nothing was delivered and a franchise was made

And what if I told you, what if I said
They built it themselves and it feels so good

Well, I'll believe it when you take me in

Floated around downtown, I floated around Spain
I was like a dentist, rooting for pain

Cover me in blankets, cover me in paint
I'll dance like a child again, I'll die like a marine

No not that refrain again
I'm stuck in the same dream
What a blessing

What a blessing, what an imitation
What a blessing, what an imitation

I can't be there when you take me in

Here comes the saint in the red again
A dictum in paint, till I scrub them

I was disgraced in America
Yeah, I was disgraced in America

And what if I told you, what if I said
I build to myself and it feels so good

Well I won't be here
When you take me in, in

Birds fly around while the dividends pay
Birds fly around while I'm picking up change
And i'm feeling handsy

Demarcation, demarcation
See those lines interrupt

Demarcation wears me thin
Demarcation does me in

Demarcation's one note plays
Rings I've made won't hold me
Paper thin

Demarcation, demarcation
See those lines interrupt
