I had a dream
That you were calling me
Caught in between
And floating down stream

I won't drop you if you won't drop me

I had a dream
Where I became a fiend
the villain was me
But how can I be redeemed

I won't drop you if you won't drop me

I won't leave you downtown
I won't leave you down
If you say so
I can take you home

I could not wake
This dream would be my fate
Floating away
but you would never stay

There's a coffin with my name dear
I could see it beckoning
What's my name here
When I'm living out a dream
There's a coffin with my name here
I could see it beckoning
What's my name here

I won't leave you downtown
I won't leave you down
