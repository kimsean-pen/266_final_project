Don't worry about me
I won't worry about you
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down
Don't worry about signs
Don't worry about patience
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down

I've always cared for you
Poured myself out for you
Yeah, 'cause I confess I can't get dressed, get out of bed
Without you here, I fall depressed

I remember every night you made me keep the lights on
'Cause you're scared
Not enough to make it right, to keep me in the dark alone
It ain't fair
I break down but I never get scared
I wanna run but I'll never get there

Don't worry about me
I won't worry about you
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down
Don't worry about signs
Don't worry about patience
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down

I've been through hell for you
Raced fire and flames for you
Yeah, 'cause I refuse to take the bruises
Keep me clueless, say I blew this, say I choose this

I remember every night you made me keep the lights on
'Cause you're scared
Not enough to make it right, to keep me in the dark alone
It ain't fair
I break down but I never get scared
I wanna run but I'll never get there

Don't worry about me
I won't worry about you
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down
Don't worry about signs
Don't worry about patience
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down

I hope you don't cry when you hear this song
I want you alright, but I'm moving on
One more time for the sake of love
You're calling my phone but I won't pick up
It's hard enough to breathe
It's hard enough to talk
Heart wants me to stay
Brain wants me to walk
Why is it a dream just to get along?
Heart wants me to stay
Brain wants me to walk
Heart wants me to stay
Brain wants me to walk
Heart wants me to stay
Brain wants me to walk

Don't worry about me
I won't worry about you
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down
Don't worry about signs
Don't worry about patience
I've been trying to say
You only miss me when you're down
