Thought I found the one I wish I could let it be
You're the bullet I'm the god let's pull the trigger
Let me be

How can I leave her alone
When she's the one I need, I need

My eyes got a mind of their own
Making me believe, believe

I never let you go finish what you started
I hope she'll never know the Faithful is impossible
I never let you go finish what you started
I hope she never know Faithful Is Impossible
I hope she'll never know Faithful Is Impossible

I can hear my heart over your body
Let it scream oh yeah

I can't feel a thing unless I'm falling
Oh set me free

How can I leave her alone when she's the one I need
My eyes got a mind of their own making me believe

I never let you go finish what you started
I hope she'll never know the Faithful is impossible
I never let you go finish what you started
I hope she never know Faithful Is Impossible
I hope she'll never know Faithful Is Impossible

I can't bear the weight
It's much too heavy once I get a taste
My conscience try to make me hesitate
It's lost in the fight now
'Cause you got it tied that's why

I'll never let you go finish what you started
(I'll never let you go)
I hope she'll never know the Faithful is impossible
I never let you go finish what you started
I hope she'll never know Faithful Is impossible

I hope she'll never know Faithful Is Impossible
