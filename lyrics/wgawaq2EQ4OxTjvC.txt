Step in this room where I wanna be
Surely you mean this as something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
When it's the truth that I wanna see

Search myself for the reason
The ever loving greed
I am put off slightly
So what am I to see, oh my love
In the sensory serenity

So pull the pin inside, baby, let it ride
Never knowing I'm in ecstasy
With the fire sign, never make it mine
Never knowing I'm in ecstasy

I am learning slowly
So what am I to see
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world is a lie

Like a knot it binds, suffocating minds
Never knowing I'm in ecstasy
With the fire sign, never make it mine
Never knowing I'm the next to bleed

I am learning slowly
So, what am I to see?
Every twist and turning
Through my hypocrisy

Search myself for the reason
Forever loving greed
I am bored of silence
So, what am I to see?

It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world isn't mine

Lie awake, still, as I try to breathe
Surely you mean this is something
You're bringing me down to a silent breath
And it's the truth that I wanna see

In the sensory serenity
How could it be that I'm in ecstasy?
In the sensory serenity
How could it be that I'm in ecstasy?

In the sensory serenity
How could it be that I'm in ecstasy?
In the sensory serenity
Could it be that I'm in ecstasy?
It's so good to see
This world is alive
It's so good to see
This world isn't mine
It's so good to see
So good to see
This world I'm in loves me so
