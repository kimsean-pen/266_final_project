We lie here pressed by our bough and whisper
Wows that wither with every branch we break
We lie undressed and barely whisper
Wows that wither with every branch we break
The autumn red reaps more than heads
The forest falls with leaves of surrender
Let all be said before regret
These bloody bandages will bury us forever

I can't let you fall asleep
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Can we all agree
Our dreaming tree bleeds

I can't just let you fall asleep
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me and please
Can we all agree
Our dreaming tree bleeds

I can't let you fall asleep
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Can we all agree
Our dreaming tree bleeds

I can't just let you fall asleep
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me and please
Can we all agree
Our dreaming tree bleeds
The autumn red reaps more than heads
The forest falls with leaves of surrender
Let all be said before regret
These bloody bandages will bury us forever
