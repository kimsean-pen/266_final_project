I didn't see
Who protects me
But I'm all that I could be
Time rushes by
More than we like
But I've all the love I need

You're my proctector, my home
I'm nothing without you
You're my deflector, I know
That nothing can get through
You feel the feelings for me
So I don't have to face the things I do.

Life's changing scenes
Played behind screens
We're all someone's hopes and dreams
Caught in the lights
You still have the fight
When you're taught to do things right

You're my proctector, my home
I'm nothing without you
You're my deflector, I know
That nothing can get through
You feel the feelings for me
So I don't have to face the things I do.

All my life you shield me from the game
You're my spine, but I've never been ashamed
They don't see and I just can't explain
You've my protector, you're mine forever

You're my proctector, my home
I'm nothing without you
You're my deflector, I know
That nothing can get through
You feel the feelings for me
So I don't have to face the things I do.
So I don't have to face the things I do.
