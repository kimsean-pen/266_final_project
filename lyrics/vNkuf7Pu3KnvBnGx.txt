See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright

Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds
And change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me

You wouldn't believe
What I've been through
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

And I've been putting out the fire
With gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

Well, you've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

Been so long, been so long
Well, it's been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire

Been so long
Ooh, it's been so long
Been so long
I've been putting out fire

Been so long
It's been so long
Been so long
I've been putting out fire
Been so long

Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
I've been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long

Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
I've been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long

Been so long, so long, so long
Been so long, so long, so long
