On the street where you live girls
Talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes

(All your life) all your life all you've asked
When's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were living in another world
Tryin' to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Oh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets
Calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone
Cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows
Left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at nights
On the neon broadway signs
She don't really mind
It's only love she hoped to find

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Oh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away

Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
