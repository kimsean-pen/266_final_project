Still here I wake and I think of you
I see you far away
Answer my call
Can you hear my voice
I hear you

For we are gone and forever lost
Broken here I lie
Beneath the shadow sink
Where daylight dies
I wake for you

In better lands the sun may shine
And green leaves on trees spring
Their opening and blossoming
But here the raven sing

But still I stand and think of
Days when grass was green
And my heart was so young
They 've never been Past
Forever lost
