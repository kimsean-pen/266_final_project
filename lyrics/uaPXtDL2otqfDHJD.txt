Sun so bright that I'm nearly blind
Cool, 'cause I'm wired and I'm out of my mind
Warm's the dope running down my spine
But I don't care 'bout you
And I've got nothing to do

Free as the water and air that I breathe
Even freer than DMT
Feel the warmth of the sun in me
But I don't care 'bout you
And I've got nothing to do

Love in the middle of the afternoon
Just me, my spike in my arm, and my spoon
Feel the warmth of the sun in the room
But I don't care 'bout you
And I've got nothing-

I think I'm in love
(Probably just hungry)
I think I'm your friend
(Probably just lonely)
I think you got me in a spin, now
(Probably just turning)
I think I'm a fool for you, babe
(Probably just yearning)
I think I can rock and roll
(Probably just twisting)
I think I wanna tell the world
(Probably ain't listening)
Come on

I think I can fly
(Probably just falling)
I think I'm the life and soul
(Probably just snorting)
I think I can hit the mark
(Probably just aiming)
I think my name is on your lips
(Probably complaining)
I think I have caught it bad
(Probably contagious)
I think that I'm a winner, baby
(Probably Las Vegas)
Come on

I think I'm alive
(Probably just breathing)
I think you stole my heart now, baby
(Probably just thieving)
I think I'm on fire
(Probably just smoking)
I think that you're my dream girl
(Probably just dreaming)
I think I'm the best, babe, come on
(Probably like all the rest)
I think that I could be your man
Oh, probably just think you can
Come on

I think I'm in love
