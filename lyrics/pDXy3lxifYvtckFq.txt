Little miss sunshine
Where are you now?
My heart is racing
And I can't slow it down
I need the feeling
Everything's round
You meet me upside in the right part of town
Oh oh oh this is life
But it's not how I want it
Just something I make up
Keeps me right
Now I can see the blue skies
I can see paradise, paradise
I can feel the warm sun on my skin
Oh paradise, paradise
Cause it's my life
I'll do what I like
Yeah, it's my life
I do what I like
I do what I like
Little miss sunshine
Tell me you're mine
My little pick me up
The fall of the day
This girl is hungry
It's my time
My body wants to lie
In hallowed ground
Oh oh oh this is life
But it's not how I planned it
Just something I make up
Keeps me right
Now I can see the blue skies
I can see paradise, paradise
I can feel the warm sun on my skin
Oh paradise, paradise
Cause it's my life
I'll do what I like
Yeah, it's my life
I do what I like
I do what I like
I do what I like

I can see the blue skies
I can see paradise, paradise
I can feel the warm sun on my skin
Oh paradise, paradise
Cause it's my life
I'll do what I like
Yeah, it's my life
I do what I like
Yeah, it's my life
I do what I like
Yeah, it's my life
I do what I like
I do what I like
I do what I like
