Too much on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too much on my... La la la la la la la la la
Here I am thinking again
All lost in my brain
But I know I should get up and get out of it
I gotta keep moving
But here I am lost all up inside my brain
Can't stop thinking, reminiscing.
Can't stop. Can't let go.
But when I wake up,
And one day I will do it,
I have let you go

Need everything I went through was beautiful
I have let you go
And everything I went through was beautiful
Maybe I, right now, can't see the forest full of trees
So lost behind hurt
But I'm trying everyday exponentially
To move forward
O you know how it feels to be lost?
But when I wake up
Everything I went through would be beautiful
When I wake up
And I will wake up
It's gonna be beautiful
Down to to my left side (Last cry)
Feeling I could fly (Feeling I could fly)
All day, up high.
Sweeter than the sugar on a cinnamon treat
Or an ice cream
That was me
But I'm feeling like I'm in a nightmare
Fear of loving somebody, everywhere
Oh Lord, I need this confirmation, this affirmation
That when I wake up
Hen I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
When I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
