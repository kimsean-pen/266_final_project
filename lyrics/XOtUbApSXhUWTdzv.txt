Sometimes when I'm missing you
I want to call you up on my dream phone
under my pillow baby blue
I can I call only when I think of you
when I wish you were here at home
I call you up on my dreamphone
I let it ring and ring some more
wishin' you'd show up at my door

Sometimes when I'm missing you
I want to call you up on my dream phone
under my pillow baby blue
I can I call only when I think of you
I wanna kiss your happy feet
I wanna hear your voice so sweet
but I'm here in my room alone
wishin you'd pick up the phone.
