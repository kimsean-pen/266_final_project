Born from Hell
The supreme force of evil
To destroy the altar
And slaughter the Christian's born

Churches will be destroyed
Crosses will be broken
He's laughing in blasphemy
Like a domination of death

Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist

The war is started
Heaven's on fire
From the deep of Hell
Leaving words of hate

Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist

The terror is declared
The final fight started
The Antichrist and Lucifer
Fighting with angels and God

Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist

Antichrist!
