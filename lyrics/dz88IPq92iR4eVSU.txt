Red roses, temptation
You make the most of an ify situation
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love, or if it isn't?

Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly

So don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
And don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for

Desire can mean danger
I wanna lover, not another stranger
I'm saving all my passion
Who's to say if it's love or just attraction?

Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly

So don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
And don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth waiting

And don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
And don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting

And my resistance is weakening, weakening
Every time we touch
'Cause baby, you got everything, everything
That I've been dreamin' of

So don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
But don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting

And don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
And don't rush me
This love could be so much more, yeah, yeah

But don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
But don't rush me
I've made that mistake before

But don't rush me
This love could be so much more
But don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
