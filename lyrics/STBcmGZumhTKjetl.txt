Even though you're gone I still carry on
It's the same big sea, it's the same to me
To carry on, carry on
I will stay strong, I will stay strong
I set you free, I set you free
Now run along, now run along

In the midnight hour I will lose my power
I will dig my hole, I will become a mole
In the ground, in the ground
It's much too deep, it's much too deep

What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

Everywhere I go I'm reminded
Long ago, it's so long ago
But it won't leave, please leave me
Leave me alone, I am along
Deep in the ground, looking around
Trying to find my home, trying to find a home
But I dug too deep, I dug too deep
I cannot see, I cannot see

What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

Even though you're gone I still carry on
It's the same big sea, it's the same to me
