In the belly of the cloud
I was released, you were released
Was it deafeningly loud?
Or was it peace? Sweet peace

All the streets, all filled with sound
Because it's right, it's for the best
Still I sense their judgment now
As we ask for rest, just rest

I can't sleep until I see you sleeping
Curse my mind and its all-seeing eye
Watch the rise and wonder if you're breathing
Against your will, you are alive

I don't recognize the world
That you have made, that we have made
Still you fool yourself to ask
If you had stayed, if we had stayed

At the ringing of a bell
Or at the falling of a tree
If you think of it at all
Remember me, just me

I can't breathe until I see you waking
Watching as the scars fall from your eyes
Into a world that you may not remember
I hope you die, I hope you die, I hope you die
I hope you die
