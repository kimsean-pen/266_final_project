I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that fire

So after all this time you're still so blind
Thought I was yours
You must have gone and lost your mind
I took it all, there's nothing left
That you're showing me your weakness

You're so naive

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I'm that fire

Nothing's changed, another days has gone
Full of lies, I only told what you want
You've hit the wall and I can tell
'Cause you're giving in to your to weakness

You're so naive
You're so naive

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I'm that fire

Fire

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I'm that

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You ramble on about how I'm that fire
But if you knew, how far this is from real
You walk away knowing I'm that fire

Fire

That fire
