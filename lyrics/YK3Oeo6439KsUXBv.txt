I'll call youif i need you
My heart's on fire
You come to mecome to me wild and wired
Oh you come to me
Give me everything i need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Oh and you can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong baby
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone i ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby i would rather be dead
In your hearti see the starsevery night and everyday
In your eyesi get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as i'm here in your armsi could be in no other place
Your're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone i ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart no no no
Baby i would rather be dead
Each time you leave me i start losing control
You're walking away w/ my heart and my soul
I could feel you even when i'm alone
Oh baby, never go
Oh simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone i ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby i would rather be dead
Oh you're the best
