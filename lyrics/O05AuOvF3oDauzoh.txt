You're just the statue
Of the boy I used to know
You're just a tattoo
Of the words that we once spoke
You're the dry river
Where the love used to flow
But it still runs through me
With you it had to go
But if you take this back
I'll be waiting to come alive, come alive
If you turn your back I'll be waiting to fly
But you're like the falling leaves
Whilst I'm still the oak tree
'Cause you're the one to leave
Now I'm falling asleep
You're like the broken keys
Whilst I'm just a broken home
Cause as I breathe in deep you're looking at me
Like a statue of the boy I used to know
You're just a lighter
With no fuel to light our flame
You know I'd fight for this
But you wouldn't do the same
'Cause you're just a diary
With a blank and empty page
But the story we wrote
I can't quite erase
But if you take this back
I'll be waiting to come alive, come alive
If you turn your back I'll be waiting to fly
But you're like the falling leaves
Whilst I'm still the oak tree
'Cause you're the one that leaves
Now I'm falling asleep
You're like the broken keys
Whilst I'm just a broken home
Cause as I breathe in deep you're looking at me
Like a statue of the boy I used to know
I'll watch you fall to the ground
'Cause there's just stone in your eyes now
We had it all, till we were found
We're just living these lies now
'Cause you're like the falling leaves
Whilst I'm still the oak tree
'Cause you're the one to leave
Now I'm falling asleep
'Cause you're like the broken keys
Whilst I'm just a broken home
And I breathe in deep as I watch you leave
You're statue of the boy I used to know
