It's the fear of not having enough time
That keeps me awake at night
Thoughts of escape
In this wretched world life is underrated
With hands so warm I cover my suppressed heart
The heart that once settled for too little
As darkness prevails I can see the light
I am the architect of new beginnings

Right here, tonight, I am guided by fire
Disappear with me - forever
I promise I won't miss my home
Because tonight, I'll be guided by fire

You once said restless souls can never die
Did you do all the things you always said you would?
Did you refuse to become one of them?
I always knew you wouldn't dare
Silent rebels, defensive without a reason
Victims of acquired behaviour

Right here, tonight, I am guided by fire
Disappear with me - forever
I promise I won't miss my home
Because tonight, I'll be guided by fire

Right here, tonight, I am guided by fire
Disappear with me - forever
I promise I won't miss my home
Because tonight, I'll be guided by fire
