I'm stuck in the tardis
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves in
And in the right places
Watch me dance
I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder
We are tied to the stake
Up on the ladder
We wait for you mistake

Up on the ladder
Trying to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same
