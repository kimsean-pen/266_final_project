Didn't I warn you not to?
Didn't I warn you good?
Maybe we couldn't help it
Maybe we never should

Didn't I say it slowly?
Didn't I make it clear?
Is it unfair to ask you?
Why it is you're still here?

You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name

Didn't I make it harder?
Didn't I leave you that?
Was it too much to ask you?
Why it is you still care?

You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, singing
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I've bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
