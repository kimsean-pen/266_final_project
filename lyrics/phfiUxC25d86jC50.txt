I've been sitting here for hours,
I've burned an image of you in my mind
Finding comfort in the words you say,
But it's not the same

I know you're worth the wait
And I can't explain
What I know is true inside
But I would turn away the world
Just to have you here with me tonight

We can take our time
Making sure that everything feels right
It won't be easy but I'm not afraid
You're so far away
We made our start from scratch
It's now or never but we can't look back
I need you with me for another day
You're so far away

I've been sitting here forever
Your voice is resonating in my mind
Countless hours with you on the phone
And now I'm not alone

I know you're worth the wait
And I can't escape
What I know is true inside
But I would turn away the world
Just to have you here with me tonight

We can take our time
Making sure that everything feels right
It won't be easy but I'm not afraid
You're so far away
We made our start from scratch
It's now or never but we can't look back
I need you with me for another day
You're so far away, Yeah far away

I know there's no time left for second chances
Still we're right despite these circumstances
You've changed me more than you could ever know
So we will just hang on until tomorrow
So take my hand, don't ever let it go
This time is right

We can take our time
Making sure that everything feels right
It won't be easy but I'm not afraid
You're so far away ... Yeah far away
