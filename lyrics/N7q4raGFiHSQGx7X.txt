When you're feeling like a lover
Nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there in the supermarket
With your red dressing falling
And your eyes are to the ground
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters when the world you love is gone
Stealing me, baby

I need you
In my heart, I need you

Cause nothing really matters
I'm standing in the doorway
You're walking 'round my place in your red dress, hair hanging down
With your eyes on one, we love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters when you're standing, standing

I need you, need you

Cause nothing really matters
We follow the line of the palms of our hands
You're standing in the supermarket, nothing, holding hands
In your red dress, falling, falling in, falling in
A long black car is waiting around
I will miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're gone away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better, so much better

And I need you
I need you

Cause nothing really matters
On the night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars and pouring rain
Never felt right about, never again
Cause nothing really matters
Nothing really matters anymore, not even today
No matter how hard I try
When you're standing in the aisle, and no, baby

Nothing, nothing, nothing
I need, I need, I need you

I need you
I need you

Just breathe, just breathe
I need you
