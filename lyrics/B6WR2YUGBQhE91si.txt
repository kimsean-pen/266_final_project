Aside from growing old
I have no pennies in bottles
Ahh, aside from growing old

And I don't mind, cleaning up the mug museum
If I know what's nice, I won't even tell myself

I know it doesn't feel like nothing
I know it doesn't feel like nothing
Anymore, anymore

What's the hubbub, I'm losing my mind
I'm running from people
What's the measure of a passing time
I'm, I'm running from people
Deep seated inconsequence
Still running from people
Linking hands like a monument
I'm, I'm running from people, ah

And I don't mind, cleaning up the mug museum
If I know what's nice, I won't even tell myself

I know it doesn't feel like nothing
I know it doesn't feel like nothing
Anymore, anymore

What's the hubbub, I'm losing my mind
I'm running from people
What's the measure of a passing time
I'm, I'm running from people
Deep seated inconsequence
Still running from people
Linking hands like a monument
I'm, I'm running from people, ah

La la la la la la la nothing
La la la la la la la nothing
La la la la la la la nothing
La la la la la la la nothing
Anymore, anymore
