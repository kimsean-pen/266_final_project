I'm amazed at a quiet ocean
I'm amazed at your warm devotion
I'm amazed at what the people sayin'
I'm amazed by a divided nation

Like the rhythm of the earth, I get disrupted

I'm amazed at all that has been
I'm amazed at all that will be
I'm amazed at the tv stations
I'm amazed what they want me to believe

After all is said and done- where is the justice?

I'm amazed, the lack of evolution
I'm amazed at the lack of faith
I'm amazed at the love we're rejecting
I'm amazed what we accept in its place

Like the rhythm of the earth
And the rhythm of the ages
Like the rhythm, I get disrupted

I'm amazed
I'm amazed
Ah
Ah
