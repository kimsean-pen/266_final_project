Everytime we say goodbye
Why does God above me
Leave me to cry
Everytime we say goodbye
I die a little
Leave me to cry
Everytime we say goodbye
Why does God above me
Leave me to cry
Everytime we say goodbye
I die a little
Leave me to cry
Everytime we say goodbye
Why does God above me
Leave me to cry
Everytime we say goodbye
I die a little
Leave me to cry
