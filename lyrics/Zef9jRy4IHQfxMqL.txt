I like the way that you look in my headlights
Climbing off your balcony
We drive away like you're earning that Lucky Strike
Hanging in between your teeth

It's not a lot but it's sweet when it's simple
Don't overthink it, just dive in and let go
Don't complicate, I like you babe

I like the way my car smells with your cigarettes and my ashtray (ah)
I like the way the sun got when he rules over the freeway
So I turn to you and say can you promise now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I found a burnt CD-R in your visor
From back when you were in a band
We laughed so hard it hurt
But I like how my guitar moved when it was in your hands

It's kind of sweet how you're ramble when you're drinking
So stay with me on a date until it's weekend
Don't complicate, I like you badly

I like the way my car smells with your cigarettes and my ashtray, ah
I like the way the sun got when he rules over the freeway
So I turn to you and say can you promise now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I like the way (I like the way), ah
I like you bad (I like the way), ah

I like the way
My car smells with your cigarettes and my ashtray, ah
I like the way
The sun got when he rules over the freeway (rules over the freeway)
So I turn to you and say can you promise now
That we're never gonna settle for settling down
I don't wanna think about the rest of my life
I just want the things I like

I like the way (I like the way), ah
I like the way (I like the way)
I just want the things I like
