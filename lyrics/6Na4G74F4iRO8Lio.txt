Oh I poked the no no
And they scold the wood Gipetto
Rigor mortis after coitus
You know they don't wanna let go
Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now

She sip martinis, I Biz Markie
This goofy rapper wooed her
Nelly, she forced one on me
I call them lips is soopers
I'm reluctant, she wants something
I know I can't give her (love)
Slobber Donny
Left the club
With other young'n sucking up
The air, we catch the ferry
Met that kitty
Lead me too her
Recon we betting
Getting naked in Kama Sutra
Shuffle pass, duffle bag
Huffin' gas, muffin' top
I know you spot that come and go
With pumping addict hurt
Then she text me thirsty
Next day asking 'bout her future
I no Cleo, I dios mio
No trap me, no Luther
"S" on chest
I swear no stress
Now bullet call me Superman
Best I detest
Don't need this
Try me best not to confuse her then
She go loco, blog and a post
And a labeling me an abuser like
Fuck that fucking fuck
He fucking suck
And he nothing but loser
Iiiight
No shallow, basicallo
Girl just keep on reachy
Pass around that rumor like
Collection plate you preachy

Oh I poked the no no
And they scold the wood Gipetto
Rigor mortis after coitus
You know they don't wanna let go
Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now

Oh I poked the no no
And they scold the wood Gipetto
Rigor mortis after coitus
You know they don't wanna let go
Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my eg-

Moved away, three years later
Had forgot 'bout what happened
Tried to caffeinate
I happened to be passing a cafe
Saw her working
Tried to hide my face
She smelled me from miles away
She came right up
She got nice as
She approached me, slowly
And, she sat right across from me
Then she chose her words cautiously
And she gave an apology
For all that hate she started then
And louderly she shout
Why u run off and levi?
Why u jnco my feelings?
Leggo poof like a genie?
I apologized a million trillion times
Like Miss Jackson
I didn't want to hurt you
To go
Now forgiveness I'm asking
Gradually her madness subsides
And then we were actually speaking, laughing
She look back at me ask
If I'd like to leave I'm like
Ya ya ya
Let's get out here
She's like great
Bodies tossing
Lacrossing
But also shot glasses and sheets

Oh no we at it
God damn
We at it again
God damn
Fucking out my cardio
My heart is in your hand

Oh I poked the no no
And they scold the wood Gipetto
Rigor mortis after coitus
You know they don't wanna let go
Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now

Oh I poked the no no
And they scold the wood Gipetto
Rigor mortis after coitus
You know they don't wanna let go
Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now

Oh no no no
My heart is in your hand
Oh no no no
My heart is in your hand

Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now

Oh no no no
My heart is in your hand
Oh no no no
My heart is in your hand

Buddha rub the belly
R the Kelly, make 'em echo loud
Get up off that, get up off that
Let go of my ego now
