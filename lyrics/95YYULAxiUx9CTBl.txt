Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on
Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on
You gonna keep on sailing
Till you lose your happy home
Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on
Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on
I don't mind you sailing
But please don't sail so long
All right little honey bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little honey bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, ya I know it sound like my little honey bee
She been all around the world making honey
But now she's coming back home to me
