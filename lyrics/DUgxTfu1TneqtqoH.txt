There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time.
And I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind (oh whoa).
All I have is this picture in a frame (oh ah),
that I hold close to see your face everyday.

With you is where I'd rather be,
but we're stuck where we are.
It's so hard, you're so far.
This long distance is killing me.
I wish that you are here with me,
but we're stuck where we are
it's so hard, you're so far. (so hard, you're so far.)
This long distance is killing me.

It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far.
This long distance is killing me.
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far
(so hard, so hard, where we are, where we are, your so far).
This long distance is killing me.

Now the minutes feel like hours
and the hours feel like days. (whoa oh whoa)
While I'm away (way-ay)
You know right now I can't be home (ah)
But I'm coming home soon (ah)
Coming home soon. (ah a hah)
All I have is this picture in a frame (ah),
that I hold close to see your face everyday.

With you is where i'd rather be (where I'd rather be.),
but we're stuck where we are (oh oh).
It's so hard, (oh ah) you're so far. (oh ah)
This long distance is killing me.
I wish that you are here with me (you are here with me),
but we're stuck where we are (oh oh)
It's so hard, (oh ah) you're so far. (oh ah)

Can you hear me crying?
Ooh (oh-oh oh-oh)
Can you hear me crying? (oh-oh ah!)
Ooh (oh-oh oh-oh)
Can you hear me crying? (oh-oh ah!)
Ooh (oh-oh oh-oh)
Ooh woo whoa ah ah oh ah (oh-oh ah!)
Uh ah uh ah whoa0h ah (oh-oh oh-oh)

With you is where i'd rather be (where I'd rather be.) whoa!
(but we're stuck where we are) oh!
(it's so hard) So hard (your so far), so far
(this long distance is killing me) This long distance is killing me
I wish that you are here with me (you are here with me) me.
(but we're stuck where we are) Stuck where we are! So hard! So far
This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far.
This long distance is killing me.
It's so hard, it's so hard, where we are, where we are, you're so far
(so hard, so hard, where we are, where we are, your so far).
This long distance is killing me.
