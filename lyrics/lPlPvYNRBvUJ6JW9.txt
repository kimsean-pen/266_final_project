Hey
I guess it's time to play
But I don't like this game
'Cause every time I lose it, oh I lose it
Oh, and wait
I think I need a break
I need some time to think
But I'll be back tomorrow, tomorrow

I don't know
If I should say a thing
'Cause when you go
I lie awake until you're home

Hey
I think I need a taste
Just give me one more day
I promise you I'll have it, oh I'll have it
Oh, and don't
Don't you dare let go
'Cause I just need to know
If all of this is working, we're working

I don't know
If I should say a thing
'Cause when you go
I lie awake until you're home
