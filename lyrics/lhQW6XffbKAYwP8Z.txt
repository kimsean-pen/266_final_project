And it's painless
Sitting in subterranea
Ancient reference
To Mesopotamia

And it's quiet again
Hidden fragments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record

2013 Philippsburg Confederate graves
Are uncovered, throwing new light on
This 19th century conflict, sparking a repeat
These southern spectres were disease ridden, dusty, organic
And psychic

Rebellious mistakes
Occur again
Everything moving
In a circular fashion

Our words return in patterns
Our minds, encapsulating time

Gregoror, satiated walking thru' capitol
Stumbles on two thousand dead Thai monks in SS uniforms
Then fled to Hotel Bloedel, outside Nuremberg
A long way south, to a reasonable smell of death

And it's quiet again
Hidden figments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record
