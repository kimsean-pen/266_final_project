it's a thin thin line and i've walked both sides of it
seen the other side appear so tempting worth dying for it
and your limbs aching out of want
absorbing your every thought
worth risking it all for
working it's wonders now for you

over the ocean outcast with nowhere to go
a brighter forecast, new winds will blow
a storm is drawing near
it calms and the air is clear
waste my youth chasing kites
i know will blow out of my hands

we push our heads in the sand there's nothing here to seek
no discovery of mine will be safe in these seas
you feel that bitter taste on your tongue
swallow your every wrong
let your sins fill your lungs
ending all worries now for you

over the ocean outcast with nowhere to go
a brighter forecast, new winds will blow
a storm is drawing near
it calms and the air is clear
waste my youth chasing kites
i know will blow out of my hands

overlooking our past letting it go
a brighter forecast, new winds will blow
the storms that's drawing near
will calm and the air is cleared
waste my youth chasing kites i know will blow
