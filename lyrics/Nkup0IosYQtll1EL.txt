9-1-1 what's your emergency?
(heavy breathing)

Don't think I can take it
With every drama a piece of me dies
Like some kind of sadist
I think that he likes to see the pain in my eyes
He knows that I'm lovesick
He kissed me and promised I will be alright
We both know it's bullshit
The longer I'm with him the less I'm alive

Doctors on the other line cause he's not coming home tonight
And I just took my very last pill
Need something to numb the pain
Demons knocking on my brain
I think they coming in for the kill

Nine-one wanna need some
Why my baby please me like a game
I'm not having fun
Nine-one want to leave him
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done cause
I, I, I gotta lose my guy
Oh I, I'm, I'm gonna loose my mind

You must think that I'm crazy
Well he does too so I guess I'm [?]
Need someone to save me
I'd really appreciate if you'd intervene

Doctors on the other line cause he's not coming home tonight
Can't seem to find my bottle or pills
Swear to God I'm not insane
The voices only say his name when I'm
starting to think that they're real (scream)

Nine-one wanna need some (need someone)
Why my baby please me like a game
I'm not having fun (not having fun)
Nine-one want to leave him
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done cause (gotta be, gotta be done)
I, I, I gotta loose my guy
Oh I, I'm, I'm gonna loose my mind

Nine-one wanna need some (need someone)
Why my baby please me like a game
I'm not having fun (not having fun)
Nine-one want to leave him
Why my heart is always aching
And I gotta be done cause (gotta be, gotta be done)
I, I, I gotta loose my guy
Oh I, I'm, I'm gonna loose my mind
