In the summer you said
Our love was over for good
Well I know, I know
Well I know, I know

I already need you again
Oh no, I already need you again

It suddenly seemed like you made up your mind
It's hard to believe they're all at a time
My love, my love
My love, my love

I already need you again
Oh no, I already need you again
Cuz something's missing
I already need you again
Oh no, I already need you again
My love

No no no no no no no she'll be back
No no no no no no no she'll be back
No no no no no no no she'll be back

I already need you again
Oh no, I already need you again
Cuz something's missing
I already need you again
Oh no, I already need you again
My love
