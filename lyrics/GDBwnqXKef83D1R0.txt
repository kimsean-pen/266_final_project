In the states there's a problem with
race because of ignorant past burned fires
From evolution we've been killing each other,
I figure man should have it down to a science
No chance, not for a minute
Not for a second I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he's saying
I've seen your side
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior
And know your interior

Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man
(no stand)
Live in the past
We make it last
(a hated mass)
No solution
Mind pollution
For revolution

So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one
No good
For no one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
White hoods and militants, you know it's such a pity living, breathing
Violence in your city
If one man had one home
In one world he'd live alone without variety
Full of anxiety no one to point at, question
Or even talk to-in his private grave
No matter what color
He wouldn't be saved from hell, he dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man
(no stand)
Live in the past
We make it last
(a hated mass)
No solution
Mind pollution
For revolution

So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one
No good
For no one

So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one
No good
For no one
