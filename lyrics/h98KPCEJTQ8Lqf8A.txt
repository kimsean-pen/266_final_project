Please don't let it begin
You're under my skin, same old story
Boy meets girl and she falls
Much harder than him
Baby, where's the glory?

If all night, all night
Your attention's not mine
Please don't let it begin
You're under my skin, it's a sin
'Cause you're starting to win

Since I'm already screwed
Here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
And I'm just not getting through
To the lover in you
But I'm still hoping

That tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room
Just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

Just push her aside
She's not your type, so clich√©
When boy falls under the spell
Of a woman from hell
It's hard to take

'Cause tonight, tonight
You could've found out I might
Have been the girl of your dreams
Baby, you might've seen
What it means just to really be free

Since I'm already screwed
Here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
And I'm just not getting through
To the lover in you
But I'm still hoping

That tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room
Just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

Tell me that you do
Tell me that you do
Tell me that you wanna take my number

There will come a day
A hazy day in May
Or a storm in mid-December

When you need someone
Just to have a little fun
And I could be the perfect girl
For you to run

Since I'm already screwed
Here's a message to you
My heart's wide open
I'm just not getting through
To the lover in you
But I'm still hoping

That tonight, tonight
You're gonna turn down the lights
And give me a little more room
Just to prove it to you
What do I gotta do?

Don't let it begin
'Cause you're under my skin
And I'm screwed, I'm screwed
(I'm screwed, I'm screwed)
Don't let it begin
'Cause you're under my skin
And I'm screwed, I'm screwed
(I'm screwed, I'm screwed)
Please don't let it begin
You're under my skin
(Please don't let it begin)
Please don't let it begin
You're under my skin
(I'm screwed, I'm screwed)
