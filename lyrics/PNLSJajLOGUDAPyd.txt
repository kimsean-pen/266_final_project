How can I laugh or cry
When my mind is sorely torn?
Badabec had to die
Fair Pantagruel is born
Shall I weep, yes, for why?
Then laugh and show my scorn

Born with a strength untold
Foreseen to have great age
Set in Gargantuan mould
Joyful laugh, yet quick to rage
Princely wisdom, habits bold
Power, glory, lauded sage

Pantagruel born - the earth was dry and burning
In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
Pantagruel born - the earth was dry and burning
In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
Pantagruel born - the earth was dry and burning
In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him

Pantagruel born - the earth was dry and burning
In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
Pantagruel born - the earth was dry and burning
In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him

How can I laugh or cry
When my mind is sorely torn?
Badabec had to die
Fair Pantagruel is born
Shall I weep, yes, for why?
Then laugh and show my scorn
