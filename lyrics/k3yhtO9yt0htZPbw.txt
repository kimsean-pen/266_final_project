I'm a prisoner who can never leave
Someone that you use anytime you please
But I never want you to set me free
Cos I'm addicted to this love disease

And the fever rages in my soul
Begging you to want me and take control
But come tommorow you'll let me go
To find another foolish heart I know

As I face another lonely night
A different lover will hold you tight
It's not right

I can't help myself from crying over you
I can't get enough of your love
Yeah I'm dying cos it's true
I can't get enough of your love

I'm going crazy can't you see
You're turning every day into misery
Just like murder in the first degree
You're killing something deep inside of me
Cos you don't care if I should live or die
And you don't even attempt to lie
And that's why
