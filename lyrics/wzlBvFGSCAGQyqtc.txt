That's the way things go
All people's change as they grow
I hide in this room
Let's hope it's not wasted

Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame

I look into your eyes
And try not to cry
That's all I know
Let's hope it's not wasted

Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame
Oh, it's such a shame
