It's okay if bridges are burning down
Wings are made to fly and I'm on my way
There's a lot to give, so much to take
I can't control this feeling, the world will face us anyway!

We see the sunlight in the shadows
Good lessons come from the darkest days
Nothing else matters
We are ready for anything

We're together here comes double trouble
Nothing can stop us cause we're stronger
We're together here comes double trouble
Here comes double trouble

It's okay if you didn't make it on the first time
Life is made of risk, just keep on trying
There's a lot to see, so much to live for
Don't you have this feeling? The world will face us anyway!

We see the sunlight in the shadows
Good lessons come from the worst days
Nothing else matters
We are ready for anything

We're together here comes double trouble
Nothing can stop us cause we're stronger
We're together here comes double trouble
Here comes double trouble
