When I touch you ... feeling your skin
When I touch you ... deep within
I'll break your silence on your way to me
I will make you everything you want to be
When I touch you...

You know that you'll love it... you'll need it...
For sure...
I'm drawing your lines with my hands
I'm weaving the dream that never ends
I don't play hide and seek... with you... dear
When I touch you...

Aiming fingers searching secret pleasures
Roaming where your river seems so deep
You know I'm going on
I like the song you'll sing... for me
When I touch you...

You know that you'll...

And when tension's spilling down your skin
Love will never be what she once was
When I touch you...
