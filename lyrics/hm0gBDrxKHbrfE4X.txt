I need to tell you you're not wrong
Don't throw your body on the bomb
Your face a visage, it still hurts
Your gifts in flames while I watch them burn

I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind

Took only moments, bored indoors
Forget me now like it was before
If this goes on I will always wait
Your head to turn while my heart breaks

I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind

Your stare is a gun, unlit room
Your body lit by the black moon
Make me a mantle, and say grace
Your prayer and visions slip away

I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind
I've been waiting a long time to see you disappear
Colored clear, make me blind

I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
I've been waiting a long time
