You're falling in a lower gear
A little rest is what you need
You're rolled up on the seat
Your arms around your knees

We met by chance, talked on the phone
We kept in touch
I took you home
Sure, it proves we get along
And it will only get better from now on

We found a place to which we drive
And i offer you the time
To sleep - to dream
To wake up when we arrive

We found a place to which we drive
And i offer you the time
To sleep - to dream
To wake up when we arrive

Right moments come out of the blue
But when there's one it's up to you
Even when the time was up I couldn't stop
I was floating all day long

We found a place to which we drive
And i offer you the time
To sleep - to dream
To wake up when we arrive

We found a place to which we drive
And i offer you the time
To sleep - to dream
To wake up when we arrive
