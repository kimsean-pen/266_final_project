No, I like when people talk in the beginning of songs
I think it's kinda rad
(I don't think you should use it)
Well something kinda introspective
Something that means a bit to me
Like a little more... personal?

You say you gotta go but what does that mean?
Do you wanna be together or is it just me?
Sometimes I think you're in until I think you're out
It's like I'm swimming in the deep end, pull me out

Wanted to feel wanted to know
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven I can call my own

Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
Cos the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

It's like we do a dance where no one wants to move
But if I take the first step, maybe we can find a groove
I'm really trying hard to not just walk away
I think that it's about time someone said

Wanted to feel wanted to know
Wanted to steal a little piece of heaven I can call my own

Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
Cos the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

I wanna know what goes on in your mystery
I think that I could have the key
To run back everything

Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
Cos the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal
Can we try a little more personal?
Can we throw away all the casual?
Cos the more I know about you
And the more you know about me
It's easier to be a little more personal

You say you gotta go but what does that mean?
Do you wanna be together or is it just me?
