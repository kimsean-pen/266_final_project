Blind, you're blind
Full of breaths, and sobs, and shakes, and shakes
Saying you will do whatever it takes
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)

Call declined
Say you're "round the corner" fine, okay
You think I will buy whatever you say
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)

But now you're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn and you're pulling it harder
And I think I'm gonna (think I'm gonna)
You're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn and you're breaking my heart
You're making me want to

Crash the car we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
And if he doesn't show
Heaven knows, heaven knows
I will make you feel so blue

You arrive, towing silence on a lively eve
Eyes are crying for another reprieve
(Another, yeah, whatever)
We're blood and water but my back is blown
You're shoulders slumped are saying
"You should have known I'd let you down again"
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)

But now you're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn and you're pulling it harder
And I think I'm gonna (think I'm gonna)
You're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn and you're breaking my heart
You're making me want to

Crash the car we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
And if he doesn't show
Heaven knows, heaven knows
I will make you feel so

Baby, you're breaking my heart
Baby, you're breaking my heart
Why do you make it so hard?
You're breaking my heart

Crash the car we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
And if he doesn't show
Heaven knows, heaven knows
I will make you feel so

Crash the car we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
And if he doesn't show
Heaven knows, heaven knows
I will make you feel so blue
