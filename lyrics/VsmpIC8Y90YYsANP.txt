Rituals of evil
In dungeons dressed in black
Screaming virgins tortured
Dragged to the Devil's altar
Whipped tortured
Our ritual has begun
Witches Sabbath
All good will be undone
Patterns of evil
Whip marks across my flesh
Evil witchcraft
Disciples of death
Narcotic chanting
Female screams fill the crypts
Naked witches writhing
They offer obscene kiss
Whipped tortured
Our ritual has begun
Witches Sabbath
All good will be undone
Patterns of evil
Whip marks across my flesh
Evil witchcraft
Disciples of death
Patterns of evil
Casting shadows

Forever in my mind
