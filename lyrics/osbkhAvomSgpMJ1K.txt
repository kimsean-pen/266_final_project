All I have, I will give to you
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me and we'll be, us

All I have, I will give to you
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me and we'll be, us

And there's no one else, who knows me
Like you do, what I've done
You've done too, the walls I
Hide behind, you walk through
You just walk through

Well I know all the words, to take you apart
You know I know your heart, I want to mend your heart
You're broke down, why don't you tell me from the start
You know I know you're hurt, I want to mend your heart

And there's no one else, who knows me
Like you do, what I've done
You've done too, the walls I
Hide behind, you walk through
You just walk through
