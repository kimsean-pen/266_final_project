I know I've been what's in your mind you could use it, babe
If ever I could let you go is that hard to take?

It's not often you soften up enough to smile
I'm damaged, I'm sandwiched in here for a while

Tomorrow it's the last event that you'll be a man
Forget what you thought she meant thank her, wish her well

I'm damaged, I'm sandwiched in the tree of light
It's no wonder I'm under and no strength to fight

If ever there had been a time would you let me know?
Is there enough of you around could you let some go?

All the love won't deny you you're above all you cry to
Gave it all I could think of wish you'd get what you're on the brink of

All the love won't deny you you're above all you cry to
Gave it all I could think of wish you'd get what you're on the brink of

All the love
