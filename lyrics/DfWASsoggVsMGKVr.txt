I was sitting in the grass
Crosslegged
When my leg it melted off.
It sank into the dirt,
But that's okay, cuz I did not need it anyway.

Whoever wants can it eat it for a tasty snack!
I think I ate pretty healthily before the time that i died.
And whoever wants can tell us that we can't come back.
But we will time and time again, to this hill.

I took the clouds for granted
That they'd always be above.
A quilt below the heavens,
An ivory oven glove.
I never missed the trees
And the folks that live in there

I never knew this hill could be the a monster ride that we'd share.

A monster who'd I'd like to know
A friend to ride on home
He could tell us not to be afraid
Cuz we just would waste our time.
And whoever wants can tell us that we can't come back!
And whoever wants can tell us that we can't do that,
But we will.

I took the clouds for granted
That they'd always be above.
A quilt below the heavens,
An ivory oven glove.
I never missed the trees
And the folks that live in there
I never knew this hill could be the a monster ride that we'd share.
