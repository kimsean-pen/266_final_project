Fuck being friends (say it again, girl)
Fuck being friends (we don't pretend)
I got your heart in my hand and your dick in the other
You ain't scared to fuck, but you scared of being lovers
Why is that, huh?

My pussy beat better then my heart do
Boy, please, you ain't blind, you're a smart dude
So why you pussy-footin' on this part two?
Know, you didn't come here just to argue
You still love me, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you stuck, why play dumb?
You still love me, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Why you worried if your friends blowing me up tryna fuck me?
All up in my phone, all, all up in my head
You stuck, why play dumb?
You still love me, oh, oh, oh

Fuck being friends (being friends)
Fuck being friends (fuck being friends)
Fuck being friends (being friends)
Fuck being friends (fuck being friends)

Why you in my bed?
Prolly 'cause i'm still up in your head, oh
I was doing better and you knew it so you called me
Then you start to feel again
But you're scared to fall
Why is that? Huh?

My pussy beat better then my heart do
Boy, please, you ain't blind, you're a smart dude
So why you pussy-footin' on this part two?
Know, you didn't come here just to argue
You still love me, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you stuck, why play dumb?
You still love me, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Why you worried if your friends blowing me up tryna fuck me?
All up in my phone, all, all up in my head
You stuck, why play dumb?
You still love me, oh, oh, oh
