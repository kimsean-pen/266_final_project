One day I'll tap your mind, then I'll know everything
One day I'll tap your mind, then I'll know everything
One day I'll tap your mind, then I'll know everything
One day I'll tap your mind, then I'll know everything
No one believes me
No one believes me

They're always on your side, every time!
And are you right, and are you right?
Backseat driver, you're driving me insane
I happen to know exactly where I'm going

Whats your agenda?
Whats your agenda?
Whats your agenda?

No one believes me
No one believes me
