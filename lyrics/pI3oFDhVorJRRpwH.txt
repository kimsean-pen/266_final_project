I've been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

I've been walking on a lonely road
For many stories I've have once told
No matter what they say
I will follow my heart
I think it's time for me to stand up
And hold my crown

'Cause I'm living my dreams
Never been so alive
The sky's the limit
Now that I know I can fly
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I'm growing up, I'm growing up
And it's my time to shine
Yeah, it's my time to shine

It don't matter if I'm wrong or right
I'm getting stronger every time
I try not to let it go
Take it one step at a time
I've made my ego, now it's time for me to let it shine

'Cause I'm living my dreams, never been so alive
The sky's the limit
Now that I can fly

No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I'm growing up, I'm growing up
And it's my time to shine
Yeah, it's my time to shine

I've been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
I've learned to let it go
I've learned to let it go
I've learned to let it go
Now it's my time to shine

'Cause I'm living my dreams
Never been so alive
The sky's the limit
Now that I know I can fly
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I'm growing up, I'm growing up
And it's my time to shine
Yeah, it's my time to shine

'Cause I'm living my dreams
Never been so alive
The sky's the limit
Now that I know I can fly
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I'm growing up, I'm growing up
And it's my time to shine
Yeah, it's my time to shine
It's my time, it's my time to, It's my time to shine
