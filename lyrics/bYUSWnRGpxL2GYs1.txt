Let's make a date out of the cinema
Then stay out till early in the morning
I always like it cause we take it slow
While everyone around us seems so hurried

It feels familiar, cause I've been here before
When your words swept the ground right from under me
Remember when you were so insecure
Now you can't get your hands up off of me

But the time we spent was so short
Can't believe it's time to go again

You're always on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it
You're always on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it.

Can we pick it up where you left off
When you said you'll never get over me
I'll take for granted every roll off your tongue
Cause you're screaming out all your honesty

But the time we spent was so short
Can't believe it's time to go again

You're always on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it
You're always on my mind, all time
Cuase there's nothing I'd rather think about
Believe it, believe it.

You know it's time,
You see the bags at the door
I'm minutes away from departing
In exchange for a few last words
Will never be enough for me.

You're always... on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it
You're always on my mind, all time
Cause there's nothing I'd rather think about
Believe it, believe it.
You're always on my mind.
On my mind, believe it.

But the time we spent was so short
Can't believe it's time to go again.

You're always on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it
You're always on my mind, all the time
On my mind, believe it...
