If you told me how you're feeling
I could see the light
If you opened up
If you told me I could stay
I could see the light

If you only
Wanna be who you are again
Won't you wake up from your dreaming
Every now and then

There's an answer to your loneliness
If you dare to ask
There's a truth to see
If you're looking closer you could see the signs

If you only
Wanna be who you are again
Won't you wake up from your dreaming
Every now and then

In your mind lies are all
In your mind lies are all
You see

I've been waiting
Expectations in my eyes
For a sunny day
When the colors all shine brighter than the ones you have stored away

If you only
Wanna be who you are again
Won't you wake up from your dreaming
Every now and then

If you only
Wanna be who you are again
Won't you wake up from your dreaming
Every now and then
