Oh the stories we keep
Hide in the dark
They're fifty feet tall
And full of lies
Silence spreads
Each step ahead

What lies underneath
Finds air to breathe
In pockets full of fantasy
Where I'm free
In what I make believe

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here

Catch me in your fire
Feel the cold side of your desire
Fear what you don't know
Can't let it go

Oh empty the seas
We are underneath
Making our way back up to light
Unseen
We take our dreams

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here

Where ever you go
It will follow you
No matter the way
There's nothing to say
It all looks the same
As it all falls away

Where ever you go
It will follow you
No matter the way
There's nothing to say
It all looks the same
As it all falls away

Where ever you go
It will follow you
No matter the way
There's nothing to say
It all looks the same
As it all falls away

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here

Oh what's inside
Has opened up its eyes
I'm just too tired to put up a fight
I just want you to see that
I'm right here
