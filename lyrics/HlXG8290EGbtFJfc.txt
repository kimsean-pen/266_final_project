I wander through fiction to look for the truth
Buried beneath all the lies
And I stood at a distance
To feel who you are

Hiding myself in your eyes
And hold on
Before it's too late
We'll run till we leave this behind

Don't fall
Just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives

Now the risk that might break you
Is the one that would save
A life you don't live is still lost

So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see
Nothing is real till it's gone
And hold on

Before it's too late
We'll run till we leave this behind
Don't fall

Just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives
So live like you mean it

Love till you feel it
It's all that we need in our lives
So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see

Nothing is real till it's gone
Hold on
Before it's too late
We'll run till we leave this behind
Don't fall
Just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives
And hold on
Before it's too late
We'll run till we leave this behind
Don't fall
Just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives
It's all that we need in our lives
It's all that I need in my life
