Visions haunt my memory
They hold on, hold on desperately
You and I were over long ago
Don't know why my heart was last to know
Each time I find somebody new

Still in love with you
I know I've been lying to myself
Baby, it's you
You know I'll deny it
But know that it's true
Still in love with you

Wake up, cryin' in the night
These feelings I'm feeling
Prove you right
You told me no one could take your place
No matter how I try I can't replace
One thing you said
I know it's true

Still in love with you
I know I've been lyin' to myself
Baby, it's true
I don't want to believe it but what can I do
Still in love with you

You and I were over long ago
Don't know why my heart was last to know

Still in love with you
I know I've been lyin' to myself
Baby, it's you
I don't want to believe it but what can I do
Still in love with you
I know I been lyin',lyin" all along
Baby, it's you
And I know I'll deny it
But know that it's true
Still in love with you
I know I've been lyin' to myself
Baby, it's you
