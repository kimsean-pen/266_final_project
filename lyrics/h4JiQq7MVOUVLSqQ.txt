Taking my time
Choosin' my line
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop
Don't wanna get off
Got myself hung up on you

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known
Things that I'm growin'
Don't taste the same without you
I got myself in
The worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' ta doubt you

Seems to me
Talk all night, here comes the mornin'
Seems to me
You just forget what we said
And greet the day

Seems to me
You don't wanna talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

I've got ta cool myself down
Stompin' around
Thinkin' some words I can't name ya
Meet ya half way
Got nothin' to say
Still I don't s'pose I can blame ya

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Walk away
