Pieces of twine, heaven's on fire
Made my mind up, it was all the same

Situations condensate
Makes me feel like it was all the same
Well I am in agreeance that time is like a strobe like
Better get to blinking, I don't want to miss a thing
You say your'e getting older, you wanna get to know them
Swimming with the best of them, you don't wanna miss a thing
She wasted the day
Said I'll take it anyway
While he faked his disdain
Said why can't I hold on to the refrain?

Once in awhile I seen you come around
Future president, it was all a little plain
You got a little gemstone, paint it white and then some
Getting pretty good at it and it was all a little plain
It was like another planet, so real you couldn't plan it
Digging on the beach again, the waves are getting grey
I am in agreeance that I am like a strobe light
Better get to blinking, I don't wanna miss a thing

Eyes blink open to the day
Haven't seen you in a while
Then proceeding to smile
While I'm spinning the wheel
And I'm starting to feel
What I'm seeking here
What I'm seeking here

I cannot hold to your mountainside ride cause well
I can't believe what I said

Pieces, pieces, wasted
Those pieces weren't all of the same
Mission accomplished I want to resolve this
And I can't believe what I said

Peace is, peace is wasted
I can't believe what they said
