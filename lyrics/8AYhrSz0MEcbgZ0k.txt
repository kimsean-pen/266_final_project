Beyond true will
We seek the comfort in a broken heart
Now pattern shapes
An image of true life
(True life, true life)

Alone
Surrounded by a million faces
One by one
I see the judgment in their eyes
(I see the judgment in their eyes)

Like a disease
I'm always in the wrong
And now the numbness wearing off
Can't stand the pain
I get in line
(I always do)
I always do
Need to be patient
While perfecting death's design

I cannot help it, can't decline
It's always better down the line
I'm in the wrong and I've done it all before

And I wish I'd never been
And I know it's just a dream
Now I'm blind I can open my eyes

Can't stay awake
Burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see
What's gone to me
Live in fear
The sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

Nothing left to break
My life is in a thousand pieces, million reasons
Why should I keep myself away?
(Hard to define)
Hard to define
(It always is)
It always is
It's hard to scream with your throat full of glass
(Throat full of glass)

I cannot help it, can't decline
It's always better down the line
I'm in the wrong and I've done it all before

And I wish I'd never been
And I know it's just a dream
Now I'm blind I can open my eyes

Can't stay awake
Burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see
What's gone to me
Live in fear
The sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

(Can't stay awake)
Can't stay awake
Burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see
What's gone to me
Live in fear
The sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

Can't stay awake
Burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see
What's gone to me
Live in fear
The sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake
