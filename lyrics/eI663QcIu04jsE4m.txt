"She is a girl driven mad by the relentless forces of the beyond
He will not relent, as he comes for her again and again"

I put my hearse in reverse, gonna go for a drive
Up to cemetery, get inside
I could smell her perfume got her blood in a vial
Now we're gonna dig, gonna be here a while. Yeah!

Two hours in, see her skin, threw the shovel aside
Pulled her from the dirt, caught a look in her eye
She's got worms in her mouth, spider webs in her hair
Yeah she may be fucking dead, but I don't care

D-E-A-D
She's my graveyard baby
D-E-A-D
She's my horror queen

Bride of Frankenstein, I'll make you come alive
Oh won't you please be mine?

D-E-A-D
She never tricks, she only treats

She was cold to the bone, open wounds on her flesh
Stitches are for bitches, body bag for a dress
I poured her a shot, she threw it back real quick
Now she's goin' to town, with her lips on my boomstick
Lips on my boomstick

D-E-A-D
She's my graveyard baby
D-E-A-D
She's my horror queen

She never tricks, she only treats
There's nothing she won't do for me
She never tricks, she only treats
There's nothing she won't do for me

And then she did a little twist, it went just like this

D-E-A-D
She's my graveyard baby
D-E-A-D
She's my horror queen

Bride of Frankenstein, I'll make you come alive
Oh won't you please be mine?

D-E-A-D
She never tricks, she only treats
