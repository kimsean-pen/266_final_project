Be it a bone or a broken staff,
Crush hopes, make a shell of a man.
Cut down to the scars on our knees,
I see you traitor!
Bound wounds packed with salt and clay,
Drown in ash to take the taste away,
Forged, crushed, forced to kneel,
Torn nerves replaced with twisted steel.
Another throne, our broken path,
Lead her steady, hold her fast,
Steeds track through the crimson waves,
Guided by the blade,
She's nervous, trapped behind the lines,
Of fear and filth and butchered lives,
A trigger in the hands of minds,
Too young for graves to bind.
Divide the weak, spread suffering, dismay,
Be steady, hold all our restraint.
A storm of swords will rain upon the backs of broken men,
For us they pray, scattered in the aftermath.
Another bridge won't save the trust we stripped from our first born,
This will won't break, as iron strengthens iron.
Before dawn breaks the night we push on through the fog.
A place where cowards thrive and good men die like dogs.
Bite the tongue until you can't ignore,
Blood in the mouth beats blood on the floor,
Weed out the weak to keep the bloodline pure,
Claw the lungs until they breathe no more.
A chalice held toward the sun to appease the hands that bind,
Our collective inner toil, spill poison on the mind.
We're strengthened by iron, reduced to tears by pen,
I throw my hands deep into filth to find myself again.
Divide the weak, spread suffering, dismay,
Be steady, hold all our restraint.
Prepare yourselves!
For a storm of swords to rain upon the backs of men,
For us they pray, scattered in the aftermath.
Another bridge won't save the trust we stripped from our first born,
This will won't break, as iron strengthens iron.
