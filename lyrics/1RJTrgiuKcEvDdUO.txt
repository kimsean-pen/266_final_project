Put up with it
Its always difficult
I have to deal with it
Deal with it let it go
I realise
Aggravated
I'm not the idiot

Please don't panic
I've found us a place to stay tonight
Heart on the floor
I give myself tonight

Eyes on the glitter line
What a beautiful sight

I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
Its not that bad
I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad

Life is not a movie
I'm thinking that it should be
So give me something to watch
I hang my trophy
I'm feeling like I'm something
I'm proud I'm proud of what I've got

Heart on the floor
I give myself tonight
Eyes on the glitter line
What a beautiful sight
What have we all fallen in love with?
What have we all fallen in love with?

I don't know about you
But I feel

I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
Its not that bad
I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad

I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad
I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad

I don't want your sympathy
I tell you all the time
I can't do it like this
I don't want your sympathy
I tell you all the time
I can't do it like

I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad
I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad

I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad
I feel suffocated
Treasure
Poison
It's not that bad
It's not that bad
It's not that bad
It's not that bad
It's not that bad
