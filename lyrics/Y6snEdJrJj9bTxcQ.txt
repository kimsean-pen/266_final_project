Baby I'm a want you. Baby I'm a need you.
You're the only one I care enough to hurt about.
Maybe I'm a crazy, but I just can't live with out
Your lovin' and affection
givin' me direction
like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour.
Lately I'm a prayin
that you'll always be a stayin' be side me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by.
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why...

Lately I'm a prayin
that you'll always be a stayin' be side me.

Used to be my life was just emotions passing by.
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry.
You taught me why...

Baby I'm a want you.
Baby I'm a need you.

Oohh . took so long to find you, baby
Baby I'm a want you.
Baby I'm a need you
