Running, running from one heart to another...

Echoes of loneliness
Traces from love affairs
Will never disappear
Always come thru

I thought I'd never know
The time to see you go
two people turned into one
Thinking as one

A hint in the night
A touch of a dream
Has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
A rose of our love
Is witherd and torn
And gone from one heart to another

Sailing away to sea
The ships made of you and me
They pass in the darkest nights
Turn out the lights

And I thought I'd never know
The season to see you go
Two people twirled into one
Being as one

A hint in the night
A touch of a dream
Has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
A rose of our love
Is witherd and torn
And gone from one heart to anothar

Running, running from one heart to another

A hint in the night
A touch of a dream
Has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
A rose of our love
Is witherd and torn
And gone from one heart to anothar again

A touch of a dream
Has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
A rose of our love
Is witherd and torn
And gone from one heart to another again

Running, running from one heart to another (X3)
