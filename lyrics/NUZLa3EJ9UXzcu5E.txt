Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance...

I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love (I want your love)
Love, love, love, I want your love (I want your love, I want your love)
I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love (want your love)
Love, love, love, I want your love (want your love, I want your love)-

You know that I want you, and you know that I need you
I want it bad, a bad romance

I want your love and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I want your love and all your lovers' revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance

Want you in my room when
Your baby is sick!
