Sinking
So sick of thinking
Of all the things you need from me
Who you think that I should be
Itching
To feel you with me
But I can't do that to myself
Touch so soft but where's the kill?

I wanna look past it
Cuz you're such a habit
But I'm made out of glass and
Some wounds you just can't lick
The crimes that you have committed
You hold them against me
Some nights
Without you I can't dream

So now I see you in my nightmares
Or not at all
All by myself drowning in my tears
It's just the cost
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares
Nightmares
And you're to blame

Crawling
I know you're calling
Your number on my shattered screen
Type your name my fingers bleed

I wanna look past this
Developed a habit
Cuz I'm made out of glass and
Some wounds you just can't fix
The lies you've told me have damaged
My heart and I'm manic
Tonight I'm sleeping in panic

So now I see you in my nightmares
Or not at all
All by myself drowning in my tears
It's just the cost
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares
Nightmares
And you're to blame

So now I see you in my nightmares
Or not at all
All by myself drowning in my tears
It's just the cost
Of keeping you alive inside my brain
I know it's strange
I'm dealing with the pain
I'm having nightmares
Nightmares
And you're to blame
