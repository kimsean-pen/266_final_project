Got struck by the first volley of the war in the courts
Never held my service
Send 'em a wire, give 'em my best, this ammunition never rests
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up

Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me

Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me

I can see the lines, open shutters, and the leaves flocked on a grid
That's what they made my hero say
But nothing gets me off so completely than when you put it down ten feet down in the ground
Call and response, negative hope

Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me

Stop breathin, stop breathin
Breathin for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me, dad, they broke me
