You are working in a factory
Your heart beats for industry
Sweat pearls on your skin
It's the screech of your machine

When the hammer comes down
It's too late for you
When the hammer comes down
It comes down on you

Live for mass-production
You wanna speed up the action
And you hammer on steel
And you hammer for fame

But when it hammers on you
Will it be the same
When the hammer comes down
It's too late for you
When the hammer comes down
It comes down on you
