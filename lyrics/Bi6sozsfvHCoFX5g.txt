Let's go out for breakfast when you wake
Not hungry now but in a while I think that all could change
Used to feel so much that it would ache
Now I've figured out, the walls surround, a holiday

True care
What does that even mean?
I needed true care
When I was 17
True care
How do you even show?
I needed true care

When I was 23 years old
You show me true care then
When you showed up to a house
Where I was drinking by myself
By the door
Spilling liquid on a carpet
That belonged to someone
I didn't even know
Or care about
Or want to show
My vivid mind
Or tragic dancing

And on my brightest days
Still duller than your darkest days
Impossible for me to say
How anyone
Deserves your true care
I'm uncomfortable
With being so uncomfortable
You let me be unreasonable
With everyone
Show me true care
True care
True care
Show me true care

And on my brightest days
Still duller than your darkest days
Impossible for me to say
How anyone
Deserves your true care
And in front of all
Our friends are so responsible
You let me be unreasonable
With everyone
Show me true care
True care
Show me true care
True care
Show me true care
