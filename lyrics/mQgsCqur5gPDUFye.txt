He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, ** all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, ** all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down

Gabriel, Gabriel
Gabriel you've gone too far
Gabriel you've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds I cannot stay, you've gone too far
You've broke my heart, you've gone too far

Wide awake and I can hear my heart beat
Hopes it cradles me and rocks my bones to sleep
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark
And he don't say anything more
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep

Gabriel you've gone too far
Gabriel you've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds I cannot stay, you've gone too far
You've broke my heart, you've gone too far

The sum of all the parts that you have taken
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole
He was stronger than I was but it's strength you can't sustain
Do not come to give me counsel you should beg forgiveness
Of me Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel,
For he was stronger than I was but it's strength you can't sustain
Do not come to give me counsel you should beg forgiveness
Of me Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel

He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
He's falling, he's falling, he's falling, he's falling, all down
