I search alone on empty glasses
The lights come on illuminating
A nowhere bar that's like a Tardis
It's the longest night
I've ever known

Too much, too little
Too little, wanna dance
Too much, too little
Too little light

I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know

No damaged goods can be refunded
On broken hearts I can't rely
I found a diamond that shines brightly
I can't let that go
Don't pass me by

Too much, too little
Too little, wanna dance
Too much, too little
Tonight

I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I wanna life, I want it now, forever
I wanna life, I wanna know
I wanna life, I wanna be together
I wanna life, I wanna know
