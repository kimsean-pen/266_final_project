Emergency - paging Dr. Beat - Emergency
Doctor
I've got this feeling
Deep inside of me
deep inside of me.
Ijust can't control my feet
When I hear the beat
when I hear the beat.
Hey doctor
could you give me something
To ease the pain
to ease the pain

'Cause if you don't help me soon
I'm gonna lose my brain
gonna go insane.
Ijust don't know
don't know

How I'm gonna deal with you
