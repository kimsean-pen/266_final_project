erse 1:

I was born all alone, you the same babe
I was born all alone all alone
Naked, we were as we came, babe.
Naked we came, we would go on
Oh no, im not running in vain, babe.
Oh no, I ain't running too far
Its just some beasts from the wild
Can't be tamed babe...
You know, you know who we are

They dont know nothing
Nothing about us
Nothing bout love or the fears that surround us
But you row the boat that im in
You know we both sink or swim
Baby, we're drowning.wilting like flowers
Chasing the sun for the love that forgot us
And you know im breaking again
You know im caving again

Baby, its a wild world for you.
Moonrise Kingdom only made for two
In these trees there's no escaping truth
They think they're saving you
They think they're saving you.

YOU GOTTA RUN!
Or theyll catch us and stop us from growing
You gotta run!
Hold my love in your heart and keep going
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom x4
(Can't get nowhere near my heart) x 2

We were young smothered tight in the wolf's jaw
So lost in love, we're running out
We left home, we ran off to the woods aw
The beasts, the beasts, they scarfed us down
We prayed hard to a God that felt so far
We call louder now to no response
Started fires because it got so dark.
Oh you said, we'd never smolder out

They dont know nothing
Nothing about us
Nothing bout love or the fears that surround us
But you row the boat that im in
You know we both sink or swim
Baby, we're drowning.wilting like flowers
Chasing the sun for the love that forgot us
And you know im breaking again
You know im caving again

Baby, its a wild world for you.
Moonrise Kingdom only made for two
In these trees there's no escaping truth
They think they're saving you.
They think they're saving you

YOU GOTTA RUN!
Or theyll catch us and stop us from growing
You gotta run!
Hold my love in your heart and keep going
You gotta run!
Can't get they hands on it in the kingdom x4
(Can't get nowhere near my heart) x 2

I HOPE YOU LEARN TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN
I HOPE YOU FIND A LOVE IN YOUR BEST FRIEND
JUST KNOW MY HEART IS YOURS UNTIL ITS END
I WANT YOU NOW FOREVER ILL REPENT
BABY, ITS A WILD WORLD FOR YOU.
