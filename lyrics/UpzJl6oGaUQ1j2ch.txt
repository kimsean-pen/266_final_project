Her face, when you were looking for a while,
with not a trace that we're underneath the weather.
And I tried to let go
and she slipped away
like a little girl,
but I really wanna make her mine.

My girl would never say
what I need to hear
to make it all okay.
So we try to make nice so the kids won't know
for a little while, but it really doesn't make it out.

Find you alone a while
with a heavy hand and a dark-lit smile.
Let her find time to regret
what I still don't know -
and I really want to make her mine.

She wants to know just who I am.
She wants to know just who I am.
She can make you work for the worth she has.
She wants to know just who I am.

I'm guessing that it happens all of the time
through no fault of mine,
she can turn it around.
And she wasn't like the best thing under the sun,
but yeah, I guess I needed to learn from her.
I guess I needed to open up and let it all out.

Your face when it all came down
with a bright light was a little dark frown.
I was unturned by the sharp alarm
and you weren't afraid,
but it really doesn't matter.

I tried you and forced a smile
and we were like friends for an unset while.
And I might've let go maybe one of those nights you stayed a while,
and still I wanna make her mine.

She wants to know just who I am.
She wants to know just who I am.
She can make you work for the worth that she has.
She wants to know just who I am.

I'm guessing that it happens all of the time
through no fault of mine,
