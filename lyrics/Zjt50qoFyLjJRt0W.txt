Sitting here in Limbo
But I know it won't be long
Sitting here in Limbo
Like a bird without a song.
Well, they're putting up a resistance,
But I know that my faith will lead me on.

Sitting here in Limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll.
Yeah, now, sitting here in Limbo,
Got some time to search my soul.
Well, they're putting up a resistance,
But I know that my faith will lead me on.

I don't know where life will leave me,
But I know where I have been.
I can't say what life will show me,
But I know what I have seen.
Tried my hand at love and friendship,
But all that is past and gone.
This little boy is movin' on.

Sitting here in Limbo
Waiting for the tide to flow.
Sitting here in Limbo
Knowing that I have to go
Well, they're putting up a resistance,
But I know that my faith will lead me on.

I don't know where life will take me,
But I know where I have been.
I don't know what life will show me,
But I know what I have seen.
Tried my hand at love and friendship,
That is past and gone.
And now it's time to move along.

Gonna lead me on now.
Meanwhile, they're putting up resistance,
But I know that my faith will lead me on.
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,
But I know that my faith will lead me on.
