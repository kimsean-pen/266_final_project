1, 2, 3, 4.

You've got my number.
You... know what I need.
And I go crazy
When... ever I bleed.
Won't you come over?
I... swear I'll be nice.
My girlfriend told me that
You've left your wife.

I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
Oh, wont you lick the pavement for me?
I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
I like you best
When you're on your knees.

I know you're lonely,
'Cause... you're just like me.
Why don't you call me?
You... know where I'll be.

I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
Oh, wont you lick the pavement for me?
I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
I like you best
When you're on your knees.

Do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
Oh, wont you lick the pavement for me?
I learn to bribe.
I learn to say please.
I like you best
When you're on your knees.

Do do do do do do do
When your on your knees
Do do do do
When your on your knees
Do do do do do do do
When your on your knees
Do do do do
When your on your knees
Do do do do do do do
When your on your knees
Do do do do
Oh, won't you lick the pavement for me? [till fade]
