Grains of sand
Weak and blood stained
We are
We are
Trying to find our way down through the bottomless hourglass
The board is down, pieces set
We are
We are
Pawns trying to reach the eighth rank
Sacrificed for the kings and queens

On fields of sorrow I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

We are
We are
Wild roses in the wasteland
We are
We are
Defying the desert sun
Yet thrown into the grave at last
Memories from another era
Is what
We'll be
Your grace and gentle nature
Long forgotten in the end

On fields of sorrow I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

On fields of sorrow the soil wants blood and tears
On fields of sorrow these minutes feel like years
Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me in the kingdom of the dead

On fields of sorrow I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

On fields of sorrow the soil wants blood and tears
On fields of sorrow these minutes feel like years
Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me in the kingdom of the dead

Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me when I'm dead
