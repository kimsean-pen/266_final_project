I woke up
At 11: 33,
Watched the trailer for a new
Christopher Nolan movie.

And it started me thinking,
I would love to write a script,
What about the world,
From an alien ship?

Can you clarify?
If this is real, or a design.
Seeing all these speculators rise,
Inside my Darwinism Simulator.

Now we create,
Or we absorb.
How long will every brain be wrote up for?

It's dangerous,
Instant advice,
(No clue)

I think I'm sneaking to my church now,
Seems like a baby full of pain now,
A deconstruction of your chains, woah,
I'm only choosing life,
I'm only choosing life.
