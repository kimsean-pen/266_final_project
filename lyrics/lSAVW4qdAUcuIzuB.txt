Coldness in the air
Autumn in shades of fire
Brings the age of snowfalls and ice
And sets the world in perpetual slumber

Frozen rain begins to pour and the winter breeze arise
The earth stands still before the fall

The aeon of cold
Frozen to the core
White veil upon the earth

Glaciers will bury below
Ground frost unfolds
Frozen soil conceals for evermore

Behold the white and deserted woodlands
Icy lifeblood of nature
Pitch-black and lifeless waters

Desolated and bleak
Isolated and stark
Light's creation now forsaken and dark

The aeon of cold
Frozen to the core
White veil upon the earth
Glaciers will bury below
Ground frost unfolds
Frozen soil conceals for evermore
