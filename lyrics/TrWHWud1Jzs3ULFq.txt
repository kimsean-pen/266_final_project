I got you
I got you on my mind
And its time to make you see
(What I want)
So I'll just make this
A little more obvious
'Cause I get what I want
And I want you to get with me
(You want to get with me)

Don't think you know
How far I'm gonna go

Can't stop this feeling
You cannot run away
Baby I'm what's on your mind
You can't stop this feeling
There is no escape
No sleep tonight
You won't get
No sleep tonight

You want me
You want me all the time
And you don't need nothing new
But you seem to be
A little oblivious
So I'll show you the way
'Cause I think that you need some help

Tell me baby
Are you coming with me?

Can't stop this feeling
You cannot run away
Baby I'm what's on your mind
You can't stop this feeling
There is no escape
No sleep tonight
You won't get
No sleep tonight

No sleep tonight
Oh
No sleep tonight

What you want to sleep in?
No sleep tonight
You don't to spell it out in black and white
What you want to sleep in?
No sleep tonight
Do I have to spell it out in black and white?

(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)

Can't stop this feeling
You cannot run away
Baby I'm what's on your mind
You can't stop this feeling
There is no escape
No sleep tonight
You won't get
No sleep tonight

(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
(oh oh oh oh oh)
no sleep tonight
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
No sleep tonight
