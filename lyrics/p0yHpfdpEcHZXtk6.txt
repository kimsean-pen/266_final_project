The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love, and see
All the lovely things
You are to me
Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now, when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Now, when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
your smile
your smile
