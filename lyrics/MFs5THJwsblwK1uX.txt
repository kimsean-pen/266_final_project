Do I look like religion
Do you think you could preach me
Do I look like a pagan
Do you think you can teach me
Do I look like a migrant
Do you think you could move me
And did I look like I'm violent
Then baby, why don't you shoot me

And if I died in the middle of a frozen night
Would you feel alright, would you be alright if I
Died in the middle of your paradise
Would you change your mind
Would you bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

Do I look like a monkey
Do you think you can cage me
Do I look like an actress
Do you think you could rape me
Do I look like I'm energy
Do you think you can waste me
And if you don't like my poetry
Then baby, why don't you butcher me

And if I died in the middle of a frozen night
Would you be alright, would you feel alright if I
Died in the middle of your paradise
Would you change your mind
Would you bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

Preach me, teach me
Move me, shoot me
Cage me, rape me
Waste me, butcher me

If I died in the middle of a frozen night
If I died in the middle of your paradise
If I died in the middle of a frozen night
If I died in the middle, if I died in the middle
Would you cry?
Bring me back to life
