Let's stay here forever
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
A God-like floating sensation
Hands cover me
Jolting... erupting
Sensory bliss

I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?

The mark is spotted (the mark is spotted, they have found me)
They have found me (the mark is spotted, they have found me)
Found me, found me
Found me (electricity screams through the fingers)
Found me (through the fingers below)

I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?

Move me to the ambulance of thought
Tiny electric movements

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss

I'm now elevated
(I'm now elevated)
Yellow eyes stare below me
(Yellow eyes stare below me)

The church of regret emits welcoming
Please don't shut us out
The red glow creates shadows... mountains
Shadows of our choosing

Lights in their eyes start flickering
The proverbial bellow

Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever

Beautiful eruption
We've made our creation
Beautiful eruption.
We've made our creation

Sunshine beams on their faces
As they melt into one
The slight hum of the grid
The slight hum of the grid

Sunshine beams on their faces
As they melt into one
The slight hum of the grid
The slight hum of the grid

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss
