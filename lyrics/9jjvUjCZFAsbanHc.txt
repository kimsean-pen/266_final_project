it's been a little while since I looked in your eyes
And walked that bridge to the other side
Mama says its gonna get cold in the night
But if I picture you then I'll be alright
I am ready, I am ready, for you to be here

It's been a little while since I've held your hands
oh my arms won't stretch to your distant land
Give me every person in the whole wide world
and I'll pick you out in a second, girl.
I am ready, I am ready, for you to be here.

For you, for you, to be here.
For you, for you, to be here.

It's been too many seconds since I've seen your face
and for all I know you're in outer space
Dancing to the rhythms of the shooting stars
thinking of the times that forever are ours
I am ready, I am ready, for you to be here.

For you, for you, to be here.
For you, for you, to be here.

It's been a little while since I've held your hands
oh my arms won't stretch to your distant land
Give me every person in the whole wide world
and I'll pick you out in a second, girl.
I am ready, I am ready, for you to be here.
