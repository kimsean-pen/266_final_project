Life sucks so smoke a pound a day
But that ain't enough for me to get away
Problems everywhere I turn, go away
The demons on my door keep haunting me
The angel on my shoulder's on a holiday
Not happy with myself I need another me
I just want my life I beg you please
I never thought the Reaper would come for me

Life is super slow I feel super poor
When you get what you wanna
I've been working hard, goin' against the odds
And I'm fucking exhausted
Ain't no time for fun, ain't no space to run
I'm just stuck in the moment
Kill me now I'm done, I feel less than one
I no longer feel honor (yeah, yeah)
It's crazy life is Wizard of Oz
You think there's somethin' behind the curtain but there's not
Just the government with a large eye
Counting down 'til the days that we all die

Life sucks so smoke a pound a day
But that ain't enough for me to get away
Problems everywhere I turn, go away
The demons on my door keep haunting me
The angel on my shoulder's on a holiday
Not happy with myself I need another me
I just want my life I beg you please
I never thought the Reaper would come for me

What's really real? fuck all of these bills
How can I not get nauseous on these purple hills?
I'm crying 'cause my baby boy gon' need some
meals and I promised baby girl I'd get the meals
