Their minds were searching through a wonderland
It was the age of wonder
And their worlds had become too small
To restrict the narrative any longer
Future became their destination
Dedicated to creating their own destinies
A cool thing, oh what a cool thing

It seems so far away
I finally understood what cool was when I met them
Reservoir and a city skyline
What a picture perfect view

Boys in brown and burgundy brogues
Girls with more than skin to show
Smoking trees and twilight scenes
Cool kids, the cool kids, we're with the cool kids
We don't need to sit at the back of the bus
If we decide what's cool
We don't need to yell or to fear or to fuss
If we live by our own rules

Taking the paradox around them
Constructing chaos into a chorus of interweaving roads
Their journeys are beautifully uncertain
And through the interlocking and diverging moments
The finish line is clear to see and it's a cool thing
Oh what a cool thing

It seems so far away
I finally understood what cool was when I met them
Reservoir and a city skyline
What a picture perfect view

Boys with brown and burgundy brogues
Girls with more than skin to show
Smoking trees and twilight scenes
Cool kids, the cool kids, we're with the cool kids
We don't need to sit at the back of the bus
If we decide what's cool
We don't need to yell or to fear or to fuss
If we live by our own rules

We don't need to sit at the back of the bus
If we decide what's cool
We don't need to yell or to fear or to fuss
If we live by our own rules (We're deciding what is cool)
Boys with brown and burgundy brogues
Girls with more than skin to show
Smoking trees and twilight scenes
Cool kids, the cool kids, we're with the cool kids

Boys with brown and burgundy brogues (We don't have to sit, no, no)
Girls with more than skin to show (No girls screamin' no)
Smoking trees and twilight scenes (No)
Cool kids, the cool kids, we're with the cool kids

We don't need to sit at the back of the bus
If we decide what's cool (We decidin' what is cool)
We don't need to yell or to fear or to fuss
If we live by our own rules
