I'm intoxicated by my depression
And I'm consumed by the fear
That I might never find the answer
And the end just gets more near

So take my blood
And tell me something's wrong yeah
I need to know
I need to know
You can tell me I'm a lost cause
I've had enough coz
If my body is a temple

Why does it hurt like hell?

I do not think you heard me when I said
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
Help me please I could not be more desperate
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
When will this end?
Let it be the last time
Can you make it alright?
I've never been so close to the edge

My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell

I've been suffocated by my obsession
And cannot stand the sight
Of all of the pain I see in my reflection
And my fading will to fight
I make myself sick just so I can hate this
A little bit more
A little bit more
Everybody is complaining

I wish I had the same things
Knocking at my temple
Why does it hurt like hell?

I do not think you heard me when I said
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
Help me please I could not be more desperate
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
When will this end?
Let it be the last time

Can you make it alright?
I've never been so close to the edge
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell

Yes I know I've lost what you call control
But control isn't real and you never had it
Yes I know I've lost what you call control

If control isn't real, then I never had it
Yes I know I've lost what you call control
But control isn't real and you never had it
Yes I know I've lost what you call control
If control isn't real, then I never had it

I do not think you heard me when I said
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
Help me please I could not be more desperate
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell
When will this end?
Let it be the last time
Can you make it alright?
I've never been so close to the edge
My body is a temple
Tell me why it hurts like hell.
