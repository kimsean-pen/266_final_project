Could you forgive the awful things I've done
Could you forget the awful things I've done

Well I'm sure I will become your favorite son
If you'd forgive the awful things I've done

Sweet Jesus could you wash my sins away
Sweet Jesus could you take this pain away

If the devil offers no then I would say
Sweet Jesus' blood and wash my sins away

Make room in your mansion in the sky
Open up your big house in the sky
Don't ask me what I've done 'cause I would lie
Just make room in your mansion in the sky
Make room in your mansion in the sky
