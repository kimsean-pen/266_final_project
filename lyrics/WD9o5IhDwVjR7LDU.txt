You know the story
You've read the books
Boy meets girl
And they fall forever in love
But I know better
So here goes a tale
For the realest of the real
Listen

Now once upon a time in a small world
It was everything that I dreamed of
He was my gem and I was his pearl
Nothing could come between us
A prince charming to call my own
Til the day that he broke my heart
And left me wondering all alone
Picking my mind and soul apart

Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
Used to believe in fairy tales (In fairy tales)
But since my heart's been crushed (It's been crushed)
I don't believe in much, I need help (No no no no no)
Don't know which way to turn
Can't figure it out for myself
I'm just starting to learn
There's no such thing in fairy tales

Wasn't our story supposed to end
Unhappily ever after
Just as wonderful as it began
And carry on for a few chapters
Baby how come each time I open up
I can't seem to go past page one
I guess it's time for me to close up
And go back on the shelf because I'm done

Used to believe in love (I used to believe in love)
Used to believe in fairy tales
But since my heart's been crushed
I don't believe in much, I need help (I don't believe in much, I need help)
Don't know which way to turn
Can't figure it out for myself (Can't figure it out for myself)
I'm just starting to learn
There's no such thing in fairy tales

Twinkle twinkle little star
Why do my dreams seem so far? (Now they seem so far)
Up above the world so high
Won't somebody tell me why? (Can you help me?)
Can you help me out?
Can you show me what love is all about?
Cause I never known it for myself (Don't believe in fairy tales)
That's why I don't believe in fairy tales no more

Used to believe in love (No more)
Used to believe in fairy tales
But since my heart's been crushed
I don't believe in much, I need help (been crushed, I don't believe in much, I need help)
Don't know which way to turn
Can't figure it out for myself (For myself)
I'm just starting to learn
There's no such thing in fairy tales (There's no such thing in fairy tales)
Used to believe in love
Used to believe fairy tales
But since my heart's been crushed
I don't believe in much, I need help
Don't know which way to turn
Can't figure it out for myself
I'm just starting to learn
There's no such thing in fairy tales
