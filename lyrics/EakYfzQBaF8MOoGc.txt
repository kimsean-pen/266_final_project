Remember when you said we were in this together?
We only had one goal in mind
To be the best that we could be for each other
To look ahead and put our differences aside

I could swear that you're a different person now
All you want these days is a fight
I could've sworn that this would end up different but I'm tired of trying 'cause we can't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye

I feel the separation
It's time that you go your way, I'll go mine

All I ever wanted was the best for us
Then out of nowhere you were out of touch
I really think I should've done this sooner
I only wish I would have never gave so much

I feel the separation
It's time that you go your way, I'll go mine
I watched you change into everything you used to hate
And push me away 'cause you're scared of what I'll say

I didn't want this, it kills me inside
I have no choice but to sever the ties

What happened to the you I used to know?
Was it ever real, or was it just a show?
The trust, the love, the bond we had, where did it go? Where did it go?
What happened to the you I used to know?

I poured out, gave you everything
Now I wish I could take it back
Go now, far away from me before I lose what little patience I have

I believed every lie you told and now I think that I am better off alone
You only took, and always asked for more
Now give me back every part of my life you stole

I watched you change into everything you used to hate
And push me away 'cause you're scared of what I'll say
I didn't want this, it kills me inside
I have no choice but to sever the ties
