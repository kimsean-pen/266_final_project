Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
Im trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, Im wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a n-gga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but sh-t, I might get high with you
Its only fitting cause Im looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So i threw em back, now all my n-ggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad n-gga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

And can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning

The sun rising while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning

The sun rising while you moanin'
Yeah, yeah, now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lit?

That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl

I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow, yeah I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab

And now ya leaking while we freaking, ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you
And can I hit it in the morning

Can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing, or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights are still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go

See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel, sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangled in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did

And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough
And can I hit it in the morning
Can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
