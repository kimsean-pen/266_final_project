Proudly swept the rain clouds by the cliffs
As on it glided through the trees
Still following with glee faliko
Hiahi lehua of the valley

Aloha oe, aloha oe
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace, ahoi ae au
Until we meet again

Aloha oe, aloha oe
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace, a hoi ae au
Until we meet again
