I can't fight it
She got me hot and bothered
Her ring rock 'round her finger
Showing me I shouldn't want her
And brother we might have problems
Cause she's tearin' me down and I'm tempted
And I ain't gonna say I'm sorry now
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend

I think I'm in love, think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend

She's putting me out there
And she got a look like she leaving
It looks like she knows what she's wantin'
And I think I'm just what she's needin'
Brother we might have problems
But I ain't here for fending
But I ain't gonna say I'm sorry now
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend

I think I'm in love, think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend
Ooh, ooh
I think I'm in love, think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend

Ooh, ooh
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend
(Yeah)
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with your girlfriend

Yeah
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love with your girlfriend
