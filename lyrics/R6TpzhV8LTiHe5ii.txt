He said, life's the roughest ocean
She said, then it's calm and blue
White water tries to pull you under
And love's the only craft to save you

Illumina, Illumina, Illumina, Illumina

He said, each of us is broken
She said, well that's the greatest thing
In total, fragile imperfection
The dark is how we let the light in

Illumina, Illumina, Illumina, Illumina

And he sees her glow
In reflection (In reflection)
She could never know (She could never know)
How bright

Illumina, Illumina, Illumina, Illumina
