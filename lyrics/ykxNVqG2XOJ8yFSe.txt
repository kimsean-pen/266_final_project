I just found a friend in one of your lies
To treat me so nice, I can't believe my bones
When they say so many things
They tell me I am fine
Believe me I, I try

Ever so sweet you make this seem
The way things go
It's not my fault
And I'll miss, I'll miss you so good
All of those nights that we lost our way back home

Ever so sweet, you baked it in cakes for me
What you left behind
It hurts my teeth
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me
Every line
It brings me right back down

Can't you see the wall you build for me?
Can't you see the wall you build for me?
Can't you see the wall you build for me?
We're not special
We're not special
We're not special
I'm not special
I'm not special

Ever so sweet, you baked it in cakes for me
What you left behind
It hurts my teeth
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me
Every line
It brings me right back down
