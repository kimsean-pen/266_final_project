Hey you, I've seen you here before
in your eyes, prizmatic sight on and on as I defy
denials, back from the broken glass
sapphire visions and favored derisions with spiders on your mind shaking fists full of string as I

tie me up in knots while contradictory impulse lusts
the dreaming loom is twisted and confused
the stories on the spools will weave us back into one

and here we find ourselves again
tightrope decisions and blood-colored medicine a million miles from eye-to-eye
it feels much as it did before biting the tails in self-made betrayals
forever repeating this deceit, so who cares if I...

...while spinning I spun you a web
while spinning I spun you,
stammering words in a daze, seemingly starry-eyed followers mumbling praise
and all of the world is a stage, fleetingly these marionettes dance straight to their graves
with every desire on a string the future hangs perilously
it's the start of the tie that will bind and the last fraying strand

spinning on the dreaming loom a web of lies and tangled truths
with every knot that comes undone, we weave ourselves back into one
