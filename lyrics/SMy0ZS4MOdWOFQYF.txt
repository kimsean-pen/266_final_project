now you find yourself
in a state you don't know is it madness is it health
through the ivy wall
a hidden garden door
in the centre of that garden there's a well
sitting by the well
by the canterbury bells
in your face only the darkness of this hole
now you find yourself
in a state you don't know should it start or should it end
how long has it been since you've felt anything
you're feelings kept beneeth the meadows in the soil
and you gaze like from elsewhere
into the halo of this void
is there a shimmer of hope left at the end?
