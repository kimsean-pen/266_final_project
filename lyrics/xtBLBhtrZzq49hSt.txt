I know what I said was heat of the moment
There's a little truth in between the words we'ev spoken
It's a little late now to fix the heart that's broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going

'Cause I don't know
No, I don't know
anymore

It used to feel like heaven
It used to feel like May
I used to hear those violins playing our strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth

't you won't believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

I went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same, now when I'm with you
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen when our love was new
Ooh love, I'm a fool to believe in you
I don't know
No, I don't know
anymore

It used to feel like heaven
It used to feel like May
I used to hear those violins playing our strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away

Nobody wants to know the truth
Until their heart's broken
(Heart been broken)
Don't you dare tell them what you think to do
(Oh don't you dare)
till they get over
(Over... over...)
You can only learn these things from experience
When you get older
(When you get older you'l understand oh)
I just wish that someone would have told me
M m m... m
(Uh.) m m m-m-m... m
Uh wowow
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Ow wo-ow wo o o
Till it happens to you
U wo oh oh oh uuh
