That's my sweater
(My sweater)
Why the fuck you got it on
We're not together (together)
Should've let that shit at home
See the the girl in the corner of the club
That's my ex we were once in love
Haven't spoken in about six month
Till she told my friends at once
And that's when things got out of control
Took my shit
She said baby don't go
I don't wanna be here no more
That's my sweater
(My sweater)
Why the fuck you got it on
We're not together (together)
Should've let that shit at home
It happen like
One, two, three or four times
Though it was forever
But forever is not right
I've been staying bussy
I've been doing alright
But I'm only asking
For my favorite fabric back
What more can I do
When I look at you
Fuck I get confused
And I'm trying to adjust
Move on for a minute
Like dam
That's my sweater
(My sweater)
Why the fuck you got it on
(Why the fuck you got it on)
We're not together (together)
Should've let that shit at home
But thats my sweater baby
My sweater
Why the fuck you got it on
That's my sweater, that's my sweater,
That's my sweater, that's my
