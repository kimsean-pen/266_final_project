It's too late, the time has come
I kept this inside me for way too long
Silence will leave me cold
Lost on a highway
That never takes me home

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
Oh, there will come a time
When I will come undone and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind before you break me down

The weight of a thousand lies
And promises broken haunt me all the time
You say that you're sure to change
But that black heart reveals that
You'll always stay the same

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
Oh, there will come a time
When I will come undone and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind before you break me down

And I realize forgiveness is calling
And it's calling
And I've denied the reason
I'm falling
Yeah, I'm falling
So let go

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
But there will come a time
When I will come undone and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind before you break me down
