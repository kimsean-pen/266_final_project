Life's got seasons
Some are hot and some are freezing
And baby up to last weekend
You got my temperature risin' and I just wanna drive
And listen to that red album of Third Eye Blind
Soak in this image of life

Yeah, that's how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got my flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause you're loves a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different
I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
Feel right now

I'm more than okay
Happy hour tipsy on a Monday
Funny how it changes after one day
It wasn't that long ago
I was at the end of my rope
But you gave my story a twist
Ya one kiss and you flipped the script

Yeah, that's how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got my flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause you're loves a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different
I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
Feel right now
Feel right now

(Woah, woah)
Dancin' in the parkin' lot (Woah, woah)
I don't care, let 'em watch (Woah, woah)
I don't know why (Woah, woah)

Yeah, that's how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got my flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause you're loves a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different
I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
I feel right now (Woah, woah)
I feel right now (Woah, woah)
Tomorrow might be different (Woah, woah)
I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now (Woah, woah)
I feel right
