Don't hate on me,
Cause I'll just hate on you
Let me do my thing
And i'll leave the rest to you
Don't frighten me
When it's in that name
Why do you took the pain
While watering mother's name
Most of the time i was stuck in the middle Times I find someone to fit your description
I don't
I don't think that baby'll resist c'mon
I don't think that baby'll resist c'mon
Don't hate on me
Cause i'll just hate on you
Let me do my thing
And i'll leave the rest to you
Don't frighten me
When it's in that name
Why do you took the pain
While watering mother's name
Most of the time i was stuck in the middle Times I find someone to fit your description
I don't
I don't think that baby'll resist c'mon
I don't think that baby'll resist c'mon
