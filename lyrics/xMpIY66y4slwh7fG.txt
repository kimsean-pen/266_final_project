took a long time to mend
took a long time to make amends
funny how the story goes
strip a man bare and burn his clothes

time is all i crave
it comes in waves
i will be here until i drown

system's on overload
goes to bed warm but wakes up cold
what a bloody cross to bare
time on my hands but i don't care

days are all the same
they wax and wane
i will be here until i drown

time is all i crave
it comes in waves
i will be here until i drown

days are all the same
they wax and wane
i will be here until i drown

time is all i crave
it comes in waves
i will be here until i drown
