I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them memorized

But when I get up the nerve
To tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do need you

I dream of moments we share
But you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy

'Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do need you

No you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do need you

Oh, oh if only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
I do need you

Oh, if, if...
If I love you, yes
You don't know
I said you don't know how much I need you, sugar

Oh, I said you don't know
That I love you
And I will show I love you
