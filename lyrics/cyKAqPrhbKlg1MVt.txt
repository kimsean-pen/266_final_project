Your ivory tower is falling down
We get what we wanted

Brick by brick we'll take it all
The higher the throne, the further the fall
I believe, we'll finish what we started
We'll finish what we started

You think you're made of gold, untouchable
Control the power you feel on top of the world
Deep down I know you're scared
Take my hand so I can pull you off your high horse
Take my hand so I can pull you off your high horse

Your ivory tower is falling down
We get what we wanted

Brick by brick we'll take it all
The higher the throne, the further the fall
I believe, we'll finish what we started

Brick by brick we'll take it all
The higher the throne, the further the fall
I believe, we'll finish what we started
(We'll finish what we started)

You'll find yourself on the wrong side of history
The predator turned to prey
Dissolved into a memory
You never saw us coming
Blood spots will leave you vulnerable
Hindsight won't save you now

Your ivory tower is falling down
And we get what we wanted

Brick by brick we'll take it all
The higher the throne, the further the fall
I believe, we'll finish what we started

Brick by brick we'll take it all
The higher the throne, the further the fall

There's nothing left for you here
Your time is up
There's nothing left for you here
Your time is up
