Carry on
Through the storm
Lay your eyes on me
Come along
Through the mist
The best is yet to be
Jump straight into the ocean
Hold your head up high
Walk straight into the fire
Cuz me and you never dry
Into the eye
Up the storm
Stillness at its peak
Go ahead
Beat the wave
The best is yet to be
Bounce crying through the ocean
For restless mountain high
Jump straight into the water
Let the ocean cleanse your mind
Carry on with me
Carry on with me
Jump straight into the fire
Hold your head up high
Bounce straight into the water
Let the ocean cleanse your body
Don't be sorry
Carry on with me
Carry on with me
Jump straight into the water
Hold your head up high
Walk straight into the fire
Me and you never dry
Carry on with me
Carry on with me
With me
With me
Carry on with me
With me
With me
Carry on
Carry on with me
