you sang in the swell
coruscating with such ordinary colors of the coast
the champaign fielding neighborhoods
where you've come to know contentment in cataracts and torrents
coalescing summer songs with new partners for slumber
in spite of this i am beside myself
and despite this you are the same without me
you belong further in winter body
i was meant to keep you warm
please come home
but i am anchored
because i can not contain you
