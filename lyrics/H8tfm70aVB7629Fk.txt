It came unexpected
still it's laying at my door.
Ways that I reflected,
you've been there, you always will.
Still my apprehension
tells me you have gone so far.
They can't say where you are.
Compromising this
in despair I'm hoping.
You can sense what is
drifting in your ocean.
Passed beyond redemption
left just to remember.
When the moment passed here
silence thundered across the plains.
Heavy hearts that ache to
hear you say that it is not too late.
Given no chance to forgive me.
Left to absolve an illusion.
Beneath the surface I sense how I am growing older.
Holding the pieces you left like a last intervention. It's
In my wake, (taking the light from me)
now, (part from the guide as we lose)
I swim against the tide and in the (our faith)
late (taking the light from me)
hour (part from the guide as we lose)
coming to your side (our faith)
Leave my life, (taking the light from me)
now, (part from the guide as we lose)
putting out the lights that shine on (our faith)
my (taking the light from me)
all, (part from the guide as we lose)
abandoned here by time, (our faith)
left
open wide.
Compromising this,
in despair I'm hoping.
You can sense what is,
drifting in your ocean.
Breathing on unaware.
Winters reach everywhere.
Given no chance to forgive me.
Left to absolve an illusion.
Beneath the surface I sense how I am growing older.
Holding the pieces you left like a last intervention, it's
In my wake, (taking the light from me)
now, (part from the guide as we lose)
I swim against the tide and in the (our faith)
late (taking the light from me)
hour (part from the guide as we lose)
coming to your side (our faith)
Leave my life, (taking the light from me)
now, (part from the guide as we lose)
putting out the lights that shine on (our faith)
my (taking the light from me)
all, (part from the guide as we lose)
abandoned here by time. (our faith)
(taking the light from me)
(part from the guide as we lose)
(our faith)
