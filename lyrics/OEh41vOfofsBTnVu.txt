Every word's a story
Use it like a spark
To light up all the memories
Inside your ancient heart

Sharing pain and beauty
Makes us who we are
Leaves us less defenceless
And brave against the dark

If we dare to raise our voices
And circle 'round the flame
Our dance will keep the animals away

You know the beast is watching
Waiting for a taste
To feed on fear and anger
But together we are safe

Sharing pain and beauty
Makes us who we are
Leaves us less defenceless
And brave against the dark

If we dare to raise our voices
And circle 'round the flame
Our dance will keep the animals away

These hungry eyes are just souls of the night
Afraid of the light
Afraid of the light

If we dare to raise our voices
And circle 'round the flame
Our dance will keep the animals away

If we dare to raise our voices
And circle 'round the flame
Our dance will keep the animals away
