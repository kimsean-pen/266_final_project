When the birds are sleeping
That's when the trees sing
You left your winter clothes
And your teeth marks in my skin

So shake the leaves off the trees
Watch them float down, down the stream
Your son, your daughter swimming in the water

And I miss you, even when you're around
I'm a black cloud sending lightning to the ground

Darling please show your teeth
Just one more dance to help me sleep
Owl girl, cold water eyes
Fill the past with friendly nights

Human skin can be hard to live in
You'll feel better in the morning

(Swim, swim outside the walls)
Wash your hands in the lake
(Swim, swim outside the walls)
You got a heart, light the way

Trails lost in the snow
Make way for winter's eerie glow
And that black rock in your bedroom
I hope you'll climb it soon

In your boat, tied to a tree
I hope you'll find the sea

Throw me a dream please
It's been a dreamless sleep for
Such a long time, such a long time

Sing myself awake
Watch the branches break
No one could ever take your place

(Sing, sing outside the walls)
Wash your face in the lake
(Sing, sing outside the walls)
You got a diamond under your skin
