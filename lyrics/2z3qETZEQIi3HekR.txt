Dry my eyes just to greet the day
Lift myself up from where I lay
Simple silence, my only friend
The only one on whom I can depend
Oh please won't you please, won't you please, won't you please
Won't you save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears?
And there's a change in the air
I can feel it
How my heart cannot bare
Can you feel it?
Save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears
I don't know where I've come to find
All the hearts beatin' out of time
As I try not to figure out
All the things I have come to doubt in my head
Oh please won't you please, won't you please, won't you please
Won't you save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears?
And there's a change in the air
I can feel it
How my heart cannot bare
Can you feel it?
Save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears
Oh please won't you please, won't you please, won't you please
Won't you save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears?
'Cause there's a change in the air
I can feel it
How my heart cannot bare
Can you feel it?
Save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears
Save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears
Save all the grace til the hurtin' disappears
