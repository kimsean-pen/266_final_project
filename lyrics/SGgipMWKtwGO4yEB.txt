I invite you to the party of my mind
An invitation to the party of my mind

Some talk, some laugh
Some go out for air
In the party of my mind
They'll all be there
All my friends will be there
In the party of my mind

There's a room for us
In the party of my mind
A place to be, a place to be found
A room without light
A room whith lights that blind
These ideas I invite
To the party of my mind

Won't you come in and invite love
Won't you come in, invite your anarchist friend
Won't you come in, anything can happen
Won't you come in, stay till the end

There's a disturbance over by the stairs
And her face looks round for me
Her eyes say something's going wrong
Some things aren't how they should be

I invite you to the party of my mind
An invitation to the party of my mind

Some talk, some cry
Some go out for air
In the party of my mind
We'll all be there
Everyone will be there
Everyone will be there
