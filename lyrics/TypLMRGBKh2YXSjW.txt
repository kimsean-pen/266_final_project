I can't help it
The way I feel you in my bones
Don't mind the judgement
You wrap me up when we're alone

They don't really need to know our business
They don't really need to know what we do
They don't really need to know where we go
When it's just me and you
Got you touchin' on me all in secret
Want you lovin' on me all four seasons
Baby, tell me who we think we're pleasin'
I wanna be with you

Baby, they don't get us, never had this love before
I wish they know just how I felt, think they'd be ready to adore you
How could they call this bad love when all I want is more?
When all I want is more?

It's gettin' heavy
Oh, I can see it on your face
Oh, if you let me
Then I will love you all over the place

They don't really need to know our business
They don't really need to know what we do
They don't really need to know where we go
When it's just me and you
Got you touchin' on me all in secret
Want you lovin' on me all four seasons
Baby tell me who we think we're pleasin'
I wanna be with you

Baby, they don't get us, never had this love before
I wish they know just how I felt, think they'd be ready to adore you
How could they call this bad love when all I want is more?
When all I want is more?

Baby, it's no secret, we can't hide it anymore
I wish they know just how I felt, oh don't they know that I adore you?
How could they call this bad love when all I want is more?
When all I want is more?

More, more, more, more, more-ore
I'm addicted to you
More, more, more, more, more-ore
I'm addicted to you

Baby, they don't get us, never had this love before
I wish they know just how I felt, oh I knew that they'd adore you
How could they call this bad love when all I want is more?
When all I want is more?

Baby, it's no secret, we can't hide it anymore
I wish they know just how I felt, oh don't they know that I adore you?
How could they call this bad love when all I want is more?
When all I want is more?
