Game's on, start strong like you got the gift
Blanket on, fully formed, can you handle it?
I can see you sipping while you're thinking so provocative
Slide over, uncover your wish

I'll be your coffee, I'll be your cream
I can be your dirty magazine
I can be your hottie, I'll show you things
That'll make you go, wanting some
When you've tasted me, woo

Well my honey's gone and got you now
You'd be wrong to turn me down, boy now
Bet ya money, money, I'm your type
Do me wrong, do me right

Old kicks, new tricks, baby show me yours
Get you high, get you fixed on my candy store
Everything I'm packing
Is exactly what you're looking for
Slide over, get under my skin

I can be your crazy, I can be your cool
I wanna be your nasty, you wanna be my fool
I can be your hottie, I'll show you things
That'll make you go, wanting some
When you've tasted me

Well my honey's gone and got you now
You'd be wrong to turn me down, boy now
Bet ya money, money, I'm your type
Do me wrong, do me right

My honey's gone and
My honey's gone and
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa

Bounce bounce
Bounce bounce
Bounce bounce
Bounce bounce

Woo

Well, my honey's gone and got you now
You'd be wrong to turn me down, boy now
Bet ya money, money I'm your type
Do me wrong, do me right

Do me right
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa
Do me right
Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa
Do me right
