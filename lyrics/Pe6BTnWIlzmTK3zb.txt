He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything did not turn out as planned
If life's a risk
It's worth a chance
I know where there is faith
There's always hope

They'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
The ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lavish stage
Taking our first step down a new road

Arhys' time is running out
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation
When you stand for your beliefs

When the man in the mirror
Takes a long, hard look at me
Will the person staring back
Be the man I want to be

Change my mind
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine
Open eyes
Help me see which choice
Is right
