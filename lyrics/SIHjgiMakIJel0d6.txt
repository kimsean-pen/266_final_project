Looking for a penny on an empty beach
I've been looking for a lover who has eyes to see
While I'm here, I wanna walk with you
Hold your hand
In the sun
In the sun
In the sun

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns and with it
Something inside me

Looking for a way to leave the world today
But the world is gonna leave us all anyway
While I'm here, I wanna walk with you
And hold your hand
In the sun
In the sun

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns and with it
Something inside me

Together, together, together
In the sun
I need to get clean
I need, I need, I need

Turquoise is the color I need to get clean
The forest burns and with it
Something inside me
