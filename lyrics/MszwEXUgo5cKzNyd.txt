I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder,
In any other summer
Could you be a part time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day

When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up
And you don't need even to worry about your weight cause

We can all be loved the way that god made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up

Cause you would always tell me I was away too much

Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake

So say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina

Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina

Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now?

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone

Watching blue planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we was two rabbits
And then you'd vanish

Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand but I can't help

I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications

And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'd have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina

Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now?

Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own

Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back
Go oh won't you leave me now?
Ooh

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
(Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own)
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
(Sing that song)
Oh won't you leave me now?
(Go oh won't you leave me now?)
And I've been living on the road Nina, oh

(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina
(But you can't mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina
(Take it back)
Oh won't you leave me now?
(Go oh won't you leave me now?)
Now?

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
(Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own)
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
(Sing that song)
Oh won't you leave me now?
(Go oh won't you leave me now?)
And I've been living on the road Nina (I've been living on the road)
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina (then again you should know)
(But you can't mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina (cause that's you and me both)
(Take it back)
Oh won't you leave me now?
(Go oh won't you leave me now?)
Now?
