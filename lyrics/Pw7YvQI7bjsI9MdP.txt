So stand the fuck up
Show me that this life is worth living
Oh take this day and call it your own
This is your chance to redeem yourself

In a world where every single day counts
The clock strikes twelve and I'm still in bed
Staring at the ceiling
Will I ever amount to anything?

The inevitability of life
And the calamities of this world
Fuck
I will never know

I will never know
I will never know

Is there a purpose in this life to be fulfilled?
Is there a way to make sense of a life that will one day end?
Will anything I do be remembered?
Will these words live to be read by the eyes of a new generation?
By the eyes of a new generation?
By the eyes of a new generation?

I will be there for, for you I will be there
Pick your fucking self up and realise that one day you will be a memory
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Dust to dust

So stand the fuck up
Show me that this life is worth living
Oh take this day and call it your own
This is your chance to redeem yourself
This is your chance to redeem yourself

I will never know
I will never know
