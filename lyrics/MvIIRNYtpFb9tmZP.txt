Poke a hole in a zip lock bag to let water drip
Cause I wanna watch something
Hit me so hard that the bruise gets dark
Leave me pained for a few more bars

The dark red in the negative space
Guide my hand across your face
Till I find the spots that crease when you feel safe and pleased
I'm trying to be cool-
