You look pretty good today
Is it me or did you shave?
Good, you've been looking at me twice as more
So I can see your face
You sit across from me, in the classroom
But do you even know my name?
If you want to ask me how I am
Don't hestitate

'Cause you're my
Cru cru crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay 'cause you make my heart
An art class
An art class

Why do you always stick to smiling
And sit still being so quiet?
I've been pretty distracted for some days
And it's ruining my diet
If you don't take the hint already
I'm afraid I'll start a riot
'Cause you make my whole world go crazy
Yeah your smell just sends me flying

'Cause you're my
cru cru crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay 'cause you make my heart
An art class
An art class

All my days
Been trying to find a reason to stay
Say my name
And I'll go ahead and pick a date
I'm okay
If you understand that this is fate
Art class
Art class
Art class
Art class
