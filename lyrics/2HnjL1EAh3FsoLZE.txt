Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
I wanna do it
Let's draw straws
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man

Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare

That he will cook him rare
Wheeee!

I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he anwers
Sandy Claws will be no more

You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces

And the Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie id the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased by our success

That he'll reward us too, I bet

Perhaps he'll make his special brew

Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

I'm not the dumb one

You're no fun

Shut up!

Make me

I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide

Until his curiousity

Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key
