I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my heart.
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my foolish heart.

21 and it ain't no fun,
My life's going by but it's just begun.
I'm searchin' and searchin' and I'm lookin' around,
Ain't gonna cry cuz there's no one to be found.

I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my heart.
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my foolish heart.

Took ya down to the avenue,
Weather was cool, so I bought you some food.
But I got so nervous when you asked me to come home,
Went in my house and spent the night all alone.

I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my heart.
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my foolish heart.

I know, when you're a pretender,
Your mind's wild from the start.
Just gimme one chance baby,
Help me shadow my heart.
Gimme one chance baby,
Help me shatter my heart.

Just won't cry cuz my life's goin' by,
I'll find someone before the day I die.
Gimme a chance and show me what to do,
Couple a minutes I'll be doing' it with you.

I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my heart.
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
Need somebody help me shatter my foolish heart.
I'm a pretender [x6]
Stand up pretender,
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
I'm a pretender at the game of love,
I'm a pretender.
