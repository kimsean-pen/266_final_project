Dance

Do the D.A.N.C.E.
1, 2, 3, 4, fight
Stick to the B.E.A.T.
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P.Y.T.
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A.B.C.
That's how you make it right

Do the D.A.N.C.E.
Stick to the B.E.A.T.
Just easy as A.B.C.
Do the dance, do the dance

The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance, do the dance
You're always there for music and me

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance

As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me

Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance, do the dance
You're always there for music and me

Man up, Hold tight
Driving dark
Do the dance, do the dance
Head up, Foot down
Speed of sound
The way you move is a mystery
Time's up, Kick start
Keep on track
Do the dance, do the dance
Flags out, Sit back
Safe and sound
You're always there for music and me
