You stand here in my place
Feel the warmth upon your face
Stand back and start to smile
You now have time, you now have will

I would never want to leave this country
Where rules are fast and knowledge easy
I would never want to take you with me
Unless you're open and trust my hand

I would never wish this much on you
When what you have might be enough
I would never want to drive that fast
Unless you're ready, willing, happy

Take me away from these simple feelings
I know there's places on the other sides of here
Take me away from these simple feelings
I know I'll take that car and drive there faster

I would never want to take you with me
Until you're open and grab my hand
I would never wish this much on you
Until you like to live that fast

You stand here in my place
Feel the warmth upon your face
Stand back and start to smile
You now have time, you now have will

I would never want to do that to you
To take you far and leave you stranded
I have never gone quite far enough
But you can get off whenever you like

Take me away from these simple feelings
I know theres places on the other sides of here
Take me away from these simple feelings
I know I'll take that car and drive there faster

I would never want to do that to you
I would never want to drive that fast
I would never want to do that to you
I would never want to drive that fast
