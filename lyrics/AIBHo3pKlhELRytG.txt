You-hoo-hoo
you've been gone for so long

I'm losing sleep
look at what you're doing!
And I-hi-hi
yes
I know that I was wrong

but I couldn't see
see what I was losing.

Come back now
baby
little run-around
little run-around

Little lost and found
little lost and found
yeah!
Don't make me crazy

Just bring your body back home
right here where you belong.

Whoa
building a bridge to your heart

Whoa
ler's make a new start
build a bridge to your heart.

I don't know what the future's gonna be
good or bad

time won't be your saviour.
And I can't give you no written guarantee

I won't make you sad
but I'll be on my best behaviour.

Look what you're doing when you put me down

when you put me down

Made me the clown
made me the clown
yeah!
Look what you're doing

Just come on over and see just how much lovin's in me
yeah!
Whoa
building a bridge to your heart

Listen, I'll take you any way I can tonight

come back and satisfy my appetite.
You gotta know you mean thar much to me

To get you back
you know
I'll do anything.

Come back now
baby
just bring your body back home

Right here now
baby
where you belong.
Whoa
building a bridge to your heart

Whoa
building a bridge to your heart
