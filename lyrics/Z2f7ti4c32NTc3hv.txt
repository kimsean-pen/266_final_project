Went to a party
I danced all night
I drank sixteen beers
And I started up a fight

But now I am jaded
You're out of luck
I'm rolling down the stairs
Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk to fuck

I love your stories
I like your gun
Shooting out truck tires
Sounds like loads and loads of fun

But in my room
Wish you were dead
You ball like the baby
In Eraserhead

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk to fuck

Too drunk to fuck
Hmm
Too drunk to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk to fuck

Oh je suis trop bourr√©e
Pour baiser
