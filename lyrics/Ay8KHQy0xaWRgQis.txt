(Verse)
Static when we touch
So magnetic when we love
Inside there is a rush
So you're bloody
Don't pull the plug

(Bridge)
Love it when you make a difference
Don't be afraid of the distance
I don't wanna lose the frequency
I don't wanna let the feeling leave
Rise away to hit the landing
Get the sounds of the space and
I don't wanna lose my frequency
I don't wanna let the feeling leave

(Chorus)
Tell me your first sign of love
(Tell me your first sign of love)
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, til you get it right (til I get my...)
I can feel it near, frequency is real
Way you turn me on

(Verse)
Vibrations set the tone
Stimulation makes it flow
Your signals find a hard room
Send a message, make it known

(Bridge)
Love it when you make a difference
Don't be afraid of the distance
I don't wanna lose the frequency
I don't wanna let the feeling leave
Rise away to hit the landing
Get the sounds of the space and
I don't wanna lose my frequency
I don't wanna let the feeling leave

(Chorus x2)
Turn it on, first sign of love
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, til you get it right
I can feel it near, frequency is real
Way you turn me on
