Cloudy covered mood
I'm not feeling all too great
If I was feelin you before
I'm not feeling you today
Or any other day
In my feelings
That ok
I don't need you to say
Cloudy covered mood
I'm not feeling all too great
If I was feelin you before
I'm not feeling you today
Or any other day
In my feelings
That ok
I don't need you to say
Cloudy covered mood
I'm not feeling all too great
If I was feelin you before
I'm not feeling you today
Or any other day
In my feelings
That ok
I don't need you to say
Moving over slow
There's a lot weighing on my mind
I got things to think about
And I don't have that thinking time
Every second counts
Even when it's time well spent
It's 2 cents on the dime
And I missed out paying rent
Give me what I need
And I need it straight away
I don't have no time for you
I'm not out to waste my day
Moving over slow
There's a lot weighing on my mind
I got things to think about
And I don't have that thinking time
Cloudy covered mood
I'm not feeling all too great
If I was feelin you before
I'm not feeling you today
Or any other day
In my feelings
That ok
I don't need you to say
Cloudy covered mood
I'm not feeling all too great
If I was feelin you before
I'm not feeling you today
Or any other day
In my feelings
That ok
I don't need you to say
