she touched
my arm
and smiled

one of these days soon: very soon

love you til then
love you til then
feel my breath
on your neck
and your heart will race

don't say no to me
you can't say no to me
i won't see you
denied

i'm sorry you saw that
i'm sorry he did it

an echo

a stain...

a stain...

i can't say no to you
i can't say no to you
say nothing

freefalling
