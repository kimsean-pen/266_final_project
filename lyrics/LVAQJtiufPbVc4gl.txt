I'm home alone tonight
Full moon illuminates my room and sends my mind aflight
I think I was dreaming up some thoughts that were seemingly
Possible with you

And so I call you on the tin can phone
We rendezvous at a quarter-two and make sure we're alone
I think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free

When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away
Making sure to laugh while we experience anti-gravity
Anti-gravity, anti-gravity

For years, I kept it to myself
Now potentialities are bound and living under my shelf
Simply, choose your destination from the diamond canopy
And we'll be there

And so I call you on the tin can phone
We rendezvous at a quarter-two and make sure we're alone
I think I've found the way for you and I to finally be free

When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away
Making sure to laugh while we experience anti-gravity
Anti-gravity, anti-gravity, oh yeah

Anti-gravity, anti-gravity, oh yeah
