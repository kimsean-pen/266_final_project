Time's gone inside out
Time get's distorted with
This intense gravity

I don't got time for holy rollers
But then they wash my feet
And I won't be their soldier

There's intense gravity
Yeah, there's intense gravity
I'm just your satellite
I'm just your satellite

Ooh, and I know that time's gone inside out
And now it's only like we told you
Mmm, oh then they wash my feet
They do not make me complete

Break out a character for me
Time keeps on going when
We got nothing else to give
We got nothing else to give

Ooh, cause our time's gone inside out
I don't make time for holy rollers
Mmm, there's only you I need
They do not make me complete
