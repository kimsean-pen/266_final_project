So called Mr. Rock & Roll
Is dancing on his own again
Talking on his phone again
To someone who tells him
That his balance is low
He's got nowhere to go
He's on his own again

Rock chick of the century
Is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no one there
Before she ever seemed to care
Now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I knew you
I wish I knew you before"

Mrs. Black and White
She's never seen a shade of gray
Always something on her mind
Every single day
But now she's lost her way
And where does she go from here?

Mr. Multicultural
Sees all that one could see
He's living proof of someone
Very different to me
But now he wants to be free
Free so he can see

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I knew you
I wish I knew you before"

He'll say, "Me, I wish I knew you
I wish I met you when time was still on my side"
She'll say, "Me, I wish I knew you
I wish I loved you before I was his bride"

And so they must depart
Too many more broken hearts
But I've seen that all before
In TV, books and film and more
And there's a happy ending
Every single day

And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I was something more"
And they'll meet one day far away
And say, "Me, I wish I knew you
I wish I knew you before"
