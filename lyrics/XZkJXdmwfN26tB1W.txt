Oh, now
Does it feel alright?
I got back on the wall
Just to see how it comes to the light again

Somehow
When you feel alright
You step back when you fall
Just to see how it comes to the light again

'Cause it never wants to fade

I've seen the light in you, before
I've seen the light

I've seen the light in you, before
I see the light again

Oh, oh
Does it feel alright?
I stood back on the wall
Just to see that you come to the light again

And the sun won't go
Back to where it belongs
Don't have too far to fall
If you'll see that it's only the night again

'Cause it never wants to fade

I've seen the light in you, before
I've seen the light

I've seen the light in you, before
I see the light again

Oh, oh
I see the light
Oh, oh
I see the light in you
Oh, oh
