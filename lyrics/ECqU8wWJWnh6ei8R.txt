You're writing letters to me
You're waiting for a reply
Obsession makes you feel weak
It makes you turn a blind eye
I'm your new fantasy
I'm all you wanna be
You're mister no good
Love unconditionally

Sweet fascination
Is taking over you
Just like you want it to
Infatuation
It makes the lonely feel
That the illusions real

You're like a hammer to me
You drive it down on my head
It doesn't feel right
I don't like all the fanfare
I know you're watching me
But it can never be
You're mister no good
Love unconditionally

Sweet fascination
Is taking over you
Just like you want it to
Infatuation
It makes the lonely feel
That the illusions real

Sweet fascination
Is taking over you
Just like you want it to
Infatuation
It makes the lonely feel
That the illusions real
Sweet fascination
Sweet fascination
