I'm no good for you
I'm not what you need
You've made it very clear
Though I disagree

Enough to let you go
To let you drift away
'Cause once you navigate these troubled waters
I believe that someday you'll return

And I will still be here
When you come up for air
Do what you gotta do
I'll wait for you to come up for air

'Cause in this whole wide world
There's no one else for me
So while you search the seas for answers
I will still be waiting here

Make sure you dive down deep
Because if you do
Even though it takes a thousand lifetimes
My love, I know you're finally gonna see the truth and you'll return

And I will still be here
When you come up for air
Do what you gotta do
I'll wait for you to come up for air

And even if this really is the end
I'm sure I'll be alone until I'm dead
'Cause no one else will ever quite compare
To them it wouldn't be fair

To let you with somebody new
And all I did was think of you
If you're my Jack then I'm your Rose
And I promise I'll never ever let go

And I'll still be here
When you come up for air
Do what you gotta do
I'll wait for you to come up for air

Come up for air
Come up for air
To come up for air
Come up for air
Come up for air
To come up for air
