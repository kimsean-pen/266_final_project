Wait up
Don't wanna wait up for you, baby, still I wait up
Lonely in the canyon
No love
There's no love reflecting in the glow of
Million dollar man

Show me your cut baby, come clean
Come out of your smokescreen
If you really love me
Open my eyes babe, you burned me
Your kiss is salty
Chlorine

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh baby, I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh baby, I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end

Hold on
Don't wanna hold on if you let go, I can't go on
It takes two to dance

Show me your cut baby, come clean
Come out of your smokescreen
If you really love me
Open my eyes babe, you burned me
Your kiss is salty
Chlorine

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh baby, I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh baby, I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end

I'm in it
I'm in it
I was only gonna touch ya, now I'm in it
I'm in it
Swimming in it
I wasn't gonna love you now
I'm so fucking deep in it
I think I feel another wave, another wave
I'm diving in, I'm diving in it anyway
I'm in it
I'm in it
I was only gonna touch ya, now I'm in it

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end

Swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
Know where you've been
In the deep end
