There was a time my world belong with you
But I was so misguided in our youth
I couldn't help but drink this poison brew
You had a strange perception of the truth

Oh, baby, I remember you
Oh baby, I remember you
'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea

The tempest rise, it stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony
I was aware that danger lay ahead
And I couldn't bare this stranger in my head
Well, you've got a face (you've got a face)
Well, you've got a soul
Oh, he ain't got nothing
Not even our hope
I give it a try a long time ago

And your face was designed

But you didn't know
Oh, baby, I remember you
'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea

The tempest rise, it stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony
'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never hear or feel the crashing of the sea
The tempest rise, that stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony
