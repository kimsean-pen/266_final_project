I didn't see it coming
The kiss was so unpredictable
And maybe it's the mystery
In you that I'm addicted to it
It's overrated knowing somebody so well it takes away the fire

It's funny when you tell me you don't think you're all that interesting
I beg to differ, with you
I'm out here on the edge of my seat
And every minute guessing,
Holding my breath and fueling that fire

And baby you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark, shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card

I'm an unexpected dreamer
Just watching through my every day
You don't follow any leader
You make your mark, and make a change
You could see that I was loving, oh
But baby now I'm living the life, yeah
You can blame it on the gravity
The reason that I'm falling
But the truth is I would jump
And girl you're everything I've wanted
It's a revelation, yeah, kind of elevation
Learning to fly

And baby you're my wild card
My perfect little twist of fate
You're my first spark shot in the dark
Favorite part of everything
And baby you're a sweet surprise
Lucky like a shooting star
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card

You're my wild card
Got me happy like a holiday
How in the blue been waiting on you praying for your everyday

And baby you're a sweet surprise
Looking like a superstar
You're a strong, free, just what I need, wild card
Oh baby
All I need
All I need
You're my wildcard
Baby, you're my wild card
You're my wildcard
Baby, you're my wild card
