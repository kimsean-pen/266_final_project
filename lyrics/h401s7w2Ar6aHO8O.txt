I'm losing touch with my reality, I hate this.
Chasing ghosts until I black out, it's useless.
Maybe one day your God will judge me.
She'll fuck me. And taste me.

Let's say that I've found the one.
Veins are flowing with her love.

I feel alive. I don't know why I don't know why.
I'm dead inside. I don't know why I don't know why.

I'm dead inside.
I close my eyes, I see the light.
This over, over... Overdose.

Searching for release to take the pain away again.
Losing sleep I think I might be addicted.
Maybe one day I'll meet your maker.
I'll smile, and thank her.

I feel alive. I don't know why I don't know why.
I'm dead inside. I don't know why I don't know why.

I'm dead inside.
I close my eyes, I see the light.
This over, over... Overdose.

There's no denying I've torn apart my insides.
What I've done, can't be undone.
Took things too far and now I've lost my fucking mind.
You left me... You left me dead inside!
Dead Inside!
Dead Inside!

I feel alive. I don't know why I don't know why.
I'm dead inside. I don't know why I don't know why.

I'm dead inside.
I close my eyes, I see the light.
This over, over... Overdose
Dead Inside!
Dead Inside!
