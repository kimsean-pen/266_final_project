I got some fucked up teeth
I'm lookin' ugly as hell
No lie, hands down, ain't nothing you could say to change it
I'm lookin' ugly as hell right now
But I love you, you mean everything to me
And I know I ain't speakin' that loud in them other one
'Cause I'm a dumbass and I be talkin' low
That's me though, that's me
But anyways...
Fuck the haters, I love you
Can't wait to be with you
I know it's late and them other videos dumb as hell
And I look dumb as hell, sound dumb as hell, look ugly as fuck
You know that how it goes
And I know you tryna tell me
I hope so
Shit, but it's small, you know that
But anyways, I love you
You mean everything to me
You're my world
