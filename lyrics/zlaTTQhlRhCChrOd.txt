I miss the way you sing low
So I can't hear your voice over
The radio in my car
But you know every word they say
You knew you just the right thing to say of
Distance ripped us farther and farther and farther away
I'll see you soon

If you're coming back this way again
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention

Maybe I fell too fast
Maybe I pushed you away
Now you're gone and I'm afriad
That you're never coming back this way again (should be way not away)

I'll see you soon
If you'll come back here
I'll see you soon
Just say that you want to see me too

Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
We starve for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida
Are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention

You know I won't mind if you
Monopolize all my time
I won't say a thing at all
I won't say a word no

So come back from California
Come back from California
