In another time
There were people here
And it felt so real
'Til it disappeared
There's a wave that breaks
On tomorrow's shore
You can see it now
It's coming
To catch you dreaming

We've done nothing wrong
It's just who we are
No need to apologize
Work it out this way

All the paths are gone
Tracks we left behind
Left forever in
Shifting sands of time
In the heat of sun
As we come undone
If I look at you
It's only
To catch you dreaming

We've done nothing wrong
It's just who we are
No need to apologize
Work it out this way

We've done nothing wrong
It's just who we are
No need to apologize
Work it out this way

We've done nothing wrong
It's just who we are
No need to apologize
Work it out this way

We've done nothing wrong
It's just who we are
No need to apologize
Work it out this way
