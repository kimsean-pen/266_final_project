Jesus, babe!
Can't you hear me cryin'
Ain't it enough?
I'm alone in the night
It don't matter what you've done
I just want my life back, for a while
Is it too much to ask?

The book marks the page
Sittin' out in the room
The alters of candles
Castin' shadows on you
I see the bed in the dark
I could just sleep
I could just sleep

And hear me babe
When I don't want to say it
See it through
I'm back home and stayin'
I can't be alone any more
And I don't blame you
Or pretend to know
The right thing to do

Late afternoon
And the knocks on the door
Fist through the wall
Wipe the blood off the floor
And I can see in the dark
Even still
I can see in the dark
Even still

Well I waited for you
All the thoughts twist around
The visions of you
Get lost in the clouds
What now?

Jesus, babe!
Can't you hear me cryin'
Ain't it enough?
I'm alone in the night
I don't care what you've done
I just want my life back
For now

Late afternoon
And the locks on the door
A ship through the fog
Sweep the mess from the floor
I can see the bed in the dark
And I can could just sleep
I could just sleep
