Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

Taken down
In deep Brazil
Long before this time

Found his way to Louisville
Where he was ripped apart
And sailed across the sea
To start again

Where the line falls straight across his soul
Then a nail pierced through his bone

Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

Go far
So far away they tell you
Reach for across the sky to let them part

I built this table all by myself
I went through hell and it didn't help
That I smoked a couple cigarettes

Didn't sleep for seven days
The coffee was too strong
