We got problems
We got pain
We got issues
We're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day

Pills to stay up
Pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days

I bought a six pack of freedom
Ten pack of pride
Losing the streets, and I'm feeling alive
Cigars and Sinatra
Sparking some flames
Killing me softly
Kiss me again
If you don't know now you know
Wheels keep spinning
If you don't know now you know
Champagne killin
(Sittin' on the hood of my Chevy singing)

We got problems
We got pain
We got issues
We're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day

Pills to stay up
Pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days
Happy days

[?] papers got me straight in my zone
If you don't know now you know
Wheels keep spinning
If you don't know now you know
Champagne killin
(Sittin' on the hood of chevy singing)

We got problems
We got pain
We got issues
We're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day

Pills to stay up
Pills to sleep
Pill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days
Happy days
(Sittin' on the hood of chevy chevy)

Do it for the love, and make you feel good
Steady goin up, and make you feel good
Rain, rain, go away
Just bring me my happy days
Do it for the love, and make you feel good
Steady goin up, and make you feel good
Rain, rain, go away
Just bring me my happy days

Sittin' on the hood of chevy chevy
Sittin' on the hood of my chevvy chevvy

Sittin' on the hood of chevy chevy
Sittin' on the hood of my chevvy chevvy
Bout to to roll up something heavy heavy
