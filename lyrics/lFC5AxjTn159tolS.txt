It was something that I read in a book
About a gang of bandits around a prairie fire
One was going to empty his gun
Into a sleeping man because he snored too loud
Then another one stopped him there
With the tale of two sailors in a smuggler's boat
And the sailors were plenty scared
They saw a dark shape swimming up the Strait of Hormuz

If it was violent
Cause if it's violent, it's understood
And if it's violent
It's all violent

The sailor tried to calm his friend
With a tale of a couple in an apartment
Where the husband was slowly poisoning his wife
His wife was telling night tales to their child
About city cats and country mice
And how the dogs in charge would eat their young
And while they fought each other tooth and claw
The suburban rats would fall down and laugh

If it was violent
Cause if it's violent, it's understood
And if it's violent
It's all violent
