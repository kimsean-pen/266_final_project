I fell into the street, poison in my veins
Clamber to my feet and into the night again
Back to my home, back to my owner
Who screams at my tardiness
Put his hands to the sky

And says, what can I do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?

In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine

And what can you do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?

Put his hand on my shirt
Hand on my face
Head to the wall
When you've broken your only doll

And what will you do with a girl
If she refuses to be alive?

And you've broken your only doll
And what will you do with a girl
If she's refusing to be alive?

there's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
And a garden of such beauty
That the flower seem to grin

there's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I live my life regretting
That I never jumped in

there's a boy across the river
With short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover
And I want to be his peer

there's a boy across the river
But alas I cannot swim
Now I never will get to put
My arms around him

There's a life across the river
That was meant for me
Instead I live my life in constant misery

There's a life across the river
But I do not see
Why I should please those
Who will never be pleased

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
There is gold across the river
But I don't want none

Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
I would rather be tried
Than held up by a golden gun

Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
