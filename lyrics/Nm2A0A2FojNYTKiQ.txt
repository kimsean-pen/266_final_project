I'm not a man, I'm a machine
Chisel me down until I am clean
I buy books, I never read
And then I'll tell you some more about me

Beneath the concrete there's a sound
A muffled cry below the ground
There is a poison in the air
A mix of chemicals and fear

Manners are just hunches
I'm not sure what they mean
You're asking for commitment
When I'm somewhere in between

Never, never try to gauge temperature
When you tend to travel
At such speed
It's our velocity

Is it cold where you are
This time of the year?
You didn't leave a scar

I've seen that numbers hit a screen
And you're expected to know what they mean
Throughout the conflict I was serene
I can't outrun the sadness I've seen

Are you willing to resist
The people you've never met?
The devil's wheel revolves
But it needs to be reset

Never, never try to gauge temperature
When you tend to travel
At such speed
It's our velocity

Please tell me is it cold
Where you are this time of the year?
You didn't leave a scar

I've got no one to call
In the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone
With these thoughts

I've got no one to call
In the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone
With my thoughts

I watched a film to change my feelings
Strong enough to bear a burden
If everyone became this sensitive
I wouldn't have to be so sensitive

If everyone became so sensitive
Perhaps I wouldn't be so sensitive

Love is a lie
Which means I've been lied to
Love is a lie
Which means I've been lying too

Love is a lie
Which means I've been lied to
Love is a lie
I've got no one to call
In the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone
With these thoughts
I've got no one to call
In the middle of the night anymore
I'm just alone
With my thoughts
Never, never try to gauge temperature
When you tend to travel
At such speed
It's our velocity
