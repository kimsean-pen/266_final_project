I gotta get me a grip and be strong.
Gotta show I can rip, moving on.
As I trembling, It's not ending.
Gotta avoid to make slips and meet nongs.

'Cause I want it, yeah I wanna live my life.
I wanna live my life in this world.
And I need it, yes I need it,
yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth.

I gotta learn to say NO, disallow.
Well, it's my turn to go pro, right about now.
I've been fading for too long, degrading.
I gotta earn me some dough, this is how.

'Cause I want it, yeah I wanna live my life.
I wanna live my life in this world.
And I need it, yes I need it,
yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth.

At 23, I was far from feeling free.
At 24, my life was a big bore.
Now I'm 25 and I'm still not high,
yeah, I'm 25 but still alive.
I'll never give up until I reach my goal, until I reach my goal...
Controlling body and soul.

Yeah I want it, yeah I wanna live my life.
I wanna live my life in this world.
And I need it, yes I need it,
yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth.
