I take what I can get
You were the only part of me that I could ever like
And all you take from me
Is time that I misplaced inside the dark the stormy sea

Fire burning tears there hurting
With all I gave to you
To you
All you get is all you give when your feelings meet the
Your feelings meet the thief

Until you lose yourself until you lose yourself o ye

If I could read it through
I'd take my time my own sweet mind and post it back to you
You are you are you are
His soul his fire his own desire
That's burning through and through

Fire burning tears there hurting
With all I gave to you
To you
All you get is all you give when your feelings meet the thief
Your feelings meet the thief
Fire burning tears there hurting
With all I gave to you
All you get is all you give when your feelings meet the
your feelings meet the thief

Here's my hand shake it
There's your smile make it
Now my heart's shaking
but my back's breaking

Here's my hand shake it
There's your smile make it
Now my heart's shaking
but my back's breaking

falling from my high time
making me feel alright
it's what you do to me
it's what you do to me

making me feel all good
tearing what my mind should
it's what you do to me
it's what you do to me
it's what you do to me
it's what you do to me
