Born with eyes
But they are not to see
Living on your knees
Choking on spiritual agony
Follow the traces of blood
Throughout the past centuries
You choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame

You strive for perfection but you don't have the tools
Human weakness embodied
Fodder to fools
Feeding the fear of life it self
Over and over again
And you choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame

So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand
You're the saint and I'm the sinner
No - you will never understand

Born with eyes
But they are not to see
Living on your knees
Choking in agony

Follow the traces of blood
Throughout the past centuries
Still you choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame
So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand.
You're the saint and I'm the sinner?
No! You will never understand!
So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand.
You're the saint and I'm the sinner?
No!!!
