Give me more
Give me more
Give me more

I wanna bring it back
We never carry on
I wanna bring it back
We never carry on
Seize it somehow seize it somehow
Only thing I lose

We hurry on
(Oh)'cuz we are coming to the end
We hurry on
(Year)'cuz we are coming to the end
I know it's me I could be one from millions
I never trust anything to survive

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue flame we are

Can you reach out? Shout it out! you Shout it out!!
Seize it somehow seize it somehow
Only thing I lose

We hurry on
(Year)'cuz we are coming to the end
We hurry on
(Year)'cuz we are coming to the end
I know it's me I could be one from millions
I never trust anything to survive

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue flame we are

I wanna bring it back, we never carry on
Seize it somehow, only thing I lose
Yeah, we hurry on, I could be one from millions

Touch it touch it, don't you know it's just begun
Watch it watch it, make me feel like the man
Break it break it, We can't leave it undone
Kill the sound, you are maybe alive

One, two, three, four, go!

No no, on my own
No no, on my own
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

(No, no)That's all, I'll be all right
(No, no)That's why you take me back
(No, no)That's the price I must pay?
Now moving closer to the blue flame we are

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

(No no) That's all, I'll be all right
(No no) That's why you take me back
(No no) That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue flame we are

We are!
