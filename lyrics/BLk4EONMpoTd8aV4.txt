Night turns to day.
Light takes the whole town.
Smoke fills the skyline one shade of grey.
It makes it hard to see when dust gets in your eyes.
The air too thick to breathe.
Won't make it out alive.

Day turns to nightlife, noise fills my ear holes.
Echoes of a concrete world, deafening sense. Senseless.

I'd give my whole world to find a way out (of here).
Inhale the fumes? Please I might as well drown.
The City grows far beyond what we are now.
I'd give my whole world to find a way out.
