You got a lot of nerve blaming someone else for your mistakes
You got a lot of nerve to bopping up your head
When you can't carry your weight
Yeah, it's a put on
Another late night show
Yeah, it's a put on
Pretending you don't know

The self inflicted wounds
You did 'em on your own
Yeah, you were first to draw the knife
Last to throw the stone
Oh, the trust in me, I have abused
Oh, take mercy on my
Self inflicted wounds

You never get away with trying to tell yourself
One of your own lies
You never get away holding back those tears
Trying not to cry
Darling, hold on
Let me try to explain
Darling, hold on
Tryin' to own all this pain

The self inflicted wounds
I did 'em on my own
I was first to draw the knife
Last to throw the stone
Oh, your trust in me
I have abused
Oh, take mercy on my
Self inflicted wounds

I'm looking for redemption
Love's hallowed ground
I'm praying for forgiveness
And I've searched around
But there's none to be found

Self inflicted wounds
I did 'em on my own
You were the first to draw the knife
Last to draw the stone
Oh, the trust in me, I have abused
Oh, have mercy on my
Self inflicted wounds
Oh, have mercy on my
Self inflicted wounds
