Did you ever feel like you wanna be
someone else for just one day
Did you ever feel like you wanna see
through another pair of eyes
Did you ever think I might wanna be
with anyone else for just one day
Did you ever really think of me
when I walked away

The look the dunks and the bottle of Jack
the smokes the slouch and my eyes back
you think you know what you think you'll find
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but you'll never know what I won't share
coz I don't care, no I don't care
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but I don't care

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish ways
go back to start again
go back to start again

Did you ever feel like you should have said
something smarter at the time
Did you ever feel like you should have kept
it all to yourself
Did you ever think it might be your fault
I never promised anymore
Did you ever think it might not be me
now it was always me

The look the dunks and the bottle of Jack
the smokes the slouch and my eyes back
you think you know what you think you'll find
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but you'll never know what I won't share
coz I don't care, no I don't care
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but I don't care

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish ways
go back to start again

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish ways
go back to start again
go back to start again

The look the dunks and the bottle of Jack
the smokes the slouch and my eyes back
you think you know what you think you'll find
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but you'll never know what I won't share
coz I don't care, no I don't care
you think you'll figure me out tonight
but I don't care

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish ways
go back to start again

And I wonder, if I'm just built this way
coz every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
when it's over, me and my selfish ways
go back to start again
go back to start again
go back to start again
