Well I spent the night in heaven
I wanted to figure it out by myself
I spin around the fortress
You never know the currency that we all run on
We run on
We run on
You once told me
You keep a billion frequencies on your person
End the night with channel four
You don't see me looking you up when I'm here
We live fast 'cause time won't last
See me freezing like the bum I am
From where you start there's endless information drilled into your eyes
Well, I don't need protection
One life begins, another dies
Bad timing
I won't last
Man, that's the facts
It is a feeling that will never pass
And you know you could be taking us far
When I speak to you again through the stages of pleasure
Well, I don't have my own face
So c'mon and be replaced
There's a future that's calling
But I don't see it coming
No, I don't have my own face
So c'mon and be replaced
There's a future that's calling
But I don't see it coming
No, I don't see it coming
No, I don't see it coming
No, I don't see it coming
