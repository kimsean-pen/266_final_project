Well I was walkin' for some time when I came across this sign
Sayin' "Who are you and where are you from? We don't like when visitors come"
"No Trespassing" that's what it said, at least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

Come on!

One day I was trippin' and that's when I could see
That the either I had tapped into could be reality
It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine

Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind
I don't need no sympathy, I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty, and I'll shine when I wanna shine
Make their faces crack
There's no turnin' back
Let's GO!

Wait till ya get a load of me!

I ain't got BS in my bag, that's the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is glass
Come on baby, can't you see?
I don't need no GPS to show me where to go
But I can turn into the North Pole
and show you what is cold

I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine.
Life's my light and liberty, and I'll shine when I wanna shine
Make their faces crack (crack)
There's no turnin' back
Let's go!

No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

Wait till ya get a load of me
I said wait til ya get a load of me

I ain't sittin' at home
I won't waste and rot
I ain't sittin' at home, no
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty, and I'll shine when I wanna shine
