Well, I, I, wanna fly, fly
On the wings, wings of summer
But you, you put your eyes
You put your eyes on mine

Go, perfect your fall
And no matter what
Smile for them all
For today, we see never
Tomorrow's menu reads forever

I, I wanna fly
On the wings of summer
But you, put your eyes on mine
I, I want to fly
On the wings of summer
But you, you put your eyes on mine

Don't confess to the crime
Till you lavish in your concubine
When you think you got clever
They'll wheel you in and pull the lever

Now I, I want to fly
On the wings of summer
But you, put your eyes on mine
Now I, I'm going to fry

'Cause I ran over the guy with a Hummer
But you, put your eyes, eyes on the divine
Now I, I want to fly, fly on the wings of summer
But you, you put your eyes
You put your eyes on mine

When you think that it's all over
They'll clip your wings and make you roll over
To perfect your great fall
No matter what smile for them all

For today we see never
Tomorrow's menu reads forever
For today we see never
Tomorrow's menu reads
