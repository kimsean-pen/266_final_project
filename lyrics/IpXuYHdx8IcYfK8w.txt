Open-hearted as a heart can be
'Cause we're all a ruin like broken leaves
I give you me in oceans of tears up to my knees
Stitched together like pants and sleeves
I carry this carapace worn thin by he and she
Danced to dust and dusk and
Strung along the highway
I found my way, belligerent
Following the stars of your eyes

Promise me you'll cherish
This tarnished offering

And if you take me inside
And you give me a place to hide and cry
I'll bathe you in the crystal light
That sleeps between my thighs
At times you fear the angel's sigh
To the lord and heavens that this ain't right
But in this chalice you'll find the wine
Our hands hold bonfires burning bright
And the heart is dumb and the heart is blind
But I think you'll find that the lord is kind
And I pray you'll cherish this tarnished offering
Burnt silver brushed lavender offspring

Promise me you'll cherish
This tarnished offering

Burnt silver brushed lavender offpsring
Sprung from me when first we kissed
You held me quietly, a rush purged me of my past
Opened a desert of diamonds vast, glinting
And a tiny chorus of swallows
Swung open the door freed the caged bees and wallows swarm
Geometric patterns on the sun
Eclipse, new moon
Tempt my werewolf not to run
Tempt my werewolf not to run
