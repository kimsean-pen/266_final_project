Since we're feeling so anaesthetized
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine (see you at the bitter end)
Love has seen you run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
And I'd whine out (see you at the bitter end)
Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down in six weeks' time
The mess you left will end (see you at the bitter end)
