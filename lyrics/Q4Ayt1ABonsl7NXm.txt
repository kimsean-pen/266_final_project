I wanna carve this moment out
Right
I wanna leave us all in doubt
At least I'm better than last week
This one ordeal
I have to go for a while
I wanna slip out there again
Would play nice with you
Write down for me:
What you got is gone
Just getting through
Each day the same
Same as always
Never meant to forget
Ever let to believe
Ooh they don't know
They don't know
What fools are we
An elixir of light
You're reciting the words
Ooh they don't know
They don't know you
In the wake of your life
It comes back again
You will see them in the end
And the story in her eyes
Was told a thousand times
You just never cared to listen
I got a picture of you two laughing
And I can tell which one is you
It's in the shadows of your mouth
It's in my dream
I found you out
Same as always
Never meant to forget
Ever let to believe
Ooh they don't know
They don't know
What fools are we
An elixir of light
You're reciting the words
Ooh they don't know
They don't know you
In the wake of your life
It comes back again
You will see them in the end
And the story in her eyes
Was told a thousand times
You just never cared to listen
