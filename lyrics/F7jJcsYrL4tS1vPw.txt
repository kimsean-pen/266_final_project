She's a free-wheeling lady baby high-strung well-off (C'mon)
She's a free-wheeling lady baby high-strung well-off
In the brains and she means way well
She's a little bit skinny mini girl child old soul
She grown up real well
She'll chew you out if you deserve it man
But I kinda like it and I really love her
She's a wild kind of muskrat, scrappy mofo
Stay that way baby girl and I love you so
Never gonna let her go, no no no

She got a wild brain, but so do I sometimes
And I don't know why, you gotta die
She wanna, clean up the world but I'm drowning in dirt
I wanna clean up the world, but I can't
I wanna, give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind (alright, woah alright)

She's a skinny little, scrappy little, wild talking, all good, always means well, baby girl, dandelion, flower child
All substance, no jive talkin', fast walkin', girl babe
You might wanna, roll her up in a ball
And eat her in a sandwich, but it's mine man
She's a sweet talkin' honey in the raw
Flaming fast jaw flappin' woo!
Bees buzzing baby, we'll buzz awhile
It's a big old bulbous world at a boiling point
But she's always right there
She gets in your hair like bubblegum
But you love it and you need some schooling
Babe I'm the record man, yeah (Fuck!)

She's a skinny mini little baby girl child
All fast walkin' no jive talkin' baby
She's a real wild card you know and I know you know man
I wanna give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind

She make me cross my I's and dot my T's if you know what I mean
