To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile

to know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him

to know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do

You know I do
Why can't he see?
How blind can he be?
Someday he'll see
That he was meant for me, oh oh yeah
To know know know him
Is to love love love him

Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile
to know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I really do
And I do
