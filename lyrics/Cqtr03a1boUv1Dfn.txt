Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less

And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The doctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less

Unless, unless
I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired
Of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real

Oh yes, I'm stressed
I'm sorry I digress
Impressed, you dressed to S.O.S.

Oooooh and my parents love me
Oooooh and my girlfriend loves me
Oooooh

Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less

And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that you're a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less

Unless unless
I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick I'm tired
Of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real

Oh yes, I'm stressed
I'm sorry I digress
Impressed, you dressed to S.O.S.

Oooooh and my parents love me
Oooooh and my girlfriend loves me
Oooooh they keep photos of me
Oooooh that's enough love for me
Oooooh

Oooooh and my parents love me
Oooooh and my girlfriend loves me
Oooooh they keep photos of me
Oooooh that's enough love for me
Oooooh
