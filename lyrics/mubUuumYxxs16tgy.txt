So he tried to put the fire out
But you used gasoline
When the congregation gathered around
You screamin' "it wasn't me,"
So there is a sickness that's going around
But no one's got a vaccine
I think it drowned in holy water
I think it's time we all come clean

I swear it's like dying
To catch a ghost
It feels like I'm trying
To hold smoke
I swear it's like dying
To catch a ghost
It feels like I'm trying
To hold smoke

When the army had to hold the line
You were nowhere near the front
Before the kids could tell their dog goodbye
You were loadin' up your gun

I want to know what is the great divide
I wanna know what I've become
You think that no one else is lonesome?
You think that you're the only one?
It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
I'm trying to find a way
It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
It feels like I'm jumping towards a train
But I'm trying to find a way
