I guess I should tell her I'm sorry
I never showed up to the party
Yeah, I got into a misunderstanding
With her old boyfriend named Charlie

Yeah, I love, I love my Juliette
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

But tell your man I ain't afraid to die

When I first met her I fell in love
And she smiled because she knew
We were day drinking in Brooklyn
It was death in the afternoon, yeah

I love, I love my Juliette
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

Charlie's army's coming for me
Charlie's army's coming for me
He says, "Boy, you're gonna be sorry"
Charlie's army's coming for me

Tell your man I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capitol crime
Tell your man I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capitol crime

I'm not gonna tell him I'm sorry
'Cause it's me and her after the party
No need for a misunderstanding
'Cause nothing's gonna change my mind, yeah

I love, I love my Juliette
But her ex-boyfriend wants me dead

Charlie's army's coming for me
Charlie's army's coming for me
He says, "Boy, you're gonna be sorry"
Charlie's army's coming for me

Tell your man I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capitol crime
Tell your man I ain't afraid to die
If loving Julie is a capitol crime
