Magpgies on fire
making love like little
worms out on the porch can
leave the medicine
oh well I'm game,
for anything at all
Scarecrows a liar
spends the year alone
no one checked it out
to see if it was real
sold you the moon
and now it's time to fall
all in all it's like the
bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
love

What more do you want?
how much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
all in all it's just
a call of something wise beyond your room

There's a changing of a major chord
your minor threat will do, love
my gun misfired
shot myself instead i guess
i always knew id be the one to lose
last scream dont slane
time to make a move

What more do you want?
how much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
all in all it's like the
bird trapped inside the cage
love
A bird bout half your age, girl
a bird who's never really here to say

What more do you want?
how much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
least of all she's like
a bird who's now been
freed from someones cage
