Dear Marie, I would love to
Meet your family, oh, oh
I would love to meet your mum
Dear Marie, I've been waiting
For this moment all my life
I've been waiting for this night

The silver clouds are a-rollin'
And the moon wakes up
To chase the sun
And the turquoise sea
Goes flowin' on
And, Marie, I would love
To meet your mum

Oh, dear Marie, do you see
Yourself as clearly as I do?
Take a walk inside my shoes
Oh, dear Marie, you done gave
Me love and stripped me of my cool
You done thrown me in the pool

And the nightingales are a-singin'
And the whole entire
World is on the run
And the river Nile goes flowin' on
And, Marie, I would love
To meet your mum

Oh, love me, love me
Oh, Marie, yeah
To meet your mum

Oh, the silver clouds are a-rollin'
And the moon wakes
Uup to chase the sun
And the turquoise sea
Goes flowin' on
And, Marie, I would love
To meet your mum
