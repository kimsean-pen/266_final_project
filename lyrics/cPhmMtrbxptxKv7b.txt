1. Deceit

For many years I put my trust in you
Perceiving the vows I took that were true
Only to learn all had been lost to you

To search for meanings not truly there
Answers to questions only bring despair
Distractions down the path of our lives

Unforgiving

Was there a point to nine years we had
Selfish thoughts leave you undesireable
Part of me was severed that very day

In the wake of confusion I search, looking
For the answers to questions only reveal
