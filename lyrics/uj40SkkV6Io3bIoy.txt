B.l.e.s.s T.h.i.s M.e.s.s.
Will you bless this mess?

Simple angel, perfect devil
Can I come inside?

I'm feeling like larva
I'm frumpy like Martha
A 15-foot Parka
I grow out my clothes
Eat 'till I'm sleepy
The muffins are beefy
A giant diamond
When you're blessed it shows

You wanted me to me act up
To make you feel more backed up
Well take swig of vodka
And battle underwater
You say you need a father
Well, baby, I'm a baller

I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh

B.l.e.s.s T.h.i.s M.e.s.s.

B.l.e.s.s T.h.i.s M.e.s.s.
Will you bless this Mess?

No rehash, no rehab
No empty simulation
I want it, I made it
It's not an animation
Got no time for depression
No therapy session
Inertia, it festers
And feeds my aggression
These chains on my tires
They came with it, they're stock
My sense of direction is all the way up, up

Keep up, keep up, 'cause I'm not coming down
I'm jacking up shots, you can fight for the rebound
Got an angel and a devil seducing my head
I'm in for a three-way and sleep when I'm dead

You wanted me to me act up
To make you feel more backed up
Well take swig of vodka
And battle underwater
You say you need a father
Well, baby, I'm a baller

I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh
I won't ever grow up, oh oh
