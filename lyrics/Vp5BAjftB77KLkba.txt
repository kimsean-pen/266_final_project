Just a kid from the neighbourhood
We're all kids from a neighbourhood
Take it back to '96
I fall asleep with the radio on
Turn my pillow to the fresh side
Fall asleep ol' sleepy eyes
I don't dream big, just the right size
That modesty comes from my mom side
You ever heard of a soft touch?
You ever heard of a finger roll?
A little sun, a little raindrop
And you watch this thing grow
Follow me like a firefly
At midnight in mid-July
Mix some blood, sweat, and tears of joy
That's what I call a rally cry
Relentless
Like a dog on a bone
We got gas in the tank to go all night
We got gas in the tank to go all night
Relentless
We don't walk alone
Relentless
It's time to get to work, now let's get going
Woo!
I was hopeless, I was restless
On the spinning wheel of fate
I met a man with a tattoo
In the shape of his home state
He said the past was complicated
Both mourned and celebrated
Take a minute to get fascinated
Right here right now, and you're liberated
Relentless
Like a dog on a bone
We got gas in the tank to go all night
We got gas in the tank to go all night
Relentless
We don't walk through it alone
Relentless
It's time to get to work, now let's get going
Woo!
Relentless!
Woo!
You call my name
(You call my name)
From the front porch
(Front porch)
And I'll come running home to you
(Home to you, you, you)
You call my name
(You call my name)
And I come running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running on home to you

Just a kid from the neighbourhood
We're all kids from a neighbourhood
Take me back to '96
I fall asleep with the radio on
I'll be ready come the daylight
I woke up saying, "It's about time"
Relentless
Like a dog on a bone
We got gas in the tank to go all night
We got gas in the tank to go all night
Relentless
We don't walk through it alone
Relentless
It's time to get to work, now let's get going
Relentless
Like a dog on a bone
We got gas in the tank to go all night
We got gas in the tank to go all night
Relentless
We don't walk through it alone
Relentless
It's time to get to work, now let's get going
Woo!
