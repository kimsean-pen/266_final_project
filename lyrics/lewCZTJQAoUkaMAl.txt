This isn't violence this is just a war in my head
I give it time but it never seems to end
I feel a fire in the back of my throat
So let's get covered in flames and play some games with the smoke
You said:
"Don't you try to run right now
'Cause baby I could burn you down"
Yeah

You make your way into my veins
Course right through my limbs and dig your way into my brain
So in the second that you walk, walk into a room
I can't help myself from that thing that you do

Oh, you're killing me right now
(You're killing me, killing me right now)
I think it's time you burn me down

Oh, I love the things we do
When it's just me and you
I'm burning up, burning up
Oh, burning up
Yeah

Oh, you're killing me now
I think it's time time you burn me down

You're just a ghost
Of blissful feelings
A cloud of smoke
That I keep breathing
An illusion, I'm losing you to
The games in my mind
I see your face
An apparition
But then it's changed
Shape shifting
Don't wanna open my eyes

Hey
Yeah

Oh, you're killing me right now
(The things we do, me and you)
