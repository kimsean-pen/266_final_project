And if I ever had a wish,
In the whole world,
I would've listened to my brother,
When he spoke to me.

And I never would've played,
With my conscience,
In the fields where I walked,
In the company.

But you gave me wings,
And I used them,
I used them, I used them,
On my youth.

And you gave me wings,
And I used them,
I used them and I,
Won't lose them.

Now I found my feet,
Count to one, two, three,
And I'm taking off tonight,
Now I'm free.

As I walk my feet,
On the cold concrete,
And I and I and I.

I can feel my dreams,
When I'm in my city, eh, eh, eh,
I fall on my knees for my,
For my city, eh.

We go on every dream,
In my, in my city, eh, eh, eh,
And that's where I'll stay,
And that's where I'll stay,
In my city, eh, eh, eh.

Wandring down the streets,
With my new town.
With the lights blinding,
And my heart weighed down.

I think I'll get a job,
Of stealing people's thunder,
Where the folks back home,
I will make them vouch.

You gave me wings,
And I used them,
I used them, I used them,
On my youth.

Yeah, you gave me wings,
And I used them,
I used them and I,
Won't lose them.

I don't wanna lose them.

I can feel my dreams,
When I'm in my city, eh, eh, eh,
I fall on my knees for my,
For my city, eh.

We go on every dream,
In my, in my city, eh, eh, eh,
And that's where I'll stay,
And that's where I'll stay,
In my city, eh, eh, eh.

Shoulders ache,
For want of wings,
My city shakes,
The fear in me.

I can feel my dreams,
When I'm in my city, eh, eh, eh,
I fall on my knees for my,
For my city, eh.

We go on every dream,
In my, in my city, eh, eh, eh,
And that's where I'll stay,
And that's where I'll stay,
In my city, eh, eh, eh.
