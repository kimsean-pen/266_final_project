run from me darlin'
run my good wife
run from me darlin'
you'd better run for your life
run from me baby
run my good wife
run from me baby
you better run for your life
and each time I see you
I contemplate
what I love most of all
your swingin' gaze
run from me darlin'
run my good wife
run from me darlin'
you'd better run for your life
run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run
run, run, run, run
