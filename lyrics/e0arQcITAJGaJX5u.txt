Hordes of rage and bigotry
March upon the land
A tempest of insanity
Raised by sacred hand
Heaven sent they bath in blood
To worship their believe
Misled and seduced
They don't see they get abused

Fool crusaders
Knowing no remorse
We'll bring you to a halt
With unrelenting force
With all our might

Roaring thunder
Is pounding at the worlds
Torn asunder
As the holy fire burns
Blind believers
Are marching in the streets
Worlds will collide
For freedom or defeat

Bold and grim we'll hold the line
Determined to oppose
For mankind and the galaxy
They'll never break our rows

False messiah
You shall never win
We came here to retaliate
Upon you for the sins
The sins and the blood

Roaring thunder
Is pounding at the worlds
Torn asunder
As the holy fire burns
Blind believers
Are marching in the streets
Worlds will collide
For freedom or defeat

Solo Piet

Roaring thunder
Is pounding at the worlds
Torn asunder
As the holy fire burns
Blind believers
Are marching in the streets
Worlds will collide
For freedom or defeat

Titans will collide
For freedom or defeat
