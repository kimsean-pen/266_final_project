If love is heavenly then tell me how come it can hurt like hell?
If everything is black-and-white then how come i see in pastels?
How come being such a sad girl makes me want to be a bad girl?
How come being such a sad sad girl makes me want to be a bad bad girl?
My heart keeps beating,
my heart keeps beating, my heart keeps beating the shit out of me.
my heart keeps beating,
my heart keeps beating, my heart keeps beating the shit out of me
I know you good I know you're right why do I still put up a fight?
Why do I want what I don't like why do I want what I don't like?
How come being such a sad girl makes me want to be a bad girl?
How come being such a sad sad girl makes me want to be a bad bad girl?
My heart keeps beating, my heart keeps beating,
my heart keeps beating the shit out of me. (Repeats)
