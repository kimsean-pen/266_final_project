As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong

Back at the old gray school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh

So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say, oh

You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one, oh

But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen, oh
In the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
Well this is true and yet, it's false, oh

But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face, oh

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh

So who is rich and who is poor
I cannot say, oh, oh

You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one, oh

But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied, oh
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
The back of your car
To the back of your car, oh
