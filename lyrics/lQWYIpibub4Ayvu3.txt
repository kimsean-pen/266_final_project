aside the wandering eye has opened
a stare all the way bare and broken
the start of a brand new adventure

hey now
catch me quick before I walk away
tell me if there's something I should say
I'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces

not far a blue guitar is playing
it drew me like it knew
and it's saying

hey now
catch me quick before I walk away
tell me if there's something I should say
I'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces

we drown in ups and downs
neglecting
the beauty of my sun is setting

in the end there's no way in redemption
hey now
catch me quick before I walk away
tell me if there's something I should say
I'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces
hey now
catch me quick before I walk away
tell me if there's something I should say
