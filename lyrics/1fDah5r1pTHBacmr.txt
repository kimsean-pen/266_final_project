All the stories my father told
They spoke of your golden heart
Now the air in the room is cold
As your memories fall apart
(You fear the silence)
So I keep the words coming
(You only remember that)
Once all the clocks stop running
(We might expect it)
But my heart's still filled with dread
And words I never said
(Words I never said)
Give me strength to see you weak
Cause I can't bear to let you leave
I know you're tired, but please don't sleep
Cause I can't bear to let you leave

You've been claimed by your suffering
Sinking deeper in your pain
If you made a recovery
Could you ever be the same
(You fear the silence)
So I keep the words coming
(You only remember that)
Once all the clocks stop running
(We might expect it)
But my heart's still filled with dread
And words I never said
(Words I never said)
Give me strength to see you weak
Cause I can't bear to let you leave
I know you're tired, but please don't sleep'
Cause I can't bear to let you leave

I tower over your hospital bed
Like you used to with me
I tower over your hospital bed
Like you used to
Strength to see you weak
Cause I can't bear to let you leave
Give me strength to see you weak'
Cause I can't bear to let you leave
I know you're tired, but please don't sleep'
Cause I can't bear to let you, bear to let you leave
