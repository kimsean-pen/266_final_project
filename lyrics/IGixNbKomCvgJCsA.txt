Careful there, you're gettin' too close
What you think you're feelin' is crushin' at most
But I already know
I can't leave it alone
Can't leave it alone

Hands find the places where they've never been
To know for themselves new surfaces and mine
They've got a mind of their own
I can't leave it alone

Oh, let the night start unfoldin'
Get to the part where the space between us closes
Where we lean into the gold-blue sky of mornin'
With the words we can't find like bees inside us swarmin'
I can't leave it alone

Storm rock the window panes every day
Shades of neglect in fishtank-green
And I envy your clothes
How'd they get to be so close?
I can't leave it alone

Strange as a snowfall on the plains
Your eyes glitter like an eagle's cage
Glitterin'
Glitter in the knowing
I can't leave it alone

Oh, let the night start unfoldin'
Get to the part where the space between us closes
Where we lean into the gold-blue sky of mornin'
With the words we can't find like bees inside us swarmin'
I can't leave it alone

I can hear you thinkin' in the dark
The noise of your nerves are all question marks
And I
I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone

I can't leave it alone, I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone, I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it alone, I can't leave it alone
