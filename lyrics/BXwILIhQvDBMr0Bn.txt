Make the world go away
And get if off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away.

Do you remember when you loved me?
Before the world took me away
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away.

Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away.

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just tell me that you love me
And make the world go away.

Make the world go away
And get if off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away.

Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away...
