Don't lose focus, I don't want to stand on your blind side
Know you working, don't you let it cut into my time
I'd lose my mind before I see you and I separated, no
I'm so scared to lose you, never choosing to let go
Love's so fragile, anything could happen, and we know
Hearts made of glass, but somehow we last
Yeah we made it, no

I would rather be
Without vision 'fore I ever watch you leave, girl
Got me feelin' like oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind
Oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind

When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is
You (I'd be better off blind)
When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is
You

Could be here looking at the same window with different views
I'll take my time
To read between them faces you're makin'(no, no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I would rather be
Without vision before I ever watch you leave
Got me feelin' like
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'd be better off blind

When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is
You (I'd be better off blind)
When I close my eyes
All I think about is you
All I think about is
You (I'd be better off blind)

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

When I close my
All I think about is you
All I think about is
You (I'd be better off blind)
When I close my eyes (eyes-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
All I think about is you
All I think about is you (blind, blind)
Better off blind, no-oh-oh-oh
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
