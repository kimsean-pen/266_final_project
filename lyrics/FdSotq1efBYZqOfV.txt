My daddy got here on the gravy train
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
They went walkin' and she took his name, round here
There was dancin' in the afternoons, those days

Waitin' tables, chasin' girls with the money he made
It was 1957 and love felt the same, love felt the same
Frightened little girl, she makes a break

Into the arms of something better, round here
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark

Waitin' patiently to make my mark, round here
And I remember my, my first day at school
And I remember trouble and thinkin' I was so cool
I remember it all, like yesterday, don't you

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside says, "You can do better", round here
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived

I want to put my hands in this earth again

Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, to the beat
Even though I think I've seen everythin'

There is to see of this world
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth
All that I wanted, was to be someone
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
Some cheesy covers and those neighbours
That banged on the walls

Andy says it's time to show them all, round here

Please sir, we two have other plans
Please sir you would not understand
What's going on, is magical, can't you see
That some of us do more than dream

Every time I try to leave this place
Something inside
Says, "Keep on keepin', on and on", around here
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived
I wanna put my hands in this earth again

Music fell like rain to the streets
The Specials and The Jam, ABC
Even though I think I've seen everythin'

There is to see of this world
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space
Is the place of my birth, my birth
In this town, yes, I guess I got to be someone
To be somebody, in the beautiful city
This place I call home
(This place I call my home)
These streets of London
(This place I call my home)
It's everythin' I know
(Everythin' and everybody)
On the streets of London
(I wanna thank you, thank you)
This place I call my home
(I wanna thank you, thank you)
