You stop and ask why I look glum
(I know I know)
You think am I bright or am I dumb
(I know I know)
You see five letters in my eyes saying guess (what if I get it wrong?)
One thing on my mind is happiness (ain't so wrong)

It's a hot winter and my mind's somewhere else
Hot winter ey, hot winter ey

Pull the wool over my eyes (I know, I know)
Just because my lips are stained with wine (what are you doing on your own?)
Doesn't mean my smile is on time (stop waiting)

It's a hot winter and my mind's somewhere else
Hot winter ey, hot winter ey
