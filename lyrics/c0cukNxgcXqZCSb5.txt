We have no future, we have no past
We're just drifting ghosts of glass
Brown sugar, ice in our veins
No pressure, no pain

Everybody looks the same to me
Rows and rows of faces on the balcony
I can hear them calling down to me
Come up here - set us free
Got sugar in our brains
Or a dagger in our hearts

This is not my home, no
Everyone's bought and sold
This is not my home
Everybody's walking round the dead and cold

One by one by one we disappear
Day after day and year after year
You are run about our wasted there
Nobody hears cause nobody cares
Put a dagger in my heart now

Cold here and I shudder and I shiver
I want to look twenty but I can't deliver
Pains in the heart
Ba-ba-bow-wow-wow

It's cold in here
Can you hear my teeth a-chatter
The time has come for all of us to scatter
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Dagger in the heart

No
This is not my home, no
Everyone's bought and sold
This is not my home
Everybody's checking out the dead and cold

We have no future we have no past
We're just drifting ghosts of glass
Brown sugar, ice in our veins
No pressure, no pain

Nothing on earth could help me, no
