Never ending symptoms in my head
We lay hollow in the emptiness
I'm too tired to push you from the bed

No more fighting, no more fighting
No more fighting for us

Feel the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend or break it
The space between is deafening
The space between is deafening

No one's moving, we lack the courage to
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would
But we're too tired, we're at the ember's core

No more fighting, there's no more fighting
There's no more fighting for us

Feel the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend or break it
The space between is deafening

No more fighting, we've given up now
Silence has more than worth
Imagination cures loneliness
When you become a prisoner

Feel the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend or break it
The space between is deafening
