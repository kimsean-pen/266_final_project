And my eyes start to wander to the other girls, to the other side, yeah
And my heart starts to wonder, is it okay, is it alright? Yeah
And I'm not too fond of all the arguin' and all the fightin', yeah
And I'm lost in love, I just want to hug all through the night, yeah

It's the morning baby, I'm about to slide, no cha-cha
Your girl ain't passion, more like Prada
We don't do the potion, man we always take alot of it
I wash it down just with a little molta
Little silver, little gold, and I won't bowl
There's freaks in the street so you know you gotta hold
Screamin' in my face and you're gettin' real bold

Gettin' real tough, you know, you know
I don't want to get rough, you know, you know
I don't want to lose your love, you know
I don't want to lose your love, ayy
I don't want to lose your love

And my eyes start to wander to the other girls, to the other side
Yeah, yeah, and my heart starts to wonder, is it okay, is it alright? Yeah
Tashie, who next up in the storm?

Now you see, see, see, see, see what I mean she walk
She walk, she said things with her art, she doesn't really talk
I'm racin' with the time and I'm fightin' with the clock
Tock, tick tock, tock tock
I'm fuckin' with the band baby, this is how we rock

I don't want to get rough, you know, you know
I don't want to lose your love, you know
I don't want to lose your love, ayy
I don't want to lose your love

It's later in the evening, I'm playin' on her keys and, ayy
As down as one can be, yeah, what's goin' on inside of me? Ayy ayy
I just want time, I want a dream, ayy
I try want time, I want a dream, ayy
I slept one time, I want a dream, ayy
I want one time, I want a dream
I want a dream, I want a dream
