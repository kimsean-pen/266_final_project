You've been on the ordinary drugs
I can see that you've been trying to make it on your own
It's all you've ever known, that time moves slowly
Always such a solitary one

You've been having ordinary fun
I can see that all you've ever planned was getting old
It's all that you were told, that life's a movie
Falling into solitary love

If you look up you can see it in the sky
Heavenly colours that paralyse the laws inside your mind
From a million years gone by
No ordinary life

Everybody knows that you're hurting
Serving your time behind the curtain
Open up your doors and your windows
We could live a life so simple
Everybody knows that you're hurting
Serving your time behind the curtain
Open up your doors and your windows
We could live a life so simple

You've been on the ordinary drugs
I can see that you've been trying to make it on your own
It's all you've ever known, that time moves slowly
Always such a solitary one

If you look up you can see it in the sky
Heavenly colours that paralyse the laws inside your mind
From a million years gone by
No ordinary life
No ordinary life
