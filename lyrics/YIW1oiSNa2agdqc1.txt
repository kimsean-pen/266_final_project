I live in a constant state of fear and misery
Do you miss me anymore?
And I don't even notice
When it hurts anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

I know I'm morbid at times
That's how I like to be
They call my dick a mammoth
You're salty you got a micro-d
Classic penis joke
Inserted with appropriate timing
Because if I ain't got a penis line
I ain't dining
No homo, but seriously I'm getting faded
And my life is like my vids
Low budget and underrated
Kids, the only way to succeed
Is to chip away at the soul
