Altering winds swept away what haunts us
Hidden beneath tarted shadows and shores
Shifted perspective, changed to the core
Landscapes we knew exist no longer

Hidden beneath tarted shadows and shores
Shifted perspective, changed to the core
Landscapes we knew exist no longer
(Interlude x6)
Where I go? I've lost you
