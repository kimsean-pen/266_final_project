I thirst but never quench, I know the consequence
Feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top, where tell me will it stop?
And what am I to say?
Open our music book, that only few can look
And I'll write a song for you

Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I'll write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate, they only recreate
In another place
There's in your silent night, joy of a song's delight

'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love

My magical mystique, finding it all complete
In your lovely face
Feelings we try to chase, memories that won't erase
Stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked

'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love

Love yeah
We'll write a song of love my baby
Write a song of love

We have a magic box
We write a song of love
We write, write a song of love

Sounds they never dissipate
They only recreate
To another place or time
We write a song, we write a song
Just you and me baby

We, we're on a spinning top
We write a song
We write a song
We write a song
