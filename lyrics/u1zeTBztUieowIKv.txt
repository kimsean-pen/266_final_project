Someday the pain I feel in my heart
Will slowly start to fade
'Till I feel nothing at all
And all trace of who I was will be lost
'Cos dreams are only made to destroy things like us
Each time I close my eyes
I see your spirit rise
But the more it comes to life
I disappear
I see your ghost in the middle of the night
I talk to shadows that you left behind
You dug me a hole
You hung me a noose
Someday I'll be someone that you never knew
I've already lost
Everything I could lose
And I can't make it stop
If I'm nothing to you
As dawn breaks I remain in the dark
Your echo leaves a scar so you'll never be gone
But someday all my love will be numb
And I'll grow tired of waiting for the feeling to come
Each time I close my eyes
I see your spirit rise
But the more it comes to life
I disappear
I see your ghost in the middle of the night
I talk to shadows that you left behind
You dug me a hole
You hung me a noose
Someday I'll be someone that you never knew
I've already lost
Everything I could lose
And I can't make it stop
If I'm nothing to you
I see your ghost in the middle of the night
I talk to shadows that you left behind
You dug me a hole
You hung me a noose
Someday I'll be someone that you never knew
I've already lost
Everything I could lose
And I can't make it stop
If I'm nothing to you
