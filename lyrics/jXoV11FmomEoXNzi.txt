In the lake I had a thousand trees
Could you show me a picture of my selfies
In the lake I had a thousand suns
Could you show me a picture of those words

That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reason
That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reasoning
That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reason
That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reasoning

In the lake I pushed the trees away
Could you show me what it's like on a sunny day
In the lake I had a thousand moons
Could you take me back into that other room, please
So you could see me as I am blue
See me as I'm blue
See me as I'm blue
See me as I'm blue

That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reason
That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reasoning
To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
Oooh
To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
Oooh
That was in your face, I saw you going
Nothing would have changed, no better reasoning

In the lake I had a thousand trees
Could you show me a picture of my selfies
And the one who had a thousand hearts
But we can't just go right back to the start
But you can see me as I'm blue
See me as I'm blue
But you can see me as I'm blue
See me as I'm blue

To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
To-do-do-doo
Oooh
