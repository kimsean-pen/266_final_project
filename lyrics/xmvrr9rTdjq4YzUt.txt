Sleep will carry us
After mentioned having a lesson
It's the least discerning place
We could dive to

We both shouldn't last another day
Another failed invention straight to nowhere
One more you say, what causes these
It's all the better your greed seems to carry you well
We couldn't dive
Too far

We toss our failures at the earth
Connected to a cause
Stripped away another fool
Blame it all because
We toss our failures at the earth
Stripped away from under

So shy crossed my heart I sinned
With images too far apart to tell
What don't we know?
what should we know?
Slipping under is just the beginning of thirst
Could we dive too
Too far

We toss our failures at the earth
Connected to a cause
Stripped away another fool
Blame it all because
We toss our failures at the earth
Stripped away from under

We so forgot to mention
A waste upon the hours
We so forgot to mention
The hook that is the chorus

We so forgot to mention
A waste upon the hours
We so forgot to mention
The hook that is the chorus

We toss our failures at the earth
Connected to a cause
Stripped away another fool
Blame it all because
We toss our failures at the earth
Stripped away from under
