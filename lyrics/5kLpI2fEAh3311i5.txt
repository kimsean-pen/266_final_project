I did all the things that I wouldn't do cause you like that
You did all the things that you wanna do, there's no take backs
Now you got a new girl, maybe got a few girls
Do they do all the the things that you wanted them too
'Cause it's good to you

'Cause I spaced out on you, gave you room
And you thought only of you, easily distracted
In the ways you acted

Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had
Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had

All the times you heard from me
About my insecurities and
Telling me that you didn't mind
But still wanted different sides
It's silly 'cause you told me that I was your everything
But look at us now, did it even mean anything

'Cause I spaced out on you, gave you room
And you thought only of you, easily distracted
In the ways you acted

Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had
Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had

We gon' make mistakes
But I won't make mine you
We gon' make mistakes
Baby not like you

Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had
Bet you think you traded up
When you traded us like that, like that
Bet you think you traded up
But I know you'll want what you had, what you had
