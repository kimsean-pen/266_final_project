These limbs have grown so bare
In the coldest winter of our given time
Time's ticking down,
And you were never meant to be here
Running towards the fire,
Feeding on the flames
No one's here to guide you
As creation blooms before your eyes

Glory
Lost to thoughts of apathy
Shadows fill the void
Where memories recede,
As your light goes out

Some were meant to fight
Some were meant to die

You will let your life flicker out
Let it fade,
Let it fade away

Time is
Time is running out
Let the ghost of revelled youth
Cling to you like shadows
Chasing light
