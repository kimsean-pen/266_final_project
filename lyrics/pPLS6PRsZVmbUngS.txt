Keep a light on those you love
They will be there when you die
Baby, there's no need to fear
Baby, there's no need to cry

Every little piece in your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece in your life
Will it mean something to someone?

You fuse my broken bones
Back together and then
Lift the weight of the world
From my shoulders again

Every little piece in your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece in your life
Will it mean something to someone?
Every little piece in your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone

You touch my face
God whispers
In my ear
There are tears in my eyes
Love replaces fear
You touch my face
God whispers
In my ear
There are tears in my eyes
Love replaces fear
Fear

Every little piece in your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece in your life
Will mean something to someone
Every little piece in your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone
