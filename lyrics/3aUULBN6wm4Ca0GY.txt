There is no easy way to break somebody's heart
When you know what you're gonna say will leave a mark
But I've tried, and i've tried, and i've tried
To no end

This is the moment that you smile before you cry
Feels like I'm aiming for your heart, ready to fire
Oh I wish it could be different, wish it could be different
But it'll only hurt you more

If I say that things can change
I'd be leading you astray-yeah-yeah

The stars in the sky are all burned out
Nothing to guide us back home now
These are the words I've kept inside
Now this is the sound of goodbye
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back
Everything starts to fade to black
How can the silence seem so loud
And all you can hear is the sound
Of goodbye

I know I said that I would love you 'till I die (I die)
That was then and this is now, that ain't no lie (no lie)
But I can't keep on faking I'm constantly making you wait

I don't wanna fight with you but I don't wanna fight for you
'Cause things just don't feel the same
Oh I wish it could be different, wish it could be different
But it'll only hurt you more

If I say that things can change (Hey)
I'd be leading you astray-yeah-yeah

The stars in the sky are all burned out
Nothing to guide us back home now
These are the words I've kept inside
Now this is the sound of goodbye
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back
Everything starts to fade to black
How can the silence seem so loud
And all you can hear is the sound
Of goodbye

Of goodbye.

These words fall out my mouth and nothing feels the same
Hey

The stars in the sky are all burned out
Nothing to guide us back home now
These are the words I've kept inside
Now this is the sound of goodbye
Lost in the darkness, can't turn back
Everything starts to fade to black
How can the silence seem so loud
And all you can hear is the sound
Of goodbye
