Wait just a little bit longer
Before you stab me in the back and walk away
'Cause I've grown a little bit stronger
And now you're choking on those deadly words you ate
I can't wait to watch you fall
Like the castle you built on sand

I won't let you live my life from inside my head now
Let you out, it's hard to pretend how
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold
Make my way to places I'm bound for
Don't you say that you wanted this more
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold

Take all the time that you asked for
'Cause I can see the lack of energy in your eyes
I'm walking out through the back door
'Cause there's no point to waste away these days inside
I'm learning how you're burning down
All the bridges you built by hand

I won't let you live my life from inside my head now
Let you out, it's hard to pretend how
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold
Make my way to places I'm bound for
Don't you say that you wanted this more
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold

I won't let you live my life from inside my head now
Let you out, it's hard to pretend how
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold
Make my way to places I'm bound for
Don't you say that you wanted this more
On, and on, and on it goes
Your heart is black and mine is gold
