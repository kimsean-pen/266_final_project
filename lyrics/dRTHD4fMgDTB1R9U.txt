So close to this unsafe bridge
is where this little lady lives
no matter how much time she gives
she'll never be on this side

White water always rushing by
and people shouting encouraging lies
will only serve to make her cry
and wish to be on this side

Grass is no greener over here
which only adds to my fear
she will leave her pastures clear
and i know she is on the right side

And yet i know she must feel free
to come over here herself to see
that coming here is so lonely
and she will wish again for that side.
