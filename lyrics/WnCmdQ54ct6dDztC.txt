Burning in it's savage fury
Our fates accept not judge or jury
Helpless we must watch it done
For I have seen the Death of the Sun

We are coming to the end
I see my life and I have sinned
It's too late to change our ways
For man has seen his final days

Solar winds that parch the land
Minions are wasted by Satan's hand
A molten globe will torch the sky
As mankind bleats his final cry!
