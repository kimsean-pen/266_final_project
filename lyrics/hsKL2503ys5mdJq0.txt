Oh sweet lord, I've swallowed my pride
Go on do my drugs, waste all of my time
Pray for the day, for what's wrong will be okay

Here I am, head in my hand
Yeah, go ahead and take what's mine
So sure you'll rule the world
And I sit back 'cause I don't mind
Yeah, I don't mind, I don't mind

Forgive me my friend, I have worn down by time
Fighting for fear, losing all that is dear
Never can be sure if it's alright

Here I am, head in my hands
Yeah, go ahead and take what's mine
So sure you'll rule the world
And I sit back 'casue I don't mind
Yeah, I don't mind, I don't mind
