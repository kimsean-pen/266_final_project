You're humming tomorrow's nursery rhyme
But you're singing the only words you know
Would you cry if I lie 'til the day ...

I chose it
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we know so well

I tried to stay in line in our deaths
In our heads
Oh, but your wish is my command...
Oh, is your heart still mine for sale?
I'd like yours, here is mine.

I chose it
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we know so well

I tried to stay in line in our deaths
In our heads
Oh, but your wish is my command...
