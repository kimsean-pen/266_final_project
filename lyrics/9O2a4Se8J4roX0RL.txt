Try to be
Try to be the brightest star
You're not demanding
You're not
You're not commanding enough
Try to be the brightest star
You're not demanding
You're not
You're not commanding enough
Try to speak
Try to speak the clearest thought
You're no commanding enough
You're not pretending enough
Try to clean
Try to clean your filthy heart
You're not healthy enough
You lost the timing and touch
Living on the edge of your backseat dear
I never had a chance
Always smiling with a head full of fear
I just never cared
