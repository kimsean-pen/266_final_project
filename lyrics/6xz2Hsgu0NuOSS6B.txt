You know I've got to go
There's nothing more to say
'Cause you're better off alone,
It's got to be this way
You know I've got to go
There's nothing more to say
Surely you will know,
In the light of day

I've learnt how to stay gracious in defeat,
'Cause I've never been victorious
And now you offer me to feel complete,
You've given me your trust
'Cause I wanna give the honesty you need,
Nothing false or dubious
I want us to be all that we can be,
I want this for the two of us

You know I've got to go
There's nothing more to say
Surely you will know,
In the light of day

Wish I had the courage to explain,
To let myself be heard
I wish there was a way to break the chain,
But I struggle with the words
Say you wanna take me to your bed,
But it's hard to know
Maybe it's because we're off our heads
Maybe this is love?
