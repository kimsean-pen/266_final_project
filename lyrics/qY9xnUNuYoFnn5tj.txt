The wind took the smoke, and seperated it all.
I hope my ghost a little stronger than these blunts that I rolled.
Sometime's the shit just bring me back when I can't maintain control,
Independent thoughts just wander in my head when I don't.

Most the people that I see are hiding behind a mask,
Because I don't it's even clearer to see they not intact.
Fragments of some dreams that they know they repressed in the past.
Way to scared to take a jump and even give it a chance.

Sometime's I think that some of the
things on my mind just ain't alright.
Why do I feel the way that I feel when I look up to the sky.
No dark, no light, it's just a product of my mind.
Any way you can describe and try to twist these fuckin lies,

We just live and die, isn't that the suprise?
Are expectations necessary to escape a miserasble life?
I represent a million voices that never got a chance,
Only thing that stands between us is their all in my head.

Where do I go when I cannot feel the feelings lost in the smoke.
Where do I go when I cannot find the things that I need to cope.
Where do I go when I cannot reach the people that got my back.
Where do I go when I cannot understand if my mind's intact.

This ink spills across the sky.
What do you see inside my mind?

Where do I go when I cannot feel the feelings lost in the smoke.
Where do I go when I cannot find the things that I need to cope.
Where do I go when I cannot reach the people that got my back.
Where do I go when I cannot understand if my mind's intact.
