There's nothing wrong with spending summer in another city
I've seen the lights above the streets at night, they look so pretty
I've flown above the clouds and thought I'd never come back down (back down)
Now I find myself where I started
Picked right up like we never parted
Feese I'm in between
Am I wide awake or in a dream? (a dream)
No matter where I go
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
No no no matter where I go
There's no no no
There's no place like...
There's noting better than a wave that's louder than the ocean
I heard the sound and there was love, I felt every emotion
I always wanted more and I got what I waited for (waited for)
Feet on land, I know I belong here
Can't forget, I'm never alone here
So put your arms around me
Make me feel like I've been found (I'm found)
No matter where I go
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
No no no matter where I go
There's no no no
There's no place like...
No
Matter where I go
No
No matter where I go
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
No no no matter where I go
There's no no no
There's no place like home
There's no place like home (home)
No no no matter where I go
There's no no no
There's no place like home
