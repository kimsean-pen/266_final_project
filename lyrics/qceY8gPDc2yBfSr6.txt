I might attract too much electric eyes
I feel the rush
You're my drug
Can't get enough

()
I want to dance until
It feels like time is standing still
Forget the world
Just let me in
I feel so oh oh...

(Pre-)
Having the time of my life (with you)
Keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long

You take me off the sand
And fly me where I want to land
It's like this beat will never end
I feel so oh oh...

(Pre-x2)
Having the time of my life (with you)
Keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive

Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long
