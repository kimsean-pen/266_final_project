Oh, I like it

You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down, you shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Oh, you don't believe me

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Oh, stay sweet

You say
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up, you hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home
Oh, you really do me

When you say
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Sweet lady
Oh, come on, stay sweet

My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need
(Got everything we need)

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Oh, stay sweet, stay sweet

Oh, runaway, come on
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, sweet lady
