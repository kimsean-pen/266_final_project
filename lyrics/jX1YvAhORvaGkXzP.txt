I see you, kid, alone in your room
You got the weight on your mind
And you're just trying to get by
Your world is just beginning
And I know this life seems never-ending
But you got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you
You know what you got to do
You ain't got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you
Let 'em in one by one
Keep 'em safe from all the harm
Let 'em in one by one
They wanna live you wanna be somebody
They want to give and be wanted
They want to forgive and not be forgotten
They want to reach the end
Their way of living, their way of living
I see you, kid, alone in your room
I see you, kid, You got the weight on your min
You're just trying to get by but your world is just beginning
And I know this life seems never-ending
It's up to you, It's up to you you know
It's only time, it ain't' got nothing on you
It's nothing but time, and it ain't got nothing on you
Never give away, never give away your body
Never, never give away your friends
Ever, never give away what you always wanted
Never, never ever give in
You want to live - My way of living
You want to live - My way of living
You want to live - I want to live
You ain't got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you
[X4]
Your world is just beginning
[X2]
It's up to you to be a superhero
It's up to you to be like nobody
You ain't got nothing but time
For your way of living
And it ain't got nothing on you
You ain't got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you
