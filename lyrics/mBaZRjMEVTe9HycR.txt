My mistake
Thought this year would bring something different
And I'm the same old story
Haunted memories

All the way (all the way)
All the way from the warmth of your hands
You wouldn't even let me hold them

Another one
So over them
Kill me twice
Finalize my shelf life

Now you're alone
Do you feel any better?
Left to commence
And a heavy head

(Leave me)
The brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away

Please don't feel like
I'm attacking you
I did some things too
And pushed you away

It needs to
The feelings of the past will surely fade through
To live another day

Looks like I was someone I could barely recognize
Hope it's not too late to scatter this disguise

My mistake
Thought this year would bring something different
And I'm the same old story
Haunted memories

All the way (all the way)
All the way from the warmth of your hands
You wouldn't even let me hold them

(Leave me)
The brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away
