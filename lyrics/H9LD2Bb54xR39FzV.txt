oh, pure heart's peer caught me gawking
your hair in the wind such small lonesome hands
i think i was meant to keep you warm
it was bigger than me
it was bigger than the sea
and i'm not waving i'm drowning
i felt your waves calming comely
lights on as is angles casting sides
infinity and all watered the moon
it was more than i could care
i felt your weights crushing contours
and i felt cascades ripping right through me
my brightest love sent from tundras
your arctic touch
my brightest love it was more than i shared
it was more than you cared
