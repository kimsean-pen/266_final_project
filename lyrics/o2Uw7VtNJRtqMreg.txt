I should warn you, when I'm not well... I can't tell
Oh there's nothin' I can do... to make this easier for you
You're gonna need
To be
Patient with me

I'm this apple, this happening stone... when I'm alone.
Oh but my blessings get so blurred... with the sound of your words
I'm gonna need
You to be
Patient with me

How can I warn you when my tongue turns to dust... like we've discussed
Doesn't mean that I don't care... it means I'm partially there
You're gonna need
To be
Patient with me
