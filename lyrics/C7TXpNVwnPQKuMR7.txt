I see the middle kingdom
Between Heaven and Earth
Like the Chinese call
The country of their birth.

We all figure that our homes
Our homes are set above
Other people than the ones
The ones we know and love.

In every place with a name
They play the same territorial game
Hiding behind the lines
Sending up warning signs.

The whole wide world
An endless universe
Yet we keep looking through
The eyeglass in reverse.

Don't feed the people
But we feed the machines
Can't really feel what
International means.

In different circles
We keep holding our ground
Indifferent circles
We keep spinning
Round and round.

We see so many tribes
Overrun and undermined
While their invaders dream
Of lands they've left behind.

Better people, better food
And better beer
Why move around the world
When Eden was so near?

The bosses get talking so tough
And if that wasn't evil enough
We get the drunken and passionate pride
Of citizens along for the ride.

The whole wide world
An endless universe
Yet we keep looking through
The eyeglass in reverse.

Don't feed the people
But we feed the machines
Can't really feel what
International means.

In different circles
We keep holding our ground
Indifferent circles we keep
Spinning round and round and.

They shoot without shame
In the name of a piece of dirt
For a change of accent
Or the color of your shirt.

Better the pride that resides
In a citizen of the world
Than the pride that divides
When a colorful rag is unfurled.

The whole wide world
An endless universe
Yet we keep looking through
The eyeglass in reverse.

Don't feed the people
But we feed the machines
Can't really feel what
International mean.

In different circles
We keep holding our ground
Indifferent circles we keep
Spinning round and round and round.
