Concerto for a rainy day

Hey
Rain

Rainy day
Rainy day

I'm standin' in the rain
I'm waiting all alone
I'm so tired
I wanna go home
I'm standin' in the rain, gettin' soaking wet
I'm doin' my best, but what do I get?

I'm standin' in the rain, can't seem to get along
Oh, people rushing by, wish they could hear my song

I'm standin' in the rain
It's teeming down on me
Cats and dogs
I wanna be free

I'm standin' in the rain, doin' my thing
I'm trying my best, what does it bring?
Standin' in the rain, getting soaking wet
I'm doing my best, but what do I get?

The good intentions and the pain
Lay drowned now in the pouring rain
I tried to be so good this time
But here I am under the sky

The good intentions and the pain
Lay drowned now in the pouring rain

Rainy day
