I got to have all your love
Night and day
Not just a little part
But all of your heart, sugar

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

Don't be led in the wrong direction
To start this thing off right
A man need a little love and affection
Yes he do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it, all right

Lookin' here

We got to bring it all down
Start gettin' it right
We got to stop this messin' around
And keep the thing up tight
Yes we do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it, all right sugar

Got to have a hundred
Well, got to have a hundred
All right

Ooh, I must do, I must do
I must do now

Oh! Got to have a hundred
Yeah, got to have a hundred
Oh! Got to have a hundred, too right
Got to have a hundred, now, oh
