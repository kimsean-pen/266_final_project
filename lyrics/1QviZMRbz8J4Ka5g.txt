He say, she say, everybody knows
Been there, done that, everybody knows
Blah blah blah blah, everybody knows
Same old shit, nigga, everybody knows

I said I'm so exquisite
You more like so shitty
I'm so with it
You more like "who is he?"
I'm so fly
You more like four chick-lets
I'm more Mike Jordan, the Fourth,
You more Pippen, check it
I been doin' this shit
I been rippin' records
I been surrounded by the best so
Yeah, get to steppin'
I been followin' my roots
So there's nothin' to question
Things been fallin' apart
But there's nothin' to question
Not perfected my craft
But I'm probably a veteran
Okay yeah, not quite
Like honorable mention
Just mention a brother, right
Right, right when I step in
I'll probably leave with your mother
Nah, I'm just messin'

Know somethin', but actually know nada
More kids runnin' around, no father
Have a drink, more soda, no water
What am I rappin' about anyway?
More blah blah
Bet you can't name a crew who's hotter
Injury Reserve, but really, we're starters
Enough of that shit, man, back to the real flow
Bars under construction, I even got the steel toes
Ugly chicks I punt em, much rather go and field goals
They say that this sound like some old shit
Either that or they like "oh shit"
"Groggs, I love your verse fam," no shit
I probably sound like I got an ego but I'm hella humble
And if you don't like it be like Barney and kick hella rubble
That's probably the corniest thing coming out my mouth
But it still sounds better than most of that shit out
He say, she say, everybody knows
