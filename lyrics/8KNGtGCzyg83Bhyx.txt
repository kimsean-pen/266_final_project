Ride away from Holloway
I said mum, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't comin' back
To let them fill the shack up with all gold plaques
Soon come, home run (What?)
Locket on the part with the baseball bat
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen

Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA

Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London Queen
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen, oi!
