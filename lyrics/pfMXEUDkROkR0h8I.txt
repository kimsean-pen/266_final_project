Well, I feel like the time's just slipping away
And it seems that the road gets rougher each day
Sometimes I get caught up
With little things that just don't matter
I remember how I used to swing from a rope
One that sat on the hills just above Jackson's Cove
Sometimes I close my eyes
And just go back to that little girl

I wanna run
I wanna fall
I wanna take every chance that's given to me
Live this life like I've got nothing to hide
Free and wild
With the heart of a child
With the heart of a child

Try to be everything to everybody but you
But the truth is you ain't got nothing to prove
You only get one chance
Only one trip around this world and

I wanna run
I wanna fall
I wanna take every chance that's given to me
Live this life like I've got nothing to hide
Free and wild
With the heart of a child
With the heart of a child

I wanna chase down a dream
With nothing to break my fall
Just risk it all
And have no regrets
And never forget
To run
And fall
I wanna take every chance that's given to me
And live this life like I've got nothing to hide
Free and wild
With a smile
And the heart of a child
And the heart of a child
