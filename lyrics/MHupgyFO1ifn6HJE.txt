Dizzy, we're caught in a spin
If I was older, then would you still let me win

Cold, so cold
And all that you say again, that's like
Don't go, so cold
You're not the same

Seriously, at last it bothers me
Under the blue of my desire to be
Never taking myself that seriously
Don't think it bothers me

Chasing, the depths of ascent
I had to learn it
To savor the consequences

Cold, so cold
And all that you say again, that's like
Don't go, so cold
You're not the same

Seriously, at last it bothers me
Under the blue of my desire to be
Never taking myself that seriously
Don't think it bothers me

Seriously, at last it bothers me
Under the blue of my desire to be
Never taking myself that seriously
Don't think it bothers me
