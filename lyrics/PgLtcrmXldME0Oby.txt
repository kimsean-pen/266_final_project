Stop
The train is ridin
Down to the station
Where you lived
When we were school kids

Hey
The rails are caught now
And I am falling down fools in a spiral
Round this town of steam

My body tells me no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

My body tells me no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more

Stop

The train is riding
Down to the station where I lived

When I was a cool kid
Hey
Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn down in a spiral

Round your crown of thieves

My body tells me no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
My body tells me no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want morre
It rides me out of town

Oh, it's my road, it's my road, it's my road
It's my road, it's my road, it's my road
And it's my war, it's my war, it's my war
His eyes are open
His eyes are open
Oh, cause I want more, I want more
Want more
His eyes are open
His eyes are open
(Hey, hey, hey)
My body tells me no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
My body tells me no, but I wont quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
It rides out of town
