Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Oh, loving you forever, is all I need

Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh, baby let's.
Let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me

Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh baby, let's.
Let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

(Good or bad, happy or sad)

Why, oh tell me.
Why do people break up?
Then turn around and make up
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me
Would you baby?
'Cause being around you
Is all I see
So baby.
Let's we all stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
