I was shaking hands with the face of death
In the amazon
I was in a trance
Tryna' catch my breath
But I couldn't run
When you came around
I was on the ground
Blood in my mouth
And I realized the whole damn time
I've been missing out
(Hey!)

Oh, we never gonna go back to the way it was
Oh, and we're never gonna go back to the way we was
Tell me if you wanna roll with the rest of us
Cause, oh, it's never gonna go back to the way it was

Did you get your fill?
Have you seen it all?
Have you had enough?
It's a jagged pill you've been choking on
You gotta cough it up
Ain't it fine to forget your mind when you ride the wave
Summertime is only one more breath away
Just one more breath away

Oh, we never gonna go back to the way it was
Oh, and we're never gonna go back to the way we was
Tell me if you wanna roll with the rest of us
Cause, oh, it's never gonna go back to the way it was

Na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na
The way it was
Na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na
The way it was

I don't need to know what we're heading for
Babe, I'm not looking back
Listen to your feet on the wooden floor
Don't need nothing else but that
You know you don't have to take
Your past mistakes into the dawn
So drop off your bags, don't break your back
We're gonna keep moving on
We're moving on, we're moving on
We're moving on, we're moving on

Oh, we never gonna go back to the way it was
Oh, and we're never gonna go back to the way we was
Tell me if you wanna roll with the rest of us
Cause, oh, it's never gonna go back to the way it was

The way it was, the way it was
The way it was, the way it was
