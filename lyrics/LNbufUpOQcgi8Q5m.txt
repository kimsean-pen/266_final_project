Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah

I watched the world from the side of the moon
Looking at the stars looking back to you
Just to see if you were still alive
Looking at the sun with the fire in your eyes

It's hard to know where I stand
Even the man on the moon
couldn't tell me where to land
But I wanted to fly in the sea
With no gravity to pull me down

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
'Cause the steps get bigger so go ahead and walk them off
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away

Oh, oh
No, no

So tell me this one thing, now listen to me close
You steal from me, but you call it your own
You liar, you thief
Go make your stand on your own two feet

So whoa now, whoa now
Listen what your friends say
Go now, go now
Go and do it that way
I'm the one you want to believe
But in your heart you can't see

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
'Cause the steps get bigger so go ahead and walk them off
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away

Oh, let it fall
Let it fall

Hold on it won't take long
You can find yourself if you decide to finally start
Don't look to me when you fall
'Cause the steps get bigger so go ahead and walk them off
And you know how I feel
So don't let your life start to slowly waste away
