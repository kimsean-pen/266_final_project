What can I do?
Will I be getting throught?
Now that I must try
To leave it all behind
Did you see
What you have done to me

So hard to justify
Slowly is passing by
Forever and one
I will miss you
However, I kiss you
Yet again

Way down in neverland
...
So hard I was triyng
Tomorrow I'll sill be crying
How could you hide
Your lies, your lies

Here I am
...
Seeing you once again
My mind's so far away
My heart's so close
To stay

Too proud to fight
I'm walking back into night
Will I ever find
Someone to belive?
...
Forever and one
I will miss you
However, I kiss you
Yet again
Way down in neverland
...
So hard I was triyng
Tomorrow I'll sill be crying
How could you hide your lies
Your lies
