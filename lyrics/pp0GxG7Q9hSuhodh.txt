This is my emergency
Let me feel your apathy

Are we swimming in the same ol' sea?
The one where you don't care to rescue me
There's water in my lungs again
The moon's reflection has no end
The taste of salt my biggest sin
The taste of you my only sin

You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay

You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay

This is my emergency
Let me feel your apathy

Hold me underneath the cold moonlight
Where I believe every lie you told to me
Tell me once more that I'm safe
I never believed, so give me faith
The fear of death is sinking in
I'd rather die than sink with you

You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay

You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay

You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
You can't make it okay
