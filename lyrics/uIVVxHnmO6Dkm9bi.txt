Any time now they will force the door
Any time now, any time
Just can't get right down, pedals to the floor
Any time now, any time

And they call you delusive
But I always need you near
And they call you abusive
But I always need you near

Pass the front line, way beyond through cold
Biding time now, biding time
As expected, we will reach that shore
Any time now, any time

And they call you delusive
But I always need you near
And they call you abusive
But I always need you near

And they call you delusive
But I love you and you do me no harm
And they call you abusive
But I always need you near

And they call you delusive
But I always need you near
And they call you abusive
But I always need you near

And they call you delusive
But I love you and you do me no harm
And they call you abusive
But I love you and you do me no harm
