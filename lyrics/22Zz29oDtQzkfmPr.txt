So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

You could say that I'm going insane
And I'm not quite right
And I'm that to blame

You could say that I'm sick on the inside
Bet you don't know why I like it that way

You could say whatever you like
If it's so wrong I don't wanna be right

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

So what?
So what?

You could say that I'm going insane
And I'm not quite right
And that I'm to blame

I don't care you could say what you want to
I am who I am and I'll never be like you

You could say whatever you like
If it's so wrong I don't wanna be right

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker than sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

So what?
So what?

And when I'm up
It's better than never
And when I'm down
I'm desperate

And when I'm up
It's better than never
And when I'm down
I'm desperate
I'm desperate
I'm desperate

So what if I'm crazier than crazy?
So what if I'm sicker then sick?
So what if I'm out of control?
Maybe that's what I like about it

So what?
So what?
