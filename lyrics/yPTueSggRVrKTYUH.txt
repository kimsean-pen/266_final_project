People say I'm in the way
People say never betray
Oh when I've gone, when I've gone
You'll turn to me when I've gone, when I've gone

Need a little understanding for all I've done
In another situation I don't belong (belong)

Every day humiliate
Every way solemn in trait
Oh when I've gone, when I've gone
You'll turn the key when I've gone
Don't belong...

Need a little understanding for all I've done
In another situation I don't belong
Need a little understanding for all I've done
In another situation I would belong (belong)

Need a little understanding for all I've done
In another situation I don't belong
Need a little understanding for all I've done
In another situation I would belong (belong)
