teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may set the world ablaze
for it is cold
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may cry out loud my wrath
and my passion
or else my coil will blister and decay

the soul is never silent
but wordless
held imprisoned
in a cursed tomb
wherein reflections never fade
never die
slowly maddened
by the emptiness

left to perish in the ever-dark coil
yet, always alert it its slumber
scorn by the drops of light
piercing through the surface
and it screams

the soul is never silent
but wordless

teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may set the world ablaze
for it is cold
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter
teach me the tongue of fire
so that I may cry out loud my wrath
and my passion
or else my coil will blister and decay
