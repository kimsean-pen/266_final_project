Falling in this great divide
The earth, it splits, and my feet on both sides
Oh, my faith is shaky

I got to keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
Keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
When it all feels broken
Got to keep your hope alive

Falling in this great divide
The earth it shifts, and I'm on the other side
And I swear the world's going crazy

But I still keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
Keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
When it all feels broken
Got to keep my hope alive

'Cause this war won't wage itself
It's time we tip the scales
With the weight of the world on our selves now
And I've been wrong a thousand times or more
But I keep on letting on

Keep on hoping
Keep on hoping
Keep on hoping
Keep on hoping

Got to keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
Keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
It all feels broken
Got to keep your hope alive
Got to keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
Keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
When it all feels broken

You know I'll stick around, hey
Keep on hoping
