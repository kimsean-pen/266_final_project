I watch you wash away
I watched you go
Pretend you never cared at all

Your eyes in front of me
They look so dead
Pretend you never cared at all

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around

I watch you toss away
I watch you fall
Pretend you never cared at all

You won't be here to see
I watched you go
Pretend you never cared at all

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around

And I saw you there
Sitting underground
And I know,
And I know you're not around
