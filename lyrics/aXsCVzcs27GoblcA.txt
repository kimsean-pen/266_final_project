Heart like a love song,
touch like a juggernaut
Hit like a wave
Knocking me down again
Body forever
Every breath you take blows me away
You were the one to separate, leave me, nothing
This is the love that deviates, takes away, hurting

I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I can't get over you, eh
No matter what I do
I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you

I can't get over you

Words like a bullet
Force of a wrecking ball
Breaking down, you kept me at the borderline
Holding tight, barely breathing

You never let me see the light
Close my eyes, prayin'

I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I can't get over you, eh
No matter what I do
I can't get over you, I can't get over you
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
I can't get over you
No matter what I do
I can't get over you
