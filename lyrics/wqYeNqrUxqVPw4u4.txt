Have you ever been compelled
Under a spell
From a protagonist who knows you far too well
Have you ever been undone
By a slip of the tongue
And portrayed a side of you who fell hard once
So we watched the water swell
From a Scottish hotel
Have you ever fell?
Have you ever fell?

Are you going to tell me why
There's a backpack by the bedroom window?
It's a pack of lies
Everything has to reach a peak sometime
Tell me why
There's a map laying flat on the bedside table
It's a pack of lies
It's not a peak it's a plateau

Let me know
When you want to leave this island
Let me know
When you want to hear my point of view

In the observation lounge
Couples ready to pounce
There's a reticence of dread and icy ground
So we watched the water swell
From the Scottish hotel
Have you ever fell?
Have you ever fell?

Are you going to tell me why
There's a backpack by the bedroom window
It's a pack of lies
Everything has to reach a peak sometime
Tell me why
There's a map laying flat on the bedside table
It's a pack of lies
It's not a peak it's a plateau

Let me know
When you want to leave this island
Let me know
When you want to hear my point of view
Let me know
When you want to leave this island
Let me know
When you want to hear my point of view

I'll stand up for you
I'll stand up for you
I'll stand up for you

I will act as a semaphore
I will guide you to a perfect landing
I will act as a distant shore
I will live to be the last man standing for you
I will act as a semaphore
I will guide you to a perfect landing

I'll stand up for you
I'll stand up for you
When you want to leave this island
When you want to hear my point of view
