I find a photo by the stairs
I'm unsure what it's doin' there
It sparks my memories
When we parked aside the shore
I kissed you there, the ocean air enchanting
It shakes me quickly
I've got to be somewhere
I lost my keys, I won't find them here

All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
I saw a red light up ahead
And so I took a left instead
We soon get lost and park the car
You find your way into my heart

And now I've taken ten steps back
I run through fire to find this trap
And I burned contently
Our end is comin' soon
But one more time I'll forget with you, enchanted
As I hold your face, I can't find the words I need
And soon the opportunity is drownin'
It's sunken and drowning

All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
I saw a red light up ahead
And so I took a left instead
We soon get lost and park the car
You find your way into my heart

You got me poisoned but you won't stop comin' around
No you won't stop comin' around
I know you're poison when I sink my teeth into you

All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
All I want
All I want is you
Your violet disposition
My unsound intuition
I saw a red light up ahead
And so I took a left instead
We soon get lost and park the car
You find your way into my heart

I'm never lost when I'm with you
Except I know that isn't true
I call the cab that takes you home
Tomorrow I don't wanna know
