The three priests inside
Pick, scratch and bleed
My friend's witch's tit
The hands be plentiful but full
A welcome and a warning
Confession begat needing
Conviction required reading
The hands be plentiful but full
As we all know
Accidents begin at home
As my scars attest
The hands be plentiful but full
The scents of genocide
You can't buy experience like that
The scents of genocide
You can't smell experience like that
The hands be plentiful but full
The scents of genocide
Genocide
