You had the worst intentions
And I let you get the best of all my friendships
You cut ties with no regrets
But in the end I hope you get what's coming
With your worst intentions, worst intentions

So have another drink
And try to think of the last time that you lost sight
Of everything you had within your reach
Before the ground fell from beneath your feet
Face facts, I know you're just dying for all the attention
All of the tension's been building up, building up
Just to come crashing down when you're not around
So you can say what you will but I know

Let's set this story straight right now
You dug your own grave
Your lies will bury you alive
Now it's time to lie in the mess you made
You've got your back against the wall
But this time there's no one there to take the fall
'Cause you're alone and all on your own
With nowhere to run to, who will you turn to?
So you can play me but I should have known

Tell me something
How do you fall asleep at night?
Knowing you're the cause of all of this

You set yourself up for failure
You took the best of me and made it history
You set yourself up to fail
And I know you will
