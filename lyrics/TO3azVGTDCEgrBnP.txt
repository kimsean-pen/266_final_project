From our lives
The land disappears
All that is left is a heart made of tears
From her smile the golden tooth is worn
Child you're only hope has flown
Hold on to this house
All I have left is the only place I've been

It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's hard, hard to run
It's not that much fun
It's all heart and lungs
It's all...
