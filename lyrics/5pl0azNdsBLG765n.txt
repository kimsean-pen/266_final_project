Don't want diamonds, don't want gold
Don't need no fashion baby, don't wanna be cool
Don't wanna hustle just to get thru
When it all comes down babe
All I want is you

Don't wanna argue, don't wanna fight
Don't want no politics babe all thru the night, no
I told ya before gonna tell ya once more
For the last time baby open up your door
All I want is you
All I want is you
Not any old girl will do
All I want is you
If ya don't need love ya gotta be nuts
The heaviest metal always rusts
Just you and me babe hangin' tough
It's gotta be
It's gonna be

It's gotta be love or bust!
Baby
Don't need a doctor, don't need a nurse

Don't need a prescription babe

For the last time baby open up your door

The heaviest metal always rusts
