The thought of one more [?]
Like a [?] guard your [?]
But when [?] are echoing through the halls
Flying to freedom, fly a hundred foot

Bells ring when things get out of hand
Barbarian kings come crash your paradise

[?] buried deep in [?] of dust
[?] stretch to reach the fray
Behind a pair of [?] golden rust
Feed parasitic [?]

Bells ring when things get out of hand
Barbarian kings come crash your paradise

[?] to preserve [?] beauty [?] thousand [?] dust [?]

Bells ring when things get out of hand
Barbarian kings come crash your paradise
