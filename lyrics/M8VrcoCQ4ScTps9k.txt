Kiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone
Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.

America has heard the bugle call
And you know it involves us one and all
I don't suppose that war will ever end
There's fighting that will break us up again
Goodbye my darling, Hello Vietnam
A hill to take a battle to be won

Kiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone
Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.

A ship is waiting for us at the dock
America has trouble to be stopped
We must stop communism in that land
Or freedom will start slipping through our hands
Goodbye my darling...

I hope and pray someday the world will learn
That fires we don't put out will bigger burn
We must save freedom now at any cost
Or someday our own freedom will be lost

Kiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone
Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.
