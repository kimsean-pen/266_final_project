I'm happy is I am
Cause I'm leaving
Days will be the same
In a different away

Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

We'll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won't die un the city

We'll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won't die un the city

We'll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won't die un the city

Right eyelids closet
Both feet behind
I aim for tomorrow
Work on my mind

Going to a place
Where I used to stay
Writing something new
In this home I know

We'll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog
Won't die un the city

We'll be all right
Stay here some time
This country dog won't die un the city
