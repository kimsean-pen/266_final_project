Frankie Laine, he was singin' "Jezebel"
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl

I said, "Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So, won't you let me see?"
I said, "Won't you let me see?"
I said, "Won't you let me see your naked body?"

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do almost anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice

Ah, but no you cannot see
She said, "No you cannot see"
She said, "No you cannot see my naked body"

So we're dancing close, the band is playing 'Stardust'
Balloons and paper streamers, they're floating down on us
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love"

In solemn moments such as this, I have put my trust
And all my faith to see, I said, all my faith to see
I said, all my faith to see her naked body

Oh, oh, naked body, oh, oh, all my faith to see
All my faith, oh, oh, all my faith
Oh, oh, all my faith to see her naked body
Her naked bo-bo-body
And all my faith to see, I said, all, all my faith
I said, all, all, all my faith to see
All my faith to see her naked body
