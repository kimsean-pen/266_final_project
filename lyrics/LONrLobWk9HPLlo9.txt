[Hello!?]

And there's the rub
We can talk for a while
But I have sweet nothings to say
You don't want me anyway, you don't want me anyway
So why, why should I stay?

So goodbye to you and your life
Your new best friends, your confidence
And I'll be here when you get home

Sitting halfway, away from nowhere
Praying for our lips to touch
Holding myself for a second
Just to catch a smile on this line

So goodbye to you and your life
(Two months, eight weeks)
Your new best friends your confidence
(Turn my hours into days)
And I'll be here when you get home
(When you get home)
So goodbye to you and your life
(Two months, eight weeks)
Your new best friends your confidence
(Turn my hours into days)
And I'll be here when you get home, when you get home

"I can't feel the same about you anymore..."

Is it just like you said it would be,
I can't feel this way about you anymore
Is it just like you said it would be
(It's never easy)
I can't feel the same
I can't feel this way
I can't feel the same about you anymore
(It's never easy)
