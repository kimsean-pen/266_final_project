you were going home
last day was to end never seen again
only seventeen

he was there for you calling out your name
lisa watch out in the night

this is so unfair
flying far away never coming back

so this is in the air
what if we could call spirits back to us alive
chances are too slim

hold me down inside
when i caught you in the alley
i'm pretty sure that you will die

she will dance in silent hill
a dance that is so still
flowers on the ground

the rain is all that sounds
we lift our heads in the air
too see the meaning of this war
against your own soul

life is too short
to find yourself afraid of his sort
this is not like the plan
you just thought that it had the longer span

your family
won't see your face
anymore
or not even your grace

she wants to dance
i will pray
what if it was my daughter?
hold me down
i will kill
the creep that took
your life

life is too short
to find yourself afraid of his sort
this is not like the plan
you just thought that it had the longer span

experience the being...
not much longer than you're seeing
further away from your frame
who's the man to blame?

life is very frail
it's so easy to fail
climb out the hole
it's a mission to get up with your soul
