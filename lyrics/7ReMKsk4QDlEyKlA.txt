The autumn clouds
Are caving in
And night comes
Crawling black as sin
Lightning strikes
And rain begins
A storm that tares my soul
I toss and twizzle in my bed
My thoughts are
Spinning in my head
Darkness nears
Soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control

I spent my life
In foolish quest
For gold and riches
I'd contest
And now I'm left
With just regrets
To late to change my ways
My life it seems
Has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say

My life has been a waste

WHEN!
When time has come
For me to leave
WHEN!
When judgment's passed
Upon my life
WHEN!
A cold dark grave
Awaits for me
WILL!

Will my name
Live endlessly?

WHEN!
When time has come
For me to leave

WHEN!
When judgment's passed
Upon my life

WHEN!
A cold dark grave
Awaits for me
WILL!
Will my name
Live endlessly?
So I die but won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born
So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away
DIE!
All friends and
cattle pass away!
DIE!
And death will come
For every man!
DIE!
But I know
One thing never dies!
DOOM!
The sentence passed
Upon the dead!
NOW!
The time has come
For me to leave
NOW!
And judgment's passed
Upon my life
NOW!
I will rest in my dark grave
WILL!
They speak my name
With reverence?
My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
