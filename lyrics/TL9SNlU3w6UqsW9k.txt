Charriot traces carved in sand
Once more, pain, will expand my land
Each arrow thrown
Strengthen my throne

Bounds to my realm, the sword shall set
My blade was the one that you've last met
With red-stained hands,
The victor stands

From wisdom to hate
From wisdom to hate

Intrude my peace... war, I'll proclaim
Your empty skull will be my gain
I will, with greed
Watch yourself bleed

With envious eyes, on me you've sined
Each place I pass are left to ruins
On your decline
My reign will shine

From wisdom to hate
From wisdom to hate

I am the one which none defies
Warfare and I are unified

Wisdom collapse
Hatred soon will rise

Charriot traces carved in sand
Once more, pain, will expand my land
Each arrow thrown
Strengthen my throne

Bounds to my realm, the sword shall set
My blade was the one that you've last met
With red-stained hands,
The victor stands

I am the one which none defies
Warfare and I are unified
