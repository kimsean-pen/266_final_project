Jackie left home on a cold dark night
Telling me he'd be home
Served the seas for a hundred years and left me all alone
and I've been dead for twenty years
I've been washing the sand with my ghostly tears
Searching the shores for my Jackie oh
I remember the day that a young man came
He said your Jackie is gone
We got lost in the rain
I ran to the beach
And laid me down
You're all wrong I said and they stared to the sand
That man knows the sea like the back of his hand
He'll be back sometime
Laughing at you
And I've been waiting all this time
For my man to come
And take his hand in mine
And lead me away
To unseen shores
I've been washing the sand with my ghostly tears
Searching the shore
These long years
And I'll walk the seas
Forever more
Till I find
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh
My Jackie oh oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
My Jackie oh
My jackie oh
