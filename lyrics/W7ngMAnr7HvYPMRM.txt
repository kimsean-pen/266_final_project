Lost my only contact with the outside of your room
Collect the specs of nothing that I had left for you
I'd say anything I could if only it would make you stay
This interest is dis-interesting I fail with words you burden me

No, not scared
But sad to say the least
My guard, fell down, with the walls created weak
I felt your love, your stupid love that you had wasted all on me
Taste the bitterness of me
I hope you sob, I hope you weep

I don't get it, I'm not on my hands and knees
If begging's what you like then I will plead
Nothing speaks to me or comforts me
I'm not getting sleep, barely functioning
Bury the blame it's all your fault because I'm
lost and I'm found but I'm alone in the long run again

Why won't you fall for me?
I'm distant like you asked me to be

No, not scared
But sad to say the least
My guard, fell down, with the walls created weak
I felt your love, your stupid love that you had wasted all on me
Taste the bitterness of me
I hope you sob, I hope you weep

Distant like you asked
Hang over my head
My ribs bruised not broken from holding it all in
Distant like you asked
Hang over my head
My ribs bruised not broken from holding it all in
I see your face unlike the others, I'm sure I'm thought about at times
If the only way way is over it, our time has to die

No, not scared
But sad to say the least
My guard, fell down, with the walls created weak
I felt your love, your stupid love that you had wasted all on me
Taste the bitterness of me
I hope you sob, I hope you weep

I felt your love, your stupid love that you had wasted all on me
Taste the bitterness of me
I hope you sob, I hope you weep
