The plague that is your eyes
A joke to break one's heart
A joke to break your heart

The dream of love to come
When you leave
All life will end
The dream of love to come
When you leave
All light will end

To bash through paradise
The skull that is your heart
The skull that eats ones heart

The dream of love to come
When you leave
All life will end
The dream of love to come
When you leave
All light will end

To want what you don't want
To want what you don't want
You called me a mattress
