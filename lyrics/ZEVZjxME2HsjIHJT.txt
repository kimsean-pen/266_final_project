Roses
I walked in the coroner with the body screaming donor
Never sold a bag but looking like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo

You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, I'm a fiend
She might get it popping, I might wife a photo queen
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it up
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast never last, couple life don't last

Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga roll, show you all of me
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell young girl you cute but bald
And that shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who to call us

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it up
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast never ask, life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga roll, show you all of me

I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh lord it's hopeless
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, already know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it ...

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it up
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast never last, couple life don't last

Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga roll, show you all of me
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no
