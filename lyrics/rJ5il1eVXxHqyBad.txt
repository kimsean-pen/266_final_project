He lives in his imagination
With those friends of his very own
He doesn't get along with the outside world
He'd rather be alone

Sometimes when it's late at night
He starts to wonder why
The plans he made can never happen
So all he does is cry

His parents, they can't understand
Why their son, he turned out wrong
He runs away from all the pain
Forgets them when he's gone

He'd rather be all by himself
Because his plans they seem the best
He finally gets the nerve one day
Now life becomes a test

Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say

Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say

Mom and dad, I'm sorry
Mom and dad, don't worry

I'm not the son you wanted
But what could you expect?
I've made my world of happiness
To combat your neglect

Mom and dad, I'm sorry
Mom and dad, don't worry
Mom and dad, I'm sorry
Mom and dad, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry

Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say

Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say

Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do
Wherever you go, whatever you say
