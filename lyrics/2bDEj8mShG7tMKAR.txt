Well I say a sad goodbye
And then I move on
Well baby my heart goes blind whenever you're gone
And I know that you'll come back
And that gets me by
But holding you in my arms
Oh well that gets me high
And I hope that this is never ending
I just wanna see how it unfolds
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
Just say you'll stand right here forever
Through every high and through every low
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
And I don't care where you hide
Or secrets you keep
Well baby if this love's a knife
Then bury it deep
Cause you know my heart would break if you said goodbye
So if you don't feel the same
Then just tell me a lie
And I hope that this is never ending
I just wanna see how it unfolds
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
Just say you'll stand right here forever
Through every high and through every low
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
Oh no no no no
Oh no
No no no no
Oh woah
Don't wanna know
I hope that this is never ending
I just wanna see how it unfolds
So if you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
Ooh, just say that you'll stand right here forever
Through every high and through every low
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show
Cause I don't wanna know
