The night that suddenly become deep too
Can't hold my breathing for long
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
A wild shake cannot wake us up
Do believe that it's done
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my god

Baby blue, has the light gone out?
Baby blue, ahh
Your eyes are deeper than the oceans go
Tell me love, is there hope?

Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
Oh my, we're beginning to blue, oh
