When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town
Down around San Antone
And the folks are risin' for another day
'Round about their homes

The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you talkin' 'bout your China Grove
(talkin' 'bout your china grove)
Whoa, oh (whoa, oh) China Grove

Well the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin' and they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes underground

They say that the father's insane
And dear Mrs. Perkin's a game
Well, talkin' 'bout your China Grove
(talkin' 'bout your china grove)
Whoa, oh (whoa, oh) China Grove

But everyday there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies with their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night

Though it's a part of the Lone Star State
People don't seem to care
They just keep on lookin' to the east

Talkin' 'bout your China Grove
(talkin' 'bout your china grove)
Whoa, oh (whoa, oh) China Grove
