A love affair too much to bare
I'm well aware
You said you needed me, but I was always there
I was always here

Your heart was scared, I guess that's fair
But no one compared
Hallucinating you was a like a month of air
Such a breath of air

I wonder if you've ever loved someone
As much as you say you love me
No other one could ponder up a love
Enough to make me feel complete

Oh, how did you save me?
When no one else thought I was worth saving?
You keep my soul racing
You kissed my lips and, oh, baby

Meet me at the lake tonight
Will you ever take the dive?
Look at me, baby, I see heaven in your eyes
(You're still my angel)
There was a time it wasn't beautiful
A love that's blind will never truly grow
So I will drown, yeah, drown

You saved me
When no one else thought I was worth saving
You keep my soul racing
You kissed my lips and, oh, baby

You heard my heart
You heard my heart
You heard my soul
We fall apart, apart so hard
But don't let go
We don't let go
