Another warning without any trace
Another kick straight in your face
Another morning you'll be on the run
Trouble is coming 'till the day is done

Another strike no more peace alive
Another hit nothing humanized
We want the truth broken and abused
The finger on the trigger is no excuse

The optimist is talking
About a chance to survive
The realist is praying
Waiting for a way to die
The pessimist's destructive
We're the hounds of justice
The hounds of justice

Another warning the lands will burn
There's no surrender and the evil returns
Before you speak you better start thinking
To live on your knees is your own disease

Another boom in the dead of the night
Another flash blinding your eyes
Where is God when we needed him
Chasing shadows on the wall in the killing zone

The optimist is searching
For a chance to survive
The pessimist is praying
Waiting for a lonely way to die
The realist's destructive
We're the hounds of justice
The hounds of justice

The optimist is talking
About a chance to survive
The realist is praying
Waiting for a way to die
The pessimist's destructive
We're the hounds of justice
The hounds of justice
The hounds of justice
The hounds of justice...
