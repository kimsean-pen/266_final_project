I'm on an island and I've got nowhere to swim
Oh, what a mood I am in, I'm on an island
I'm on an island since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind, I'm on an island

But there is nowhere else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island and I've got nowhere to run
Because I'm the only one, who's on the island

But there is nowhere else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island and I've got nowhere to run
Because I'm the only one who's on this island

I'm on an island
I'm on an island
