Go!
Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock 'cause I can't fucking sleep
Soon you'll pay, like a heart attack

Call my friends, I might not make it back
The doctor says I'm heading for destruction

Something's gotta give...
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment
(Ohhhh) And no matter what you do about it

'Bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head!
I stop and stare, scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone

I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's trying to take me out

The doctor says I'm heading for destruction
Can I fucking live?
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment

(Ohhhh) And no matter what you do about it
'Bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement

(Ohhhh) And no matter what you do about it
'Bout it, 'bout it

I'm still in your head!
(Inside your head)
(Inside your head)
I AM YOUR BREAKING POINT
YOU CAN'T RUN, YOU CAN'T HIDE
I'LL BE THERE WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AT NIGHT
I'M ALWAYS WATCHING YOU
The doctor says I'm heading for destruction
My time is wearing thin...
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgment
(Ohhhh) And no matter what you do about it
'Bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb (time bomb) ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement (your judgement)
(Ohhhh) And no matter what you do about it
'Bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
