Every night when your fate will call
Find a way and you take it all

What you got to do to make it
In the times when you feel naked
And you take it all

It's driving near to heaven
If you're brave enough to love it
And you leave me in the door

Baby when I come to get you I'm all I find
Everytime I go to come back to see it's not my time
Everytime I think of something it's on my mind
I tell you when it's all about you, I need you by my side

Every night my heart takes a toll
Be my rock when I lose control

But you pull me through to fake it
In the times when I can't take it
And I choose the door

But you came to win the nowhere
And by my side you show it
And it makes me feel alive

Be my love, my calling to live for, to be my love
It's all that I wait for, to be my own
It's more than you stood for to stop my fall
It's all that oh

Baby when I come to get you I'm all I find
Everytime I go to come back to see it's not my time
Everytime I think of something it's on my mind
I tell you when it's all about you, I need you by my side

Ooooo, oooooo
Ooooo, oooooo

Be my love, my calling to live for, to be my love
It's all that I wait for, to be my own
It's more than you stood for to stop my fall
It's all that oh

Baby when I come to get you I'm all I find
Everytime I go to come back to see it's not my time
Everytime I think of something it's on my mind
I tell you when it's all about you, I need you by my side
