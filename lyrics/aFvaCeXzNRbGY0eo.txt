Your voice
Is taking me to some higher level
Your arms
They protect me against the nasty world
Your sweet eyes
Is a ocean I love to swim
Your my seat belt
You hold me tide
In feather I crash
And even hundred feets above your head
And i'm still thinking about you when I'm there.
Your hands
Always guides me to some better place
Your hair
Draws the lines of your tenderness
Your my seat belt
You hold me tide
In feather I crash
And even hundred feets above your head
And i'm still thinking about you when I'm there.
And even hundred feets above your head
And i'm still thinking about you when I'm there.
And even hundred feets above your head
And i'm still thinking about you when I'm there.
