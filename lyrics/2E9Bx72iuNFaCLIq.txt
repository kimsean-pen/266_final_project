Low now, feelin' low now
This divide inside my mind, I might lose control now
Demons feedin' on my soul, I'm a fuckin' ghost now
And there's nothin' in my chest but a fuckin' hole now (hole now)

Woah now, blood, it flow out
There's a war inside my mind, drugs could dull it all down
Broken hearts and wasted time, tryna work it all out
Take a look inside my eyes, got a heart of stone now (stone now)

Know my head is spun, with thoughts of you I'm overwhelmed
All this pain I hold, I wish I could heal myself
See inside my core, know you were my everything
Without you, have nothing left so I'mma let this pistol sing
Know my head is spun, with thoughts of you I'm overwhelmed
All this pain I hold, I wish I could heal myself
See inside my core, know you were my everything
Without you, have nothing left so I'mma let this pistol sing

Blood run cold like overdose, going toe to toe with death
Smokin' 'till I'm comatose, 'till there just ain't nothin' left
Whiskey with the cyanide, empty bottle by my bed
Depression got no antidote so fill my fucking brain with lead
