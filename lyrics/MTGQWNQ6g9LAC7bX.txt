Tucked it in
Dropped a lie
Turn me off
(I travel I travel)
We never leave each other 'cause we leave each other so cold
It makes a madder way

The easy part is taking yourself in
It's wartime every time
A shot away

Wipe the smile from your face
It's getting in the way
It's wartime every time
She caught me on a lie and she turned me off
She made it cold
You couldn't do it if you wanted to
(believe me believe me)

It's wartime every time
Small talk every time
It's my favourite chloroform

It's pillow talk every time
Get it out the way
Friction war
Shot away

Ricochet
We're like identical twins
Sucking on the same teat
Spitting out the same things
(I travel far, I travel far)
It's wartime every time
Small talk every time
It's my favourite chloroform
It's pillow talk every time
Getting out the way
Friction war
Ricochet

Line'em up and knock'em down
A shot away
A shot away
A shot away
A shot away
