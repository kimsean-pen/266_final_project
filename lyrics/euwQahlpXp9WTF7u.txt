A piece of me is slowly dying to make it through
Secretly I pray so hard now, I bet you did too
What, what what?

I've been feeling all the grace that you've been throwing at my feet, it's so cold, it's so cold

A piece of me is slowly dying to make it through
Secretly I pray so hard now, I bet you did too

You said it so well yourself complex, my complex
Strokes correct, pressure placed on your hips
You said it so well yourself complex, my complex
The morning cities on the back of our necks

Are you with it now?
Can you see the pleasure in it now?
Are you with it now?
Can you see the pleasure in it now?

Say you're with it, say say you're with it
Say you're with it, say say you're with it
Say you're with it, say say you're with it

A piece of me is slowly dying to make it through
Secretly I pray so hard now, I bet you did too
