When we signed up for the army
to a rangers company
armed with M16's
straight into the war

Then we served under the banner
clad in US stars and stripes
and on moonless nights
we marched for endless miles

Once we were soldiers
once we were young
we have found our peace
we've seen the end

Fallen in war
we belong to history
fallen in war
sleep six feet below

Heart of the brave
cannot bring me back to life
fallen in war
still brothers in arms

We have fought in distant conflict
and for all to many years
seen our friends go down
wounded dead or lost

Know that peace comes at a high price
it may take a thousand lives
and a deep belief
sacrifice of men

Once we were soldiers
Once we were young
We have found our peace
We've seen the end
Fallen in war
We belong to history
Fallen in war
Sleep six feet below
Heart of the brave
Cannot bring me back to life
Fallen in war
Still brothers in arms
Shining heart beats no more
Buried deep, deep in cold earth
Shallow grave in my motherland
Here I stay, here in darkness, forever
Fallen in war
We belong to history
Fallen in war
Sleep six feet below
Heart of the brave
Cannot bring me back to life
Fallen in war
Still brothers in arms
