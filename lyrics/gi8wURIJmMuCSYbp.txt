I am a phantom over the battlefield
Aye aye aye phantom over the battlefield
The zebra stripe the zebra stripe of stupidity
Phantom over the battlefield
Take a look here, there take a look it's always more of the same
Take a seat there in the electric chair
I am the phantom over a battlefield I am a phantom over
the battlefield aye aye aye aye aye aye over the battlefield
