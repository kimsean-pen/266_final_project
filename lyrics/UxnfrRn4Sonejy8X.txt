Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get Back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

Go home

Get Back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back

Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman

But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta
Go home
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oooh,
Get back, Loretta
Your mama's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back
Oh, yeah
