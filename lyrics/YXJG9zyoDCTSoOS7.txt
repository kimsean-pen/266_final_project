Escape
Just to get away
Too late
Butcher meets the blade
Panic
On the menu
Elevate
But the vantage point is a blurred view
It's a blurred view
Blackout
Spinning all around
You lost it in the high
But I know
You'll find it on the comedown
Illuminate
The flawed perception
Recreate
The same scene
The same reflection
The same reflection
Blackout
Spinning all around
You lost it in the high
But I know
You'll find it on the comedown
You'll find it on the comedown
Find it on the comedown
But I don't wanna come down
But I don't wanna come down
Escape
Just to get away
Too late
Butcher meets the blade
Panic
On the menu
Elevate
But the vantage point is a blurred view
Vertigo
Blackout
Spinning all around
You lost it in the high
But I know
You'll find it on the comedown
You'll find it on the comedown
