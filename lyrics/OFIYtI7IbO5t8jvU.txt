All my windows were barred
The sun made stripes of shades
I was sitting round like a zombie
Feedin' my own face

I was carrying my cheek
I was digging my strange
I was taken you for granted
You were holding the rains

But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
I can hear you louder than ever

It's a slippery slope
Like that mouse trap game
Inside my tunnel vision you slipped
On my train

But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

I don't wanna ignore
You were the past of my feelings
But probably gonna get out of this just
Hear me out anyway
The darkness knockin' and now
I'm down in on all my promises
Don't try to pull me out of this
Just lay down by me and wait

'Cause I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
I can hear you louder than ever

I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
I can hear you louder than ever
