Quiet as that secret you keep
Still in your heart as you sleep
Old as the lay of the land
Cold as all matters at hand
Long as the river of song
Mad as the world it moves on

High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me
High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me

Straight as the wood of the cross
Wild as all the love that you lost
As sure as inside the egg lays the yolk
I'm standing outside the gates of hell
And I'll keep singing 'til I croak (oh baby!)

High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me
High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me

Come lay your head on my lap
And let your hair fall back
You've got to live with yourself
So baby don't look back
Come lay your head on my lap
And let your hair fall back
You've got to live with yourself
So baby don't look back (Don't look back!)

High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me
High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me

High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me
High as the heavenly sea
Low lays the devil in me
