Slouched behind a keyboard
Your fingertips are nails
I've been faced to face you
My social skills surprisingly frail
Come a little closer, I didn't catch your name
Insult me all you want to
But dare you do it to my face?

Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you

You're entitled to your opinion
But I must ask you why
If all you say is hurtful
I would take to hurt your inside
It was heavy on the intent
But light in its effect
And when I'm the subject
Here's the reaction you can expect

Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you

Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
