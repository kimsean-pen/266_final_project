The secrets of sexual attraction

The music's running through me
I'm rushing through the crowd
The sweat is pouring off me
and the beat is dead loud
I want someone to love me
and I know I want it now
These feelings that I'm feeling
must be satisfied somehow
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it

We all feel better in the dark
We all feel better in the dark

My body surges with energy
Shivers down my spine
I look deep in your eyes
and I know that you'll be mine
And now our time has come
and I'm feeling really horny
You're with me
and together we're in ecstasy

We all feel better in the dark
We all feel better in the dark

The music's running through me
I'm rushing through the crowd
The sweat is pouring off me
and the beat is dead loud
I want someone to love me
and I know I want it now
These feelings that I'm feeling
must be satisfied somehow
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it
You want it, you want it, you know you really want it
I want it, I want it, you know I really want it

We all feel better in the dark
We all feel better in the dark
