Chasing the light through darkness
On unbroken fields of barley
Hoping to grab the blinding ray
In order to say I'm sorry

Oh-Ho the snow
Twisting falling
Oh-ho It's cold
Lonely autumn

We suffer
And cause suffering
In our own unique
And terrible way
Holding on for daylight
When the nightmare never ends

Oh-Ho the snow
Twisting falling
Oh-ho It's cold
Lonely autumn

Oh raging beast that lives inside me
Now begins the degredation
This time I'm for real
Letting go of history
Grab hold of the light in darkness
And the sun rises warming
Only to lose control again
And all life darkens

Oh-Ho the snow
Twisting falling
Alone
The dead, cold autumn
