Well it's gonna be a lucky man
That gets to take your hand
And play house with you a while
Girl, I was looking for you
I thought you could pull me through
'Cause I've been slipping down the other side

And anyone that sees you
Anyone that sees you at all
Anyone that sees you at all
They know, they know
They know, they know, they know
What I should have been told
Just by looking

Well it's gonna be a lonely time
But I don't mind
You've always been there
When I've called your name
Girl, and when you smile
Wider than a country mile
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To please you baby

And anyone that knows you
Anyone that knows you at all
Anyone that knows you at all
They know, they know
They know, they know, they know
What I should have been told
Just by looking

There's a wild journey
It builds up inside me when you're around
And the fire is still burning in us
Even now, even now

Oooh no

And anyone that sees you
Anyone that sees you at all
Anyone that sees you at all
They know, they know
They know, they know, they know
What I should have known all along
Just by looking

And there's a wild journey
It builds up inside me while you're around
And the fires still burning in us
Even now, even now
Give this love somewhere to go
If you don't want it, let me know
Somebody will

Well it's gonna be a lucky man
That gets to take your hand
And play house with you a while
