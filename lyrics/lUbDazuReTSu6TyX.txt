You crave attention
As if it's due to you
You want permission
To behave as badly as you do

You want respect, but
You don't act respectable
You want fame to fill the void
Where you once had a soul

But you haven't earned it
You haven't walked long enough in these shoes
You don't deserve it
You haven't nearly paid your dues

It's so pathetic
This image you portray
Shatters like crystal
And slowly fades away

You want the world's eyes
You need the accolades
You want the money
And all the empty praise

But you haven't earned it
You haven't walked long enough in these shoes
You don't deserve it
You haven't nearly paid your dues

When it's all over
What will you have left?
You'll still be incomplete
Forgotten and depressed

You want acceptance
It's all you wanted all along
You want forgiveness
From those who you have wronged

But you haven't earned it
You haven't walked long enough in these shoes
You don't deserve it
You haven't nearly paid your dues
