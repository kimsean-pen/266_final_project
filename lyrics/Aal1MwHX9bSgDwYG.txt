I was at a party and this fella said to me
Something bad is happenin'
I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing
No respect for human rights
Evil times are coming
We are in for darker nights

I said who are you to talk about impending doom?
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said I'm a minister
A big shot in the state
I said I just can't believe it
Boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me
What is right and what is wrong?
He said keep on rocking baby'til the night is gone

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty
He was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation
Do we have some time for us?
I said I was not exactly, waiting for the bus
He said if you're going somewhere can I come along?
I said keep on rocking baby 'til the night is gone

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on
'Til the night is gone
