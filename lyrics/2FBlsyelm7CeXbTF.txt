Remember when there was nothing else to do
But lie in bed and, wonder how it was
Always up to you, and no one else and
Early mornings, made by warnings what's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, I'm not complaining but waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do

Remember when we would hang out every day, and we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say Cause nothing mattered
Never boring, slept in mornings, not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming
It's not important if days are shortened I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do

What's a day when it all ends up the same, and lasts forever?
Can't complain when there's nothing there to blame, and things can't be better
Summer evenings, teenage grievings
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading
No concentration on hesitation
I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do so
Turn my head it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do!
