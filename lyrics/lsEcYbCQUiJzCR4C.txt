It's been three days
You come around here like you know me
Your stuff at my place
Next thing you know you'll be using my toothpaste

Step off, sit down
Get ready, let me tell you who's the boss now
Stay here, get out
Everytime I turn around, you're in my face

Don't care where you think you've been
And how you're getting over.
If you think you got me found, just wait-it gets much colder

Here I am, as perfect as I'm ever gonna be; you'll see
Love me for me
Stick around; I'm not the kind of girl you wanna leave; you'll see
Love me for me
(Shut up!) Come back
No, I didn't really mean to say that!
I'm mixed up, so what?
Yeah, you want me, so you're messed up too!

But I love you, I hate you!
If you only knew what I've been through!
My head is spinning, but my heart is in the right place
Sometimes it has to have itself a little earthquake

Here I am, as perfect as I'm ever gonna be; you'll see
Love me for me

Stick around; I'm not the kind of girl you wanna leave; you'll see,
Love me for me
I've been waiting all my life to finally find you, just so I can push you away

And when you're crawling over broken glass to get to me, that's when I'll let you stay
Uh-Ah!
Here I am, as perfect as I'm ever gonna be; you'll see
Love me for me
Stick around; I'm not the kind of girl you wanna leave; you'll see,
Love me for me
Love me for me
Whoa
Here I am, as perfect as I'm ever gonna be; you'll see
Love me for me
(Love me for me)
Stick around; I'm not the kind of girl you wanna leave; you'll see,
Love me for me
