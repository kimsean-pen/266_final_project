Swimming against the current, it's been this way from day one.
Always an uphill battle, we never got a single handout from anyone.
So tell me, if we were "damaged goods," then what does that make you?
As far as I'm concerned, you're nothing more than just a worthless suit.

We are the rose.
We are the rose that grew from the crack in the concrete.
I never doubted for a second even when you left us on our own.
Don't you wish you would have known?
How does it feel now that you're in the back seat?
I guess you should have had a little more faith in me.

Now I won't take all the credit, but you sure don't deserve an ounce.
So go & talk the talk while we walk the walk.
There's no way that you can stop us now!

We are the rose.
We are the rose that grew from the crack in the concrete.
I never doubted for a second even when you left us on our own.
Don't you wish you would have known?
How does it feel now that you're in the back seat?
I guess you should have had a little more faith in me.

You can lie.
You can cheat your way through life.
You can take what you don't deserve until you die.
You can lie.
You can cheat your way through life.
You can take what you don't deserve until you die.
You can lie.
You can cheat your way through life.

You can take what you don't deserve until you die, but you can never take away our pride.
Because when they said we couldn't WE DID!
One day you'll be forgotten.
When they said we couldn't WE DID!
They'll remember our name forever, because when they said we couldn't WE DID!

I forgive you.
It's not your fault you couldn't see what I saw.
You never were to care about the underdog.

We are the rose.
We are the rose that grew from the crack in the concrete.
I never doubted for a second even when you left us on our own.
Don't you wish you would have known?
How does it feel now that you're in the back seat?
I guess you should have had a little more faith in me.

We are the rose.
We are the rose that grew from the crack in the concrete.
I never doubted for a second even when you left us on our own.
You left us on our own!
I guess you should have had a little more faith in me.
