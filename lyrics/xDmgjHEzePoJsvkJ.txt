Floating on a cloud
Feeling high
It happens every time
Whenever I'm with my guy

Tripping on love
And it feels so good
I can't help myself
And I wouldn't if I could

'Cause he's got that certain touch
That I'm addicted to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I can do

Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it

Moving over close
Can't get enough
I've just got to have
All of my baby's love

And when I'm alone
Feeling sad and blue
He gives me a shot of love
And I'm as good as new

Helpless as I am
As if I don't care
His tenderness is what I miss
Whenever he's not here

Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it

There just ain't no one else
Who can bring out the love in me
So many guys have tried
They've tried to capture my eye
But he's the only one I see

Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it

Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it

Oh I'm, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
