If you've ever owned a car
Or you rent a car
Or you have a company car
Then count that up
Add it to the evergrowing list of
things you can't claim all the credit for
If your mother had a job
Your dad had a job
When you're growing up then count that up
'Cause [?] wants a penny some the only kind of capital

If you've ever visited another
country and walked through passport control
Then count that up
One more stamp in the book you'd like to call my own genius
Count it up
If you get to choose the clothes you wear and how you cut your hair
Then count that up
Count it up
And you knew lies you democratic power for the good of somebody else

Then try to
Count
Count
Count
Count it up

?? fashion for??
Can't we give each other the tiniest benefit of it all

If you can go through day to day without the fear of violence
Count that up
Count it up
If people don't stare at you on the
street because of the colour of your skin
Count that up
Count it up
If your body makes some kind of sense to you
Count that up
Count it up
And use the breath you have left to say something that [?]
Then try to count it up
If you can turn on the tap
And your kids can drink the water
Count that up
Count it up
If you've ever had the luxery of turning down a job
Count that up
Count it up
If you had books and you had
magazines in your house when you were kids
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget to count it up
Count it up
