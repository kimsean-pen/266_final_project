Hiding behind the shadows
I'll be waiting in the dark
To drive this blade straight through your heart
I'll drag your body to the car
As blood races down my arm
I think everyone will wonder where you are (tonight)

I'll hide you in my walls
Your body will never be found
I'll wear your skin as a suit
Pretend to be you
Your friends will like you
More than they used too

Dear diary my teen angst bullshit has a body count! (count!)
I believe its 6 going on 7 now! (7 now!)

I've been dreaming about you
In a pool of your own blood
With your eyes gouged out
By the work of my thumbs
The scent of your insides
From under the floorboards
The perfect perfume
For settling a score

I'll hide you in my walls
Your body will never be found
I'll wear your skin as a suit
Pretend to be you, your friends will like you more than they used too
Pretend to be you, your friends will like you more than they used too

Ride the wings of Pestilence!
Ride the wings of Pestilence!
Ride the wings of Pestilence!
