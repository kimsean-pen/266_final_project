Close your eyes the stars shining bright
moon's silver beams bring you sweet dreams
and your face will be covered with roses.
Will you wake up? Nobody knows...

Night surrounds you dark and cold
bad thoughts will grow, capture your soul
and your heart will be frozen with ice breeze.
Will you grow warm? Nobody knows...

Sleep comes over you, steels your thoughts
nightmares come true, burn your cold hearts
and what you feel and your thoughts no more real at night
hope there is light that will guide you to feel what is right

Sleep comes over you steels your thoughts
nightmares come true burn your cold hearts
and what you feel and your thoughts no more real at night
hope there is light that will guide you to feel what is right
