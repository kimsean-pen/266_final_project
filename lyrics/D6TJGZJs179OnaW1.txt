We were spitting venom at most everyone we know
If the damned gave us a road map then we'd know just where to go
Now let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
Well you were talking soda pop you talk it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give are the opinions I ain't got
So let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Let it all fall off, there oh, oh

Well you were spitting venom at most everyone you know
If you truly knew the gravity you'd know which way to go
Well let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
My ears were pressing firmly right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out your words were not so clear
Now drop

Hold on to what you need, we've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need, we've got a knack for messed up history

Well we went downtown, and we sat in the rain
Both looking one direction and waiting for a train
I thought over, thought over
I don't know who kept track, I didn't know there was a score
Well it looks like you're the winner I ain't gonna play no more
It's over, game over

Well we walked real stiff and our cane's hit the ground
You hit me with yours and said you're gonna stare me down
It's over, oh it's over
You can say what you want but don't act like you care
It takes more than one person to decide what's fair
It's over, think it over

You were spitting venom at most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map then you'd know just where to go
So we carried all the groceries in while hauling out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless I do not know what can
So who's to say what a rotten thing to say such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you sorry
What I always did, what I always did, what I always had to sling
So let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off
Let it drop, let it all drop, let it all drop
Oh let it all fall off

Cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had
Well, cheer up baby, it wasn't always quite so bad
For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had

Cheer up baby, it wasn't really always quite so bad
