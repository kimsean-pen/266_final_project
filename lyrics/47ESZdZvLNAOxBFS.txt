Between you and I,
And the starlight of the sky,
Nothin' and no one would ever know,
Galaxies high, you take me so fully,
As we jive through tonight,
Holdin' nothin' from eyes,

All I ever need, is you to take this crown,
Just lay me down,
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love,
Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I *repeat throughout*)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy

Violets are blue,
'N' every color, brings remnants of you,
Reach up and touch what you can feel,
Captivated, so surreal,
Drowning inside,
Of your soul that runs so deep,
As I'm lying here beside you, Infatuated, I'm so weak

All I ever need, is you to take this crown,
Just lay me down,
All I have, is you to pull me through
This world that I'm in, my love,
Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I *repeat througout*)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy

Baby, please,
Say that you'll understand
That tonight, is a night, to love again,
Sweet memories,
of kisses we've blown in the wind,
And I'll cherish this quiet time we spend alone

Between you and I (Just you and I, Just you and I *repeat throughout*)
Baby, Just can't stop lovin' you,
Your kisses, are haunting my head
Between you and I darlin',
Nothin' could get better baby,
I just love when you call me lady,
oh ya know that drives me crazy
