I'll be around,
No matter how
You treat me now
I'll be around from now on.

Your latest love
Can never last,
And when its past,
I'll be around when he's gone

Good-bye again,
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then,
Oh drop a line to say you 're feeling fine

And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see
You're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone.

Good-bye again,
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then,
Oh drop a line to say your feeling fine

And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see
You're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone.
