Earthquake

King of dysfunction
You little drama queen
I got myself an original one
You're the same as me and
We're constantly one day from disaster
I think I'd rather see the
Plaster on the walls come falling at you
You look amazing

I think we lost ourself a bit here
Mate, it might be fascinating
Torrential rain and we grab
Our coats again, storm chasing
A heat wave's coming and we know
We forget the water
I feel close to you
hiding under a table when our
World shakin', feel we're stable

Earthquake

That's right, it's all falling down tonight
no hiding in the corners with a swinging light
As it's moving past your face
It illuminates, you look amazing
One day from disaster

I think we lost ourself a bit here
Mate, it might be fascinating
Torrential rain and we grab
Our coats again, storm chasing
A heat wave's coming and
We know, we forget the water
I feel close to you
Hiding under a table when our
World shakin', feel we're stable

Earthquake

(Shakin', feel we're stable)
