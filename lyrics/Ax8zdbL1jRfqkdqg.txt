Clap your hands, all so right
(Turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, all so right
Clap your hands, all so right
Clap your hands, all so right
If tomorrow is judgment day
(Sing mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
If I wake-up in World War III
(World War, in World War III)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
'Cause your love is my love
(My love)
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break-us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
(Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break-us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
If I lose my fame and fortune
(Really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station
(Okay)
It's okay, if you're sleeping with me
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
(Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay, as long as I got you baby
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
(Is your love, baby)
It would take an eternity to break-us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break-us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day
(Every, every day)
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
(Oh no, no, no)
And no matter what the people say
(It really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
'Cause your love (love) is my love
And my love is your love
(Your love)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
(Can't hold us)
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
(Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
(Is my love)
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break-us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
