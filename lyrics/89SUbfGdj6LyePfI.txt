Tohu Tehom Theli Than Leviathan Tanin'iver Taninsam!

We invoke thee, Black Dragon of Chaos
We evoke thee, O mighty dragon force
Awaken now from your aeonic slumber -- rise up from the abyss
Dragon of forgotten lore - let your Chaos rule forever more
Lotan - Raise your seven heads and let the ancient ones rule again

Apep - Dragon of devouring darkness, supreme ruler of emptiness
Open up your black diamond eyes and rejoice as Ra's creation dies

Jormungand - Lord of the poisonous sea, fulfill the twilight prophecy
Unleash your hatred upon all life and kill this world in the final strife
Tiamat - Queen of the formless deep - The Eleventh seal is now broken
Hark to your children's invocations and awaken from your dreadful sleep

Leviathan - Tortuous one, by your Wrathful Chaos our war will be won
Bring forth your darkness, grant us your grace and enlighten us in your wicked ways
Typhon - Lord of dark desires, purify us with your smokeless fires
Make us at one with thyself and walk the earth once again
