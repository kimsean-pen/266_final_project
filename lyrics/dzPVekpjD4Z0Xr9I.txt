Do you or don't you want this to be your song?
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along
This art is weak in its pretty, pretty frame
And I am a monkey with a misspelled name

I'll put down your disco
And take you heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I am born again

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

Do you or don't you want to take this hit?
Does it make you feel like you're a part of "it"?

I'll put down your disco
And take you heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I am born again

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

The Valley of the Dolls is
The Valley of the Dead
The Valley of the Dolls is
The Valley of the Dead

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you

I'll put down your disco
And take you heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away

I am born again
I am born again
I am born again
I am born again
