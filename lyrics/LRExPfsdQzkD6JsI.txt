Like a man
Like the yams, yams, yams
The sedan
Think that I can

I'm a buff baby, but I dance like a man
She a nice lady and she shakin' the yams
Spent the whole summer trappin' out the sedan
Marching wit' the bands 'cause I think that I can

I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll never let ya flex on me
Broke my heart about a while ago, baby got the best of me
Momma told me "Fuck these hoes, get that dough, that's the remedy"
So now I'm smoking all my veggies, and I'm counting up my celery

Yeah, yeah
Same pants every day like, these were my only jeans
Yeah, yeah
Taking shot after shot like I'm tryna' win the MEP
Yeah, yeah
Might change my name to Kobe, bitch I'm Kobe Lou
Who are you? (Woah) Who are you?

I'm a buff baby, but I dance like a man
She a nice lady and she shakin' the yams
Spent the whole summer trappin' out the sedan
Marching with the bands 'cause I think that I can

I'm a buff baby, but I dance like a man
She a nice lady and she shakin' the yams
Spent the whole summer trappin' out the sedan
Marching with the bands 'cause I think that I can

Yeah
I'm a lover not a fighter, but I never let you flex on me
Woah
My bitch smell good and my whip stank like copary
Yo
Eggs on me like I'm, doing groceries
Woah, woah, woah
Baby, don't smoke all the weed

You said I ain't high (what?), you must be joking please
Ayy, nigga
Bitch I'm on (fire) do it look like I need more degrees?
Yeah
Boy you talkin' crazy, you must not know who you talkin' to
Who are you? Who are you?

I'm a buff baby, but I dance like a man
She a nice lady and she shakin' the yams
Spent the whole summer trappin' out the sedan
Marching wit' the bands 'cause I think that I can

I'm a buff baby, but I dance like a man
