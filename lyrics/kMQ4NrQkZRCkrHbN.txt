Even in my darkest times
Overcome with worry
Find the comfort in the storm
No reason to be sorry
Look inside
For a place to hide
All around the faithless wait
Full of expectations
They will never see the beauty
In the imperfections
The more I show
The less they know
Out of reach
Underneath
Learned to breath
Underneath
Something inside of me invisible
Turning the fragile unbreakable
But they cannot take away
Cannot take away what I believe

You cannot take away
Cannot take away what's underneath
Every little cut runs deep
Masked in my tomorrow
Bringing wisdom that I need
For all the time I borrow
My other side
Is left behind
Out of reach
Underneath
Learned to breath
Underneath
Something inside of me invisible
Turning the fragile unbreakable
But they cannot take away
Cannot take away what I believe
You cannot take away
Cannot take away what's underneath

Something inside of me invisible
Turning the fragile unbreakable
But they cannot take away
Cannot take away
Something inside of me invisible
Turning the fragile unbreakable
But they cannot take away
Cannot take away what I believe
You cannot take away
Cannot take away what's underneath
Underneathâ€¦
