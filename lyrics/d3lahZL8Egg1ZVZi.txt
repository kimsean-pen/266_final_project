Well he's tearing a line down that open road
He's got a Hotchkiss Shaft and 9 tonne load
No thing in Hell nor Heaven can match this king of chrome

He clenches his snow-white knuckles around the steering wheel
It's been 18 years since his last home-cooked meal
He used to swim 'round naked with the fish and the foam

He got white-noise blaring from his cabin door
He ain't seen his own mother since 1984
He likes his meat served red, straight off the bone

He's out there searching for that missing part
He got an eye for trouble and a broken heart
He don't know where he's going but he ain't never goin' home

Truck driver
Oh, truck driver
Last of the midnight riders
What do you dream in the night all alone?

Truck driver
Oh, truck driver
First of your kind, now the sole survivor
Where are you heading in the night all alone?

Endless highways all leading up
He drinks elixir from a plastic cup
Oh, sing it out loud, baby, sing it low

Truck driver
Oh, truck driver
First of your kind, now the sole survivor
Tell me what you dream in the night all alone?
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
In the night all alone

Baby, you're cold, walking around[?]
I can see you're walking, babe[?]
Oh, and you're bawling your eyes
Honey, I want ya', I want ya' so bad

Endless highways all leading up
He drinks elixir from a plastic cup
Oh, sing it out loud, baby, sing it low

Truck driver
Oh, truck driver
First of your kind, now the sole survivor
Tell me, where you headed in the night all alone?
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
In the night all alone
