(I am) What you fear most
(I am) What you need
(I am) What you made me
(I am) The American Dream

I'm not selling out

This is my time to shine
I've got the scars to prove it, only the strong survive
I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
Life never favored weakness, welcome to the pride

This is my time to shine
I've got the scars to prove it, only the strong survive
I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
Life never favored weakness, welcome to the pride

Since the dawn of time
Only the strong have survived
I will not be forgotten
Welcome to the pride

Only the strong survive
Welcome to the pride

I will not be forgotten
This is my time to shine
I've got the scars to prove it, only the strong survive
I'm not afraid of dying
Everyone has their time
Life never favored weakness, welcome to the pride
