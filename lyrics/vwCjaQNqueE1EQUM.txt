This is basic plucking
Or the Staunton Lick

Hold down the chord of C
Pluck a fretted bass string
With the thumb of the right hand

And pluck the third, second and first strings
Altogether with the first, second
And third fingers of the right hand

This is the Staunton Lick
The Staunton Lick
The Staunton Lick
