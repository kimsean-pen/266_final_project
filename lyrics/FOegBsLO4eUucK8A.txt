So first off I hate you
The words cut through her lips like Japanese knife
She didn't expect to be hearing this tonight
Meanwhile, I hear it all happening
Through the door on the phone in the next room
Yeah I'm listening to you

She said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms
And I can't wait, I can't wait, till there's no scar across my heart
I'm sick of being your trash bag baby, wanna see you fall down
I can't wait, I can't wait until your not around

My heart breaks, it shatters
I spend all of June trying to pick up the shards
Oh yeah, oh no, I should have know better
But I'm not bitter
My hand hurts, it's blistestered
So don't grab it, coz she'll fucking stab you
It's true! When will you stop playing with fire
Well I don't know

She said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms
And I can't wait, I can't wait, till there's no scar across my heart
I'm sick of being your trash bag baby, wanna see you fall down
I can't wait, I can't wait until your not around

I can't wait, I can't wait
Wait for you anymore (I can't wait for you)
I can't wait, I can't wait
Wait for you anymore (I can't wait for you)

I'm sick of being your trash bag baby, wanna see you fall down (sick of being your trash bag)
I can't wait, I can't wait until your not around (sick of being your trash bag)

She said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms
And I can't wait, I can't wait, till there's no scar across my heart
I'm sick of being your trash bag baby, wanna see you fall down
I can't wait, I can't wait until your not around
