Oh e yo e oh e yo e oh e yo e yay
Deep in the jungle in the land of adventure lives Tarzan

Oh e yo e oh e yo e oh e yo e yay
I am jane and I love to ride an elephant

My name is tarzan I am jungle man
The tree tops swing-a from jungle land
Come baby come I will take you for a swing
Let's go honey I'm tink-a-ling.

Tarzan is handsome, tarzan is strong
He's really cute and his hair is long
Tarzan is handsome tarzan is strong
So listen to the jungle song

Oh e yo e oh e yo e oh e yo e yay

Oh e yo e oh e yo e oh e yo e yay...
I am jane and I love to ride an elephant.

When you touch me I feel funny
I feel it too when you're touching me
Come to my tree house to my party

Tarzan is handsome, full of surprise
He's really cute and his hair is nice

Coochie coochie kiss me tenderly
