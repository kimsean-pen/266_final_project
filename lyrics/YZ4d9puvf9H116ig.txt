Metaaaal!

I'd sign a contract with the devil
I've tried for so very long
I'd die to become immortal
that's why I sing this song
Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
Who'd give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!

In life, I have no religion
Besides the heavy metal gods
Wear nothing but black skin tight leather
My skin is clad with metal studs
Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
I'd give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!

Some twenty years ago, the gods put down their feet
So firmly in to the ground that no man of sword nor pen
Could ever change the rules upon which
The very fundament of metal was made

Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
Read all about it, in the manual
Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
read all about it

Yes read it
Don't need no flashy house, no kids, car or ugly wife
the only thing I want is what my parents don't
Need no widescreen TV
No, in all honesty

The only thing I want to be (to be or not to be)
In the book of heavy metal... metal!

In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal - in life - metal!

In the book of heavy metal - to death - metal!
In the book of heavy metal
I'd sing a contract with the devil
In the book of heavy metal
I'd like to become a star
In the book of heavy metal
I'd die to become immortal
In the book of heavy metal
thats why i play the guitar
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
In the book of heavy metal... metal!
