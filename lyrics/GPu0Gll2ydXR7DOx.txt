Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom

Ka-boom, ka-boom
Ka-boom, ka-boom

We're a death marching band, Peter Pan off the wagon
Entertain but never trust anyone sober
We're tasteless but taste good, my s, top hat's top hated
Unsafe cheerleaders, porn poms and pipe bombs

I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
I hope this gets caught in your mouth
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
Don't say no, just say now

I like a big car, 'cause I'm a big star
I'll make a big rock and roll hit
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours

Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you

Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you

I'm the leader of the club, and I've shrugged off my mouse ears
We fly no-class Dumbo jets, and drive hardcore-vettes
We fight war with drugs, and our sex always formal
We wear lawsuits when we get high, high, high

I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
I hope this gets caught in your mouth
I won't do it with you, I'll do it to you
Don't say no, just say now

I like a big car, 'cause I'm a big star
I'll make a big rock and roll hit
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours

Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you

Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
I'd like to la-la-la-la love you

Inhale, exhale, let's all hail
It's a depraved new world
Inhale, exhale, let's all hail
It's a depraved new world
I like a big car, 'cause I'm a big star
I'll make a big rock and roll hit
I'd like to love you but my heart is a sore
I am, I am, I am so yours
I am a big car and I'm a strip bar
Call it fake, I call it good as it gets
Nothing in this world is for real
Except you are for me, and I am so yours
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
Ka-boom, ka-boom, ah
