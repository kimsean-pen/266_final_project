And I'll find a way to fix things
I don't understand what your texts mean
I'm hiding my feelings in blue screens
This isn't how things are meant to be
I understand the pros of
Following you through a crowded house
I sat in the grass with my phone out
I don't understand all the yelling
(The yelling) accomplishes nothing
I'm stressed cause you're stressed when you call me
I'm feeding off negative energy
Falling in love with the same scene
Making mistakes isn't new to me
Anxiety sucks it's controlling
I miss how we dealt with the old things
When playing in houses was new to me
I was playing in houses with friends I cared about
And I knew you so well
