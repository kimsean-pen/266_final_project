I made you think, you don't understand.

I used to think that happiness could only be something
to happen to somebody else.
Everybody believed, everybody but me, yeah yeah.
And I've been hurt so many times before
that my hopes was dying, I was so sick of trying.
Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah yeah.
But then you came into my life, you opened up my softer side.
Now I can see, to your eyes.

Suddenly, I realize.
I made you think, you don't understand.
All the times you didn't understand
why you just couldn't be my man.
I made you think, you don't understand.
There were many walls you had to climb
if you really wanted to be mine.
I made you think, you don't understand.
After all the hoops I pushed you through

now you see I'm in love with you.

Now, I hope you finally understand.
So many tears I've had to cry
But you had many more of your own.
You had to try
But you stuck it out and you're here with me now
And remember when the days when I pushed away your love
you called my beloved and you still stayed around
Yeah you figured me out. Said, You got me down.

And there's no way I lie to you, you know me better than I do.
Baby, ooh, you see me through

I'll be good with out you.
I made you think, you don't understand.
All the times you didn't understand
why you just couldn't be my man.
I made you think, you don't understand.
There were many walls you had to climb, (yeah)
if you really wanted to be mine. (ooh)
I made you think, you don't understand.
After all the hoops I pushed you through, (through)

now you see I'm in love with you.

Now, I hope you finally understand.

Ohh.
Baby, won't you listen now
Can't you see what I'm talking about
Said baby won't you listen now

Can't you see what I'm talking about?
Time went on, and I was wrong
to keep my distance for so long.
So afraid, you wouldn't stay

But you never turned away
Always right by my side
You're forever in my life.
Don't you go
It's not mine, no, It ain't you

I found my home.
I could see, to your right
Suddenly, I realize.
I made you think, you don't understand.
All the times you didn't understand
why you just couldn't be my man.
I made you think, you don't understand.
There were many walls you had to climb
if you really wanted to be mine.
I made you think, you don't understand.
After all the hoops I pushed you through
now you see I'm in love with you.
Now, I hope you finally understand.
I made you think, you don't understand.
