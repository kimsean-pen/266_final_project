My man walks on hands and knees
I am his first and only child
He is mine
He is my saint
He brings me roses and incense
And he closes my mind
He closes my mind
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love
I will kiss the ground
Where he left a taste
of his strength of mind
Take me down
Take me down now
Take me down
Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down there
In your hands again
Take me down
Take me down
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love
When I dream that sweet dream
When I forget where I am
I will always remember
Your hand on my shoulder
Pulling me down
Pulling me down
Into the cold dead earth
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down there
With real love
Real love
Real love
Real love
