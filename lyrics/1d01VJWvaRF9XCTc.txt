I won't let my yesterday
Take a hold of me
I'm gonna disarm it
Oh, Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I've lost many battles
Didn't lose the war
I'm never gonna be defeated
People who are crazy enough
To think they can change the world
Are the ones who do
Are the ones who do
It's a long way to the top
But you can make it if you know that
Someone loves you too
I'm gathering an army
To fight for what's left in this world
And unite
Those who know what is love
Body of a woman
Soul of a child
Mind of the free
Heart of the wild
An army to fight
For love
(Hey)
An army to fight
For love
So let's conquer the world now
Let's make love not war
That's all we have to know
Oh, Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
People who are crazy enough
To think they can change the world
Are the ones who do
Are the ones who do
I'm gathering an army
To fight for what's left in this world
And unite
Those who know what is love
Body of a woman
Soul of a child
Mind of the free
Heart of the wild
An army to fight
For love
Ako'y naririto, nalilito,
ang mundo ko'y gumugulo, gumuguho, parang bagyo
Gabi na malamig, nanginginig,
mga mata'y nakapikit, parang ako'y napaidlip
'Wag ng mag-alala, heto ako, buong-buo,
sundalo ng pag-ibig mo, mula paa hanggang ulo, iyong-iyo
I'm gathering an army to fight for what's left in this world
And unite those who know what is love
Body of a woman, soul of a child
Mind of the free, heart of the wild
An army to fight for love
(Hey)
An army to fight for love
An army to fight
For love
