Out of the dust, out of your voice
Stopping the cars as you run past
We are in love, we are in love with you
Sing to us, beautiful one

Got on your skin, colder than night
The last of the one, the one we divide
Lying so still, lying so still here
Sing to me, beautiful one

Fill me up
Oh, fill me whole
Oh, tear my throat ust to hear yours
So sing out loud

Ooh...
Ooh...

Ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah...

And still...
Sing to me, beautiful one
