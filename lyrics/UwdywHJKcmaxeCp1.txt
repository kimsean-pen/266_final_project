In an ice-capped fire
Of burning wood
In our world of wire
Ignite our dreams of starry skies
And you and me
As realised our bigger themes

Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me

Do or die
What's done is done
True beauty lies
On the blue horizon

Who or why
What's one is one
In pure disguise
Of vulgar sons

Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me

Whatever burns burns eternally
So take me in turns internally
When I'm on fire
My body will be
Forever yours
Nocturnal me

(End)
