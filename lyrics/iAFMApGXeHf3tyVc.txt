The moon is out and rising
And silent is the night
My face is pale and hiding
Behind the neon light

The seven is my number
Temptation is my game
I came from six feet under
And Satan... Satan is my name!

At night I'm dressed as lover
I praise the morning star
Good evening little lady
Come join me in my car

I am the one you'll come to
A wolf in his best disguise
Don't say they never told you
The evil... evil never dies?

Saturday Satan - See the devil is alive
Saturday Satan - Diabolic dynamite
Saturday Satan - See the evil in my eyes
Saturday Satan - I'm the devil in disguise

Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

I am the son of darkness
The pentagram's my sign
Believe me little darling
At midnight you'll be mine

I'll eat your soul for breakfast
Can't break my evil spell
My purgatory's waiting
Welcome... Welcome you to hell!

Saturday Satan - See the devil is alive
Saturday Satan - Diabolic dynamite
Saturday Satan - See the evil in my eyes
Saturday Satan - I'm the devil in disguise
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!
Saturday Satan - See the devil is alive
Saturday Satan - Diabolic dynamite
Saturday Satan - See the evil in my eyes
Saturday Satan - I'm the devil in disguise
