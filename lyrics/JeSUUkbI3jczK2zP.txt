So much is going on
but you can always come around
why don't you sit with me for just a little while
tell me, what's wrong

And you just give me all your love
give me all you got baby

Give me all your love
that I know

So tell me what you wanna do
they say ---- you
why don't tell to me just a little why
I don't know the time
make your way

And you just give me all your love
give me all you got baby

Give me all your love

Give me all your love

Give me all your love
baby

Just give me all your love
