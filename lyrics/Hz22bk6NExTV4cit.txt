Please don't get me started
Looking backwards to move on.
Strong yet open-hearted,
Accept leaving when leaving's come.

God didn't see it coming,
Never said I love you, hope you knew.
Now my bags are packed and my sails are tacked
And my course is marked by stars.
When this cycle ends,
Will it start again?
Will we recognize old friends?

I'm on my way,
Soon be moving on my way,
Leave a little light on,
Leave a little light on,

I'm on my way,
Soon be moving on my way,
Leave a little light on,
Leave a little light on,

Time always unwinding,
All these dead lines in my mind.
Dreams and seeds we planted
Took for granted, didn't prove.

Walking down this road
When my pulse beats slow,
Hope to have you close at hand.
When this cycle ends,
Will it start again?
Will we recognize old friends?

I'm on my way,
Soon be moving on my way,
Leave a little light on,
Leave a little light on.

I'm on my way,
On my way, on my way, on my way,
Leave a light on,
Leave a little light on.

I'm on my way,
Soon be moving on my way,
Leave a little light on,
Leave a little light on.

I'm on my way,
On my way, on my way, on my way.
Leave a light on,
Leave a little light on,
Leave a little light on.
