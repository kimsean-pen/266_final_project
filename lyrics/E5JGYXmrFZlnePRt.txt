I survive on hotel shampoos
I'll be runnin' out soon
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more

Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought this summer you'd be
Gone away again
Oooo he's gone away again

We were poor, yeah
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong

Craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gone away again, hmm
He's gone away again

Driving in a sweet brand new car
Living the life of a superstar
I got my way again, hmm
I got my way again

We were poor, yeah
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong

He says that
He don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all our pretty disguises

Work hard
Oh we work hard until we're sleeping
And we sleep but we're not dreaming
Oh we sleep but we're not dreaming

Where's his love?
Where's his kisses?
He says "Sorry babe, this has
Got away from me."
He's gone away from me

We were poor, yeah
We were dream chasers baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong
I know he'll prove me right
He's gonna prove me right till I'm wrong
