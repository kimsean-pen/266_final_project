Go sing, too loud
Make your voice break- Sing it out
(Go... Go... Go Kitty... Kitty... Kitty)
Go scream, do shout
Make an earthquake...

You wish fire would die and turn colder
You wish your love could see you grow older
We should always know that we can do anything

Go drum, do proud
Make your hands ache - Play it out
Go march through crowd
Make your day break...

You wish silence released massive tremors
You wish, I know it, surrender to summers
We should always know that we can do everything

Go do, you'll learn to
Just let yourself, fall into landslide

Go do, you'll learn to
Just let yourself, give into low tide

Go do!

Tie strings to clouds
Make your own lake - Let it flow
Throw seeds to sprout
Make your own break - Let them grow

Let them grow (Endless summers)
Let them grow (Endless summers)
(Go do endless summers)
You wish surprise, will never stop wonders
You wish sunrise, will never fall under
You wish surprise, will never stop wonders
You wish sunrise, will never fall under
We should always know that we can do everything
Go do!
