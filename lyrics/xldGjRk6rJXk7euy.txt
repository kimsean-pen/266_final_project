Heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart-heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart-heartbeat

I saw you talking on the phone
I know that you were not alone
But you're stealing my heart away
Yah, you're stealing my heart away

You're acting like you're on your own
But I saw you standing with a girl, ooh
Stop trying to steal my heart away
Stop trying to steal my heart away

I don't know where we going
I don't know who we are

I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
Feel your heartbeat

She said, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat

Maybe it's the way you move
You got me dreaming like a fool
That I could steal your heart away
I could steal your heart away

No matter what it is you think
I'm not the kind of girl to blink
And give my heart away
Stop trying to steal my heart away

I don't know where we going
I don't know who we are

I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
He said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat

She said, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
(Feel your heartbeat)

Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
Stop stealing my heart away
You're stealing my heart away

I don't know where we're going
I don't know who we are
It feels like we are flowing
High above the stars

Heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart-heartbeat

But I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
Yah, I can feel it, I can-, ayy

I can feel your heartbeat
He said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
He said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat

She said, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
She said to me, "I can feel your heartbeat"
Running through me
Your heartbeat, feel your heartbeat

Stop stealing my heart away
Tell it to me, girl
Stop stealing my heart away
Give it to me, boy
Stop stealing my heart away
Say it to me, girl
You're stealing my heart away

Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)
Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)
Stop stealing my heart away (I can feel your heartbeat)

Your heartbeat
Your heartbeat
