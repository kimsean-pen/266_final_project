boulevard apartment
that was in 2007 when i drove you back from philly then
you were with me there in secret
i was marking out for that feeling
like i know it's real cuz i feel it
and i hate to make you feel morally in debt
i wish you were on my arm
want you tattooed on my neck
i hate to make you feel more than depressed...
baby i'm correcting this miss

because this summer i've had enough
i took too much...
and i didn't see you enough...
(and i didn't eat enough...)

crashed my car on keyser like i'm tom may
playing twisted metal like i'm kanye...

moving through these attitudes
like we could not be speaking then and still i come right back to you
i hate to make you feel more than incensed
i'm pulling up with the best

see the prices going up
and i start to fade away
final crisis of the heart passing over me again
and i try to call you back but can't remember anything
yr the cd in my car...
yr the phone that never rings...

and i hate to hold on restless feelings...

i crashed my car on keyser like i'm tom may
thank you black kray...
