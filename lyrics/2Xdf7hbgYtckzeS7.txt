Look at us break our bonds in this kitchen
Look at us rallying all our defenses
Look at us waging war in our bedroom
Look at us jumping ship in our dialogues

There is no difference
In what we're doing in here
That doesn't show up as big as it turns out there
So why spend all our time undressing our bandages
When we're the ultimate key to the cause

Right here all underneath
Look at us form our cliques in our sandbox
Look at us micro-kids with both our hearts blocked
Look at us turn away from all the rough spots

Look at dictatorship on my own block
There is no difference
In what we're doing in here
That doesn't show up as big as it turns out there
So why spend all our time undressing our bandages

When we're the ultimate key to the cause
Right here all underneath
How I've spun my wheels
With carts before my horse

And shine on the outside springs from gloom
Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons
And score bourne into form, stretching my limit

There is no difference
In what we're doing in here
That doesn't show up as big as it turns out there
So why spend all our time undressing our bandages
When we're the ultimate key to the cause
Right here all underneath
