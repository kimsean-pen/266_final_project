Valmara! Valmara! Valmara!
Flechettes kiss me with the lisp of your shrapnel caress.

Lost this arm! Lost this leg! Lost this diving board!
A belly flopped proposal of "Let's be friends".

Tour de force!
Tour de force!
DeFacto!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!

Prosthetic, prosthetic, prosthetic.
Blemish necro is the velcro on the charred appendage.

Cauterize solder gun in the melting of seeds.
Oh dear god, what a tangled web we weave.

Tour de force!
Tour de force!
DeFacto!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!

All we are are failed attempts,
Propelled by stilt-legged presidents.
Incarcerate the mason fence,
Like flechettes,
Flechettes!
Flechettes!

I'm not biting the lead,
My pencil's broken again.
We will fill in the blanks,
Or you can cheat off your,
Flechettes!
Flechettes!

I'm not biting the lead,
My pencil's broken again.
We will fill in the blanks,
So i can cheat off your,

Tour de force!
Tour de force!
DeFacto!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!

(Vocal Interlude)

Tour de force!
Tour de force!
DeFacto!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!
Ayuchuco!

All we are are failed attempts,
Propelled by stilt-legged presidents.
Incarcerate the mason fence,
Like flechettes.
