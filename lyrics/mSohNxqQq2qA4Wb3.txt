?? where I first began
began to feel like a man
noticing girls
for their bodies
but got played, coaxed and tricked
?? against my sensitive skin
planted insecurities across my belly

but now I've got more charm
than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow
got more charm than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes

im just going with the flow

drugs help me understand
understand that im a sensitive man
I need chemicals
to keep me in balance
but got played, coaxed and tricked
??? for lust and sin

put it in our nature
to polute our minds

but now I've got more charm
than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow
got more charm than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill

rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow

flow...
going with the flow...

going with the flow...
going with the flow...
going witht the flow...
going with the flow.

but now I've got more charm
than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow
got more charm than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow
got more charm than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
steady as she goes
im just going with the flow
got more charm than a hundred dollar bill
hundred dollar bill
rolled up in your nose
