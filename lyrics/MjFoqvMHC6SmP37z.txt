The sunset
I close my eyes
I pretend everything's alright
Drowning in anger from all these lies
I can't pretend everything's alright
Please don't let me fall forever
Can You tell me it's over now?

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of master
I try to save You but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to You
I'll never let go
I need You with me as I enter the shadows

Caught in the darkness
I go blind
Can You help me find my way out?
Nobody hears me, I suffer the silence
Can You tell me it's over now?

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of master
I try to save You but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to You
I'll never let go
I need You with me as I enter the shadows

Ahhh!

I'm holding on to You
I'm holding on to You

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of master
I try to save You but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to You
I'll never let go
I need You with me as I enter the shadows
Ahhh!
