Whole memories yeah
Whole memories yeah

We rolled through Cecconi's
We ate like some mobsters
Merlot and Branzino
Long way from horchatas
Drinking 'til we wasted
They lookin' right at us
This money don't make me
I'm just having fun, yeah

So let the rum keep running
Let the blunts keep rolling
Yeah, I'm with that
And let the ones keep falling
Let those girls keep coming
Yeah, I'll take that
You know that
I've been stressing for a long long minute
Now I'm off that
I do this for the memories
Even if I remember none, yeah

Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me
Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me

Cuidado
Cuidado
Cuidado
I drank ayahuasca
I felt my own life go
I saw my own future
Deeper than blindfolds
The jungle's amazing
Real love, going through it
I'm back and I'm thinking
The fuck am I doing?

Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me
Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me

Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me
Memories yeah, memories
Memories yeah, remember me
