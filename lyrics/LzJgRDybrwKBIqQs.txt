Wastin' away

Wastin'
Wastin' away

Do you ever notice what surrounds you?
When it's all bright and tucked under
Do you ever notice what's around you?
When it's all right under our skin

Wastin'

Wastin' away
Wastin'
Wastin'
Wastin' away

Do you ever notice what surrounds you?
When it's bright, wrapped up for you
Do you ever notice what's around you?
When it's all there, in the wake of you
