Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill

Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever

But I'm down for the minute so just chill

Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real

Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill

Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
