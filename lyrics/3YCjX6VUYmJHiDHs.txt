Yeah she kisses the way that good songs are sung
And she thinks that she's special
But she knows that I'm really only looking for some fun,
Now she's sitting on my bed half naked,
Asking if I want to go out and get some breakfast
While I'm walking to the kitchen
Wondering why the hell hasn't she left yet

I'm losing hope
Thought I was living but I'm dying in Ontario
And she should really be wearing her winter coat
Don't know why all the girls wanna be so cold

Now she's poppin' 'em like Tylenol and chasing it with alcohol
She had a great set of legs and didn't seem to mind my busted ass smile
Anyways, I bought her a couple of drinks
She had the first one then got all religious on me
Mumbled something about the twelve steps and how it's a "real disease"
Well, I guess it's time for me to leave

I'm losing hope
Thought I was living more like dying in Ontario
And she should really be wearing her winter coat,
Don't know why all the girls around here wanna be so cold

I'm losing hope
Thought I was living more like dying in Ontario
And she should really be wearing her winter coat,
Don't know why all the girls around here wanna be so cold

I'm getting tired of this feeling in my stomach
It's not this city, it's what I've done with it
I'm getting tired
I'm getting tired
I'm getting tired of this feeling in my stomach
It's not this city, it's what I've done with it
I'm getting tired
I'm getting tired
All my angels are etched in snow
All my angels are etched in snow
Thought I was living but I'm dying in Ontario
All my angels are etched in snow
All my angels are etched in snow
All my angels are etched in snow
Thought I was living but I'm dying in Ontario
