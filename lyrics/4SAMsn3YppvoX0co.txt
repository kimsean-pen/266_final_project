it's deep in the mind
so slick by design
i'll end up the same way maybe

don't hold on to pride
you'll lose if you try
you'll end up the same way someday

lord i'm on my way, don't let me down
lord i'm on my way, don't let me down

can't feel it inside
how long can it hide
you'll end up the same way maybe

redemption denied
as life passes by
i'll end up the same way someday

lord i'm on my way, don't let me down
lord i'm on my way, don't let me down

gets deeper inside
so strong the divide
i'll end up the same way maybe
don't loose an insight
abuse till you die
we'll all end the same way someday

lord i'm on my way, don't let me down
lord i'm on my way, don't let me down
