I come over
Quarter past two
Love in my eyes
Blinded by you

Just to get a taste of heaven
I'm on my knees
I can't help it
I'm addicted

But I can't stand the
Pain inflicted
In the morning
You're not holding on to me

Tell me whats the point of doing this every night
What you're giving me
Is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh

This is the last time
Baby make up your mind

'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?

I can't keep touching you like this
If its just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

We were on fire
Now, were frozen
There's no desire
Nothing spoken

You're just playing
I keep waiting for your heart
(I keep waiting for you)
I am fiending for the sunshine

To show our love in a good light
Give me reason

I am pleading to the stars
(Tell me)
Tell me whats the point of doing this every night
What you're giving me

Is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby make up your mind
'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed

If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keep touching you like this

If its just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na)

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na)
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely

Baby why you callin me?
Not another one
Not try'na be your whole life
I don't wanna fall asleep
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby why you callin me?
Not another one
Not try'na be your whole life
I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If its just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss
Temporary bliss
I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
I can't keep feeling love like this
Its not worth temporary bliss
