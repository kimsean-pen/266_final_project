Everything is old in the world
Except for the baby
Little baby, ah little baby

And nothing's sun isn't seen
Except for the baby
Little baby, ah little baby

And I say child, be my teacher
Would ya could ya baby yeah?
Little baby, ah little baby

And everyone is too big to cry
Except for the baby
Little baby, ah little baby

And everyone knows how to lie
Except for the baby
Little baby, ah little baby

So I say child, be my teacher
Would ya could ya baby yeah?
Little baby, ah little baby

So I said talk to me baby (talk to me baby)
talk to me baby (talk to me baby)
talk to me baby (talk to me baby)
talk to me baby (talk to me baby)
talk to me baby tell me everything's all right

So I say child, be my teacher
Would ya could ya baby yeah?
little baby, ah little baby
little baby, ah little baby
little baby, ah little baby
little baby, ah little baby
