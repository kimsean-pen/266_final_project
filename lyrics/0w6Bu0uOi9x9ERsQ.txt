She's loose like Wavy Gravy
And asked me to lie down on the ground
She moves just like she's crazy
And doesn't care who's around
She always spoke so plainly
Until the day she left town
There's a riot now she's coming home

And though I loved her dearly
I couldn't keep her around
Dreaming like a baby
I care too much to let her down
It always seemed so easy
Until the day she left town
There's a riot now she's coming home

She's loose like Wavy Gravy
She's loose like Wavy Gravy
