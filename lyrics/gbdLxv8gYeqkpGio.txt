Well, you think that you know what I am but you don't
'Cause I say what you can't and I do what you won't
I like it loud, wear it proud, like a crown upon my head
I'll always be this way til the day that I'm dead

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I
Want, want, want
I'm unusual
Ain't takin' no shit
Gonna drink this in til I'm
Gone, gone, gone
I'm living it up
Not giving a what
I'm living it up
Not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called

Whatever the fuck I want

Wouldn't you like to know
What I'd do if I got you alone
Would I sigh? Would I beg?
Would I scream? Would I moan?
I don't talk the talk
'Cause I walk the walk
And I'll shake it for you just like this

Singing La-di-da La-di-da-di-da
Save your kiss I need a lick

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I
Want want want
I'm unusual
Ain't takin' no shit
Gonna drink this in 'til I'm
Gone gone gone
I'm living it up
Not giving a what
I'm living it up
Not giving a what

Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I want

So come a little bit closer, baby

'Cause all I want is you
So what are gonna do?
Come a little bit closer, honey
Gonna have my way with you...

'Cause I'm a sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I
Want want want
I'm unusual
Ain't takin' no shit
Gonna drink this in
'Til I'm
Gone gone gone
I'm living it up
Not giving a what

I'm living it up
Not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I want, want want

I'm living it up
Not giving a what
living it up
Not giving a what
Sick individual
And I'm doing this thing called
Whatever the fuck I want
