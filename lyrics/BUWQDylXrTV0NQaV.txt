When your friends are dead
It's so much easier
When you don't even care

All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me

When your friends are dead
It's so much easier
When you don't even care

All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me
All these faces mean nothing to me
