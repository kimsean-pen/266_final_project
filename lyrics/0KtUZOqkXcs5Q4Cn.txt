Blow up the bridge and into the morning
How up the house and into the blue
To end
You're lifting your soul
For a few seconds
Be someone new
Blew up the bridge and into the morning, morning, morning...

Alarm clock ring
Was it your daily routine?
Your coffee's cold by now
Her face stuck in a magazine
His white shirts
Still hanging in rows on the closet door
She still hurts
Fragments of you live on
Why do you stay home?

No ordinary day
He's leaving for good
We're moving away
Blew up the bridge and into the morning, morning, morning...

His struck dance
Out in the garden when it's late
Cut in half
Plus lots of drama now you're losing face
You drove out
Before the city woke up so still
Humid air
And stories of you live on why do you drive home?

No ordinary day
He's leaving for good
We're moving away
Blew up the bridge and into the morning
How... up the house and into the blue
Up to ending?
You're lifting a Forever seconds, to place on the moon
Blew up the bridge and into the morning, morning, morning
