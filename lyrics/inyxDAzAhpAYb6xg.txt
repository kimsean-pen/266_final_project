Favorite boy
Favorite girl
Marriage made in heaven
Had to be from another world
And when I see you
I want to be him
'Cause I'm all around him

You know I hate to say it
I wouldn't to bore you
I never thought I'd say it
That girl is too good for you

So many things I wish I'd done
I left so many things, I'm not the only one
But I still don't get it, right to this day
Why couldn't I say it
I just couldn't say it

I know that she still loves you
But God knows why I let her
That girl is far too precious
She deserves much better

You know I had to say it
But I just can't ignore you
I never thought I'd say it
That girl is too good for you

I know that she still loves you
'Cause I saw it in her letter
Well, I know that she still loves you
But I could love her better
