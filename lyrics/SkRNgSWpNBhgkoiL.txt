Saturday, you're lost in a fire
Should you go, or stay and expire
But you keep on waiting for someone to get the courage to run
I don't know, if they'll find it

Over time you're lost in the city
If you're gonna act like that, then you're not gonna be with me
If you keep on keep on waiting for someone to get the courage to run
I don't know, if they'll find it

Maybe it's not the time
Maybe we were never meant to be
Oh maybe you should stick around if you truly love me
Oh maybe it's not the timing
Maybe we were never meant to be

Oh but when you get back would you let me know
If sleeping around set you free?
