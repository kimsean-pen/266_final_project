Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

What's That Line?

(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)

Got tthe joint lit way up
It's time to get down
So loud that my ears pop
We can't turn back now
What is a turn-down?
To the club we go
So what? The song comes up
And it just goes on

(And it just goes on)
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

Time to make the club go up
