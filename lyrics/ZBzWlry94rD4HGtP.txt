So you say you're ignored
As it is
Well, give us your sad, sad trip

You're right, I get it
It all makes sense, you're the perfect person
So right, so wrong
Let's all live in your imaginary life

Assumed it's whether
We're right, or wrong
We're doomed, and there's plenty for all

How dare you catch me counting
How dare you call at all
How dare you call this suffering
How dare you call at all

You're right, I get it
It all makes sense, you're the perfect person
So right, so wrong
Let's all live in your imaginary life

Press on these tannins
They double in time
The touch of life, once failed to mention so far

Of course the law is fountains
Of face to face remorse
Of fast and restless blackmail
Like pent up fetish force

You're right, I get it
It all makes sense, you're the perfect person
So right, so wrong
Let's all live in your imaginary life

Do you want it enough?
Do you want it at all?
Should you need it at all?
Takes a minute to see
Do you want it enough?
Do you want it at all?
Should you need it at all?
Do you want it or not?
You're right, I get it
It all makes sense, you're the perfect person
So right, so wrong
Let's all live in your imaginary life, life, life, life
