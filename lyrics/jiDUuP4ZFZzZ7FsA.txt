Driving away from the wreck of the day
And the light's always red in the rearview
Desperatly close to a coffin of hope
I'd cheat destiny just to be near you

And if this is giving up
Then I'm giving up
If this is giving up
Then I'm giving up, giving up
On love
On love

Driving away from the wreck of the day
And I'm thinking about calling on Jesus
Cause love doesn't hurt
So I know I'm not falling in love
I'm just falling to pieces

And if this is giving up
Then I'm giving up
If this is giving up
Then I'm giving up, giving up
On love
On love

Maybe I'm not up for being a victim of love
All my resistence will never be distance enough
...
Driving away from the wreck of the day
And it's finally quiet in my head
Driving alone, finally on my way home
To the comfort of my bed

And if this is giving up
Then I'm giving up
If this is giving up
Then I'm giving up, giving up
On love
On love
