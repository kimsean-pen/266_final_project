My face is falling
My face is falling off

Don't look at me, when I'm coming down
My face has fallen on the ground
Ice in my head is spinning around
Snakes in my skin (to) take me back
Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back

My face is falling
My face is falling off

Don't look at me, when I'm coming down
My face has fallen on the ground
Ice in my head is spinning around
Snakes in my skin (to) take me back

Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back

My face is falling
My face is falling off

Don't look at me, when I'm coming down
My face has fallen on the ground
Ice in my head is spinning around
Snakes in my skin (to) take me back
Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back

My face is falling
My face is falling off

Don't look at me, when I'm coming down
My face has fallen on the ground
Ice in my head is spinning around
Snakes in my skin (to) take me back

Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back
Take me back I'm not going back
