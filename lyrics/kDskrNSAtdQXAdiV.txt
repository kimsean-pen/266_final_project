Well I'm learning to make
This a permanent feeling
I guess this
Is how the living start
Learning about dying
And this knot is interior
In this house and in these bones

But who am I to say?
I miss you all the same
And the blood in your veins
The earth and the debris that I haul
Feel the weight of it all

I swear it away
You'll remember me
I swore it away
You'll remember me
Walk it out to the burn pile
All the debris I haul
Feel the weight of it all
You'll remember me

But who am I to say?
The blood of our youth
Is the blood in our veins
The earth and the debris that I haul
Feel the weight of it all
Well I swear it away
