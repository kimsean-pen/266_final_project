I don't want to go
Something tells me no
No, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand
Say go, go, go

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
My, my, my
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
You can fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
But I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know!

Something in the air
Tells me to beware
No, no, no
Her love is like a knife
She'll carve away your life
So go, go, go

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Hey, I don't know!
