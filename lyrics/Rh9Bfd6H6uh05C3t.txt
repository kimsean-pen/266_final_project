Hold on
Two halves past and Colorado
Every night
It's five
You hold on
Terrified what's gonna happen
Try it again
Twelve times

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized
Sigh

Hold on
Two halves past and Colorado
Every night
Predicted a precise moment
Someone once said
To sherish the fall while you're up to it

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized

To you, I am a birthday sentiment
Yearly rub-it-in
Don't go caving in
Somebody dumb fooling me
with something I don't know and
I just fall into it with you

Oh
In the twist
Didn't mean to floor you
Hold me somewhere
With a lot to decide (oh)
With a lot to decide (uh-oh)

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized

To you, I am a birthday sentiment
Die in increments
until you cave in
Your broken bracelets
An easy thing to replace
Let's go away then
Gracefully
