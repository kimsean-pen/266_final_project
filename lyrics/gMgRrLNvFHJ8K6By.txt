We began at the beginning
Moving high and moving fast
Machine's clean, so sweet and mean
Should have known it wouldn't last

But when I took her clothes off, I thought she would explode
Clutch another handful, kept us on the road
Oh yeah!

The black things came from nowhere
But they couldn't beat the shield
They flew across the highway
But we smashed them in the field

But when I made a suggestion, I thought she would explode
Clutch another handful, keep us on the road
Oh yeah!

It was 'round about the third day
I remember it so clear
We came across a bad vibe
Naked, grinding fear

And that was all we left there, in concrete staring cold
Clutch another handful, keep us on the road
Oh yeah!
