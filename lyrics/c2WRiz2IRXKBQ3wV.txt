At night I walk this stinkin' street past the crazys on my block
And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk
And I'm searching for the latest thing, a break in this routine
I'm talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen

This is home
This is Mean Street
Yes, ah, this is home
The only one I know

And we don't worry 'bout tomorrow
'cause we're sick of these four walls
Now what you think is nothin' might be somethin' after all
Now you know this ain't no through street, the end is dead ahead
The poor folks play for keeps down here, they're the living dead

Come on down, huh, wow!
Down to Mean Street
They're dancin' now, ooh
Out on Mean Street
Dance, baby!

It's always here and now my friend, it ain't once upon a time
It's all over but the shouting, I come and take what's mine
We're searching for the latest thing, a break in this routine
Talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen

This is home
Mmm, this is Mean Street
Yes, ah, this is home
Only one I know

(This is home) See, a gun is real easy
(This is Mean Street) In this desperate part of town
(This is home) Turns you from hunted into hunter, ah
(This is Mean Street) Go an' hunt somebody down
Wait a minute, ah

(This is home) Somebody said "fair warning"
(This is Mean Street) Lord strike that poor boy down
