Since man cannot live without miracles,
He will provide himself with the
Miracles of his own making. He
Will believe in any kind of deity
Even though he may otherwise
Be a heretic, an atheist, and a rebel."

Flames
In the age of hell
In the age of fire

War
In the name of God
In the holy empire

Burn the witch in pyre

Death
In the name of God
In the name of fire

Love
For the grace of God
For the saints for liars

Fire
In the name of Lord
To impure desire

Lord
You the greatest one
Blow up the pyre

"O Lord our God, help us to tear
Their bodies to bloody shreds
With our shell.
Help us to drown the
Thunder of the guns with
The shrieks of their wounded."

In the name of God
In the name of fire

For an endless life
In the holy empire

In the name of hell
Your soul inquires

The warmth on my face
Is the hot of fire

Death
In the name of God
In the name of fire

"The world itself is the will to power
And nothing else!
And you yourself are the
Will to power - and
Nothing else!"
