I've been waiting for sunlight
I've been searching for love inside
I've been wanting a new life
But you are the one who holds it all
I've been waiting for sunlight
I've been searching for love inside
I've been wanting a new life
But you are the one who holds it all
Oh God

Oh God, I'm alone again
On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now
Oh God, I'm a broken man
Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now

Set me free, yeah
Let me bathe in your sunlight
Take my hand, and we'll take flight
I've been feeling your love
I know you are the one who holds it all

Oh God, I'm alone again
On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now
Oh God, I'm a broken man
Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now

Now everything is golden
And this world feels brand new to me
Golden

Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth
I've been given a bad break, but I've got an awful lot to live for

Oh God, I'm alone again
On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now
Oh God, I'm a broken man
Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
Heaven, take me now
Heaven, take me now
