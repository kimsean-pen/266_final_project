No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel strange every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship, but
My momma hanging my sister, sit

It's on now, the days are long now
The ups and the sun down
In the twisting morn
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around as the promise breaks

Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate

Keep on pulling, that rope will break
We'll welcome the new age

Covered warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now the star burst
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine
Will I know when it's finally time
This whole life of hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be
