Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

They tell me you've touched the face of God,
at the sound of the rope cracking on your neck
They tell me you'd never give it up
like the song that was soul singing in your head

So honey please, don't let go
or you'll fall into the dead of night
So honey please, don't let go
You better learn to fly,
'cause they're gonna point you up at the sky

The more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning comes
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

That loving man ain't no rolling stone
At the sound of the drums, I'm gonna set you free
I talk to him on the telephone,
and these are the words that he gave to me...

He said honey please, don't let go
or you'll fall into the dead of night
So honey please, don't let go
You better learn to fly,
'cause they're gonna point you up at the sky

The more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning comes
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

The more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning comes
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
