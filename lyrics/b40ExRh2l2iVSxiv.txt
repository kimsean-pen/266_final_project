No more inferiority will ruin this, our lives
To step outside the boundaries of just the will to survive

Come inside, fell your life slip from your grasp
To your religion you clasp
A fear that is new pours into you, tearing your soul
Release the unknown
Dethroning the old, crowning the young, rightful heir
The time has come

Religion has died
All shall melt under one sign
Relinquish your life
A new lease of power has been sent forth
The weak can only cry
Lost amongst the dust of a crumbling world
Last breath fails
Time to move on, evolution calls

Worlds collide, the weak step aside
Our calling is heard, no mercy will come
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood

This time has been anticipated
Since the dawn of man
Hatred silently brewing
Awaiting its final stand

Our rule, our rule
The advantage is ours
Gathering the powers of the past
Tensed to agress
Deal a strike with precision crass

Worlds collide, the weak step aside
Our calling is heard, no mercy will come
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood

Now that the time has drawn upon us
Allocate your inner soul
Seize this opportunity
Retribute your malevolence handed down
