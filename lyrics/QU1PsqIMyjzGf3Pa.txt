To hold you back
And make you come my way?

I know
I'm the only one to do what's to be dont

To hold you back
And make you see my way?

I know
I'm the only one, again, to do what's to be done

Well I know (I know)
It's real (it's real)
I hope
I'll always be the one
To hide, to know
I'll always be the one

To hold you back
And make you come my way?

I know
I'm the only one to do what's to be done

To hold you back
And make you come my way?

I know
I'm the only one, again, to do what's to be done

Well I know (I know)
It's real (it's real)
I hope
I'll always be the one
To hide, to know
I'll always be the one
