Pray the wild
Pray for sanity
Pray like falling rain and light

Pray that someone
Frees us from the fear
For the times [?] here

And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you

Pray that seasons
Sees us from [?]
Safe from storms [?] leave us here

Pray us wild
Pray us softly
Pray us safe unto the seas we know
Oh

And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you

Oh-oh
And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
And I need you
Oh-oh
And I need you
