Life gave me hollow glamor
There's no one to live it
My heart continues to stammer
But no one is in it

'Cause when I wake up in my empty room
This particular shade of blue
It takes control
To slow this mood
I just want to be told what to do

Sleepwalk
Déjà vu through the avenue
Sleepwalk
Evil angels are calling you

The nightmares of others were written
In black magic marker
The damage we've seen was predicted
As the city grew darker

An effort to cross the avenue
Got them taking a moving mirror
I take a book
I'm unreviewed
And I don't always know just what to do

Sleepwalk
Déjà vu through the avenue
Sleepwalk
Evil angels are calling you

The song on the radio
I just surrounded our love
Isn't it typical?
Stepping on flowers

Sleepwalk
We a found a pulse but it's deep underground
In heaven's basement where it's always sundown
Sleepwalk
We a found a pulse but it's deep underground
In heaven's basement where it's always sundown
