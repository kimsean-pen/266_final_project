You were born in a small town
Always had dreams bigger than your brother, you know
Hit the road where it forks down
Make a decision, start from the gutter

Big city lights, fast lane livin'
But you never forgot your roots, oh-oh-oh
Back in time, daddy's advice
Baby don't forget that you...

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
With everyone you know

Shine a light
Shine a light

You have struggled before, now
And each time you made it out the other side
Pick yourself up when you fall down
Stand tall and never be afraid to cry

Big city life, same thing different time
Darlin' don't forget your roots, well
Back in time, mama's advice
Baby don't forget that you...

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
With everyone you know

Shine a light, yeah
Shine a light

People laugh and people cry
People live and people die
But I'll never meet another life like you
'Cause every day and every night
Teachin' you wrong from right
Now you get to shine a light don't you
Don't you

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Let everybody know

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Everywhere you go
Shine a light

Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
With everyone you know

Shine a light
Shine a light (Hey)
