Sleng Teng
That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang
[X2]

Yeah, me got God and me got you
Every day thinking about how me get through
Everything I own is on I.O.U.
But I'm here to bringing you
Something new

You no like the people, they no like you
Then they go and set it off
With a big boom
Every gun in a battle is a
Son and daughter too

So why you wanna talk about
Who done who?
Why you wanna talk about

Sleng Teng
That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make it bang
[X2]

Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the poor, pull up the poor

I'm a fighter, fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road
Bring me the reaper
Bring me the lawyer

You treat me like a killer
I ain't hate ya.

I'm a fighter, fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road
