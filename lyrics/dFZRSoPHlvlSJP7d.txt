there you see her
sitting there across the way
she don't got a lot to say
but there's something about her
and you don't know why
but you're dying to try
you wanna kiss the girl

yes... you want her
look at her, you'll know you do
it's possible she wants you too
there is one way to ask her
it don't take a word
not a single word
go on and kiss the girl
(kiss the girl)

go on and kiss the girl
(kiss the girl)

floating in a blue lagoon

no time will be better
she don't say a word
and she won't say a word
until you kiss the girl
(kiss the girl)
