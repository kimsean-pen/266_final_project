Your little feet
Your sharp teeth
The way the light hits your eyes
Your scrappy fur
Your fists
The light from the lord
That shines inside

Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing

Sing a song for the new breed
Inside of me

Your deep growl
Your high whine
The uneven way that you move
Your pure heart
Your love
The lord made you to prove something

Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing

Sing a song for the new breed
I could be right
Then you'd be right too
