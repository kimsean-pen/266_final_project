Do you want to follow me indoors
If the elevator be my floor
There's a lonely blackbird on the telephone wire
He's there most days
If we don't have time for everything
Let's at least sit quietly with him
Just long enough to notice when he flies away because he always flies away

And tomorrow everything will change
That's what all our teachers used to say
We don't need to wonder if the rows on our face will turn to grey
But since we know the movements of the stars
We know exactly where we are
And we'll be together when the leaves are acting strange
We'll watch them fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away

There's a mountain underneath the clouds
There's a heaven underneath us now
Can you make out the diamonds on the edge of the sea from where you lay
There's a blackbird sitting on a line
And we're all here navigating time
Let's watch him long enough until he flies away... they always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
They always fly away
