I only know
I don't know anything either
. I have spent a lot of time here.
Feel that love throws you.

There is one thing, one thing
What you can't do
I faced shine.
The use of time eluded.

Where are those cars
I think you don't like me
It's just a crime

Holding on
There is only one thing to do
Find a better place to sound
Find a locker room

I would only know
When you feel what you do
Your love is getting cold here
time bypasses the use

It is not a drug
so you can be how wild that
I'm on your side
