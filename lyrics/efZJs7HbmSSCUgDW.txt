Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa

I look up
There are Dark things coming down
My Parachute can't bring me back to the ground
I lose my faith when I watch the fading lights
Just your shadow's touch makes me feel alive

Hey!
Everybody shout
Hey!
Celebrate it loud
Forever now!
Forever now!

I walk the streets
They are hard, cold, sad, and true
Don't lose your way
I am here with you

Hey!
Everybody shout
Hey!
Celebrate it loud
Forever today
Forever tonight
Reset your eyes
Erase your mind
I will never let you down
Join me forever now
Forever now! (Let's run into the pouring rain)
Forever now! (To feel like we're alive again)

Whisper me
All your secrets
Whisper me
All my secrets
Whisper me
All your secrets
Whisper me
Celebrate it loud

Forever Today
Forever Tonight
Reset your eyes
Erase your mind
I will never let you down
Join me forever now
Forever now! (Let's run into the pouring rain)
To feel like we're alive again
Forever now! (Let's run into the pourin rain)
To feel like we're alive again
