When you're on... I swear, you're on
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all, don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call

Then out of no where,
You put me right back there
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
And we know what happens
When we get to your house
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all,
Please don't tell me now
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call

I throw away everything I've written you
Anything just keep my mind from
Thinking how I had you once
No, I can't forget that
Sometimes I wish I could lose you again

You're winning me over with everything you say
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
When I let you closer,
I only want you closer
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out

If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all,
Please don't tell me now
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call
