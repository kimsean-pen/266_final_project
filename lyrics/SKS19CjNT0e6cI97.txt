So you can heal
They claim with conviction
You got a crowd
So what's your appeal
Your voice
Your predictions
They're getting loud

Well if I let you die
You must forgive me

Raise me up
Up through the ashes
[Welcome the paradise you made]
Take me on
Into the light

You want to die
Create a sensation
Be making the news
An eye for an eye
My king of creation
King of the jews

Before I let you die
You must forgive me

Raise me up
Up through the ashes
[Welcome the paradise you made]
Take me on
Into the light

Give me sign of remorse
I don't need your blood
You will hang on the cross
For playing god

You the people must decide
The self proclaimed prophet
Or the malice murderer
The king or the convict
It's up to you
So tell me
Who's free to go

(Barabbas, Barabbas, Barabbas!)

Raise me up
Up through the ashes
[Forgive my every sin]
Take me on
Into the light
