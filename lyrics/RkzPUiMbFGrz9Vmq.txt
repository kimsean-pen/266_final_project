I don't need money
I don't need sleep
I just wish my man would go home

Cause everything's funny
When it's just you and me
I'm tired of people asking
What I do when I'm alone

They spend the summer getting clean
But September comes
Fall like leaves

Oh what would I do without you?
What would I do without you?

Oh Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one to fix the stupid shit I been through
Oh Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one who knows my favorite color
And it's powder blue

Fuck all my friends
Tell me "Go get a job"
Bloody noses, talking so fast
Like an 8-ball ain't so wrong

All these problems ain't real
Til' I'm stood up or I'm bored
Check for powder, kitchen counter
Can't tell me this ain't real fun

They call their parents
Move back home
Go to church and pray for the sad sad girl

Oh what would I do without you?
What would I do without you?

Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one to fix the stupid shit I been through
Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one who knows my favorite color
And it's powder blue

Whats the point
In being young
So meaningless, without you i'm no good

My big dead eyes
Lost in your buzz
I realize
That you're the only one

Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one to fix the stupid shit I been through
Mr Watson, I've been cheating with you
You're the only one who knows my favorite color
And it's powder blue
