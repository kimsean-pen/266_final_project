een burning up inside day to today
Trying to find the words to explain my sexuality
It's liquid, it's living, a moving love defined by itself
There's no rules, no convention
This love can go where ever it wants

Gimme a human drama
And understand that gender's just a game
Gimme a human drama
All sexuality is not the same
Gimme a human drama
The personal is so political
Gimme a human drama
Again, again

Gimme a human drama
We break a box to find a hundred more
Gimme a human drama
There's lots to learn but so much more to unlearn
Gimme a human drama
The personal is so political
Gimme a human drama
It kinda feels like genders just a lie
Genders just a lie
