I never was a lonely drifter
Slow brained cheater
Live for the money now
I never was afraid to speak my mind
Baby's got a baby sitter
A cocaine dealer
Stack up the money now
I'll rather be a hustler than a clown
When the world will be polluted by the ashes of the sun
Ain't nobody gonna tell me where to run
If there is a god she probably wants me to explore the universe
And if life is just a ride it should be fun

And the air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up
The air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

My heart is going bang bang when I
Sing for you I live for the moment now
Being in a one subconsious mind
Maybe I'm a one trick pony but I
Ride it ride it ride it ride it ride it honey
Maybe I'm a master of disguise
When the world will be polluted by the ashes of the sun
Ain't nobody gonna tell me where to run
If there is a god she probably wants me to explore the universe
And if life is just a ride it should be fun

And the air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

The air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

Gonna sleep in december
In december
Waking up and it's summer
It's summer
Liberation of my life
Liberation
Moving in to the light

And the air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

The air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

So the air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up

The air is free
I'll do whatever I want
I'm coming up
