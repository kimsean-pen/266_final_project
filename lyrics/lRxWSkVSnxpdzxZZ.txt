It seems that all successful things and all
The envy that they bring might not be
Worth it. Being shot down every minute
For the effort you put in and all the time
That you've spent. The key to success is
The faith in knowing you're right.
Memories of better days is what you're
Holding on to, when the critics loved you.
Competition has it's way of bringing you
Down.
Always being number one, robs the music
Of it's fun. Ego trips get in the way of the
Goals we've set. Now the audience is
Split. We've worked too hard to watch it
ALL FADE AWAY.
Memories of better days is what you're
Holding on to, when the critics loved you.
Competition has it's way of making you
Mad. Why can't you be glad... for me.
Well I know what competition means and
The feelings that it brings. Friends that
Want to be on top, you're on the list of
Friends to drop. Success is what I want
To feel, at your expense it isn't real, it's
Jealousy... and jealousy's not true. No it's
Not true... at your expense. In
Competition with you.
