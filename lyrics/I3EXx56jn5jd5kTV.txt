They began a magical journey
To the ancient dragonland
For ten days they walked through majestic woods
Their vision ever at hand

The dragons fly in the blue skies
The mountains show their might
Standing in the heart of the land
What a sight!

See the deer, trolls and wolves, lovely creatures
They're guardians of this land
Such wonder and beauty lives in their hearts
To see is to understand

The dragons fly in the blue skies
The mountains show their might
Standing in the heart of the land
What a sight!

The river will lead them to Urien
The mystical home of the gods
Now a mass of ruins
Because of the last war

See the falls of Erloria
The grey mountains are near
Dark shadows falling
Daylight's end is here

And all the creatures of darkness
They warn us in the night
In the darkland there is danger
There's evil there to fight
