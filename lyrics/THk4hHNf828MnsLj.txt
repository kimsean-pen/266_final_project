You see the night is all I have to make me feel
And all I want is just a love to make it hurt
'Cause all I need is something fine to make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you

Because this song is all I have to make me feel
And all it takes is just a love to make it hurt
And every sound arranged in time could make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you

And now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move one, I never knew what to rely upon
And now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're are unhappy still I will be hanging on your line
Should you return, should you return, should you return

Because the night is all I have to make me feel
And all I want is just a dream to make it worthwhile
'Cause all I need is someone close to make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you

And now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move on, I never knew what to rely upon
And now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're unhappy still I will be hanging on your line

And now there's nothing left to do to draw you eyes
I never knew where to move on, I never knew what to rely upon

And now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're just sinking down I will pulling on your line
And now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move on, I never knew what to rely upon

And now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're unhappy still I will be hanging on your line
Should you return, should you return, should you return
