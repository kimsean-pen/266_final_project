A million old soldiers will fade away
But a dream goes on forever
I'm left standing here, Ive got nothing to say
All is silent within my dream

A thousand true loves will live and die
But a dream goes on forever
The days and the years all go streaking by
But the time is stopped within my dream

We all have our everyday hopes and fears
And you'll find no exception in me
But that doesn't get me through a sea of tears
Over life's biggest tragedy

You're so long ago and so far away
But a dream goes on forever
I guess I believe that I'll see you one day
For without it there is no dream

You're so far away and so long ago
But my dream lives on forever
How much I love you you'll never know
'Till you join me within my dream
How much I love you you'll never know
'Till you join me within my dream
