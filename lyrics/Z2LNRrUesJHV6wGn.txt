I got nothin' where I've been
Will you bring me there again?
No-one ever understands
You won't change to help them

I got lost inside a lie
With a smile you made it die
I'm not there and you know why
And I run to get some more.

More.

Can I be there all the time?
Can I stop to wonder why?
Will I crumble? Will I fly?
And I've got to break it.

Will I be in time to see?
Will it run over me?
Can I fake out just to be?
You know I can't take it on.

On.

Held a picture yesterday.
Held a picture of a moment that I want.
I want.
I want.

You have time for me again.
But you flatten me instead.
Tried to hear the things you said.
Feel like I almost had it.

But I don't have it at all.
And I'm sweatin' tryin' to stall.
Til I think I heard a call.
I look, you're just laughing on.

On.

On.

Held a picture yesterday.
Held a picture of a moment of our love.
I want.
I want.
