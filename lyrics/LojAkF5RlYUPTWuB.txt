No one ever saw me like you do
All the things that I could add up too

I never knew just what a smile was worth
But your eyes see everything without a single word
'Cause there's somethin' in the way you look at me

It's as if my heart knows you're the missing piece
You make me believe that there's nothing in this world I can't be

I never know what you see
But there's somethin' in the way you look at me
If I could freeze a moment in my mind

It'll be the second that you touch your lips to mine

I'd like to stop the clock, make time stands still
'Cause, baby, this is just the way I always wanna feel
'Cause there's somethin' in the way you look at me
It's as if my heart knows you're the missing piece
You make me believe that there's nothing in this world I can't be
I never know what you see
But there's somethin' in the way you look at me
BRIDGE
I don't know how or why I feel different in your eyes
All I know is it happens every time
'Cause there's somethin' in the way you look at me
It's as if my heart knows you're the missing piece
You make me believe that there's nothing in this world I can't be
I never know what you see
But there's somethin' in the way you look at me
The way you look at me
