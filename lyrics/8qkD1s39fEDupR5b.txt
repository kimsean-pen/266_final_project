Why boasteth thyself, O evil men
Playing smart and-a not being clever!
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity (if a-so, a-so),
But the goodness of Jah - Jah
Endureth for ever

So if you are the big tree,
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down, (well sharp)
To cut you down

These are the words of my master
Keep on tellin' me: no weak out shall prosper

Eh! Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it - fall in it
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it (fall in it)

If you are the big tree,
Let me tell you that: we are the small axe
Sharpened ready - ready to cut you down, (well sharp)
To cut you down.

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, to cut you down,
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, to cut you down)

These are the words of my master
Tellin' me that: no weak out shall prosper

And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, uh! - bury in it!
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, uh! (bury in it)

If you are the big, big tree,
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down, (well sharp)
To cut you down

If you are the big, big tree,
Let me tell you that: we are the small axe
Ready to cut you down, (well sharp)
To cut you down
