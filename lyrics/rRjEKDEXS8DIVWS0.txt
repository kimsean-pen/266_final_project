Replace the formula and diverge with pop rocks.
This front ta-ta go away.
Idit doesn't fear, in my face.

It feels like I'm going in this unders alone.
*hard rock hands*
Oh be you there, I see da bee eerie.
Abu, are we together? Or apart?
Because is a new start.
*hard rock hands*

I'm all by myself and I know I need to change.
So say goodbye to the nah tonight, friend Dean.
Say goodbbye to the drugs and the drinking.

*hard rock hands*

On and off isa. Work anymore.
Is it the happy ending?
Or is this a spaceship?
Lick it and thinking, overrated.
*hard rock hands*

*hard rock hands*

*hard rock hands*

*hard rock hands*

Together or apart, set the tone.
