Let's Go!
break!

Boy, you've been running around too long
And I think you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of my bed
It's time for me to draw the line

(So you think that)
You can call me the only one, then walk out the door
(And you think that)
You can run around having fun and just come back for more

(I think that)
You're living in a fantasy, it gotta be them or me
And if you try it one more time
Baby, don't expect me to come running back

(Running back to you)
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running
(Running back to you)
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running

Boy, hope you see before too late
I won't play the fool, no, not this time
I'll show you just how wrong you are
To think I just can't get you out of my mind

(So you think that)
You can just play me off, then walk out the door
(Oh, you think that)
You can just run around and come back for more

(I think that)
You're living in a fantasy, it gotta be them or me
And if you kiss me once more
Baby, don't expect me

To come running back
(Running back to you)
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running
(Running back to you)
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running
Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back, I won't come running

You can't just dis me when you wanna
(Dis me when you wanna)
Or come and go when you wanna
(Come and go when you wanna)
I hear you're playing around when you wanna
(Around when you wanna)
Any time that you wanna

Oh oh, oh
Or just tell me lies when you wanna
(Tell me lies when you wanna)
I got more than you wanna
Oh, and by the way

I won't come running back, I won't come running, no
Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back, no, I won't come running

Runnin'
Runnin'
Runnin'

I won't come running
(Running back to you)
Then you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you
I won't come running
(Running back to you)
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh no, I won't come running back, I won't come running
No, oh no, I won't come running back, I won't come running

Running back to you, no
