If all these perfect lives run out, where will we stand?
Will I be rendered insignificant?
Will you still wanna be my friend?
'Cause if you don't I understand eternally
Just know I'll always grab ahold of you if you reach out for me

And it's so weird to navigate these fears
I'll be so sad if you fade away from here

When all these guest room nights run out, where will I go?
Back to the iridescent memories that I chose to leave alone?
And would I make it back to find the colors fade
Just like a sentimental photograph that I need to throw away?

And it's so weird to navigate these fears
I'll be so sad if you fade away from here

All these nights we spend
I hope they're always worth something
Is it all right to be on the darker side of you and me?

And when the sunlight melts away, who will you be?
Will you wanna be here?
Will you wanna be here with me?

All these nights we spend
I hope they're always worth something
Is it all right to be on the darker side
On the darker side, on the darker side of you and me?
