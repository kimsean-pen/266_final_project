The worship of inferae tombs
A communion of sycophants
How long is the line to our doom
Deceivers and lying chants
(chorus;)
And god damn you
You're the shadows of man
And god damn you
For it's kill or be killed in the end
The numbers crossed lines in the sand
The pools of human rats
Their tails are twisted and tied
Eat of thy poison divine
(chorus;)
The torturer slowly brought doom
Irreverent the ingrate laughed
Mendacious and full of black rants
Dark grins and knives in backs
(chorus;)
(end chorus;)
Take what is given to you - death surrounds you
Stuck low with souls for the moon-death surrounds you
Black garbs the hosting of two - death surrounds you!
