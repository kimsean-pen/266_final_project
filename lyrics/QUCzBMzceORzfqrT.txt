We are looking in on you now
What do you think you can do now?
You're very small from way out here
The last thing you will feel is fear

Give you a chance to do the right thing
Give you a chance to do the bright thing
Now our sense is all disgusted
We have found you can't be trusted
Hey!

Where I come from, no-one smiles
Every inch exists in miles
Still it's cool, relaxed and calm
Sitting here on the funny farm
Oh!

Where all the hilltops scream in pain
There are no leaders you can blame
Human greed destroys your sphere
And there's no room for you out here

You're on your own now
You're on your own now
You're on your own now
You're on your own now

You're on your own now
You're on your own now
