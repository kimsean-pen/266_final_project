Take my longings and believe them
Light a candle if you know
I breathe love, don't wanna be there
These are things I got to know
The magic seems so far
Don't know who they are

Let me go Minor Heaven
Cause my blood to run
Leave this place, unforgiven
Heal me with your sun
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven

Light a way for me to walk on
From the ashes to the sky
Burn the thorns so I can hold on
Trust in me I know I'm right
You know it's gone too far
Leave them where they are

Let me go Minor Heaven
Cause my blood to run
Leave this place, unforgiven
Heal me with your sun
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven

Even if nothing I'll become
Something I've been for all too long
Let me go Minor Heaven

Let me go Minor Heaven
Cause my blood to run
Leave this place, unforgiven
Heal me with your sun
How can I come undone?
Let me know Minor Heaven
