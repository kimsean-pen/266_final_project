Sometimes he says yes
Times he says come over
Sometimes he says no
Sometimes he says no

I know he's just a stone
In the water
I'm just tryin' to get back
He's an appetizer

Sometimes he says yes
Times he says come over
Sometimes he says no
Sometimes he says no

I know he's young at heart
Sunny sky with muddy sky
Spends his nights s-standing by (?)
Getting other women drunk

Sometimes he says yes
Times he says come over
Sometimes he says no
Sometimes he says no

When he's about to leave
He drops his eyes and speaks
About the other times
And promises he'll ride (?)

But it's always me
Who says I wanna see
Sometimes he responds
(???) With wonder of your loves (???)

Sometimes he says yes
Times he says come over
Sometimes he says no
Sometimes he says no

I'm a fool everytime
I think that I'm OK
Then I can't get him off my mind

Sometimes he says yes
Times he says come over
(?) pleasantly, cause I know
He's just an appetizer
