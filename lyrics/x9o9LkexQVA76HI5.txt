All over the world
People must meet and part,
There's someone like me
Feeling the pain in the heart.

Someone may meet again
Under the same bright star,
If maybe some night
You come back from afar.
Who cares if tonight
I don't know where you are.

Are you thinking of me now?
Missing having me around?
If you have forgotten me
My world will come tumbling down.

All over the world
Others are sad tonight
There's someone like me
Watching the sun's fading light.

All over the sky
There is the same warm glow,
Here under that star
I'm wanting you to know

...Wherever you are that I still love you so.
...Wherever you are that I still love you so.
