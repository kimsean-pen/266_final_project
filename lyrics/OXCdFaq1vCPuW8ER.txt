Go out and everybody's so cool
I don't know what to do so I'll impress you
People seem so easy in their own clothes
I shouldn't be here I just wanna go home

I want to be everybody, everybody
I just can't be everybody everybody

New shoes new shirt but the same guy
I can't bring myself to tell the same lies
I just stand here and hope I don't look too bad
The fact that I can't be me is just so sad

I want to be everybody everybody
I just can't be everybody everybody

Thank god I've got a friend to share with
Must be fate there ain't no way to have planned this
Let's go home let's forget about the outside
Lock the door shut the curtains and hide

I want to be everybody everybody
I just can't be everybody everybody
