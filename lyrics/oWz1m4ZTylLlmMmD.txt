He is hater of the rotten Earth
He is the nova that will drape the sky in woe
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the lord of those who dwell bound in sickness
Spitting vomit in the face of faith
Cleansing us who must atone for being weak
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the shadow cast upon those defiled

Victorious call
It will not befall
No salvation is free
Death comes beckoning thee
Encircle thee
Voices come in wind
Son of perdition
You come beckoning me

He is hater of the rotten Earth
He is the nova that will drape the sky in woe
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the lord of those who dwell bound in sickness
Spitting vomit in the face of faith
Cleansing us who must atone for being weak
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the shadow cast upon those defiled

Victorious call
It will not befall
No salvation is free
Death comes beckoning thee
Encircle thee
Voices come in wind
Son of perdition
You come beckoning me

The sky embedded in the death of a nova
Effigy is seen in a second of light
No voice in the crack of his mouth
Bastard son of God

He is hater of the rotten Earth
He is the nova that will drape the sky in woe
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the lord of those who dwell bound in sickness
Spitting vomit in the face of faith
Cleansing us who must atone for being weak
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the shadow cast upon those defiled

Victorious call
It will not befall
No salvation is free
Death comes beckoning thee
Encircle thee
Voices come in wind
Son of perdition
You come beckoning me
