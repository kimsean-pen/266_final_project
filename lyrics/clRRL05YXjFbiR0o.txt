empty on the inside
searching - for all my life
empty on the inside
aching - for all my life
empty on the inside
hunting - for all my life

what made me whole is slipping through my hands
youth leaves us all as this death commands
and i can't shake these beasts from my bones
it's their rabid hunger that built me this home
and it sickens me to say this is the only way
but if it hurts you i know it must be true

empty on the inside
aching - for all my life
empty on the inside
hunting - for all my life
empty on the inside
losing - for all my life
i am empty
