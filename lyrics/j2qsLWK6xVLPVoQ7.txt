My house my house is yours
So you can take your coat off
And you can close the door
My love's not going to run out
You've asked me this before
I'm gonna say the same thing
My heart my heart is yours
You've gotta learn to trust me

'Cause I didn't say only 'til the party ends
No I didn't say only 'til the Money's spent
No I didn't say only when the music plays
Oh... I said always
Oh... I said always

You hide your heart away
'Cause hearts just end up hurting
I am here to stay
Just wish you felt like you deserved it
Your eyes are on the floor
I wish you saw what I see
I'm forever yours
Darling please believe me

'Cause I didn't say only 'til the fun runs out
No I didn't say only 'til this all falls down
No I didn't say only if the sunshine stays
Oh whoa oh oh oh
I said always
Always
Always
Always, always

What else can I say to convince you?
I'm not gonna leave you
Oh, I'm here to stay, yeah

Come on take my hand
Rest your head upon my shoulder
I will help you stand
Please just let me help you

'Cause I didn't say only till the night time comes
No I didn't say only while we're both still young
No I didn't say only while the music plays
I said always
Oh... I said always
