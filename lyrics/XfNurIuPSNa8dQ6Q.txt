I don't mind
You're someone that ain't mine
But someone that I'll get
And you don't know how
Hard I've tried
To convince myself that I
Can easily forget

But you left this feeling
Here inside me
One that never fails to find me

On a rainy Monday
A feeling inside me
Like the days of summer

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day

I won't lie
I still can't say that I
Admit we went too far
And you won't see me change my mind
But I really wish that I
Could forget the way you are

But you left this feeling here inside me
The battle in my mind still fights me

On a rainy Monday
A feeling inside me
Like the days of summer

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day

Now that I can see that
You're not beside me
But I still feel you
Shine inside of me

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
Like the days of summer

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside of me
Like the days of summer

On a rainy Monday
I feel it inside me
In the hopes of one day
