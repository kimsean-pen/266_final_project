They say it's gonna take a miracle to bring you back again
They say there's nothing they can do
But I'm not the only one who sees the possibility in you
You know you're mama sees it too

No matter what it takes
I'll make sure that you find, you find your way
I'll know how hard you've been tryin'
Little one

I never wanna be a mystery to you
I'm not a god and I ain't no saint
I'm just a man workin' every day to be a better man
One day you'll learn to be one too

No matter what it takes
I won't let you make the same mistakes
But I won't hold nothin' against you
I will always be there to hold your hand
And I can help you walk but can't make you stand

So whenever you feel like you can't go on
Just believe you can, you can
And you will, you always will
Oh, you always will

No matter what it takes
I'll make sure that you find, you find your way
I'll know how hard you've been tryin', yeah
I won't let you make the same mistake

I'll always love you
Little one
Little one
