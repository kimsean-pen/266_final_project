We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, there isn't a soul around
People start coming
All we do is just grin
Said we've got to move out
Because the city's moving in
I said we've got to move out
Because the city's moving in

Tell me who you know
And I'll tell you who, too
Go see my friend and he'll set you free
Tell me what you see and
Maybe I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me

Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah

Good morning glory, Hallelujah to you
What is the story, what's been going through you
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're moving, we're getting out
We're moving, without a doubt
We're moving, we're going far
We're moving, oh yes we are

Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me
Nobody knows there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me, ah
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy

(Guitar Solo)

Level with God
And you're in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself
And you'll hear what you want to know
Got to rise above
Because below it's only getting worse
Life in time
Will take you where you want to go

Where you want to go, where you want to go
Where are you going

(Guitar Solo)

Good morning glory, Hallelujah to you
What is the story, what's been going through you
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're moving, we're getting out
We're moving, without a doubt
We're moving, we're going far
We're moving, oh yes we are

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, there isn't a soul around
People start coming
All we do is just grin
Said we've got to move out
Because the city's moving in
I said we've got to move out
Because the city's moving in
