We could have skipped this part
I could have taught how to love yourself
I waited patiently
I hoped that you would be the one to come to me
I try to talk to you
I thought that you would recognize the need
That you had deep inside
But you had to get there by yourself

I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
You know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain
I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to add this to the next
You let 'em use you good
Then they turn around and say you're sick
Is this what you deserve?
You're just a man, you're a human being
And will you listen now
This doesn't have to be the way things end

I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain
I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain

Ah-ahhh
Uh-uh
Ah-ahhh
Help me please,
Why don't you come to me?

I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain
I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain
I don't understand, help me please
Tell me everything, make me see
Know that I would give you anything
I'll take away the pain, I'll take away the stain
