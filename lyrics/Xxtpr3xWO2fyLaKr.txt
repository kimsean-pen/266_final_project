Come feel my heart
It's beating like a drum & I confess
When you're around
It's like an army's marching through my chest

And there's nothing I can do
I just gravitate towards you
You're pulling on me like the moon
I just wanna get you sideways
I'll say anything I can to get me more than just a dance
Tell me where to put my hands
You know that you could be my favorite one-night stand
You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
'Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

You're like a song
A beautiful symphony to my eyes
So take me on
I wanna sing along all through the night
I'm not like the other boys 'cause with you I've got no choice
You make me wanna lose my voice
I just wanna get you sideways
No, I'm not the type to lie but I might just start tonight
Let me turn off all these lights
You know that you could be my favorite lullaby
You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
'Cause you know I la, la, la, lie

Like a symphony
like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony
like a symphony tonight

Sounds like a symphony, like a symphony, like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony
like a symphony tonight

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
'Cause you know I la, la, la, la, la...

What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, loved you?
Do if I said it tonight?
What would you do if I told you that I la, la, la, la, loved you?
'Cause you know I la, la, la, lie
