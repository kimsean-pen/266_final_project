Down with disease
Three weeks in my bed
Trying to stop these demons that keep
Dancing in my head

Down with disease
And I'm up before the dawn
A thousand barefoot children outside
Dancing on my lawn
Dancing on my lawn, and I keep

Waiting for the time when I can finally say
This has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way
But when I think it's time to leave it all behind
I try to find a way to
But there's nothing I can say to
Make it stop
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop)

Down with disease
And the jungles in my mind
They're climbing up my waterfalls and
Swingin' on my vines

So I try to hear the music
But I'm always losing time
'Cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're
Stealin' all my lines
Stealin' all my lines and I keep
