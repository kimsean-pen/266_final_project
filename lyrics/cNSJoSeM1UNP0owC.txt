[Artie]
On the floor of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go
With the record selection
With the needle inflection
I'm dancing with myself
When there's no one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well I wait so long
For my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

I'm dancing with myself
I'm dancing with myself
Well, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
And I'll be dancing with myself

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh, dancing with myself
Oh, dancing with myself
Oh, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh, dancing with myself
Oh, dancing with myself
Oh, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
And I'll be dancing with myself

Dancing with myself
Oh, dancing with myself
Well, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Dancing with myself
Dancing with myself
Well, there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
And I'm dancing with myself
