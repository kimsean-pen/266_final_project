Children so traumatized in the first years of life that they do not bond with other people. They are children who cannot love or accept love. Who could hurt or even kill without remorse. Could a great deal of this be demons?

We both know that there's a season
A time and place to believe in
The strength is gonna come and we both need it
To give this up right now

And there's no easy way to say that we both changed
The life we knew, well it won't ever be the same

I'm just holding on to my better demons
And I really need them not to fail me now
I speak in tongues but I can never free them
And my spirit weakens but I won't back down

No holy ghost, no holy spirit
I'm on my own right now
Do the angels sing if you can't hear them?
Cause I don't hear a sound

And there's no easy way to tell you that I'm gone

I'm just holding on to my better demons
And I really need them not to fail me now
I speak in tongues but I can never free them
And my spirit weakens but I won't back down

(one 1 of 4 Americans right now)
(1 in 4 families is affected by...)

Leave me well, i'm weak from the glass you break
On my own I face down all my enemies

I'm just holding on to my better demons
And I really need them not to fail me now
I speak in tongues but I can never free them
And my spirit weakens but I won't back down

In your nightmare what happens?
I get really scared
Where are you in the nightmare? What happens in the dream?
I'm in my house upstairs
And then what happens next?
And then he comes upstairs and, um, hurts
