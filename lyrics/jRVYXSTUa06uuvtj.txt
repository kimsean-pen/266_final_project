Oh, here you are
and you're all you wished to be
you're alive and you're
not alone
not alone in this.

So close your eyes
hear the whole world
call your name
and you answer
please don't go
please don't go away.

All I know is here
and now
and right away.
Call me here
I will appear like
light of day.

All of the words
of the songs
we all will sing
mean the same thing
and it's not goodbye
and it's not "go away".

Mom, bye.
Dad, bye.

Call my name,
behold the strength
of my embrace.
All I sing to
hear my prayer
don't go away.

All of your life
you've been holding on
to just one thing
and it calls you
please don't go
please don't go away.
