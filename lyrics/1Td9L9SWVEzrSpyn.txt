She loves me like a tiger in a jungle not far away
I love the way she loves me yea I love the games we play
We're dreamin' in the afternoon so you better got somethin' to say
With all our emotions here from a thousand miles away

All I see are yellow trees lookin' down at you and me
Running from the thought police cause we don't like authority
In a jungle made of stars it's raining jewelry
My girl imagination yea she always sets me free

I tried with all my might yea but I never saw her again
Lookin' left and right I searched cause I'm living in pretend
Will I find the answers here or will I see the end
My girl imagination yea I tell you she's my only friend
