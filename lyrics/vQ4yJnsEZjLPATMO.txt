There must be something I could say
And if I never wake again
Remember me just as I'm breathing before you
The same as all along
I'll hold you from sorrow
It's better off this way and
If I die tomorrow
What of me follows you forever?
Unforgiven sins
And all that lies beneath my skin
All these things I never told you
There must be something I could say
And if I never wake again
Remember me just as I'm breathing before you
The same as all along
Here I am in color
No luster, glamour or gold
I hope you'd remember me
Dressed in shadows, black and white
To flatter the faulted soul
You never witnessed me unfold
All these things I never told you
There must be something I could say
And if I never wake again
Remember me just as I'm breathing before you
The same as all along
There must be something I could say
And if I never wake again
Remember me just as I'm breathing before you
The same as all along
The same as all along
The same as all along
The same as all along
The same as all along
