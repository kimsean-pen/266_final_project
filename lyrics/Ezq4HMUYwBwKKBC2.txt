Closing in on empty spaces
Winners laugh too soon
Their paper world with paper faces
Beneath a paper moon

Well there's a man,
A real pace setter
Coming after me
And after him there's someone better
And after him there's me

Oh well he'll offer you a cigarette
He'll offer you a light
But he hasn't finished with you yet
On another long knife night

So look behind you
There's the man you're chasing
Look behind you
Let's go human racing,
Human racing
Let's go racing now

Open arms and open purses
Open seasons here
Well they fill your head with clever verses
And then they disappear

Silent vows in secret places
They'll get you somehow
Cause you never win in human races
So who's the loser now?

Look behind you
There's the man you're chasing
Look behind you
Let's go human racing,
Human racing
Let's go racing now

Oooh

Round and around we go
Human racing yeah, ooh
After me, after you
Round and around we go
Who's the loser now...?
