Good morning sunshine, awake when the sun hits the sky.
Look up, the sounds that surround the day you died.
She waits for me outside in a hole in the ground.
In this one way thinking you might get the upper hand.

Dear Newo Ikkin, how's Apollo been treating you?
Has he been a good boy since the day I left?
Give him my love and a sweet kiss for his head,
Cause I won't be coming home... When you get this, I'll be dead.

Norris and Larry, Gloria to nowhere.
Sir, I think you'd better take my hand and pray we'll make this one out alive.
Captain, we've lost all systems control.
Then son, I'll see you in my sleep.
(Sleep...)

IS IT all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
IS IT the dreams that one day you might be something you're wrong?
IS IT all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
Is it the dreams that make us real?
Is it the dreams that make us real?

We'll miss you and wait for you when you come.
Wrong way, right way.
Bad luck; what God has been giving me.

"I don't believe retirement is included in the contract,
"Because then the contract would expire.
"If we rush at this time there will be fitting results, you are right.
"The supervisor is a fool."

(We'll miss you and wait for you when you come.)
Wrong way, right way.
Bad luck; you got to be kidding me.

I've spent so long sitting down here.
Paper cut my heart in half and discard the evidence!
When it's yours, come send me the last half
Dowsed in kerosene in a torched, blazed, blood bath.
WHEN BOY SETS fire, God knows you've lost
At a cost that has no price when you've purchased guilt.
Stand at attention and make sure you know THE LINES, and yourself.
And you'd say, "I'll be home alone again, waiting."
WAIT.

Wave to me alright;
I'm still a boy down there,
When you want to promise me that...

Wait for me alright;
I'm still a boy down there,
When you want to promise me that...

Wait for me alright;
I'm still a boy down there,
When you want to promise me that...

(To drive down...) Wave to me alright;
(Where's Wednesday?) I'm still a boy down there,
(Where's Wednesday?) When you want to promise me that...

(To drive down...) Wave to me alright;
(Where's Wednesday?) I'm still a boy down there,
