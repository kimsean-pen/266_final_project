Where's the paper bag that holds the liquor?
Just in case I feel the need to puke.
If we'd known what it'd take to get here,
Would we have chosen to?
Would we have chosen to?

So you wanna build an altar on a summer night?
You wanna smoke the gel off a fentanyl patch.
Ain'tcha heard the news? Adam and Eve were Jews.
And I always loved you to the max.

I loved you to the max
I loved you to the max
I loved you to the max

If it gets really really bad,
If it ever gets really really bad,
Let's not kid ourselves.
It gets really really bad.

Punks in the beerlight
Burnouts in love.
Punks in the beerlight
Toulouse-Lautrec.
Punks in the beerlight
Two burnouts in love.

I'd always loved you to the max
I loved you to the max
I loved you to the max
