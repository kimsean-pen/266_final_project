It was a strange place and a tender age
I was just a babe in school
Saw them roll their eyes at me
Every time that I thought that I was cool

Well uh God knows I was no chosen one
That just wasn't my prime
Yeah it's just matter of time, honey
It's just a matter of time

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night
And in the pouring rain

Yeah, I'm a work-a-holic
And I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square
Yeah

Show me what you got (yeah)
Work this body on the floor (yeah)
Who do you think you are? (yeah)
C'mon meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!

It ain't no matter of "if", honey
It's just a matter of "when"
Ah, some sunday when it's my face
In the newspaper again

All the rag magazines, black limousines
They'll be getting in line
Yeah it's just a matter of time, honey
It's just a matter of time

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night
And in the pouring rain
Yeah, I'm a work-a-holic
And I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square
Yeah

Show me what you got (yeah)
Work this body on the floor (yeah)
Just who do you think you are (yeah)
C'mon meet me on the court

Que ferais-tu?
Putain, je ne sais pas!
Ne vient pas pleurer
Vers moi...

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night
And in the pouring rain

Yeah, I'm a work-a-holic
And I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square

And I will work this body
I will burn this flame
Oh in the dead of night
And in the pouring rain

Yeah, I'm a work-a-holic
And I swear, I swear
Yeah, and one day I will beat you fair and square
Yeah
