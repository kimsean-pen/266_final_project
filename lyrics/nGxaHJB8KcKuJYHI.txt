'Cause I wanna fall
But every time you leave me down on the floor
Memories keep rushing round
Cause nothing ever stays the same

Cause maybe I'm
Just addicted to
The things I lack
And the way you move
In circles run
Round a figure eight
Always running off
Meeting up in the same place

Slow down
Pick up the pieces I've found
We're living our lives half asleep
Living our lives half asleep

Cause I wanna go
Where everything's the same
Memories keep rushing round
And all we ever do is change
Cause I wanna fall
But every time you leave me down on the floor
Picturing the ways we move

Cause nothing ever stays the same
Separate a fragile spine
A hollow hope
Just to make things right
I've been picking up pieces slowly
And wondering why you hold me

Take me back to the way it was before
Cause I wanna go
Where everything's the same
Memories keep rushing round
And all we ever do is change
Cause I wanna fall
But every time you leave me down on the floor

Picturing the ways we move
Cause nothing ever stays the same

Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Cause I wanna go
Where everything's the same
Memories keep rushing round
And all we ever do is change
Cause I wanna fall
But every time you leave me down on the floor
Picturing the ways we move
cause nothing ever stays the same
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to.
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want
