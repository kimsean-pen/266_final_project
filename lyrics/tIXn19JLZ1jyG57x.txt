She's got the looks from picture books
Well just a smile that's all it took
I wanna know why you do this, what you do to me, yeah

She's got the walk to make you sing
Just think of love, I just can't wait
I wanna know why you do this, what you do to me, yeah

She's one good lover
One to another
One good lover
Made for each other

She's got the style that drives me wild
Moves like a cat, scratched me like that
I wanna know why you do this, what you do to me, yeah
To me, yeah

She's got the push into something good
I know this rat's caught in her trap
I wanna know why you do this, what you do to me

She's one good lover
One to another
One good lover
Made for each other

Yeah, yeah

I only want to bring you closer to me
It's something we can see
I want to see you over me
You're the one for me

She's one good lover
One to another
One good lover
Made for each other

She's one good lover
One to another
She's one good lover
Made for each other

One good lover
