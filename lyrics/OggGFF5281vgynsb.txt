Following my nose
A detective with no lead
Only my dreams know
What's got into me
I run by your side
But I'm out of breath
Lower than the sea
And it's killing me
And it's killing me

If I choose to go with the way I'm feeling
Does it really mean that's the way it is
Is it just a trick that my eyes are playing on my mind
Following the passage of least resistance
Following the pack just to pass the gate
It's a little late for a change of plan
Don't you think

I got lost following you
Following you

There's a camaraderie
In a number for my chest
Do this and do that
And forget the rest
But as the tide retreats
It's showing me the shore
There's danger going deeper
But I can't be here anymore
Can't be here anymore

If I choose to go with the way I'm feeling
Does it really mean that's the way it is
Is it just a trick that my eyes are playing on my mind
Following the passage of least resistance
Following the pack just to pass the gate
It's a little late for a change of plan
Don't you think

I got lost following you

What did I do that for
Am I an idiot
What did I do that for
Am I an idiot
What did I do that, do that for
I run by your side
But I'm out of breath
And it's killing me
And it's killing me

If I choose to go with the way I'm feeling
Does it really mean that's the way it is
Is it just a trick that my eyes are playing on my mind
Following the passage of least resistance
Following the pack just to pass the gate
It's a little late for a change of plan
Don't you think

I got lost following you
Time could have stopped
And I never knew
I got lost following you
Following you
