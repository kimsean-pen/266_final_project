There's things I want, there's things I think I want
There's things I have, there's things I wanna have
Do I want the dreams? The ones we're forced to see

Do I want the perfect wife? Word perfect, ain't quite right
Shopping every day yeah, take it back the next break
They say the more you fly, the more you risk your life

And I'm just looking, I'm not buying
I'm just looking it keeps me smiling

A house I've seen another could have been
You drenched my head and said what I said
Said that life is what you make of it yet most of us just fake

And I'm just looking, I'm not buying
I'm just looking it keeps me smiling

And I'm just looking, I'm not buying
And I'm just looking it keeps me trying

And I'm just looking, I'm not buying
Well I'm just looking it keeps me smiling

There's things I want, there's things I think I want
There's things I have, there's things I wanna have
They say the more you fly, the more you risk your life

Well I'm just looking, I'm not buying
I'm just looking, keeps me smiling
