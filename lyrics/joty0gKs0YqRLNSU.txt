This appeared as a moral dilemma
Cause at first it was weird though I swore to eliminate
The worst of the plague that devoured humanity
It's true I was vague on the 'How'
so how can it be that you have shown me the light?

It's a brand new day
And the sun is high
All the birds are singing
That you're gonna die

How I hesitated
Now I wonder why
It's a brand new day

All the times that you beat me unconscious I'll forgive
All the crimes Incomplete, listen honestly I'll live
Mr. Cool, Mr. Right, Mr. Knowitall is through
Now my future's so bright and I owe it all to you Who showed me the light

It's a brand new me
I've got no remorse
Now the water's rising but I know the course
I'm gonna shock the world
Gonna Show Bad Horse
It's a Brand New Day

And Penny will see the evil me
Not a joke not a dork not a failure
And she may cry but her tears will dry
When I hand her the keys to a shiny new Australia.

It's a brand new day
Yeah the sun is high
All the angels sing
Because you're gonna die

Go ahead and laugh
Yeah I'm a funny guy
Tell everyone goodbye
It's a brand new day
