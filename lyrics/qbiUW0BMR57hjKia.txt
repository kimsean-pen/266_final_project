Spaced in time
Child of nine
Doin' twenty years on the way
Fire and steel
Earth unreal
Find another planet to stay
Papa died
Ma survived
Tellin' me about her ordeal
And the soul she could not feel
'cause they made her so unreal
Lightnin' years
Disappears
Twenty million years on my brain
Synthesize
Overrides
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane
And my soul I can not feel
'cause they made me so unreal
Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind
And I'm never ever goin' back
I'm off the track
No one even knows I'm alive
Spaced
Without a trace
Waitin' for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive
