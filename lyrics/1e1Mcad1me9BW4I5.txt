it's a ghost town, dreaming in footprints
can't leave a healthy well, so poisen and escape
the soundtrack for then is a taxi for now
cover up with the shadows, sleeping on the floor
Goddamn, I wish I a little bit smarter
to be the futurebound, we'll try rewound
I wish I a little bit smarter, I wish I was...
can I be her true love, a concertrator?
and a circuit in your lullaby, a conferencing enemy
