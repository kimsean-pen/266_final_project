To far, to see.
Back up while we still have the time.
Out on you're own, for long.
Finger to the bone, but I can't get you off my mind.

I wanna know how you're blinded.
How to find it.
Don't remind me.
Always trouble but higher than the rope.
Why don't you come outside?

Understand my pain.
Take me where you will.
It's so easy to play when you're standing still.
Since the day that I come,
all my life feels so glum.
I just wanna go.
I just wanna.

I wanna know how you're blinded.
How to find it.
Don't remind me.
Always trouble but higher than the rope.
Why don't you come outside?

The grouds and loads of empty signs.
You're heading nowhere.
You're too lost, to care.
Just when you get there,
you'll find youself one day.

I wanna know how you're blinded.
How to find it.
Don't remind me.
Always trouble but higher than the rope.
Why don't you come outside?
