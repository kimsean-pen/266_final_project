Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

And you say, "Oh, no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train
Slow, slow! The light's turing red"
But I say: No! No!
Whatever I do
I barrel on through
And I don't complain
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead
I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just "half-assed"
But with the stakes getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast

I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me
Things might get bumpy but

Some people an*lyze every detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on

Some people can't get success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on

Oh, oh - maybe I can't follow through
But oh, oh - what else am I supposed to do?

I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war
I met my personal Aphrodite
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before

We start to take the next step together
Found an apartment on Seventy-Third
The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word

I left Columbia and I don'tregret it
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it
My heart's been stolen
My ego's swollen
I just keep rollin' along

And I think
Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more before twenty-four
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control

I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast
