Pulma Gary Payton, Live in your rotation
all your plexy clad I'm snapping back upon your station,
keep style elevating, you feelin' the sensation
you're higher zone, you're not alone
i know no perimeters, frequency, no limiters
we multiply integers, we back and forth so limitless

I'm positive, negative combined with infinity

you can grab a line on a line this is synergy
Love, love, love
Anything you feel
Love, love, love
I can feel too
Love, love, love
anything you feel
Love, love, love
I can feel too
You are higher zone (hands high) repeat
Hands high, hands high (love, love, love, love)
Anything you feel
Hands high, hands high, (love, love, love, love)
I can feel too
Hands high, hands, high, hands high(love, love, love, love)
Anything you feel
Hands high, hands high (love, love, love, love)
I can feel too
Hands high
