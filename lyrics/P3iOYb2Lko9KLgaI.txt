Do I make you feel obliged?
Afraid or justified?
I felt pain a thousand times
How do you sleep at night?
Provoking me to fall like trash
Defying every part I am
Abusing me is all you can I'll never be you

I'm complicated
I'm not like you
You can not force me into your shoes
You try to act so perfect
But I see the truth in your eyes
Why are you here to bleed me dry?

The image in the mirror cries
Imagining another life
Pretending that you all pulled back
You need to back of now
Live my life for just one day
Attend the mess you've made

I'm complicated
I'm not like you
You can not force me into your shoes
You try to act so perfect
But I see the truth in your eyes
Why are you here to bleed me dry?

Can you feel the rhythm?
Making you unconscious
So afraid of failure
Nothing ever makes you feel safe

I'm complicated
(I'm not like you)
You can not force me
Can not force me
I'm complicated
I'm not like you
You can not force me into your shoes
You try to act so perfect
But I see the truth in your eyes
Why are you here to bleed me dry?
Why are you here to bleed me dry?
