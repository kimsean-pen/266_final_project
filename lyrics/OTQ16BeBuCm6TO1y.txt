Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came and made my dreams this man's reality

Maybe you can't see
All the things you've meant to me
But my simple fate is at the gate and girl, you've got the key

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

And it seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love can grow with each and every day

As we lay at midnight's hour
And feel love's hidden power
So strong and bold as life unfolds its mystery to me

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

You and me for eternity
In love, we'll always be
So young and free and naturally,
The way love's got to be

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
