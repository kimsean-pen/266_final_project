Take an old
Take a young face
And see how they click
And see how they fit
And make pairs.
It's like a time warp
Like puzzle pieces of doppelgangers
That fit and make pairs.
We'll make pairs again.

Everyone is special like a silent pug
Waiting for the loudest bark
And I don't know how it sounds
And everyone has felt or will feel all your pain.

Take an old
Take a young face
And see how they click
And see how they fit
And make pairs.
It's like a time warp
Like puzzle pieces of doppelgangers
That fit and make pairs.
We'll make pairs again.

Everyone is special like a silent pug
Waiting for the loudest bark
Waiting for the loudest bark
Waiting for the loudest bark.
