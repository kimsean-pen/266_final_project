No more of your eyes
Sharing our fates
In which you find
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

Break in the night
Take them away
Remember why
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

No wonder why
You look away
I give you my
Fear and my pain

I stem the whispers
I kill my cure
You won't stop dead until this world is yours
I dim the speakers
I bang my drum
You won't stop here until the scare is gone

No more of your lies
Endless I wait
Don't close your eyes
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

No wonder why
You look away
I'll give you my
Fear and my pain

I stem the whispers
I killed my cure
You won't stop dead until this world is yours
I dimmed the speakers
I banged my drum
You won't stop here until the scare is gone

I lost my stake here
I left my crush
You won't find hell until the scare is gone

This feels like
This feels like a curse
This feels like
A dream that's not for love

This feels like
It feels like a curse
This feels like
A dream that's not for love

This feels like
A dream that's not for love
It's not for love
It's not for love
