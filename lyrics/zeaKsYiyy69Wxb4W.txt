Did you sweep us far from your feet
Reset in stone this stark belief
Salted eyes and a soiled dye
Too many years

But don't despair, this day will be their damnedest day
Ooh, if you take these things from me
Did you feed us tales of deceit
Conceal the tongues who need to speak
Subtle lies and a soiled queen
The truth is sold, the deal is done
But don't despair, this day will be their damnedest day
Ooh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come
So don't despair, this day will be their damnedest day
Ooh, if you take these things from me
Ooh, if you take these things from me
