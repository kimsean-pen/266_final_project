I'll be the grapes fermented
Bottled, served, with the table set
And my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
I'll be the fire escape that's
Bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit, and contemplate your day
I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning
In an open tab, when your judgement's on the brink
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite albums back
As you're lying there
Drifting off to sleep (drifting off to sleep)
I'll be the platform shoes
Undo what heredity's done to you
You won't have to strain, to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat
Buttoned, zipped, straight to the throat
With the collar up, so you won't catch cold
I want to take you far
From the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free
From the tethers of this scene
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change
We'll give ourselves new names
Identities erased
The sun will heat the grounds
Under our bare feet
In this brand new colony
(this brand new colony)
Everything will change
Everything will change
Everything will change
