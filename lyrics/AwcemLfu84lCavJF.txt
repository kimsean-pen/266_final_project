Cross my heart and I hope to die
I don't need another guy
To fight my battles
To overshadow me

Don't you know I'm dangerous?
Fire burning in my blood
I got this handled
I don't need rescuing

You can call me a princess all your life
'Cause you learned to keep me helpless by your side
But that ain't what I want, I'ma show you
I'ma show you

How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?

Eyes on me like I'm a prize
But you better recognize
I'm not your angel
'Cause I belong to me

How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?

You can call me a princess all your life
'Cause you learned to keep me helpless by your side
But that ain't what I want, I'ma show you
(You-you-you-you.)
How to treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
So treat me like a queen
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a yes, your majesty?
