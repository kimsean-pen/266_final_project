When all is said and done
Will we still feel pain inside?
Will the scars go away with night?
Try to smile for the morning light
It's like the best dream to have
Where everything is not so bad
Every tear is so alone
Like God himself is coming home to say

I, I can do anything
If you want me here
And I can fix anything
If you'll let me near
Where are those secrets now?
That you're too scared to tell
I whisper them all aloud
So you can hear yourself

Green trees were the first sign

The deepest blue, the clearest sky
The silence came with brightest eyes
Like turning water into wine
The children ran to see
Their parents stood in disbelief
And those who knew braced for the ride

The earth itself, it came alive to say
I, I can do anything

If you want me here
And I can fix anything
If you'll let me near
Where are those secrets now?
That your too scared to tell
I whisper them all aloud

So you can hear yourself
Sorry, I have to say it but you look like you're sad
Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad

The cure is if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough

I'm sorry, I have to say it but you look like you're sad
Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad

The cure is if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough

I'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad
Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad

The cure is if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough

I'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad
Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad

The cure is if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough

I'm sorry, I have to say it but you look like you're sad
(Just a little)
Your smile is gone, I've noticed it bad
(Just a little)
The cure is if you let in just a little more love
(Just a little)
And I promise you this, a little's enough
I'm sorry, I have to say it but you look like you're sad
(Just a little)
Your smile is gone, I've noticed it bad
(Just a little)
The cure is if you let in just a little more love
(Just a little)
And I promise you this, a little's enough
