It's been sometime since I first met you
Noone thinks about you more than I do
If you won't let me find you
How am I gonna get through

I was straight and acted like a fool
You were drunk and unbelievably cool
You won't find a friend who
Knows you like I do

It's been sometime since I first met you
Noone thinks about you more than I do
If you won't let me find you
How am I gonna get through

I was straight and acted like a fool
You were drunk and unbelievably cool
You won't find a friend who
Knows you like I do

It's time you should be going
But there's noone home
I guess I'm alone
There's things you should be knowing
But noone ever asked me before
And you can know the rest if you want to

And everytime they are together
They all crowed around to take a picture
Don't you feel you have to
In fact I feel obliged to
If you wont let me find you
How am I gonna get through
