You see me howling at the Moon
It's what you taught me to do (Hmm)
I'm chasing stars just to get back closer to you
You see the ashes by the fire (Fire)
The only life that I knew (Hmm)
I touched the flame just to get back closer to you

Show me the way
I've done travel too far with the cross on my bag
And a hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that'll make me closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you

You hear me beatin' at the door
What else you want me to do, oh
You got me crawling out the walls to get closer to you, yes you do
Show me the way
I've done travel too far with the cross on my bag
And a hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that'll make me closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you

Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Closer to you
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Show me the way
I've done travel too far with the cross on my bag
And a hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that'll make me closer to you

Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh (Closer)
Closer to you
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh (Lay me down)
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh (Closer to you)

Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you
