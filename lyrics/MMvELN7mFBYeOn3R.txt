His hands hide inside a sleeve
And little feet play with the ground beneath him
While up in the sky is where he wants to be
Time will fly
And the wind plays with him
The night will give him its charm
While he walks home
His head's up in a cloud
He feels his pores fill up with fresh air
And there is no doubt
That one day he will be
Where the eye of his telescope has already been
And the wind plays with him
Night will give him its charm

Night will pass
But he's a lot faster
No one can do him any harm
