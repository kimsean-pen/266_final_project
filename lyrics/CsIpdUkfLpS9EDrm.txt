Well I ain't got no money. No fancy car
Ain't got no excuses baby. Hanging at the bar

I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing

Oh we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you a diamond ring
That's alright!

Ain't got no credit. No fancy clothes
Ain't got no excuses baby, But good man knows...

This all you get now baby, this all you get
This all you get now baby, this all you get

This all you get now mama, this all you get
Just name this guitar baby, that's all you get

Well ain't got no apology, don't be no fairy tail
Ain't got no excuses baby. I'm doing my deal

I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing baby

I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing

Oh we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you a diamond ring
That's alright!

Ain't got no money
Ain't got no money car
Ain't got no excuses baby
I'm drinking at the bar

I don't owe you a thing mama
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing

Well we ain't getting married.
Ain't buying you no diamond ring
Ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright, That's alright!

Well we ain't getting married
Ain't buying you a diamond ring...
