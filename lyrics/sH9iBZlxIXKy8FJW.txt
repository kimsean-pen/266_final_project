Before the start
Time at separate tables
Time in common
And with your friends
Sitting in the wings
Time in common
Smiling politely
I was standing in the backyard
I didn't have another place to go
Time in a vacuum
Two-hundred waking hours

Oh yeah, do you ever think about it?
Do you feel it all that much?
Do you really think it matters?

Beside the water
Your legs were next to mine
Time in common, time in common, time in common
On the couches
At other people's houses
Time in common (Time in common, time in common)
Outside the hall
Words in the right order
I said it back, you said it back
Brand new union
A mutual life assured
Time in common

Oh yeah, do you ever think about it?
Do you feel it all that much?
Do you really think it matters?
I tell you, I do

Pale blue dots suspended in the sky
Elastic time inside a flying can
By the columns at sunset
The birds were rising and falling and rising
Then on the platform
Through the window of the train
Time in common
