Smoke will let you fly away
Keep running from me
I know I'm not the only fool waiting
To lean and fall behind
Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feelin bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
He knows I can take you away
And we don't wanna scare the lights oh baby
On everything we're only stars fading
We're fighting for our life
Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feelin bad, I'm afraid you'll go away
Smoke will let you fly away baby
Keep running from me
I know I'm not the only fool waiting
To lean and fall behind
He knows I can take you away
And we don't wanna scare the lights oh baby
On everything we're only stars fading
We're fighting for our life
Lay down these bread crumbs your way
Saw what it's all about, what can we say?
I'm feelin bad so I'm afraid you'll go away

I'm feelin bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
I'm feelin bad so I'm afraid you'll go away
