I've been loving you
Too long
To stop now

You are tired
And you want to be free
My love is growing stronger
As you become a habit to me
Oehw, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now
Ohoo

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger
As our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you
Oh, too long
I don't want to stop now, ohh, ohh, ohh

I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, ohh, ohh, ohh
And don't make me stop now
Oh, baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now

I love you
I love you
I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please
Please
Please don't make me stop now
Talkin' 'bout heart and soul
That I love you
I love you
