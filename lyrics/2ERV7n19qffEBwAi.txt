Making a faltering correction for you
Lights out walking through the meadow
I could never think another time
Could mean so much to me
Faking a deeper wrought connection for me
Faded out, making on with life
I never thought this would be the last time

I would let you in to find a real love
What could I decide in the end?
We're all just motion in the dust
We could find a way to find a real love
How could I believe it again?
But I could never listen
And you could never know

I can hear a distant life
Making its way through the thicket
Such a harsher time for a harsher lesson
I could wait and let it run its own course
Asking just to have more
Taking time that we never had

Pacing out the last collection for you
Lights out walking through the meadow
I could never think another life
Could mean so much to me
Learning a finer taught connection for me
Faded out making on with life
I never thought this would be the last time

I will let you in to find a real love
What could I decide in the end?
We're all just motion in the dust
We could find a way to find a real love
How could I believe it again?
But I could never listen
And you could never know

I would let you in to find a real love
What could I decide in the end?
We're all just motion in the dust
We could find a way to find a real love
How could I believe it again?
But I could never listen
And you could never know
