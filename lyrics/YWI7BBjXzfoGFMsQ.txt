Well, I saw you in a bar
I was not on your radar
Well, I tried to catch your eyes
But I was just some random guy

Well, I asked you for a dance
You said, "No, there is not a chance"
I didn't know if my heart would mend
I saw you leaving with a friend

All I want is to reach you
And show what I'm about
You're not someone to preach to
You got most things figured out
All I want is to reach you
But still I'm left in doubt
If you will accept me reaching out

I almost lost my head
Was the second time we met
Do you remember me from that bar?
What do you think the chances are?

You said, "I don't mean to be cruel
Or to make you look like a fool
But if it's me you want to stalk
Just give it up and take a walk"

Come on

All I want is to reach you
And show what I'm about
You're not someone to preach to
You got most things figured out
All I want is to reach you
But still I'm left in doubt
If you will accept me reaching out

I've been turned down and left upon
The darkest moment for any cloud
I try to make it day-by-day again
As soon as I get back up, I'm gonna call
I'll be reaching out

'Cause all I want is to reach you
And show what I'm about
You're not someone to preach to
You got most things figured out
All I want is to reach you
But still I'm left in doubt
If you will accept me reaching out
Or if you will leave me here in doubt
If you will accept me reaching out
