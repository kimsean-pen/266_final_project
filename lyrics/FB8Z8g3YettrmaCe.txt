YOUR LOVE
swells and pounds me.

I know nothing (now that I know you).
My face goes blank.
My eyes go open gates
and the world can go (in them),
and it can stay and make us wealthy
and take away
so
I hold nothing
Now that I hold nothing (now that I hold you)
There's no place to use our money where we live.
The generous world suggests generously
So we lay
under low wide branches
of the oldest tree on the dune,
or in the hay,
where we will stay for so long
that the careful birds will relax
and make black nests in your black hair
and walk around beneath my still feet
and we will only notice the play of the world for a moment
and let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
we will only notice the world for a moment
and let it roll on, the way the world rolls on
the world, for a moment, and let it roll on
the way the world rolls on
through open gates.
and we will only notice the play of the world
(that long moss is growing on us)
(that the wind has rewritten us)
(the give and take not stopping ever)
for only a moment

In a generous way:
I give long walks to the dogs.
I put commas and periods in songs.
I give closed eyes to the day.
I give peace to the long decay.
(we do not need to fear dying).
