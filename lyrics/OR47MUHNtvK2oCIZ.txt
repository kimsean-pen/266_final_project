Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Honey when you knock on my door
Ooh I gave you my key

Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
(nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh... oh I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
Now it's up to us babe
Whoa I think we can make it

So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh you put the sparks to the flame
I got your heart in my sights

Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
(nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh... oh I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

(...)

Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
(woo hoo) When I was down
(woo hoo) I was your clown
(woo hoo) Right from the start
(woo hoo) I gave you my heart
Oh... oh I gave you my heart
