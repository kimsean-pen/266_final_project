He says to her why do you do it
She says to him why do you stay
Then they say unspoken words to explain it
He says, baby, I hate to see you this way
I hate to see you
I hate to see you cry

Well, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
She will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial

She sits across the table the same glass table
Cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo baby, baby, baby, baby
This is the path you have chosen
She probably goes under another name
Well, that's a good idea

So, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
Well, she will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial Hotel

Who's there
Where has she gone
But, I think she just went home

Sits across the table same glass table
And she cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo, wo, baby oh, my baby
You have to know you have to know

She knows in her heart
That he will stand by her
Anywhere don't cry, baby
I can save you
Don't cry baby, I can save you
She's at the Imperial Hotel
Don't cry baby, I can save you
