Smile an ever lasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cos that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

Talk in ever lasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm hear if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away
