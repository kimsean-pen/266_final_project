(Verse One)
I can't get your attention
And I'm so sick of it
I've got something to say to you
So shut up and listen

I don't want you to look past me
I want you to know who I am
I hate it when you ignore me
You just don't understand

(Bridge)
See, the funny thing is
You're just as useless as me
I could make you better
If you would just let me in

(Chorus)
I'm outside of you
And I can't get through
No more looking for beauty
That's dying inside me

Can you see?
I'm outside of you
And I'm so confused
You keep missing the small things
The safety that love brings

Can you see?
I'm outside of you

(Verse Two)
Your only plan to survive
It needs love and light to grow
I could be something beautiful
I guess you'll never know

(Bridge)
See, the funny thing is
You're just as useless as me
I could make you better
If you would just let me in

(Chorus)
I'm outside of you
And I can't get through
No more looking for beauty
That's dying inside me

Can you see?
I'm outside of you
And I'm so confused
You keep missing the small things
The safety that love brings

Can you see?

(Middle-8)
And as you walk by me
I'm screaming silently to set me free
I look in the mirror
And I see the future
You were good with me

And as you walk by me
I'm silently screaming to set me free
I look in the mirror
And I see your future
You look good with me
Oh!

(Chorus)
I'm outside of you
And I can't get through
No more looking for beauty
That's dying inside me

Can you see?
I'm outside of you
And I'm so confused
You keep missing the small things
The safety that love brings

Can you see?
I'm outside of you
I'm outside of you
I'm outside of you
