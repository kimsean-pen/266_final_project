Next time I'll be kinder with you
There's just this habit that I have
I throw my words around like fire
They catch on your good heart and your peace of mind
Next time I'll be kinder

If I learn to take it lighter when you
Tell me there's something that I lack
Would that make you change your mind?
Would that make it better and buy me some time?

'Cause I'm damned if I do
And I'm damned if I don't
Every time I swear I will
You say that I won't
But there's a better version of me
Stay for the person I'll be

If there's a next time I'll fight harder for you
Won't take for granted what we had
I wake with you in mind but I'm tired
Of all these different phases
Are all these faults of mine?

'Cause I'm damned if I'm true
And I'm damned if I'm right
Every time you say I'll lose
I swear that I'm trying
If there's a better version of me
Would you stay for the person I'll be?

Stay for the person I'll be
Stay for the person I'll be
Stay for the person I'll be
Stay for the person I'll be
Stay for the person I'll be
Stay for the person I'll be
