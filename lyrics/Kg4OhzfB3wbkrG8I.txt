You always needed people like me
Directions for your fingers to point
A crooked dealer's blaming spree
I'm guaranteed to disappoint
You're weak and scared and cutting raw deals
But fortune always favors the bold
I'll bet it all and crush your bluff
I'll never yield nor ever fold
And I won't shoulder the blame

I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow

You always needed a distraction
A target for the stones that you thrown
To draw attention to your actions
I'm tailor made so lock and load
Oh, you're telling tales
You spineless coward
Your word's not worth its weight in shit
Back against the wall, belligerent
I won't shoulder the blame

So high and mighty
But when the bottom drops out
You're gonna find me standing where you left me

I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow
I fight the constant undertow
I fight the constant undertow

Deal the last hand, let the cards fall where they may
From your castle made of sand you're looking down at me

So high and mighty
But when the bottom drops out
You'll have to face me waiting where you left me

I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow
The undertow
The undertow
