Lead me around
And nurse my broken wing
With all the promises
You can never honor
I just don't care enough
To react to vain attempts
Sent only to perpetuate
One's selfish little world

You won't see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still you're only let down
You won't see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still you're only let down
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive

Now here I stand
For nothing no one at all
I lead you down
Begging to touch you in the cold
You give me a reason
I will not be the one
Through all the nonsense
There is a constant

You won't see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still you're only let down
You won't see what I've become
You'll wait and watch and still you're only let down

'Cause this feeling
Has dawned the face of you
'Cause this feeling
Has dawned the face of you
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive

You won't see what I've become
You won't see what I've become
You won't see what I've become
You won't see what I've become

'Cause this feeling
Has dawned the face of you
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
A violent reaction struggling only to keep myself alive
