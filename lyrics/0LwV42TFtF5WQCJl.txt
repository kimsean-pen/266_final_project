split his ribs open using my bare hands but i could not repair all of the damage
built of milk and flesh so meek and mild but i know
if he'd lived he'd have grown to be wild

they broke him and they beat him
and break he did
they took him from me, my baby
and break he did

his skin went white as chalk, his limbs turned soft and limp
i cradled him through those moments of weakness
and watched him drift between the worlds of living and dead
until he sunk down into the pavement

they broke him and they beat him
and break he did
they took him from me, my baby
and break he did
and he laid there for days
in the cold and the wind
but i could not breathe life back in
i tried to fill up his lungs with the air from my own
but he did not wake up again
no he didn't
