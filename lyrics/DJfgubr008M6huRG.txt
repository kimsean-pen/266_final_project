We are the melanin felons
We are the product of
Providing a policy that you've gotta love
Casinos, amigos on forty acres, uh
They built this shit on my patch
Made an America

Living in terror of what they terrorise
Cover your eyes 'cause people terrified
Fuck all the promises you were promised 'cause
They cutting your eyes until you paralysed

Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)
All for one and none for all (Made an America)
No stored dead bodies on the boulevard
Cop cars, true killers and they still at large
Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)

Home of the big bodies and wide blocks
The government giving candles to crack rock
Making corners of baking soda and mass shock
This ain't a theory, I saw it happen on my block
The homie had to sell him heroin from nine to five
My brother's burning down the block, alright, he almost died
We keeping face for measles, blankets, and genocide
They call it "cleaning up the streets", we call it "homocide"

Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)
All for one and none for all (Made an America)
No stored dead bodies on the boulevard
Cop cars, true killers and they still at large
Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)

Made an America, we made an America
Made an America, we made an America
Made an America, we made an America
Made an America, we made an America

Ahhhhh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Alright
You built this on my patch
Okay
Show 'em who we is

Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)
All for one and none for all (Made an America)
No stored dead bodies on the boulevard
Cop cars, true killers and they still at large
Where we land is where we fall (Made an America)

Made an America, we made an America
Made an America, we made an America
