How does it feel
When you're alone behind the wall inside?
And, how does it feel when your cwn skin
Begins to crawl, inside
The pain just cannot be real
The lies we told you to feel
How would it look if we can find nc one to
blame, this time?
And how would it look if the mistakes were
again, this time?
Am I evil? You know I am
Will I deceive you? You know I can

Can you feel it? Its cold. inside
Can you see it? Our faces lie
You'll be here for years
Inside
