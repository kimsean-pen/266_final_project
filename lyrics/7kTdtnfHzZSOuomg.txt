Tavern in hole outside of Ventura
When low and behold, found a beauty
Said i never seen a redhead crumble just like that
She sat outside, got something to see
We walked a quiet road for miles at first
Couldn't see a thing
The rattle from the dark chills up my spine
coming from the trees
Oh, thats Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton, marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies up ahead
Thats Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies in a fog internally
Must've passed out when i came to Montana
To my surprise about a young lady
As her face grew sick, her nails tore round my heart
Blood trickled down, economically
The laughter from the dark was low at first

But the king could cover me
I recognize the stench of burning flesh
as they began to feed.
Oh, on Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton, marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies up ahead
Thats Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies in a fog internally
Oh the horror, running's not the way to fall in love
Oh the horror, running's not the way to fall in love
That's Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton, marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies up ahead
Thats Reagan's skeleton in the moonlight
Don't fear the red eyes, fear the satelites overhead
That's Reagan's skeleton marching our way
Sentimental violence, leading their zombies in a fog internally
