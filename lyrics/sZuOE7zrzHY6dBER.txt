I bind myself today, rebellion and vengeance
Tears of the patriarchs and the blindness of prophets
Silence of impostors the atheism of confessors
The filth of holy virgins and blasphemy of the righteous man

I bind myself today to the powers of Hell
The darkness of the sun, and the darkness of the moon
The teariness of fire
The blackness of lightning
The slowness of wind
The shallowness of sea
The ability of earth
The looseness of rocks

Satan delivered me today
Unto poison
Unto burning
Unto drowning
Unto this world

The army issue abundant punishment

I bind myself today
Slayer of the universe!
