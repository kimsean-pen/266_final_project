Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you foolin'? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinkin' for the pain? Is you drinkin' for fun?
There's a party outside, till the morning gon' come
Is you dancin' all alone? Is you dancin' for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you havin' fun?

Say it with your chest
Say it with your chest
Pray and work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back
Puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah
Say it with your chest
Say it with your chest
Pray and work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back
Puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah

But you know if I waste my time
Talkin' 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

I said, I said, "Who that? Who that? Who that? Who that?"
Lurkin' in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberatin' spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feedin' you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

But you know if I waste my time
Talkin' 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But somethin's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clingin' on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changin', I know that I'm changin'

I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
