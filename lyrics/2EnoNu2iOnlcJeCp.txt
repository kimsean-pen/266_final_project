Tearing me apart with
Words you would't say
Suddenly tomorrow's
Moment washed away

'Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Scars begin to fade

You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
The final masquerade

All I've ever wanted
The secrets that you keep
All you've ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak

'Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
If we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Scars begin to fade

You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Scars begin to fade

You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

Standing at the end of
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
