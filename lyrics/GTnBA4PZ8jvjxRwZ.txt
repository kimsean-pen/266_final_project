Are you listening very carefully
Close your eyes and come with me
To go where the evening comes undone
Late at night in the city streets
I feel the need to see the streets
I go where you'll always find someone yeah

Is it good night, is it good morning
Is this real life, are you performing
You're like a vision I can't control
We're in a movie I'm playing a role

I can be by myself sometimes
But I won't be by myself tonight

The sun comes out and suddenly
Something's happening inside of me
I wanna now where the silence has come from

Is it good night, is it good morning
Is this real life, are you performing
You're like a vision I can't control
We're in a movie I'm playing a role

I can be by myself sometimes
But I won't be by myself tonight

I can be by myself sometimes
But I won't be by myself tonight

Oh no [x8]

Good night, good morning
Good night, good morning
Good night, good morning
