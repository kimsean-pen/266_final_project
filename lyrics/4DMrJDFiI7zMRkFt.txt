I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I have plan
Baby, dream a while, skim a while you're sure the fine
Happiness a I guess all those things you've always pined for
I'll like to see you looking swell for me
With diamonds watches, Tiffany's just won't sell baby
'Til that lucky day you know that well
Ooh I can't give you anything but love
I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I have plan
Lady, dream a while, skim a while you're sure the fine
Happiness a I guess all those things you've always pined for
You'll like to see me looking swell
With diamonds watches, Tiffany's just won't sell baby
'Til that lucky day you know that well
Ooh I can't give you anything but love
