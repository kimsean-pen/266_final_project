I don't mind you telling me what's been on your mind lately
I don't mind you speaking up (speaking up)
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush (such a rush)

Just slow me down (down)
Slow me down (down)
Tell me tomorrow everything will be around
Just slow me down (down)

Slow me down (down)
You're the one who keeps me on the ground
Baby can you be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do it with love love love love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm comin' on way too strong
Don't think I'd be crushed
Just do it with love love love love

Just do it with love love love love, just do it with love
I can take your honesty all your words weigh heavily
I'm listening to you all the time (all the time)
Wanna be there for you the way you've been there for me

Always help me walk the line (walk the line)
And slow me down, down

Slow me down, down
I know you will always be around
Baby can you be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do it with love love love love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm comin' on way too strong

Don't think I'd be crushed
Just do it with love love love love
All this time we finally know each other
Now that I've been leaning on your shoulder
I can tell you baby
That your right when your right and your wrong when your wrong

And I can be weak cause I know you'll be strong strong strong...
Baby can you be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do it with love love love love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm comin' on way too strong
Don't think I'd be crushed

Just do it with love love love love
Baby can you be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do it with love love love love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm comin' on way too strong
Don't think I'd be crushed
Just do it with love love love love
Just do it with love love love love
Just do it with love.
Just do it with love love love love
Just do with love, love love love...
