Death wants to make you a part of it
Not coming with me
Saints, criminals, all just killing time
Death waits to make your peace with it
You'll be fine

Youth, innocence
Everyone runs out
Death is the message
Without meaning
Death is the message
Not the beginning
And when we're young
We can't wait to grow up
We get old, we give up
And we pray to grow young

Doesn't matter if you're ready
You're coming with me
The rich, the beautiful
Everyone's in line

See through the velvet
Death is the message
Where I'll never be
The taste, the bitterness
Always been too loud
Death is the message
Without meaning
Death is the message
Not the beginning
When we're young
We can't wait to grow up
We get old, we give up
And we pray to grow young
