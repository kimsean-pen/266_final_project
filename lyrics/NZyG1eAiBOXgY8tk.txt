I have taken to the market,
found out what you wanted,
came in through the back door,
tell them that you like it,
Kept it in your pocket,

I thought we were lucky.
I thought that we meant it.
at least enough to keep it,
keep it through the night time,
push it through the morning.

Oh, oh, could you keep from calling,
my house through december
returning from the winter.
cold in frozen water.

Listen to them singing.
songs about the weather,
tell them when they're older,
how you miss the neighbors
standing in the front yard,

Telling all your secrets,
like they were theirs to tell.
