Not sure if anyone has the time for me
I'm sitting on my two hands, wondering
Now you, come around here and I'm mistreated
Ah, why I would?

I don't know, who's at fault?
What's the point now?
I heard when you don't sugarcoat

Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)

Can't keep myself from hittin the ceiling baby
Too soon to do anything about it maybe (something's got you)
You gave me the reason I'll conceal it
Ah, who cares?

I don't know, who's at fault?
What's the point now?
I heard when you don't sugarcoat

(Something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)

All of the these thoughts you can bend
Waking up with no regrets
And I know that's it hard to explain
Honest to god now I'm fine

Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Oh something (something's got ya)
Something's got you (something's got ya)
Something's got you on my mind (something's got you)

Oh no
(Something's got ya)
(Something's got ya) on my mind
(Something's got ya) on my mind
(Something's got ya) on my mind
(Something's got ya)
(Something's got ya)
(Something's got ya)
(Something's got you)
