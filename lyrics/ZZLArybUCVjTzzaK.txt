You always said that I'd come back to you again
'Cause everybody needs a friend
It's true
Someone to quiet the voices in my head
Make 'em sing to me instead
It's you

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needing you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
I don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

You make me feel like I'm floating off the ground
Above this little town
You do
Look at me smile with tears in my eyes
I love the way you lie
I do

Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true

Ohh, bad habit, I know
But I'm needing you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
I don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Can I lean on you?

Ohhhhh, ohh woah
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needing you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Ohhhhh, ohh woah
Can I lean on you?
You, oooh oooh oooh
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do
