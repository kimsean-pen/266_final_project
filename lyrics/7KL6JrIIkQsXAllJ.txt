You've come so far, well done darling
We knew that you had it in you
You can do anything that you want, world is an oyster, dont dissapoint us
You can stand on your own two feet, you can lead me through the streets
Pave the way, so we can dream dreams, noone else can see what you made me see
Still climbing trees, tripping up over fallen leaves, but holding hands
No one else could ever understand what it's like between us
and thats betweens us, but I know

You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me

I dont know everything about you, would you like to spend time with me

Said you'd lend me anything, I think I'll have your company
Said you'd lend me anything, I think I'll have your company
You said you'd lend me anything, I think I'll have your company

You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
