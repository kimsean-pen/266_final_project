What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What if

If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate
Future with a dog named Red
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name

But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if (Yeah)

Picture me on one knee
With the perfect diamond ring (perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, "Yes"
We'd have our wedding on the beach (oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this may sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name

But we can't (we can't), we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if

Don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm still hoping that you are the one for me
Oh and what if I had you and what if you had me
And, baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if, oh, woah

But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
But we can't (we can't), we can't tell (ooh) the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
So I'ma say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
We all can say du, du, du-du, du-du, du-du
Baby, what if
