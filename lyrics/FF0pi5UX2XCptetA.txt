I don't mind
Letting you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do, when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do, when the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Ain't it good
Being all alone

Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well, you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble

When you're living in a bubble

So what are you gonna do, when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do, when nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Ain't it good
Being all alone

Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun
Living in the real world

Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun
Ain't it fun

Ain't it fun
Living in the real world

Ain't it good? (Ain't it good?)
Being all alone

Ain't it fun living in the real world
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good? (Ain't it good?)
Being all alone

Don't go crying to your mama (run to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (don't go crying)
Don't go crying to your mama (to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own (this is the real world) in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (this is the real world)

Don't go crying (this is the real world) to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Don't go crying (don't you go, don't you go crying)
Don't go crying (you're on your own)
Don't go crying (don't go crying to your mama)
Don't go crying
