Sorry I'm not love
I'm lost in a blurr
I'm dealing with a lot
I'm feenin' for your heart
why?

Why don't I just stop?
hope for way to much
I'm leaving in my thoughts
I'm trying, but Im not-not

I-I-I

I never mind
I never not what to do but
to float in your river
It hurts inside me
Its all a fever
in the midst of time
I float in your river
Now I'm missing in mine

Sorry, I'm not her
and now that I've learned
that my best is not enough
I'm close to giving up

I-I, I
I sure did not plan
to feel a love so grand
this weight is heavy on my head
not leaving of your left hand
why?

I never mind
I never not what to do but
to float in your river
It hurts inside me
Its all a fever
in the midst of time
I float in your river
Now I'm missing in mine
