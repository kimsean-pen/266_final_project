I woke up in a pool of sweat
First I thought that I pissed the bed
Haunted stories in the midnight hour
The Kiss of Death from the Eiffel Tower

Then I went down, like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips, and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck, and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes, just for a while

I'll crash into you, crash into you
'Cause you crashed in my imagination too

Break a leg and you crush my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
I steal a kiss then I took a dive

Then I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips, and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck, and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes, just for a while

I'll crash into you, crash into you
But you crashed in my imagination

I had a dream that I kissed your lips, and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck, and I fell for you
And I fell for you, and I fell for you
