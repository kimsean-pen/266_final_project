I've feeling like a ghost in your house and in mine
Condensation, fogging vision, just to melt away
It makes me wonder if I've passed
away or been invisible this whole time
I've feeling like a ghost in your house and in mine
It makes me wonder if I've passed
away or been invisible this whole time
If you can't see now,
then you never did, and you'll never see me again
