You're taking a chance, risking it all
For the thrill of the moment
Taking a stand, you ain't gonna fall
You've always known it

They're dying to shake you,
Trying their best to break you
And though the going is rough, you're going home as a hero

'Cause there's thunder in your heart
Every move is like a lightning
It's the power you feel when you get your taste of the glory
There's a fire gonna start
And you know they're going under
You can light the dark when they hear your heart of thunder.

Cry of the wind, spirit of fire
The heart of a lion
Taking control, burning desire
Your flame never dying

Don't lose that feeling
Don't ever stop believing
There's one more moment of truth and you're gonna face it

'Cause there's thunder in your heart
Every move is like a lightning
It's the power you feel when you get your taste of the glory
There's a fire gonna start
and you know they're going under
you can light the dark when they hear your heart of thunder.

When they hear your heart of thunder.

'Cause there's thunder in your heart
And you know they're going under
You can light the dark when they hear your heart of thunder.

There is thunder in your heart
And you know they're going under
You can light the dark when they hear your heart of thunder.
