When you woke up, I guess you didn't know I would steal you from your girlfriend.
But filter to the secret side, fill and raised by the forth sky.
Lone as we fly, somewhere close, keep that in my mind.

For the sake of simplicity lets keep this between you and me.

Obnoxiously sexual, who do we think we are.
Come and sit with the right outlet and don't get my left with my spirit distorted.
Obnoxiously sexual, who do we think we are.
Come and behold it's the fight with limits of consummates with my spirit distorted.

Feeling me in the car, the pressure points of paramount importance.
Going way too far, testing our limit, the endless minute.
Delightfully sensual, shockingly despicably beautiful.
I figure its clear by now, that love is a muscle of evil suggestion.

And for the sake of simplicity lets keep this between you and me.

Obnoxiously sexual, who do we think we are.
Come and sit with the right outlet and don't get my left with my spirit distorted.
Obnoxiously sexual, who do we think we are.
Come and behold it's the fight with limits of consummates with my spirit distorted.
