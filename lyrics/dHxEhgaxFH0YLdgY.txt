No one can be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man
No one can be my woman
Be my woman, be my woman

One ear to the ground
One dog at my neck
One tongue to my tongue
Wanting to protect me from
From

No one can be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman
Be my woman, be my woman

One ear to the floor
My dog barking loud
I couldn't tell for sure
Where the screaming sound
Was coming from
From

One ear to your womb
Puppy on the floor
Baby's coming soon
I wonder if she'll know
Where she's come from
From

From
From
From
