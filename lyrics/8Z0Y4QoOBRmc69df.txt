to see the actor without tears
Dark rivers carve the years between the lies of self control

In my psychotic karmic fear, I own your tears anyway & I am you & we are not afraid & we won't be here for long
The heart collector sings his song thats slowly boiling over

Nevermore to feel the pain
The heart collector sang

And I won't be feeling hollow for so long
Nevermore to feel the pain
The words fall out like fire
just believe when you can't believe anymore
The stage is empty now
We hope we hold and cannot allow the corrupt ecletic

Takes his fatal bow
And we won't be here for long
The heart collector sings his song Again

Nevermore to feel the pain
The heart collector sang
And I won't be feeling hollow for so long
Nevermore to feel the pain
The words fall out like fire
just believe when you can't believe anymore
