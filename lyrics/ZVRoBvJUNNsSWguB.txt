Hand me downs and photographs,
Spread across the floor.
A broken record spins in circles,
She can't listen anymore.
She's turned around a thousand times,
She set that bridge afire!

But did you wanna listen?
You took the world with you!
So what is left,
So what is left for me?

I called you on the phone again,
Just the other day.
It sounds to me you found your place
And everything is great.

But did you wanna listen?
You took the world with you!
So what is left,
So what is left for me?

But did you wanna listen?
You took the world with you!
So what is left,
So what is left for me?

I TRY so hard to figure out WHY.
No explanation keeps me waiting.
Let's try! (LET'S TRY!)
Because I know you won't forget, I know. (I KNOW...)
Even if the story is over...

I KNOW...
It's over...
I KNOW...
It's over...
I KNOW...

But did you wanna listen?
You took the world with you.
So what is left,
So what is left for me?

WHAT'S LEFT FOR ME?

But did you wanna listen?
You took the world with you!
So what is left,
So what is left for me?

WHAT'S LEFT FOR ME?

But did you wanna listen? (FOR ME?)
You took the world with you! (WHAT'S LEFT FOR ME?)
So what is left,
So what is left for me? (FOR ME?)

I tried! (I TRIED!)
