Take the trouble to decide the things you do
Will not be the things that don't apeal to you
See the mess you're makin'
Can't you see your fakin',
Gonna make it hard for you,
You're gonna -
Into the fire

Turn on the mandrake that was given to you
See if you can make it like the others do
Feel the blood a knockin'
When your finger poppin'

Gonna make it hard for you,
You're gonna -
Into the fire

Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done
Listen very closely to the message I've sung
Feel the blood a knockin'
When your finger poppin'

Gonna get the message through,
You're gonna -
Into the fire
