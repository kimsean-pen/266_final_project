I hide, you seek
Whatever you find you keep
I can stay here in the dark
I can keep on my mask
But you're so near, so near
The sky's so clear, so clear

I was half hoping, hoping
You'd be joking, joking
Thought maybe this time you had
Gone mad, gone mad
You seem let down, let down
By me somehow, somehow
Am I moving too slow?
You lead, I'll follow

And I've never been here before
But I recognise the front sliding doors

I hide, you seek
Whatever you find you keep
You can stay here in the dark
You can keep on your mask
But you're so near, so near
The sky's so clear, so clear

I was half hoping, hoping
You'd be joking, joking
Thought maybe this time you had
Gone mad, gone mad
You seem let down, let down
By me somehow, somehow
Am I moving too slow?
You lead, I'll follow

And I've never been here before
But I recognise the front sliding doors

I get you high
You got me stoned
Your lovers do this
I'll never leave this one alone
In case I lose this
