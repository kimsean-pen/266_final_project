All the gold
And the guns
In the world
Couldn't get you off
All the gold
And the guns
And the girls
Couldn't get you off
All the boys, all the choices in the world

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend, is it ever gonna be enough?

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

All the lace and the skin in the shop couldn't get you off
All the toys and the tools in the box couldn't get you off
All the noise, all the voices never stop

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend while you're giving me a hard time

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

Ooh, ooh
More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
And more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more

More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
And more and more, more and more
More and more and more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)

More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
And more and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
More and more and more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)

More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
And more and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
More and more and more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)

More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
And more and more, more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)
More and more and more and more
(Is it ever gonna be enough?)

More and more, more and more
More and more, more and more
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
