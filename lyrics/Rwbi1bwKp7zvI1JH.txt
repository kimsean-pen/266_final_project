You're trying to pull me down
Can't get my feet off the ground
Keep begging for more
But I won't feed you
You came to me in a dream
Not as sweet as you seem
Please wake me up so I won't see you

They say you're reckless at heart
You're tearing good girls apart
Cut me open, but I won't feel you
Ow! Ow!

Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah
Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah

I think I'm gonna break out
Pulling my hair out
Keep on knockin', I can't hear you

Uh! Ow! Oh!

Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah
Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah
(Ow! Ow!)

Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah
Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah

Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
Yeah yeah yeah
Hands on my face
I can't escape
She gets around
