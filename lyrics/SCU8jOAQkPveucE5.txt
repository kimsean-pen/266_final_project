I don't like it when you stress
But I like it when you take your stress out on me
And you know that I like those tiger stripes
Come put them stretch marks on me, on me, yeah
On me like you're my protection
I wish that we can get reckless
Like my imagination is

This is just the tip of it
Yeah, this is just the tip of it
Tell me if you're feelin' it

I wanna change your life
I just wanna change your mood
Make you need to change your clothes
Still I never changed on you
You know I'm there when it's somethin' new
Little bit of me on you
And I just wanna change your point of view

That means that I gotta turn you around, so be it
All in your hair for you while you get down, so be it
Things that I do for you, hopin' you'll do to me
The same things that I do to you
That's equality, oh
Change positions like you change your mind
At first we had to rush, now you keep sayin': Take your time

This is just the tip of it
Can't wait to get into it
Tell me if you're feelin' it

I wanna change your life
I just wanna change your mood
Make you need to change your clothes
Still I never changed on you
You know I'm there when it's somethin' new
Little bit of me on you
And I just wanna change your point of view

Like what I see
When you're right in front of me
And I like what you do
When I'm ridin' for you
Like what I see
(Don't forget how it feels when you get me)
When you're ridin' for me
(I'm so into you, let me know where you're ready)
And I like what you do
(Nothin' turns me on, like a woman's perspective)
When I'm ridin' for you
(Always come for you, just the way you expect it)
Like what I see
(Don't forget how it feels when you get me)
When you're ridin' for me
(I'm so into you, let me know where you're ready)
And I like what you do
(Nothin' turns me on, like a woman's perspective)
When I'm ridin' for you
(Always come for you, just the way you expect it)

Don't forget how it feels when you get me
I'm so into you, let me know when you're ready
Nothin' turns me on, like I want some perspective
Always come for you, just the way you expect it
