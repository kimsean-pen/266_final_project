Patience out the window and feed it to the birds
Saying nothing to much while they find it first
Pissin' on the moments and missing the chance
Under your face and it slipped through your hands
Waiting for approval and nobody cares
Guessing the mood is behind every stare

Think back about the things you used to care about
And now there so insignificant
Think of how lame your fears seem now
And how you might not get to live again

Worried about the stranger's imaginary thoughts
Wondering if they're gonna love you or not
Loves me she loves me not it's all the same
Irrational thoughts still feed the mundane
Waiting for approval and nobody cares
Guessing the mood is behind every stare

Think back about the things you used to care about
And now there so insignificant
Think how lame your fears seem now
And how you might not get to live again

Patience out the window and feed it to the birds
Saying nothing to much while they all find it first
Pissin' on the moments and missing the chance
Under your face and it slip through your hands

Think back about the things you used to care about
And now there so insignificant
Think of how lame your fears seem now
And how you might not get to live again

Let all fear be your mirror
Let it show you that it can't hold you
Let all fear be your mirror
Let it show you that nobody owns you
