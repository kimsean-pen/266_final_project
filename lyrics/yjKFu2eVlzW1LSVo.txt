Yeah, my demons don't fight fair
Every day I wake up to a nightmare
I'll make you cry my tears
You wanna kill me, bitch I'm right here, I'm right here
Take a shot, yeah yeah
Take a shot, yeah
Try your hardest and take your best shot
Take a shot, yeah yeah
Take a shot, yeah
Try your hardest and take your best shot

I'm not the one you wanna find love with
I'm not the one for you to put your trust in
I've got my god damn confident block shit
Round one is done, your heart losing love quick
Easily spending money on shit I never need
Ever been bit by a vampire with diamond teeth
You wear a heart on both sleeves
'Cause it's broken in half, if you ask me, I can't breathe

Yeah, my demons don't fight fair
Every day I wake up to a nightmare
I'll make you cry my tears
You wanna kill me, bitch I'm right here, I'm right here
Take a shot, yeah yeah
Take a shot, yeah
Try your hardest and take your best shot
Take a shot, yeah yeah
Take a shot, yeah
Try your hardest and take your best shot

Back in Arizona my heart got torn up
Ripped up, chewed up, and spat out
Life got me in a submission, but you're strangling me so tight
And I'm struggling not to tap out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
Can't read my mind, well you should try to talk
Look at that masterpiece beside you
Now I'm behind you
And I black out, yeah
When I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life wall red with my brains, and I black out
I just wanna get out
Exit life, back out
Paint the wall red with my brains, and I black out
