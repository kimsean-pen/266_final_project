First of all, I'm never giving up
I'm gaining perspective and counting on my luck
Don't miss the point or let it pass you by
You'll run around in circles, asking yourself why

Stand at attention, it's going down right here
(Wake up, wake up, can you hear me?)
Where's all your passion, has it disappeared?
(Get up, get up, or I'm leaving)
I won't waste any more of this life
losing direction, missing connections
One last time, I'm screaming out loud what's inside my head

I'm sick of you playing dead

Worst of all, I'm sick of growing up
I've lost all perspective, I'm running out of luck
Now here, here I go again
Scratching at the surface
Will this ever end?
Will you ever pay attention, I'm standing right the fuck here
(Wake up, wake up, can you hear me?)
Where's all the passion, has is disappeared?
(Get up, get up, or I'm leaving)
I won't waste any more of this life
losing direction, missing connections

One last time, I'm screaming out loud what's inside my head
I'm sick of you playing dead

(It's time for me to take some chances
all I need is this book of matches
to burn it all to a billion ashes
I'm seeing red)
(Stop playing dead)
(Stop playing dead)
(All I need is this book of matches
Burn it all to a billion ashes)
Don't waste any more of your life
losing direction, missing connections
For one last time, I'm screaming out loud what's inside my head
I won't waste any more of this life
losing direction, missing connections
One last time, I'm screaming out loud what's inside my head
I'm sick of you playing dead
