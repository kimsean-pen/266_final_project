You're everywhere and nowhere, baby,
Thats where you're at,
Going down a bumpy hillside,
In your hippy hat.
Flying across the country
And getting fat
Saying everything is groovy
When your tyres are flat

And it's hi, ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious.

Flies are in your pea soup baby,
They're waving at me
Anything you want is yours now
Only nothing's for free.
Lies are gonna get you some day
Just wait and see.
So open up your beach umbrella
While you're watching TV

And it's hi, ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious.

And it's hi, ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious.

And it's hi ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious.
