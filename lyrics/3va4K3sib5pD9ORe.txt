So what you waiting for?
So what you waiting for?
I have never compromised
I never gave in
And so I have welcomed every challenge in my life

And I have never wandered blind
I'm led by hunger
And so I savor every drop each minute I'm alive
Leave nothing left behind

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it
So what you waiting for?

Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

Don't let them undermine
Your dreams can never be stolen
Don't leave them stagnant rotting on the vine

Say goodbye to anyone who tries
To bleed you dry, you will show them
You're blessed with an unlimited supply

Leave nothing left behind

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it
So what you waiting for?

Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

(So what you waiting for?)
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside

Leave you cornered and alone
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

So what you waiting for?
So what you waiting for?
