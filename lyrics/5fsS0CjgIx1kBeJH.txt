Your blood pumps through your heart
And flows to the other parts of your body
Let yourself feel your own heart
Beating and pumping
When you walk in warm water
Like they do in the summer
When the sunlight is on them
You can feel so good

Your blood pumps through your heart
And flows to the other parts of your body
Let yourself feel your own heart
Beating and pumping
You know what a heart looks like
That good feeling is always there
You can feel so good

Your blood pumps through your heart
And flows to the other parts of your body
Let yourself feel your own heart
Beating and pumping
When you walk in warm water
Like they do in the summer
When the sunlight is on them
You can feel so good

It would feel so nice to be floating
And to feel so light
Oh, the grass is so green
Just let out a nice, long, sigh

Ah...
