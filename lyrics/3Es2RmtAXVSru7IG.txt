Candylanes
Dem streets of love
So deep in love
Covered with sheets of past
And candy canes
So sweet in love
Let's keep in touch
Wondered even so
With these fancy games
Ha-haa
Cadylaned
The secret price
To seek advice
How to keep your life
Candy chained
Backed by freedoms words
Act with peaceful verbs
Packing peaceful pipes
On left your familys name
Ha-hoo
