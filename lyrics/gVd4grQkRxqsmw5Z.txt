Shame on you
For thinking that you're an exception
We're all to blame
Crashing down to earth
Wasting and burning out, yeah
Fading like a dead star, wooo
Harm is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way
You used to be everything to me
Now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting
Fighting yourself
Shame on you
For thinking
You're all alone
If you want I'll make you wish you were
Failing to impress
Why can't you sleep with
Someone who protects you, yeah
Harm is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way
You used to be everything to me
Now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting
Fighting yourself
