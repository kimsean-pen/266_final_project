You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin' bands
You just wanna go to the movie show
And sit there holdin' hands
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
I only know I love you like I do, I do, I do, I do

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

Baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care, care, care, care
