Alone on a train, aimless in wonder
An outdated map, crumbled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going
'Cause they're all different names for the same place

The coast disappeared when the sea drowned the sun
I knew no words to share with anyone
The boundaries of language I quietly cursed
All the different names for the same thing

There are different names for the same thing
There are different names for the same thing

There are different names
There are different names
There are different names
There are different names

There are different names
There are different names
There are different names
There are different names

Different names
There are

Different names for the same thing
Different names for the same thing
For the same thing
