Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence

Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence

Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence

No need to listen to yourself
Maybe this one will pass you by
Or to anybody else

No need to listen to yourself
Or to anybody else

No need to listen to yourself
Or to anybody else

Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
