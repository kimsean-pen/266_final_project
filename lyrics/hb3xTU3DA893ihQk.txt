All that we have ever known,
Imprisoned by what we have not.
The tomb of ancient wisdom
Still dreamt of, though lost.

Haunted by the spectres of myth.
Barren relics obscured by time.
Beyond the scattered ruins,
Deeper than the aura of the word.

LANGUAGE TURNS AND THE LEGEND IS ALIVE.

"Neither flesh nor fleshless,
Neither from nor towards;
At the still point there the dance is...
There we have been:
But I cannot say where.
And I cannot say how long,
For that is to place it in time"

Time beyond time, beyond flesh, beyond fear.
Deeper than the aura of the word.
In defiance of those who kneel.

Brandishing steel at the inferno's edge.
War in the ageless fire of vengeance.
SPIRIT TERROR IN THE MORTAL ABYSS
RISE THROUGH THE NEXUS AS THE WHEEL TURNS.

Neither flesh nor fleshless,
Neither from nor towards.
Spirit terror in the mortal abyss
Rise through the nexus as the wheel turns
