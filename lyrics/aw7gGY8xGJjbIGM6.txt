You must have been phlegmatic in stature
The Gates of Thanos are a spread eagle wide
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes
Out of a blind mans picaresque heart

You take the veil
You'll take the dive
You take the veil

It's not over till the tremulant sings
These ides of march
Are they so make believe
How tempts the revenant

Slice up and not across
You take the veil
You'll take the dive

You take the veil
A mass of gallon sloth
As flys have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim, someone said but who is to know
And when you find the fringe
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day

The iconoclastic had it coming for years
They know the prisons that you have yet to fear
Where thumbs hide inside of sleepingbag mouths
Adlib your memoires by casting a drought

You take the veil
You'll take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth
As flies have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim, someone said but who is to know
And when you find the fringe
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day
Knife me in, hobbeling

Talking in it's sleep again
Knife me in, hobbeling
Talking in it's sleep again
Knife me in hobbling
Talking in it's sleep again
Knife me in hobbling

Talking in it's sleep again
Virulent hives, of bedpost piles
Virulent hives
Who brought me here
Forsaken, deprived and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?
Forsaken, deprived and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?
