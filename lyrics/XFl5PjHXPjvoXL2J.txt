I'm fanaticizing about doing a raindance in traffic
I'm fanaticizing about a storm to wash me away
If you'd study the laugh-lines, you'd see that I'm cracking
I spent 6 months now feeling like dead weight
The fighter in me must've died a long time ago
I must've been watching his ghost
Just going through the motions

Just putting on a face

It feels like 1929, &
I'm on the verge
Of a great collapse today
Every window in this house faces a brick wall
& I'm panicked & absent like a bird in a cage
Well, the word from the front lines says that we're out-gunned
But I can't walk away, no

I can't walk away, no, I can't

The fighter in me must've died a long time ago
I must've been watching his ghost
Just going through the motions
Just putting on a face
It feels like 1929, &
I'm on the verge
Of a great collapse today
I was just happy to be a contender
I was just aching for anything
& I used to have such steady hands, but
Now I can't keep 'em from shaking
I was just happy to be a contender
I was just aching for anything
& I used to have such steady hands, but
Now I can't keep 'em from shaking
Can't keep 'em from shaking
Can't keep 'em from shaking
I can't keep 'em from shaking
I can't keep 'em from shaking
Can't keep 'em from shaking
Can't keep 'em from shaking
Can't keep 'em from shaking
