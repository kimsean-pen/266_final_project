Someday I won't be afraid of my head
Someday I will not be chained to my bed
Someday I'll forget the day he left
But surely not today
One day I won't need a PhD
To sit me down and tell me what it all means
Maybe one day it'll be a breeze, ah
But surely not today, but surely not today

Oh, you don't know what sadness means
'Til you're too sad to fall asleep
One day I'll be snoozing peacefully
But surely not today
Surely not today

One day I'll swear the pain will be a blip
I'll have the hardest time recalling it
I'll be the king of misery management
But surely not today
One day that song won't make me cry anymore (Oh no no)
One day I'll get up off the bathroom floor (Hey, yeah)
Oh, piece by piece I'll be restored
But surely not today, surely not
Eh, not today

Oh, you don't know what happy means
If it's only in your dreams
I'll be acquainted with my jollities
But surely not today
Yeah, surely not today

Surely not
Surely, surely not
Surely not
Surely not today

One day the thought of him won't hurt the same
Won't need distractions to get through the day
I guess I hope I'm gonna be okay
'Cause I'm not today
