(Selena talk part)

Sometimes at night when I go to sleep I
Hold my pillow tight, thinking of
You 'til it hurts- But in my mind I know you're mine
and somewhere you're thinking of me to

I miss you, thinking of you- you're always on my
mind

(Selena 1st verse)
You're always on my mind, day and night
When I think of you, everything feels so right
Well, I often think of the happy times we spent
together and I just can't wait to tell you
that "I love you"

(Selena 2nd verse)
Time keeps passing by (you're not here) I feel so all
Alone
When I don't have you near, but I often think of
the happy times we spent together and I just can't
wait
To tell you that " I love you"

(Selena and full force chorus)
I'm missing my baby, missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight and never let you out of
my sight.
Missing my baby, missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat next to mine
gotta feel it (feel it)

(Selena)
REPEAT 2ND VERSE
REPEAT CHORUS

(Full force)sometimes at night when i go to sleep
i hold my pillow tight untill my eyes close but in my mind i know your
mine and somewhere your thinking of me too.

(Selena & full force)
Gotta have you (have you) gotta hold you (hold you)
Got to have your lovin' (I gotta have you)

(Selena)
And tell you that " I love you"
And I really miss you
(I miss you)

CHORUS REPEAT
I miss you, thinking of you
You' re always on mind
