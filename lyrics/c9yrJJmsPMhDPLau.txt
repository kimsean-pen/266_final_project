you're a sure sign of heaven above
and you're past the line between I like and I love
but I'm trusting you to always be mine and be true

and there's no reason we can't call it what it is
it's love it's love, it's love it's love

there's a good chance any time of the day
I'll be thinking of you in the nicest way
I haven't slept in days and I know that I'll feel this always

and there's no reason we can't call it what it is
it's love it's love, it's love it's love

I can't help but tell everyone
this is the best thing I've ever done
I owe you everything
you turned my winter to spring
this must be love
