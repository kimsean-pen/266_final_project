Slow, we paddle through the lake
Straight to the very center
Of the darkest water
Where we can embrace the shadows on the surface
The eyes that look up lifeless
From our twins below

And though your arms and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost and plundered
My love will be there still

True its chilling to behold
Up close we stumble backwards
Laughing in our boats till
The image sinks away to someplace far but certain
A land of new suspension
Where someday we must go

And though your arms and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost and plundered
My love will be there still

And though your arms and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your
Ears when all is lost and plundered
My love will be there still
