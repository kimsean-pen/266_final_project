I'm a petty thief
And what I find I keep

I was supposed to
Set an example
But I am a vandal

Yeah The paper's nice
But it's the rush I like
You don't care about the money
When you are adrenaline junkie

Words will chain me after they
Let me loose
And realize that maybe there are

Small crimes
But some things I just
Wouldn't do

And if I gave it up
Would I still be a thug?
You don't choose to play a bad guy
It's in your bloodline
And I left my heart at the scrap metal yard
You don't get to be a human when you're a hooligan
