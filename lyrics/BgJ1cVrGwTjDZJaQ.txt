don't be afraid, child
child
the end is not in sight
sight
there is much more road to travel
just stay by my side
like my father
and my mother
i will love you for forever
hold my hand and dive now, sister
breathe with me underwater
brave and able, child
child
open up your weary eyes
you must not let yourself remain
just swim by my side
like my father
and my mother
i will love you for forever
hold my hand
and dive now sister
breathe with me underwater
and i will watch over you
and i will be there too
and i will be there for you
like my father
and my mother
i will love you for forever
hold my hand and dive now, sister
breathe with me underwater
like my father
and my mother
i will love you for forever
hold my hand and dive now, sister
breathe with me underwater
and i will watch over you
and i will be there too
and i will be there for you
