Boots and thick socks
Roots and old rocks
Food and big thoughts
Quiet tree frogs

Pervasive good mood
I'm in my follow through
Sun toss a deep hue
Across my afternoon

Can't help my motion
In woods this golden
Like an earthen shrine just gave me powers and I'm
Dispelling omens

Somewhere I might be
A modern human being
But not here, not with a hundred thousand trees
Miles taller than me

Somewhere I might be
A modern human being
But not here, not with a hundred thousand trees
Miles taller than me

Boots and thick socks
Roots and old rocks
Food and big thoughts
Quiet tree frogs

Pervasive good mood
I'm in my follow through
Sun toss a deep hue
Across my afternoon

Somewhere I might be
A modern human being
But not here, not with a hundred thousand trees
Miles taller than me

Somewhere I might be
A modern human being
But not here, not with a hundred thousand trees
Miles taller than me
