Björk
Gold, finger itches
Gold, in the hand
Gold, you have to have
Gold, all for yourself

Gold, full train of it
Gold, rob the train
Gold, murder in the train
Gold, get some gold

Gold is the sweat of the sun
Give me some gold!
Gold, it glitters
Gold, is soft and thin

Einar
I'm searching for gold
I need gold just to see
Never seen it before
Indication of gold
Do I see gold?
Bloody fingers!
Dig! Crawl! Dig!

Björk
Gold is the sweat of the sun
Give me some gold!

Einar
I continue to dig into the earth,
Torn fingers, bloody fingers.

Björk
There is a sun in the sky
Nothing has changed
And gold, begotten of the sun...
Give me gold!
I need it now, oh gold!

Einar
I'm still searching for gold
I need gold

Björk
And I have to have a chunk of... gold

Einar
No indication of gold

Björk
Just a little piece of gold for me!

Einar
In the core of the earth

Björk
Oh, gold!

Einar
I see the glow, this is the gold

Björk
Gold, gold! Oh gold!

Einar
I need gold!

Björk and Einar
Oh, gold!
