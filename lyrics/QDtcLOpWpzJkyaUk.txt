Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, break away
I'm missin' out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear
You speak and there's is no other voice that I can hear

I spend my days
(Ooh, ooh)
With you
(I spend my days)
I spend my nights
(My nights)
Thinkin' about you
(Thinking' about you babe)
I spend my days
(All day, all night)
With you
(With you)
I spend my nights
(My nights)
Thinkin' about you

You're so fine on my mind
And I think about you all the time
(All the time)
Day and night, feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight

Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night that I spend without you
Is longer than the last

I spend my days
(I spend my days)
With you
(Thinkin' about you babe)
I spend my nights
(My nights)
Thinkin' about you
(All day, all night)
I spend my days
(My days)
With you
(Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights
(My nights)
Thinkin' about you
(Thinkin' about you babe)

Ooh, you know I can't get enough of you
(Can't get enough yeah)
Uh uh, you know that 24 hours won't ever, ever do

I spend my days
(I spend my days)
With you
(With you, with you)
I spend my nights
(My nights)
Thinkin' about you
I spend my days
(I spend my days)
With you
(With you baby)
I spend my nights
(All day, all night)
Thinkin' about you
(All day, all night)

I spend my days
(Thinkin' about you)
With you
(Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights
(Thinking about you)
Thinkin' about you
(Thinkin' about you)
I spend my days
(Thinkin' about you)
With you
(Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights
(Thinkin' about you)
Thinkin' about you
(Thinkin' about you babe)

I spend my days
(All day, all night)
With you
(All day, all night)
I spend my nights
(All day, all night)
Thinkin' about you
I spend my days
With you
