I wrote a letter to your ex-girlfriend on Instagram tonight
I shouldn't post it though, but I really want petty to win tonight
Dear Ms. You-Will-Never-Be-Me
I thought I'd introduce myself
I'm the reason he's flourishing
The reason he wake up the morning
The cookie that he eats when hungry

I know you feel you have a right to call him
You don't
I know you feel you have a right to text him
You don't (You-ou-ou don't)
I know you feel he may be coming back to you
He won't (He won't, he won't, he won't, won't)
I know you feel like he'll come around
He won't, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Jealousy (Oh, oh)
It keeps getting the best of me, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
(He won't, he won't, he won't, won't)

Dear Ms. You'll-Never-Be-Me (Oh)
Stop using Instagram to hit his homies
Using Morse code to try to catch him lonely
Your page don't even look like you, them titties lookin' phony

I know you feel you have a right to call him
You don't (You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't)
I know you feel you have a right to text him
You don't (You-ou-ou-ou don't)
I know you feel he may be coming back to you
He won't (He won't, he won't, he won't, won't)
I know you're prayin' he'll come around
He won't, Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Jealousy (Oh, oh)
It keeps getting the best of me, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
(He won't, he won't, he won't, won't)
Jealousy (Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh)
It keeps getting the best of me, yeah (Oh)
(He won't, he won't, he won't, won't)
Jealousy (Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)
Don't you know that you are best of me, yeah? (Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)

Dear Ms. You'll-Never-Be-Me
(Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)
Dear Ms. You'll-Never-Be-Me
(Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh)
