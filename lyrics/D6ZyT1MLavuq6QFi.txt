Sometimes I wake up
In the morning
Sometimes I dream some more
I keep my wounds without a bandage
Baby, as I come stumblin' through the door
Spent my nights in this location
Talking to spirits on the floor
I think I came to find the feeling, baby
Between what was mine and what was yours

And I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yea-ea
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

I think I'm gonna move to California
(I can start to love)
Momma can you say a prayer for me?
(Say a prayer for me)
I heard they don't get so low-down
(All my friends get so low-down)
I heard they never bleed
Not like we bleed

I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yea-ea
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And it gets pretty late
And the stations will change
And the things once in order now seem so strange
Once I could tell
All the hurt apart from myself
Now all I can see is the need, the need

I came to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me, yea-ea
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And maybe you needed a change
Maybe I was in the way
Maybe some things they stay*
And some things go away
And maybe I was lying
And maybe you were not the same
