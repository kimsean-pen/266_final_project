Never seen such doubt
Never seen without
Forever seemed so right
Understand I try

Endeavour rests inane
Takes us once again...

Somewhere in the air

The world can see a reason I believe
The words deceive the reason I believe

Heaven seemed so right
Understanding lies
Hail the fallen grade
Praise lamented shade

Somewhere in the air

The world can see a reason I believe
The words deceive the reason I believe

So you want to show
The only way you've known
A truth for all who see
A cue for all who know
