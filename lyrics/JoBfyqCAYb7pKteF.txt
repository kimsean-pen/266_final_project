I recall
That night we met
Do you remember when I said
How I loved
Your summer dress
You said, "it's borrowed, just like my bed"
But you said
You said, "it's mine"

Facing that I can no longer face you
Feels like the rain
When summer's out of sight
Here when you leave
The buffet it makes me want you
Depersonalize pain
You know what I like

An empty room
A stranger's bed
I had to crawl the halls to ask
When we might meet
Before you left
You said, "maybe tomorrow, I may borrow you"
But you said
"Right now I'm yours"

Facing that I can no longer face you
Feels like the rain
When summer's out of sight
Here when you leave
The buffet it makes me want you
Depersonalize pain
You know what I like

Facing that I can't face you
Feels like the rain is washing out my wounds with saline
Those spaces that take me back to you will sterilize the pain
I'm searching for the one that tore me to pieces

Facing that I can no longer face you
Feels like the rain when summer's out of sight
Here when you leave the buffet it makes me want you
Depersonalize pain
You know what I like

Facing that I can't face you
Feels like the rain is washing out my wounds with saline
Those spaces that take me back to you will sterilize the pain
I'm searching for the one that tore me to pieces
