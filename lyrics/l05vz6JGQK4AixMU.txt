Baked into the crust, I'm comfy, reading eulogies.
You heard I was a nice boy; well, you didn't hear it from me.
I want to keep a hoodied head even when I'm asleep:
Because once a cave carried me away. Now I carry it with me.

It's such a nice day, let's stay inside.
It's such a nice day; we've got a lot of time.
Nice Day.

Reading eulogies, I'm comfy, baked into the crust
You heard we were a good band; well, you didn't hear it from us.
I want to keep my crooked life even if it means blood:
Because once I made a mistake so grave, now I'm crawling through the dirt for us.
If you want to start living, you're going to have to leave me behind.
I'm a Pagan baby, and I'm staying indoors tonight.
You're a Holy Walker. you've got a miracle that I want to buy.
I'm a Panting Monkey, running out of breath and out of your life.

Nice to meet you, now go away.
I want to be alone.
