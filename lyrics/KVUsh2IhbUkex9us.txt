Here I stand
Empty hands
Wishing my wrists were bleeding
To stop the pain from the beatings
There you stood
Holding me
Waiting for me to notice you

But who are you?
But who are you?

You are the truth (You are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (You are the truth)
Saving my life

The warmth of your embrace
Melts my frostbitten spirit
You speak the truth and I hear it
The words are, "I love you"
And I have to believe in you

But who are you?
But who are you?

You are the truth (You are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (You are the truth)
Saving my life

My hands are open
And you are filling them
Hands in the air
In the air
In the air

And I worship
And I worship
And I worship
And I worship

You are the truth (You are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies (lies)
You are the truth (You are the truth)
Saving my life
