There are things out there that i can't explain.
There is not enough time to show you what it all means.
So you need to get out there on your own.
make your own mind up, let your soul go

All that matters is where you lay your head.
All i care about is that you're always safe.

All that time i am running.
There is only one place i'd rather go.
I'd love to show you how everything works,
but the truth is, i don't know
