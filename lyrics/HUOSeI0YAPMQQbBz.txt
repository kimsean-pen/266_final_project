The facade falls dead to the floor
Let it all burn down
I'll be silent no more
Time to rectify
Can't you see that I'm real
I have always been
The shadow that you feel
you personify
You try to shake me
You'll never break me
'cause I can hurt you
Yes I can hurt you
I rise interconneted
We will never go undetected
Like artillery
Light me up I will burn the sun down
I see strenght resurrected
Solid shape ever undefected
A synergy
Light me up like a firesign
Shadows Fading
See the colors will light up the sky
A firesign
Brace to fall
Face down to the floor
Go on antagonize me
I stand here silent no more
Apprised for all to see
This parody is evident
I see right in to you
For retribution I'm hell bent
There's naught for you to do
You try to chain me
You'll never catch me
I stand above you
Yes I'm above you
I rise interconneted
We will never go undetected
Like artillery
Light me up I will burn the sun down
I see strenght resurrected
Solid shape ever undefected
A synergy
Light me up like a firesign
Shadows Fading
See the colors will light up the sky
A firesign
I rise interconneted
We will never go undetected
Like artillery
Light me up I will burn the sun down
I see strenght resurrected
Solid shape ever undefected
A synergy
Light me up like a firesign
Shadows Fading
See the colors will light up the sky
A firesign
Shadows Fading
See the colors will light up the sky
A firesign
