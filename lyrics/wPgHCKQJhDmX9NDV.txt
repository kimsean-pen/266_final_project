Come and come and say
We could never fail
You know what to do
We can cut off the tail
Take me in your arms
I'll walk with you
And I got bud water myself
To blooming on
To the ground we cry alone
As do the bird

So pull me in the water
I'll stay forever while
And we got bud
on holding ground
I hope we can
I hope we can
Pull me into water
Take me to your eyes
We could be bud on the breeze
I'm on your way

Blooming on the wall
We are never lose
the way we are
You can cut off your tail
Hold my hands
I'll never let you down
가려진 시간너머 그 틈 위로
피워낼 그 모든 것
We are the bud

So pull me in the water
I'll stay forever while
And we got bud
on holding ground
I hope we can
I hope we can
Pull me into water
Take me to your eyes
We could be bud on the breeze
I'm on your way

And we rise alone
Blooming hour in this way
We rise alone
Blooming hour in this way
We cry alone
Growing flower in this land
We cry alone
We cry

So pull me in the water
I'll stay forever while
And we got bud
on holding ground
I hope we can
I hope we can
Pull me in to water
Take me to your eyes
We could be bud on the breeze
I'm on your way

And we rise alone
Blooming hour in this way
We rise alone
Blooming hour in this way
We cry alone
Growing flower in this land
We cry alone
We cry
