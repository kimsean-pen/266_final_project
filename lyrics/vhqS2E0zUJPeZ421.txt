One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall

Go ask Alice
I think she'll know
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small

Go ask Alice
I think she'll know
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head
