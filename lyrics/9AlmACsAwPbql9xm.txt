There once was a time
Where everything was just so perfect
Now everything has changed
And you've become a total stranger
I've seen another side to you
I never even knew existed

Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts

Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an ANIMAL!
In for the kill, like you're an ANIMAL!
Straight for the throat you're an ANIMAL!

There once was a time
When anything I do is for you
But everything has changed
And I've become a lonely prisoner
I'd kill, even die for you
You never even tried resisting

Dirty little secrets, Dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts

Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an ANIMAL!
In for the kill, like you're an ANIMAL!
Straight for the throat you're an ANIMAL!
(You're an animal)

Dirty little secrets, Dirty little secrets

Another taste is what you're looking for
There's nothing left so you can't take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat you're like an ANIMAL!
In for the kill, like you're an ANIMAL!
Straight for the throat you're an ANIMAL!
