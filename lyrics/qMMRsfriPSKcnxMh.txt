We have gone to the country in your old car

We have lost our way so many times

Hello, hello
I take you on a trip
Hello, hello
I take you on a trip, yeah! yeah!

Eating your Chupa Chup
A plane is making a loop
The beavers are so cute
A tree gave me a fruit

Hello, hello
I take you on a trip
Hello, hello
I take you on a trip

Hello, hello
I take you on a trip
Hello, hello
I take you on a trip
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
