You fell down of course, and then you got up of course and started over.
Forgot my name of course, then you started to remember.

Pretty tough to think about, the beginning of December.
Pretty tough to think about, pretty tough to think about.
Yeah, yeah, pretty tough to think about.

You're looking down again, and then you look me over.
We're laying down again on a blanket in the clover.

The same boy you've always known.
Well, I guess I haven't grown.
The same boy you've always known,
The same boy you've always known.

Think of what the past did, it could've lasted, so put it in your basket.
I hope you know a strong man who can lend you a hand lowering my casket.

I thought this is just today, and soon you'd be returning.
The coldest blue ocean water can not stop my heart and mind from burning.
Everyone who's in the know says that's exactly how it goes.
And if there's anything good about me, I'm the only one who knows.
