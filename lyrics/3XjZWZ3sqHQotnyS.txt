I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fuckin' know that
These fuckin' eyes that I'm starin' at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fuckin' leanin' on that

Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got, get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me, give me all of it
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me
(Only for tonight, only for the night)
Even though you don't love me (ooh, ooh)
Just tell me you love me
(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (ooh, ooh)

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
Get you dancin' with the Devil
Take a shot of this, but I'm warnin' you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
Oh, I got my heart right here
Oh, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too, ayy
So let me motherfucking love you

Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got, get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me, give me all of it
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me
(Only for tonight, only for the night)
Even though you don't love me (ooh, ooh)
Just tell me you love me
(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (ooh, ooh)
