We're here to work
Not break free
We're here to hurt
Endlessly

Cause when our pain's over
It's someone else's turn
No point in staying sober
If we're gonna burn

And they're never gonna give it up
Never ever gonna give it up
No they're never gonna give it up
Oh, no
Committed to the cause
Committed to the cause

Take this heart
Take this soul
Just bare parts
Of this doll

And they're never gonna give it up
Never ever gonna give it up
No they're never gonna give it up
Oh, no
Committed to the cause
Committed to the cause
Committed to the cause
