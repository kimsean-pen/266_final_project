The drones march through barren wasteland
Without expression
Broken souls corroded by fear
Deprivation exhausts the last fire

Their will is buried
Within hearts of black ash
Gasping for air
Beneath the weight of empty minds

The paralysis of isolation

Exist in parallel
Exist in ignorance
Divorce and dismiss

From deep in the abyss
There is no release
