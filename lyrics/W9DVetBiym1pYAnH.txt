On a dreary night he met a woman down by the water side
Drawn by her weeping song, even the wind was humming along
And all the trees were moving to the sound she was producing
He watched her sing, feeling her song might be meant for him
She weeps oh she weeps
It's death that she foresees
The cry of a banshee, cry of a banshee
On a dreary night he met a woman all dressed in misty white
He walked towards her and he asked: "my fair lady, why so sad?"
Suddenly her melancholic melody
Felt no longer serene and turned into a piercing scream
She weeps oh she weeps
It's death that she foresees
The cry of a banshee, cry of a banshee
She already knew, she already knew, she already knew
What he came here to do
She already knew, she already knew, she already knew
What he came here to do
For she is the omen of death, the harbinger of doom
She weeps oh she weeps
It's death that she foresees
The cry of a banshee, cry of a banshee
