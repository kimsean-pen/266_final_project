Never again she said, we should've known
We should've known, should've known
Though I could've told you that a week ago
A week ago, week ago
But you used your body, baby
And I'm feeling foolish lately
So let's not pretend like you're not coming home.

You're coming home and you say
"Run for me, run for me, run
Come for me, come for me, come
Down to the river, down to the river to pray"

Cause if the truth is blind or naked, naked
It's a losing fight
Oh, so if it's love you want then take it, take it
Make it last all night
You're taking me up, up, up so high
So if it's love you want then break it, break it
Baby, that's just fine

You break me down
You break me down
You break me down
You break me down
You break me down

Mm, now all of my kingdoms crumble in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
Watching my body sing, no compromise
A compromise when you say
"Run for me, run for me, run
Come for me, come for me, come
Down to the river, down to the river to pray"

'Cause if the truth is blind or naked, naked
It's a losing fight
Oh, so if it's love you want then take it, take it
Make it last all night
You're taking me up, up, up so high
So if it's love you want then break it, break it
Baby, that's just fine

You break me down
You break me down
You break me down
You break me down
You break me down

You break me down
You break me down
You break me down
