Lies will multiply
And no villains will be canonised
Darling don't you cry
There's no pain, anymore

I was so surprised
Saw the future in another's eyes
Woken my desire
I can't take, anymore

Build a tower
Hundred storeys high
Lock myself in
Isolation

Once again I'm drawn toward oblivion
The end already written though we've just begun

Hard to find a fit
For I know that I'm a lunatic
Sure in days of old
I'd be chained, to the floor

Lies will hypnotise
And the drink and drugs will pacify
Darling don't you cry
There's no pain, anymore

Build a tower
Hundred storeys high
Lock myself in
Isolation

Once again I'm drawn toward oblivion
The end already written though we've just begun

Once again I'm drawn toward oblivion
The end already written though we've just begun
