She's sitting at the table, the hour's getting later
He was supposed to be here, she's sure he would have called
She waits a little longer, there's no one in the driveway
No one said they've seen him
Why, is something wrong?
She looks back to the window, suddenly the phone rings
A voice says something's happened that she should come right now
Her mind goes to December, she thinks of when he asked her
He bent down on his knee first & he said
I want you forever, forever & always
Through the good & the bad & the ugly
We'll grow old together, forever & always
She pulls up to the entrance
She walks right to the front desk

They lead her down a million halls, a maze that's never ending
They talk about what happened but she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face as she walks into the room

She sits by his bedside, hold his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have & the good life
The house on the hillside where they would stay
Stay there forever, forever & always
Through the good & the bad & the ugly
We'll grow old together & always remember
Whether rich or for poor or for better
We'll still love each other, forever & always

Then she gets an idea & calls in the nurses
Brings up the chaplain & he says a couple verses
She borrows some rings from the couple next door
Everybody's laughing as the tears fall on the floor
She looks into his eyes & she says

I want you forever, forever & always
Through the good & the bad & the ugly
We'll grow old together & always remember
Whether happy or sad or whatever
We'll still love each other, forever & always

Forever & always
She finishes the vows but the beeps are getting too slow
His voice is almost too low as he says
I love you forever, forever & always
Please, just remember even if I'm not there
I'll always love you, forever & always
