O rose of my heart, can't you see
I don't belong to misery
Though she speaks fine with subtle art
Such misery clothes the rose of my heart.

Now what I see in the long twilight
A star falls down on a hill so white
On a hill so white.

A face that glows in a golden hue
No-one in this world knows what they do
I take my oath and I make my vow
For the tender things are upon me now.

In the fragrance sweet of the evening air
I could leave this world quite without a care.

O rose of my heart, the vision dims
the time is brief, now the shadow swims,
A powerful a real fine hat
Cause that's for you and that's where that's at.

Now what I see in the long twilight
A star falls down on a hill so white.

O rose of my heart
O rose of my heart
O rose of my heart.
