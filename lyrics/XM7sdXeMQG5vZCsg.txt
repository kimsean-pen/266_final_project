He wants to hold the children up high
When they come tearing thru the ride
To save you from falling
To save them from falling

He wants to bring a little bring a little honey
To the saltiness of grief
To come up from underneath
You used to say you would rescue me
You yourself
Lost at sea

Save me and ill save you
Save me and ill save you
Make ways to get through
Together
Save me and ill save you
Save me and ill save you
Make ways to get through
Together
