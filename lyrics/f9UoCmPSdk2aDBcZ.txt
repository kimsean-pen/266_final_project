I've seen this place before
I've seen this place before
I've seen this place before

This is where the light and the dark will meet
Hand in hand, carry blood into the street
From bent to broke claws shred into their truth

I've seen this place before
I've seen this place before

I've seen you crying
So there must be something behind those eyes

I've seen this place before
I've seen this place before

I've seen you crying
So there must be something behind those eyes

Walked into the dark
Walked into the dark
Walked into the dark
Walked into the dark

Only to see the light!
