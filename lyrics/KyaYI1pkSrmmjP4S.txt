Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Teddy bear
Baby, can we take it slowly?
'Cause I'm a junky for love
But we can still have a party

Take care
'Cause baby, I'm a dirty flower
But I could still open up
Just like a beautiful orchid

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Teddy bear
Can we take it softly, softly?
Just let me fix up for love
And we could still get it started

Steady there
Let me maybe talk you through it
Just 'cause this feeling's for real
Don't mean you know how to do it

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Take a chance on a night romance for you
For a change, gonna do what I have to do

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo
Fresher than the daisy eaves
It drives me crazy when you play me this

Footprints in the morning snow
You've got me rocking like an echo, echo...
