Burn the flesh that had long been rotten*
He has gone but he's not forgotten
Sayin' his name but don't replace
The time he spent to make his space
He's the only one to keep alive
Here they come again
With their bloodshot eyes
Leave the promise land
Shed your earthly skin
Left alone in a tiny capsule
He's the king of an empty castle
Went away to fill the grave
And made him stay a human slave
Never got to meet the son of mine
Here they come again
With their bloodshot eyes
Leave the promise land
Shed your earthly skin
