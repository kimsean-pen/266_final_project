I can't wake a world
That only wants to sleep
And I can't change a heart
That doesn't want to beat
Voice whispers that I don't fit
Walking down the street
Learning lines to protect myself
The story's incomplete
Well it's over
When it's over
I'm not sober

And I don't care
I like the way I dance when I'm
High
A broken record's playing
Is all you seem to want to be
I watch you walk in circles
Love, hate, sleep and press repeat
My life is elemental
Need the earth, wind and sea
I'm counting numbers
Look for synchronicity
