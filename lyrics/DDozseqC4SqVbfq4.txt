You'll be happier when I'm gone
Much too busy to worry
I'll be sad and you'll feel bad
But I know you won't be sorry

And as I turn to go
Please don't wave goodbye
I refuse to cry
On roads that are paved
With men who behave
Like they know where they're goin'

And I'll stop along the way
And it's then I'll think of you
And I'll wonder if you knew
When I got blue

And things got weird
And I started growing
Bob Dylan's beard
