As a little boy he played strange games
No toy he ever touched
But when nobody looked
His body cooked
In his soul were burning flames

Oh my son, I see your talent
I need such guys like you
Satan sits his throne
In his dark damned dome
His help he'll surely send!

Oh little mouse, where is your head?
Do you wanna use your talent instead?
Now little bird, you'll feel my blade
Now you'll see, I know my trade

Tormentor

He's the master in his own four walls
He lives a life of fun
'Cause his only joy
Is a living toy
Somebody to cut off!

Oh bloody body, where's your head?
Can't find it in this mess
You're still alive, you think you'll stand it?
But I'll have success

Tormentor

Oh little mouse, where is your head?
Do you wanna use your talent instead?
Now little bird, you'll feel my blade
Now you'll see, I know my trade

Tormentor

I like to stretch and burn your limbs
Glowing metal is my friend
Satan watch me
I will set his entrails free
You can be proud of your son!

Oh bloody body, where's your head?
Can't find it in this mess
You're still alive, you think you'll stand it?
But I'll have success

Tormentor
