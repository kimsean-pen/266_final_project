It's pretty nice
Pretty nice
When I'm overwhelmed
The bitter taste
Bitter taste
Mixed with our chemicals
I kinda like, kinda like
How it gives me chills, me chills
I kinda like, kinda like
How it gives you chills, you chills
We get sensations on the carpet
In the middle of your apartment
And there's no reason for me to hide it
I wanna love you until we die, until we...
(Yeah, these sensations are so sensational)
(Yeah, these sensations are so sensational)
You're under me
Under me
And I'm sinking in
Never leave
Never leave
I don't want this to end
I kinda like, kinda like
How it gives me chills, me chills
I kinda like, kinda like
How it gives you chills, you chills
We get sensations on the carpet
In the middle of your apartment
And there's no reason for me to hide it
I wanna love you until we die, until we...
Slow it down, speed it up
That's the way we like to love
Slow it down, speed it up
That's the way we like to love
We get sensations on the carpet
In the middle of your apartment
And there's no reason for me to hide it
I wanna love you until we die
We get sensations on the carpet
In the middle of your apartment
And there's no reason for me to hide it
I wanna love you until we die, until we...
(Yeah, these sensations are so sensational)
