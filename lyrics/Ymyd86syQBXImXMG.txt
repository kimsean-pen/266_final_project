I find it hard to shed a tear
You brought it all on yourself my dear
Wrong, yes I may be
Don't leave a light on for me
'Cause I ain't comin' home
It hurts me, baby, to be alone
Yes, it hurts me, baby

A hundred years will never ease
Hearing things I won't believe
I saw it with my own two eyes
All the pain I can't hide
And this pain starts in my heart
And this love tears us apart
Won't find me bent down
On my knees, oh yeah
Ain't bendin' over backwards, baby
Not to please, oh

'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
I'm seeing things for the first time, oh yeah
I'm seeing things for the first time
In my life, in my life

And I used to dream
Of better days that never came
And sorry ain't nothin' to me
I'm gone and that's the way it must be
So please, I've done my time
Lovin' you is such a crime
You won't find me down
On my knees, oh, no, no, no
Won't find me over backwards baby
Just to please, oh yeah

'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
I'm seeing things for the first time
Seeing things for the first time
Oh, I'm seeing things for the first time
Yeah, seeing things for the first time
Oh, I'm seeing things for the first time
Yeah, I'm down on my knees (seeing things for the first time)
In my life, in my life, oh yeah
