You were running blind
Following your feet to try
And I'll run your fate
Standing in a field of clouds??? of us is the loud
I'll holler in your name
Is it paradise? Only if it blows your mind
And then blows you away

Sometimes you reel, sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

Close in the mind, we'll call it second sight
Now that you are more the same
And it's the finish line yeah hung you out by
You were holding my hands and saying
You know I'm only here to take what's mine
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have lived a different life
Could have lived a different life
Know I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I could have lived a different life
Could have lived a different life

Pulling me inside, giving me a lost advice
And the whole house shakes
Say keep in the family height, don't make the mistakes that I did
'Cause it will wail your soul away
And I would have tried if only he was black and white
But he's bullet cry

Sometimes you reel, sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

Close in the mind, we'll call it second sight
Now that you are more the same
And it's the finish line yeah hung you out by
You were holding my hands and saying
You know I'm only here to take what's mine
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have lived a different life
Could have lived a different life
Know I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I need the remedy to keep my base
Need the remedy to sleep at night
