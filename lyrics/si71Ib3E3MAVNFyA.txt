Broken home baby
I can never blame you
No one ever taught you how to love right
No one ever taught you how to stand by
When it's uphill
And more times this love is just uphill

You're always fighting something
You never stop running
You don't even bother tryna keep your smile
Let me take you back, boy let me try
We might be alright
Perfect ain't coming but we'll be alright

You just gotta, just gotta love me
Don't let goodbyes come too easy
Love me, just let me know that you need me
Love me, I'll teach you how to love me, love me

Broken home baby
I can never hate you
Even though you're draing my soul out of my eyes
Even though you had me crying every night
I see you're trying
I'm grateful 'cause I see you're trying

I know I know I know I know why I shouldn't stay
But I'm stuck tryna save you from you
And you should know that I'm at your mercy
I've spent my life searching for you

So you just gotta, gotta love me
Don't let goodbyes come too easy
Love me, just let me know that you need me
Love me, I'll teach you how to love me, love me
You just gotta, gotta love me
Don't let goodbyes come too easy
Love me, just let me know that you need me
Love me, I'll teach you how to love me

I'll teach you how to love me
