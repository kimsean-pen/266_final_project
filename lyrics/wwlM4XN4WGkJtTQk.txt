Verse 1:
I don't want to make this sound so cold
But every now and then I'm gonna let you know, ohh
There's gotta be something givin' to me
All you need to know is that I'm a fly young lady

So do what you got to do if it's me you chose
But I got the oohhh's baby, yah hear ohh
I'm gonna give up some time if it's worth my while
Cause it's my world, I'm playin' my game

Chorus:
You gotta get down(echo)
With the way I'm runnin' things
Or you won't be around(echo)
You gotta get down with me, me

You gotta get down(echo)
With the way it's gotta be
Turn your frown to a smile(echo)
You gotta get down with me, me

You gotta get down(echo)
Ooh baby, oh you gotta get down with me
Down(echo)
Hey...
Down(echo)
Down, umm yeah
You gotta get down with me, me
Verse 2: I've heard your kinda nice (what's yours now it's that slow?)
Take the time, learn the ways then we can roll
Have you ever met a girl that knows her thang
Lookin' kinda fly but baby can you swang

So do what you got to do if it's me you chose
But I got the oohhh's baby, I got the oohs baby
I'm gonna give up some time if it's worth my while
Cause it's my world, I'm playin' my game

ChorusX2

You gotta get(echo)
Down(echo)
