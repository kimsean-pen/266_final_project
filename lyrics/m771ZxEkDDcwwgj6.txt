My love ain't black-and-white
My love ain't black-and-white
You must be colour-blind
You must ignore the signs to not see that

My love's an open door
My love's an open door
Don't let it close on you
Don't let it shut before you see that

My love, you can almost taste it
It's in the air, baby, just inhale it
Baby, just inhale it
Oh, my love, my love, yeah
My love, you cannot escape it
Want you hooked, want you fucked-up faded
Get you fucked-up faded
On my love, my love

Breathe me in deep
Breathe me just for a second
I'm that smoke in your lungs
Yeah, I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal

I'm sending a signal

Wish I could read your heart
Wish I could read your heart
Know if it beats in time
Know if it beats with mine, do you feel that?

My love, you can almost taste it
It's in the air, baby, just inhale it
Baby, just inhale it
Oh, my love, my love, yeah
My love, you cannot escape it
Want you hooked, want you fucked-up faded
Get you fucked-up faded
On my love, my love

Breathe me in deep
Breathe me just for a second
I'm that smoke in your lungs
Yeah, I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal

I'm sending a signal

Breathe me in deep
Breathe me just for a second
I'm that smoke in your lungs
Yeah, I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal

Breathe me in deep
Breathe me just for a second
I'm that smoke in your lungs
Yeah, I'm sending a signal
I'm sending a signal
