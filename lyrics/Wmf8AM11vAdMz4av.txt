Perfume on my shirt
Puts me in the past
Too lonely to be happy
But too afraid to ask

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

Too young to settle down
Too old to be in bars
It's hard to take it easy
It's easy to be hard

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

Forgive me, I am building my ship as it sails
How do I become who I wanna be while still remaining myself?

People love the old me
I don't know where he's gone
Too tired to be famous
Too vain to be unknown, yeah

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

Here I am again
Stuck in the middle
(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am, here I am again)
Here I am again
Stuck in the middle

(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am)
(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am)

(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am)
(Here I am, here I am again)
(Here I am)
