Stricken,
But i will never fall
There is nothing in this world I fear
Forsaken,
But I will never call
The ones that want to see me down,
Forever crawling
To their feet,
Forever begging for the noble deeds
I shall never kiss this crown and there is nothing I regret
I always knew this day would come
Faint premonotions blend into knowledge
This is the time of new departures
So many fists,
So many shining eyes
So many voices shouting out the will to power
I seek salvation in the distance,
Leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my deamons falling silent
I left the lost, so very long ago
I left the lost, so very long ago
As masses converging around their towers
An apodictic certainty arose in me
That i shall wear this sign forever
That I shall never kiss this corwn,
Nothing I regret
I know the apostates,
I carry the truth in me
As new liars invade my riven fatherlands
I seek salvation in the distance,
Leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my deamons falling silent
I left the lost, so very long ago
I left the lost,
So very long ago
[???],
But i will never fall
There is nothing in this world I fear
I see vassals face away from frantic leaders
Lies of omission ensnare the changeling
I see heros decay, I hear pontiffs betray
Betray their canon sermonized over ages
I seek salvation in the distance, leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my deamons falling silent
I left the lost, so very long ago
I left the lost,
I left the lost,
I seek salvation in the distance, (I left the lost)
Leaving the turmoil of this world (I left the lost)
And all my deamons falling silent
I left the lost, so very long ago
