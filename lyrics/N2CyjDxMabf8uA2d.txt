Remember the day our lips touched in the rain
Fireworks through my veins into my heart
Remember the nights dancing under the sky
I got lost in the moonlight
Found in your dark eyes

Ohh I wanna fall in love again but this time
But this time with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets
I don't want just anyone
Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you
With you
With you

I wanna fall in love again with you
With you
With you
Can we forget all the lies that we've led
Take us so far away from the truth

Can we erase all the tears and regrets
Fear hiding in the pain
The shadows of yesterday
Ohh I wanna fall in love again but this time
But this time with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets

I don't want just anyone
Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you

With you
With you
We can take a blank white page
And fill it with the dreams we made
And let the scars slowly fade away

I wanna fall in love again but this time
with no regrets
I wanna give it all again but this time
But this time with no secrets
I don't want just anyone
Not anyone new
Woah oh I don't want just anyone
Not anyone new
I wanna fall in love again with you
With you
With you
With you
I wanna be in love again with you
With you
I wanna be in love again
