A silver net of happiness
As the tears you cried, they start to go
And you start to feel the life, the flesh
It pulls apart your head, your soul
Its crooked

Now you're pinned down to the end
Its the end of all your hope
You've waited for so very long
So just shut your eyes and wait to feel
And its all too much
Because its never enough
Outside, where the sky it closes in
This sense of wealth is all just lies and sin
You walk away and try to forget this
You think how special it is to be just dead

And its all too much
Because its never enough
Now its all your fault
As you slip away
