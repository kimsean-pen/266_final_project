Lately safety is not an issue
There's more concern over questions left unanswered by
you
No compromise
I'll be alright

We'll never understand
Everything we had
But I'll try

Faulty wiring has left me fatigued
Can't seem to render situations laid before me
You cross my mind
From time to time

There's fear I can't explain
Since you went away
But I'll try
