Nah nah nah nah nah no... no no no
Nah nah nah nah nah no... no no no

The sand loves when
The waves come
The sky can't wait
For the light of the sun

So how could you
Look me in my eye
And not see what
What I feel inside
Tell me how could you
Doubt the fact that I
I love you, I love you

Don't you ever (Think like that)
Don't you ever (Never do that)
There will never be two things
That go together better than you and me

North needs south
East needs west
And no needs
Yes, yes, yes
Up needs down
Life needs death
And no needs
Yes, yes, yes

I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you

So how could you
Look me in my eye
And not see what
What I feel inside
Tell me how could you
Doubt the fact that I
I love you, I love you

Don't you ever (Think like that)
Don't you ever (Never do that)
There will never be two things
That go together better than you and me

North needs south
East needs west
And no needs
Yes, yes, yes
Up needs down
Life needs death
And no needs
Yes, yes, yes

I need you (Oh Baby)
I need you (Everyday)
I need you (I need you yeah)
I need you
I need you (I need you)
Said I need you baby

Like the desert needs the rain (Like the desert needs the rain)
Like joy needs pain
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey...
