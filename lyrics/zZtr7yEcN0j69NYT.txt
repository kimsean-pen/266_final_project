I'm not doing great,
I feel like I'm dead not thinking straight.
Inside my body troubled, full of hate,
I had to let it out before it's too late.

Deep inside, feeling so lost and betrayed.
Why does this happen to me everytime?
Stuck in this place where I can't escape.
Screaming and clawing from deep inside.

Why won't it fade?
Outside I had to lie, I'm okay.
I hope someday I'll stop feeling pain,
I guess this is a life I have made.

Deep inside, feeling so lost and betrayed.
Why does this happen to me everytime?
Stuck in this place where I can't escape.
Screaming and clawing from deep inside.

What am I doing?
I can't believe this I have been hiding.
Wanting to be less, giving to people,
They take from me, lways they're bringing drama to me.
Now!

Feeling so lost and betrayed.
Why does this happen to me everytime?
Stuck in this place where I can't escape.
Screaming and clawing from deep inside.

I can't stand,
All this fucking pain.
Please God just go away,
Please God just make them pay.
