In these days of manmade wonders
We still bicker over flies
When you come seeking for forgiveness
I'll be forced to choose my side
If I deny you what you're searching
Do I do it out of fear?
Am I ruling out my reason
Killing that which I hold dear

Out of my way, I'm running
With an excuse just underway
Reality's so daunting
And I've got no way to explain

'Cause when you're sleeping right next to me
I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name
Why do I turn away to run
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds
Sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds
Diamonds for tears

In the light of recent findings
There's no greater taint than grace
But to relinquish all our bindings
Always finds us out of place
If I rested here a while more
Would you hold me to your heart
If I knew what it was meant for
What I know to play my part

Out of my way, I'm leaving
Another excuse before I'll stay
Reality's applauding
I know I don't know the right way

'Cause when you're sleeping right next to me
I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name
Yeah, I know you're the one
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds
Sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds
Diamonds for tears

Is it a lost cause?
Can we overlook this taint?
Are these the dead laws?
Like a doubt eating the saint
And though I fear these shackles
Like my darkness closing in
I will hold out my hands
I will hold out my hands

'Cause when you're sleeping right next to me
I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name
I'll know the good I've done
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds
Sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds

'Cause when you're sleeping right next to me
I know you're the one
So when I hear you calling my name
I'll know the good I've done
I guess that's why it's raining diamonds
Sweet happiness in tears
Crying heaven shed your diamonds
Diamonds for tears
