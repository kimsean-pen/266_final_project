With sweet slow kisses all over my face
You take my hand when you're calling my name
Two young hearts just beating the same
Love's drowning here

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

We, we, I, I, bao bao b, b, b, bao
Night night night
We flood it down

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Head under water I'm sinking to you
Breathing harder but you're pulling me through
Run for cover, I'll die for you
Cause love's drowning here

Take me away
Away

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

We, we, I, I, bao bao b, b, b, bao
Night night night
We flood it down

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Take me away from here, oh oh
Cover me in love and tears (tears)

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I

We, we, I, I, bao bao b, b, b, bao
Night night night
We flood it down

Flood up the night
And we, up, the night
And we flood up the night
You and I
