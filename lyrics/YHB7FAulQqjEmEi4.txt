I left a note on the mirror, took the keys to the brand new car
So don't get mad at me, 'cause you know you treat me wrong
It couldn't be any clearer, it already went too far
So don't get mad at me, 'cause you know you treat me wrong

Don't need your sympathy, I know you're not over me, over me
And with a little sugar on the side I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'd kill to see, when your eyes get a hold of me, hold of me
And with a little sugar on the side I'll be fine, I'll be fine

You whispered words in the darkness, turned everything upside down
So don't get mad at me, 'cause you know you treat me wrong
You lied all about, I figured it out, and then you went and left it on your phone
So don't get mad at me, 'cause you know you treat me wrong

Don't need your sympathy, I know you're not over me, over me
And with a little sugar on the side I'll be fine, I'll be fine
I'd kill to see, when your eyes get a hold of me, hold of me
And with a little sugar on the side I'll be fine, I'll be fine
