Frozen in the moment
Seems like time is standing still
This life feels like a cyanide pill
The sun rise, a new morning
It's the same strife, different day
The grim reaper meets me in the doorway

I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way to fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away

Broken by this moment
Seems like I have lost the will
The will to carry on further still
The sundown, darkness falling
It all ends right where it begins
I pray for forgiveness for my sins

I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way to fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away

Can you see through the fire
Can you see through the rain
And you walk through flames
Have we all become insane
Is this my funeral pyre
Burning brightly and in vain
Faceless strangers without names
Haunts you over and over again

I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way to fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away
