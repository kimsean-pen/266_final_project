Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass
Evil controlling my mind
The fear of dying expired of life, to vomit the soul
I am dead within myself

The end a beginning to a new life in hell
I am your path to ever-lasting pain
Mass extinction of the human population
Son of the devil the evil incarnation

Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals
The child born unto evil, trapped within the statue of flesh
Vipers travel through bodily orifices
Blessed by the Devil under inverted crosses

Religious ways, lies controlling minds
I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves I search for decay packs
Of flesh driven zombies ready to feast
I suffer forever living only to dismember

Open season on humans
Laughing I watch them die, they bleed so easily
Their blood flows through my body
I need to taste the flesh exposing pulsing arteries

Removing vital organs
Not stopping till you've died
Puts from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore
Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts

Constricted corpuscles coagulating blood
My drug a slave to its taste
Reincarnated to human form, creating a race of immortal beings
Rot away dead bodies, set a flame

Searing flesh, broken necks
You can't kill what already dead
De-evolution, hunting for life
Cannibalism, immortality rip and slash

A society of mass murder bleeding slow
I take away your life
And leave you lying cold, decapitated body
Searching for its head

Anticipate apocalypse, rising dead dismembering
Hacking limbs bleeding, cracking ribs torture us
Blessed by the devil, under inverted crosses
Religious ways, lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves, desolate
Empty hollow corpse, desecrate forced
To eat your flesh extracting purity violate
Twisted bodies, rot away
