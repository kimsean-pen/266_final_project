I am insensitive I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I dunno why you stay with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse
I am a wreckin' ball crashin' into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday mornin' full of
Grace and full of Jesus I wish that I
Could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love, you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me goood
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy and I couldn't do it if
I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy and I couldn't do it if
I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
You love me good
