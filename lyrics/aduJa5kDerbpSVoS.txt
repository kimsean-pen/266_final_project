Im collecting people's tears
They cried because they miss you
They filled the seas and all the lakes
With memories the wind blew
I'd run out of jars
Before a second could pass
Didn't have enough time with you
To turn the hourglass
Pictures in my head, suddenly appear
Why'd you have to go away
It's all not very clear

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory
My legs are weak

When i close my eyes i see you
The dimples in your cheeks
I forgot to thank you for things
Cos i hadn't seen you in weeks
Woke up this morning
And hoped for a dream
But reality sat next to me
And forced me to believe
Knocked down too soon
Like a skittle on the lanes
The man took the wrong stop
From lifes's fast moving train

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory
My legs are weak

Funeral flowers, won't make me believe
They can carry out your casket
And i'll still expected see, you, you
Come round tomorrow
And tell me all your news
I don't ask for much from you
Sleep to my lullaby
Only give me one more chance
To say my last goodbye

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory
My legs are weak

Goodbye sweet angel
Sail away on teary seas
Tattooed the times we had, on my memory
My legs are weak
