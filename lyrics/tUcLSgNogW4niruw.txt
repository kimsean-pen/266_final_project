Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey"
And I love ya, baby
I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
Yeah just to hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby

Lookin' down from my orbit
Captain, can you get her to call me?
Though I may be far gone
Know that she's my only desire
Stay in her arms where the moon is shaded
Lose control and I might go crazy

Air is gone so now I'm never comin' home
Air is gone so now I'm never comin' home

Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey"
And I love ya, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby

Gravity is so crazy
It's the only way I ever could touch you
Captain, can you hear me?
I wish I was the one that told you
Stuck in moon dust, try to call my baby
Tried to reach her but now it's goin' hazy

Air is gone so now I'm never comin' home
Air is gone so now I'm never comin' home

Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey"
And I love ya, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby

Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey"
And I love ya, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
