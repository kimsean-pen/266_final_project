Here are all my songs

So come on Love, Draw Your Swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around

Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

The only

Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
So come on Love, Draw Your Swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around
The only
