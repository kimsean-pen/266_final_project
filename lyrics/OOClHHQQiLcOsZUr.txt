Talk shop
Short stop
I love you for the things you got that I'm not
Haven't got, I just haven't got
I hate it, start complaining
What you call it, keep from showing off

Dark days, afternoons
I love you for the ways that I can find to lose
So it goes, yeah, I pick and choose
I'll kiss you and I'll miss you
Then I'll try to feel something new

Woahhh oh oh oh ohhhh
I thought I worked this out
Ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohh
I thought we talked it out
Ohh oh oh ohh
I thought we talked it out
Oh oh ohh oh

Woahh oh oh ohhh ohh
Yeah I thought I worked this out
Woah oh oh ohh ohhhh
I thought we talked it out
Oh ohhh oh oh
I thought we talked it out
Oh ohhh oh oh

Sorry
Round and round and round with myself
I think I need some kind of help
Just want to empty out
Amore
These things are just too bad for your health
Yeah I need (some) help, need (some) help

Eight months, dried off
I'm running out of things to try and deconstruct
Talk shop, till there's nothing left
The little that I told you was as much as I could tell myself
And analyze, your every move
It's all the same so just push, push, push on through, emptied out
Every time you call, I'll miss it, you dismiss it
That is not what I meant at all

I thought I worked it out
Ohh oh oh ohhh ohhh
Yeah I thought I worked this out
Woahh oh ohh ohh ohh
I thought we talked it out
Ohh ohh ohh ohhhh
I thought we talked it out
Ohh ohhhh oh oh
Yeah I thought I worked it out
Woahh oh oh oh ohhh
I thought I worked this out
Oh oh ohhh oh ohhh
I thought we talked it out
Oh ohhhh oh oh
I thought we talked it out
Oh ohhhh oh oh

Sorry
Round and round and round with myself
I think I need some kind of help
Just want to empty out
Amore
These things are just too bad for your health
Yeah I need (some) help, I need (some) help
Talk shop, yeah it's a short stop
I love you for the things you got that I'm not
