You said the world was losing all its luster
You realized each day you're growing old
And the future stretches out there between us
And we decide if we want it to be cold

But don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian

It's sad now how the glass looks rather empty
The formulation of the elements makes you young
What's done is done, and there'll be no redemption
Just periodic tables to be learned

But don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian
Don't be a bad bohemian

Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive
Oh, don't let us die
While we are still alive
While we are still alive
