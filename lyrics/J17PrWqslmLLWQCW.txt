I am inauthentic
That's me not knowing who he is
I feel understands me
You don't love me
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
He mocks
Before me
I could have done something differently
You can't heal what you can't feel
Half beyond the consequence and
Hurt me must grieve
Let betrayal in this
Also I'd leave our dreams
And best beyond chance
What might have been
I embrace my feelings
Share them lonely
Last the only may are these food
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
You can't heal what you can't feel
