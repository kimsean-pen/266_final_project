I could talk for an hour
Today I'm not me
But don't you know how she is?

Honestly, how can I bother now?
To tell you the truth I ain't been sleepin' too early
Although I love to be equal
State the true love
If they're only moving it

Honestly, how can I bother now?
To tell you the truth I ain't been sleepin' too early
Although I love to be equal
Today it gets tough for learning to breathe
Today is not for me
If they learn I'm weak

I'm takin' up my time
Even though is satellites goin' in space
Still this is how I been
Even though you're still takin' up my time
Even though is satellites goin' in space
Still this is how I been

The future is slow coming
The future is slow, slow coming
The future is slow coming
The future is slow, slow coming
