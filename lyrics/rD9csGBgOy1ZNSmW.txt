Bleed into yesterday
A scene in retrograde
Fake apologies will never clean the mess you made
Weathered down and spent
You trace around the dents
Scratch a message in the side to not resuscitate

Sullen eyes, your skies are empty, there's no saving you
Life and death between your breath and barely breaking through
So precariously teetering between while in the waiting room
Praying for relief to break the skin and suffocate the pain
The second stretches into days
Fake blood is flowing through
Fake blood is flowing through your veins

You want a second chance
Extend an olive branch
Holding grudges like the gun that's in your other hand
Leave you in the past
The point of where you're at, is one-dimensional
Left up to circumstance

Trust is fraying at the ends, it's nothing new to me
Start to pick apart the husk of who you used to be
Rose-colored glasses reading off a teleprompter like a eulogy
Collected and fluently

Debased and faceless
Fade and corrode
Sway back and forth, forget that you're broken

Bleed into yesterday
A scene in retrograde
Fake apologies...

Break the skin and suffocate the pain
The second stretches into days
Fake blood is flowing through
Fake blood is flowing through
Fake blood is flowing through your veins
