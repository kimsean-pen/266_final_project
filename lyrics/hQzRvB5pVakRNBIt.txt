Damn this right girl fast but Im
taking it slow, coz when you livin large
You forget about direction.
I got this girl on my mind through my way home.
Coz when Im livin large
All I really want's affection
A little love and an attention
From you

Lifestyle changed when you told me that you want my love
Lifestyle changed when you told me Im the only one.
I used to play around but I found someone I can trust
So, my lifestyle changed when you told me Im the only one.

I used to play around, breaking hearts and hitting up phones
Coz I was living large
And now was looking for a trophy, yeah stupid

I'd say Im feeling good but honestly was feeling alone.
Coz when youre living large
The nights can often be lonely
But now I got my one and only
That's true.

Lifestyle changed when you told me that you want my love
Lifestyle changed when you told me Im the only one.
I used to play around but I found someone I can trust
So, my lifestyle changed when you told me Im the only one.

Now Im feeling sweet again
Blue and yellow start to blend
Something in my life was missing
Hoping that my heart would mend
I could feel it my chest
Looking right and looking left
Searching for the girl of dreams
Or was the dream just in my head

Nah, I wasn't dreaming you though
Nah, I was just losing control yeah
But when I saw you that night
I just knew it was right
And I needed to know yeah
Forward a couple of months
It's no shame to say I'm in love
I'm thanking the Lord up above
Finally able to to sing on this hook

Lifestyle changed when you told me that you want my love yeah yeah
Lifestyle changed when you told me Im the only one. Yeah yeah
I used to play around but I found someone I can trust
So, my lifestyle change when you told me Im the only one.
