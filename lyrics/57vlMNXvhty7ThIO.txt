If I could have all the women in the world
I would take this time to leave
The pressure's on and I'm not some kind of strong man
So take this thing from me
Don't give it a second thought
I can see you got better things to do
So just take your things and leave

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by

Late at night with the darkness here around me
I'm drinking all alone
Nothing here but my medicine to guide me
Since I've been on my own
Well, have you forgotten now?
Memories that continue to amaze me
Are all but over now

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by

Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
Hard times gone by
Hard times (Happiest days of my life)
