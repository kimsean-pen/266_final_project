I have witness my hearts addiction
Given gun to bear on child
And my Jesus calls for reparation
I have lived that firstborn failed
When the kiss tastes less than it is
Where once the heartfelt becomes:
"Why this burden?, why this trial?"
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
I have tasted that wretched end to gifts
At once so sweet and innocent
They grow to a ripe age for bloody, tragic sacrifice
They grow to an age where the lover forgets delights
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
I have failed in a fullest measure
Followed that myself of souls
Followed to the bitter end, through veils and untruths
And over you roughshod
Over you, roughshod
I have witnessed my hearts addiction
Given gun to bear on child
And my Jesus calls for reparation
I have lived that firstborn failed
When the kiss tastes less than it is
Where once the heartfelt becomes:
"Why this burden?, why this trial?"
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
Now she is, allegedly, a dance floor tragedy
For you and me...
Some kind of tragedy...
