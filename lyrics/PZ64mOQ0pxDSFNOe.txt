Will this night fulfill all the promises
And bury us in peace?
Will it leave us free and forgetful
Or at least bring some sleep?

Your eyes don't catch the little things
As they narrow on your fall
I'm checking your pulse 'cause you're so quiet
I'm kissing you but you don't feel it

Why do you do this to me?
Showing me all that I'm good for
Is to watch you sleep
As lifeless as an angel

She was the most beautiful cloud
That ever passed before the face of a girl
Seems like nothing is too good for this life
Yes, some things are too good for this world

And our names and our faces
Well, they're just spare change
In memory of a soul
Kept dropping spare change

Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?

In memory of a little girl
Who was far too much in love with the world
And who didn't really wanna stick around
For the end

Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?
Why won't you stay?
