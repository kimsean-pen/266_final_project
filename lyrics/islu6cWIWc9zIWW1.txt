I am become flesh
Omnipotent
Ubiquitous

Come to me
In burning dawn
In quickening of blood
In savage impulse

Come to me
Cloaked in fear
With ideology
Bare and reckless

Trading skin
I'll thrive within
Your inner landscapes
Of despair
Malicious Gaze
To veil
Satiate
To shield you from fear

I am bias weaponized
A talisman for the powerless
Ideations To enshrine
A Razor-edged crucifix
Blackened lungs
Infallible tongues
Canonized
To wield the sword of judgement

But don't you know
your gods bow to me
And the road to salvation
Is paved with your bones
And no spirit animates your soul
But the one that I create
Dictate
Disseminate
Pervasive and uncontrolled

Soothsayer
Truthsayer
I am the master here
Fulfill your dreams
Submit to destiny
Your path is clear
Soothsayer
I am become flesh
The architect of your end
