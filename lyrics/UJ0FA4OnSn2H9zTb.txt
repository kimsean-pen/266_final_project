Verse:
Get your head out your dreams, they would say
Ooh, shot me down time and time again
Stubborn girl she refuses to change
Catch a cloud but you can't pin me down

CHORUS:
Girl, they won't believe it
I finally found some sweet through the bitters of life
Girl, they won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside

Verse:
Took a minute but I caught it (they won't believe it)
Mmmm, now I'm in love in a different way
Tell me who could have thought this would satisfy me
All I need is a kiss from a melody

CHORUS:
Ooh Ooh
Girl they won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
That I've finally found some sweet through the bitters of life
Oh Oh
Girl they won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside
Ooh
Girl they won't believe it
I've finally found something sweet through the bitters of life
Ooh Ooh
Girl you won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside
Ooh you won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
I finally found some sweet through the bitters of life

Oh oh, say girl they won't believe it

Say it now (ooh, ooh)
Say with me (ooh, ooh) (x3)
