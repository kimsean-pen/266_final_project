If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know oh why
If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know
Oh why

Inside, a sudden loss of air
Confessions in despair
Oh why
Oh why
This love is whispering
As distant sirens ring
Goodbye

And if I should never get the chance to let you know
Listen to me now, how we loved you so
The first time, the last time, a lifetime ago
Fallen, you were calling, you, it's time to go

If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know
Oh why

If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know
Oh why

Fallen, you were calling, you, it's time to go
Fallen, you were calling, you, it's time to go
