A little less conversation,
A little more action please
All this aggravation ain't
Satisfactionin' me
A little more bite and
A little less bark
A little less fight and
A little more spark
Close your mouth and open up
Your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby

Baby close your eyes
And listen to the music
Dig to the summer breeze
It's a groovy night and
I can show you how to use it
Come along with me
And put your mind at ease

A little less conversation,
A little more action please
All this aggravation ain't
Satisfactionin' me
A little more bite and
A little less bark
A little less fight and
A little more spark
Close your mouth and open up
Your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby

Come on baby
I'm tired of talkin'
Grab your coat and
Let's start walkin'

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Don't procrastinate,
Don't articulate
Girl it's gettin' late, gettin'
Upset waitin' around

A little less conversation,
A little more action please
All this aggravation ain't
Satisfactionin' me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Just close your mouth and
Open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me

Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me
