Oh hi, I did not recognise those eyes in that dress you wore.
Your thighs are stuck in my mind and I'd like to carry them home.

Release, this urge needs feeding.

Now that's done, was it worth the fun?
Tell me, could I be the one for you?
I don't think I thought this through...
So see you around.

I never meant for this, you know I'm damaged goods.

Lately I've listed the reasons why I can't move on,
and why I sleep in the house that we lived in for over three years now.
Staring at paintings recounting the places we'd been together.
I tried to escape but I can't seem shake all these pictures (of us).

The light up on the desk still burning bright.
The way I'm dressed suggests i left it on all night.
I'd probably done the same the night or three before.
Another crowded thought for clouded minds.
Of broken promises I'd made a million times,
On how to let go, breathe, and do more exercise.

It's getting colder as the days merge into one.
I best just lay my head and pray for morning sun.

So from this moment on he started drifting
And dreamed of colours that he'd never seen before.
In the all the types fruit he'd ever tasted.
The air was warm the sky was clear of water.
Beyond the lake were trees far as the eye could see.
This was the place we used to swim together.

Those things up on your chest look mighty comfy.
I may just lay my head and wait for morning sunbeams.

Morning.
The wait is over.
So in we go.
To find a home.
