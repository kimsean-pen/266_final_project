Honey lookin' good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-four, she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural

Mommy lookin' good from her head to her feet
She forty-four but she still lookin' sweet
And you can tell her daughter ain't even at her peak
'Cause her mama lookin' so hot, packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank your mama
She make me steamin' like a sauna
Look out, look out, here she come now
Look out, look out, here she come

Girl, your beauty is a sensation
You sittin' in, in a temptation
I never knew a girl could shine like a sun
You better thank your mama 'cause girl you the one
We should have a date of celebration
Celebratin' God's best creation

Every day should be your birthday, hun
You make the guys all dumb

Maybe 'cause your beauty keep the dudes on sprung
Wonderin' just where you got that from
