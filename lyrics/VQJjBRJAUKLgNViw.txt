Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world is seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
But, all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
Though, by a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Whoa-hoh, whoa-oh, yeah

Yes, yes

Oooh, oh baby, baby, I been cryin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, there's no denyin', there's no denyin'
Oooh yes, baby baby, I've been flyin', oh yeah
Lord, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no denyin'
Here's another one to ya

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find now, where I been, yeah

Pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert screen
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
'Long the straits of fear
Wha-oh, wha-oh, yeah
Whoa-hoh, whoa-hoh, ohh-oh-oh-hooooh

Well, when I want, baby, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, baby, when I see the way you stay, yeah

Well I'm down, when I'm near
Please, please, tell me where I've been
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Whooooooo, yeah-ee yeah
Whoo, yeah, I can take you there, take you there
Oh, my baby, ooh my baby, let me take you there, oh-oh
Ooh darlin', yeah, darlin', yeah

Tuadon, tuadid, oh yeah
Suanon, suadid
Suanon, suadid
Suanon, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah

Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel,
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel

Suanon, suadid
Suanon, suadid
Suanon, yeahhh

Thanks a lot, see ya later
