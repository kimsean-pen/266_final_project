Take me home, somewhere safe
Lean on me, saving grace

Such a light, where you are
Something new, forest fire

I'll miss this when it's gone
Let's not waste life, come on
I'll miss this when it's gone
Let's not waste life
Come on, come on

We all sit next to the fire, we watch you burn
Oh we all sit next to the fire and watch you burn
