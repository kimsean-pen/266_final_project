The laughing beaut's are laughing at you
Their Georgetown eyes smile goodbye
And I already see everyone in this
Dark and dreary bay of dreams

Some you love
It's right away
The Carolina parties stay
The South River racks, they're freezing in this
Dark and dreary bay of dreams

And I'm remiss and I am reminding
I'm remiss

The laughing beaut's are laughing at you
Sprawled on the floor beside the bed
And I've already had everyone in this bay of dreams
So have your way with me

And I'm remiss and I am reminding
I'm remiss

Stay in my veins
I am deserving
Stay in my veins
I'm tired and swerving
