Everywhere is freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich, feed the poor
'Till there are no rich no more

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you
