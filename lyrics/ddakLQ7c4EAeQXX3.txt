See my face when I slide through
Every place i will find you
Every time you fell apart
Girl I see it in the scars
Baby hold my hand
Let me be your man
Let me take you away from the cold
Baby be my diamonds and gold
Wander through the dead with you caught up in my head
Thinking Ima flip and fill my brain
with lead, Ima end my life without you
Baby lets just see what these clouds do
I'm not so perfect baby yeah you worth it, come right here

Girl let me see you work it
Now we closing curtains, come right here
Don't you know you're so sexy the way you move your body up and down
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are but you're no where to be found

I tried to protect you
From my hand you left
You broke my heart right there,
all I do stare, no you'll never fucking care

I thought you were different
Telling me what is and I was wrong
I never thought of you as ignant now
I'm getting lifted, you're in my soul
Baby I'm about to die
Baby wanna watch me die
Baby don't you wanna know why
Didn't even try
