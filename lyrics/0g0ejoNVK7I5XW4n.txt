Your eyes tend to remind me so frequently
The cold and distant light of these heavenly bodies
I know too well that I'm the only one to blame, I'm sorry
I knew where we'd be led but I just kept walking

Now, I see the light, the fire devouring the coal
Now I'm used to singing with the monster I've become
To dream of the gold in the river
Oh, the nights have become longer to stand
And the dawn is harder to wake each day

These nights have stolen the best of me
And what is left should never be yours
I'm fading with the gleam of a far-off firmament

My soul weeps an ocean I can't seem to drain
I'm drowning in these waters
Sink as deep as I can sink
I know too well that I'm the only to blame
I'm sorry
I knew where I'd be led

I've spent my whole life
Dreaming of a brighter light
But I doubt you can ever realize
That all these songs to call-off the jinx
Might be everything this world has left me

Now, I see the light, the fire, devouring the call
Now I'm used to singing with the monster I've become
To dream of the gold in the river
Oh, the nights have become longer to stand
The dawn is harder to wake each day

I can't seem to live with these dreams of you
Fuck
