I'm gon' suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Burned and buried, all I carried

All my evil through a needle
As if pulled through the eye
What was and what will
They're all gone

Don't sweat it
Thread it to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
To the rest of
The rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture
Bury it all away, bury it all away

Try to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real
I won't waste it, I turn to face it
I'd sharpen the knife
Then used it to bone, made it dull

Tried explaining unexplained
Got caught in the plan
All this talking at once
I've been giving my love away
To the things that tear it apart
I'm gonna suture up my future

Thread it to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
To the rest of
The rest of the life that you've got
Tie the loose ends
Bury it all away
It's like there's
It's like there's
