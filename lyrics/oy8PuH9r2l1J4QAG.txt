from the time we were young
we were wild eyed dreamers
now we cautiously raise our eyes
the season has turned from one to the next

we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now

there's a burden we all must shoulder
so come on and put your back to the load
tears won't help but to water the ground
nothing will grow, so weep til you're dry
or til you run dry

we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
we are wide awake now
wide awake now
wide awake now
