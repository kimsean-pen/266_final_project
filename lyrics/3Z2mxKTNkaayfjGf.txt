On the eve of their death
they are baptized
in the unholy waters of Bodom
With no hint of the torture awaiting
to greet them at the break of dawn

For the reaper wants more...

When the calm is setting in
we'll watch it swiftly disappear
Too many years of silence
soon he's bound to reappear

The Reaper
is calling for you to come home
With the thrust of a switchblade
on the grip of a madman
And the waters of Bodom
turn a blood shade of red
As the Children Of Bodom
take their last breath.

(solo)

When the calm is setting in
we'll watch it swiftly disappear
Too many years of silence
soon he's bound to reappear
