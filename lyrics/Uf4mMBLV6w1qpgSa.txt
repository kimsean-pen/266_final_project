I guess I just don't get your plan
Are you trying to smash my world up
I am trying to understand
You say you know me not truly who I am
You stress the modifier while I stress the adjective

But you're in your car
And I'm on my motorcycle
I lay on the floor
Naturally bite your ankle

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

It's like the blind leading the blind
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine sometimes you gotta close your eyes
if you Wanna see the light
It's not my style to feel strong
Strong enough to wanna fight
Fight that I would probably lose but in the end
I would survive
I would survive

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

Ladies and gentlemen
The DJ just threw up
On the dance floor
Party is over, time to go
It's time to go

You were thinking about leaving
You we're thinking about walking away
The whole time sleeping
In the jail right next to me

I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind
I laugh till I cry
I party all of the time
I must have liked it a couple years ago
But at some point I changed my mind

But you're in your car
And I'm on my motorcycle
I lay on the floor
Naturally bite your ankle

Ladies and gentlemen
The DJ just threw up
On the dance floor
Party is over
It's time to go
