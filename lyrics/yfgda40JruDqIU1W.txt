Is my heart breaking
Or do I have one at all
Am I feeling or faking
I don't know anymore
What's in the back of my head?
It's just like white noise
Or a demon under his breath
Telling me it's time to dance with death
Some nights I'm possessed

No I never
See it coming
Till it holds me down like an anchor
No I never
Hear the drumming
Till I'm too far into the rapture
I wish I could be brave

Death is in the air, death is in the air, oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream

Death is in the air, death is in the air, oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream

I feel the ache of the waiting
I feel the tar in my lungs
For every debt that I'm paying
I'm no further along
What if I give up the ghost
And just become one myself
Dunno why I'm holding my breath
Cuss they all let me down in the end
And I just forgive them

No I never
See it coming
Till I lose myself to the anger
No I never
See it coming
Till The crying turns into laughter
I wish I could be brave

Death is in the air death is in the air oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream

Death is in the air, death is in the air, oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream

Death is in the air, death is in the air, oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream

Death is in the air, death is in the air, oh
Do it or don't I never know so I
Keep dancing on a pipe dream
Keep laughing when I wanna scream
