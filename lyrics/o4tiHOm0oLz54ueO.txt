The warning of dawning days
It's all awful

We know what they all say
The warning of dawning days
And so we, go on in our own way

We know what they all say
The warning of dawning days
It's all awful

We know what they all say
The warning of dawning days
And so we, go on in our own way

And so we, go on in our own way
