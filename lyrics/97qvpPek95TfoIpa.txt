I know it's getting late
But if you'd like to talk a little more
Well that's alright with me
I'm feeling kinda tired
But it ain't exactly beating down my door
Now just why could this be

And I know i shouldn't say
But you've been acting strange the last few days
And this has made me think
Your pills have cost too much
And you can't feel them working anymore
So pour them down the sink
yeah
And listen to me

All you gotta do

Is baby kick off your shoes
And lay down
Climb up here with me
And let's forget about sleep
And lay down
Why hide your face from me
Why turn away
All I wanna do is pull you closer and say

I'm feeling kinda tired
But it ain't exactly beating down my door

Now just why could this be
yeah yeah
Will you listen to me
yeah
All you gotta do
Is baby kick off your shoes
And lay down
Climb up here with me
And let's forget about sleep
just lay down with me
Lay down next to me
Lay down with me
I know I shouldn't say
But you've been acting strange the last few days
And this has made me think
(you know I'm not for thinkin)
Your pills have cost too much
And you can't feel them working anymore
So pour them all right down the sink
