We cut our teeth on sadness
We hunt our sorrows down
We fought the nights so sleepless
We made our beds on the cold hard ground
Seasons come and go
Traditions rise and fall
We watch with hunter's eyes
We found the place to call our own

What we have, we hunt
What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die
Darkness never breaks

You built your bastions
Of ivory and pride
We see your gates but do not knock
We stay out in the wild

What we have, we hunt
What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die
Darkness never breaks

Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
And we're clawing at the walls
Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
And we're clawing at the walls
We're clawing at the walls, yeah

I see a kingdom
Of closed minds and shallow hearts
So tell me this
Would you fall in line or rip it all apart?
Yeah

What we have, we hunt
What we kill, we keep
Shadows never die
Darkness never breaks

Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
And we're clawing at the walls
Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
And we're clawing at the walls
This is the hour of the wolf
We're clawing at the walls
This is the hour of the wolf

Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
And we're clawing at the walls
Hey, this is the sound of violence
Hey, these are the songs of war
Hey, we are everything you fear
