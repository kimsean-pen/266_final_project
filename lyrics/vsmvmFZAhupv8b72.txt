Girl
You have no faith in medicine
Oh Girl
You have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh girl

Is there a way to find a cure for this
Implanted in a pill
Just the name upon the bottle
Which determines if it will

Is the problem that you're allergic
To a well familiar name
Do you have a problem with this one
If the results are the same

Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh girl,
You have no faith in medicine
Oh girl,
You have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine

But girl,
You have no faith in medicine
Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh girl

Well strip the bark right off the tree
And just hand it this way
Don't even need a drink of water
To make the headache go away
Give me a sugar pill
And watch me just rattle
Down the street

Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Oh girl,
You have no faith in medicine
Oh girl,
You have no faith in medicine
Oh girl
Oh girl
Oh girl
Oh girl
