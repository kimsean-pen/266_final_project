Truth
The truth is that I never smy shadow
Every day it's trying to trick me into doing battle
Calling out "faker" only get me rattled
Want to pull me back behind the fence with the cattle
Building your lenses
Digging your trenches
Put me on the front line
Leave me with a dumb mind
With no defenses
But your defense is
If you can't stand to feel the pain then you are senseless

Since this
I've grown up some
Different kind of fighter
And when the darkness comes, let it inside you
And your darkness is shining
My darkness is shining
Have faith in myself
Truth

I've seen a million numbered doors on the horizon
Now which is the future you're choosing before you gone dyin'?
I'll tell you about a secret I've been undermining
Every little lie in this world comes from dividing
Say you're my lover, say you're my own homie,
Tilt my chin back, slit my throat, take a bath in my blood, get to know me
All out of my secrets
All my enemies are turning into my teachers.
Because, lights blinding, no way dividing what's yours or mine
When everything's shining
You darkness is shining
My darkness is shining
Have faith in ourselves
Truth

Yes I'm only loving only trying to only love.
Yes I'm only lonely loving trying to only love and feeling lonely only loving.
Yes I'm only loving only trying to only love.
Yes I'm only lonely loving trying to only love and feeling lonely only loving.
Swear to God I'm only loving, you say it ain't loving ain't loving ain't loving my loving
But I'm only loving only loving swear to God I'm only loving
Only loving only loving only loving only loving
I'm only loving only trying to only love
You say it ain't loving ain't loving ain't loving my loving
But I'm only loving only loving only loving only loving the truth.
