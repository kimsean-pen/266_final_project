So much pressure, why so loud?
If you don't like my sound you can turn it down, I gotta roll
And I walk it alone
Uphill battle, I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious I get braggadocious, I'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top

You talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah, sh-
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I "eff" up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes and I
Can't colour inside the lines 'cause
I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece and I
I wanna hang with the greats, got a
Way to go, but it's worth the wait, no
You haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece and I oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I, I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I, I

Those who mind don't matter, those who matter don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing then I'll leave you behind
Don't need a flash
And I ain't livin like that
They talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah, sh-
Roll with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I "eff" up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes and I
Can't colour inside the lines 'cause
I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece and I
I wanna hang with the greats, got a
Way to go, but it's worth the wait, no
You haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece and I oh oh oh oh oh oh I, I
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I, I

I still fall on my face sometimes and I
Can't colour inside the lines 'cause
I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Masterpiece, masterpiece, yeah

I still fall on my face sometimes and I
Can't colour inside the lines 'cause
I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece and I
I wanna hang with the greats got a
Way to go, but it's worth the wait, no
You haven't seen the best of me

I'm still working on my masterpiece and I oh oh oh oh oh oh I, I
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I, I
(Still working on, still working on)
Still working on my masterpiece
