I have been crazy
But that's just alright, alright
I have been lonely
But that's just alright, alright

My feelings I don't
hide them, hide them, hide them
Inside they keep on
Burning, burning, burning
Your feelings you shouldn't
Hide them, Hide them, hide them
From me.
Nah na na nooo 'right

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it

I don't feel so unfortunate
But that's just alright, alright
I have been treated so badly baby
But that's just alright, alright

My feelings I don't
hide them, hide them, hide them
Cause' inside they keep on
Burning, burning, burning
Your feelings you shouldn't
Hide them, Hide them, hide them
From me.
Nah na na nooo 'right

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it

Every man has been broken
Every woman too
The reason I think I'm something special baby Is 'cos I was never broken by you

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
