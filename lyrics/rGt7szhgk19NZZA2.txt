Somebody is gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody is gonna come undone
It's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night

Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Lord I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
Nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all last all summer long
Sometimes before the sun comes up
Radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Lord I know

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Heartache baby

Somebody is gonna hurt someone
Somebody
Before the night is through
Somebody is gonna come undone
It's nothing we can do
Everybody
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Umm hmm
Everybody wants to take a little chance

Make it come out right
Gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know

Let's go
We can feel around the bushes
We can hit down to the ball
We can leave it in the parking lot
But either way there's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Oh, I know
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Woooooohoooooo
Break my heart
