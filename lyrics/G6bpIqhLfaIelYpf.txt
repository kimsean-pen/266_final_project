You hold high the banner of self-deceit
Encaged in the dogmas of life, you join the elite

My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more
My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more

You mock the weak for not giving you their trust
In your world of make believe, where statues turn to dust

My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more
My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more

You walk through what is me
Stare blind - cannot see
Your thoughts flee to a different land
They are free, but but you are bound.

Silenced forever, the walls are closing in
The keys to our damnation - burial within

My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more
My Judas-windows stay shut - shut forever more
