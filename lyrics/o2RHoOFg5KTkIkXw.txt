Sunday mornin' wake up early
Skip church service to find my Jesus
I know it sounds so sacrilegious
But I just don't belong in a place like that
I love the cause but not the act

'Cause Jesus was a friend and not a judge
He loved the sinners
As much as he loved the little ones
That man was love and not an act

I sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, I'm set free

Sunday mornin' wake up early
Skip church service to find true meaning
I know it sounds so disappointing
But I just don't belong in a place like that
I love the cause but not the act

And I sing hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, I'm set free
