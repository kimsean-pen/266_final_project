I feel frozen and lonely
I wanna wake up happy enough
Welcoming sun in my bedroom
Maybe northern California
I need a dose of the sea
Sleep on the beach just for
A week with no trouble
It's all irrational but somewhere
There's a green and white
And blue flag waving

I wanna build Cascadia
California in the sunlight
I wanna build Cascadia
Oregon Shores would be alright

I care about policy in increments,
It's seasonal
I care about people and
Their loved ones, I do
I care about the colour
Of your eyes as much as
I can see the way
You elegantly move

I wanna build Cascadia
California in the sunlight
I wanna build Cascadia
Oregon Shores would be alright
I wanna build Cascadia
California in the spotlight
I wanna build Cascadia
Snoqualmie and the Columbia

I'm fearful of the consequence
Of solving all your problems
I'm happy here
I know it's real
It's common ground
It's evergreen
It's mass appeal
It's underground
It's what I know
It's lost and found
It's seasonal

I wanna build Cascadia
California in the sunlight
I wanna build Cascadia
Oregon Shores would be alright
I wanna build Cascadia
California in the spotlight
I wanna build Cascadia
Snoqualmie and the Columbia

I wanna build Cascadia
Snoqualmie and the Columbia
