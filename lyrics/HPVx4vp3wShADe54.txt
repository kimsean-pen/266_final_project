Leave the wasting world behind us
We will make it out alive
Leave the waiting world behind us
We will not look back this time

Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape
Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape

Silent the sirens
Quiet the tone
While we are sleeping
Will the Earth turn outside
We will not look back this time
Don't be afraid
We will not look back this time
Don't be afraid

Tremors below us
Murmor of ground
Hold on to lanterns

Leave the wasting world behind us
We will make it out alive
Leave the waiting world behind us
We will not look back this time
We will not look back this time
(We will not look back this time)

Leave the wasting world behind
Leave the wasting world behind
Leave the wasting world behind
Leave the wasting world behind

Don't be afraid
We will not look back this time
We will not look back this time

Leave the wasting world behind us
We will make it out alive
Leave the waiting world behind us
We will not look back this time
We will not look back thisâ€“
