Way on down to your home
I unravel like a bow
Saw your face in the wind
And I'll never go there again
Way on down, down
I am a river
Coming over your head
Coming over your head

Did I change your mind?
I was a floater on the ground
Singing a lover's song
I was higher than a skyscraper

Way on down to your home
I unravel like a bow
Saw your face in the wind
And I'll never go there again
Way on down, down
I am a river
Coming over your head
Coming over your head

Did I change your mind?
I was a floater on the ground
Singing a lover's song
I was higher than a skyscraper
