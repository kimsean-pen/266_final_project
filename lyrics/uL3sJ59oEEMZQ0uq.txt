He could fall and she could weep
But as holy are her feet and hard with mention
But dear they may not speak
We fell tight when there is tension and their eyes could make us weak

And his heart was full of fire at the man he had become
And his soul was seldom higher with the falsities of fun
He could embrace sweet desire as in moments as they pass
But he feared it ever more, when he saw it didn't last

We walk up Holland avenue
and watch the rich as they consume
Their product made our hearts exude emptiness unrivalled by
The hunger that I could control
And he'd pray up to his God that he might save his soul

But the grey in this city is too much to bear
The grey in this city is too much to bear
And I believe you are meant to be seen but not to be understood

And I want to be held those eyes
I want to be held those eyes

You'll work your thumbs till they're sore
And you'll work my heart till it's raw
and you'll call and you'll call but you'll never be told
and I'll fall and I'll fall and I'll fall
and I'll fall and I'll fall and I'll fall

We are basic lies
We are basic lies

It's going to be pretty tough when you leave
You'll help to take a little part of me
To make sure you don't treat yourself mean
And I want to see all that you'll see

And we are basic lies
And we are basic lies
