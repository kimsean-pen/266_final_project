Busy bee, finding peace in a schedule
Silly goose, I am me, you can't ridicule
Tryna act like you past, but you regular
Still attached, on my ass, can't get rid of you
Lovestruck, bossed up, and I guess you just
Mad, huh? Shordey pressed he ain't feeling her
Too bad, so sad, what's that got to do with me?
I'm going hard in the stu', drop a couple of bands
You going hard for a dude that ain't even your man
Diff' between me and you is just too substantial
To get into
I mean, yeah, yeah, I make it look simple
Man of God, but I'll have him thinking all sinful
Oh my God, I would think you'd be a bit tasteful
If you tryna imitate, how you still hateful?

Oh, 'cause
You a cornball and I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
Thought you all cash
But you fucking with a star, yeah
Thought you all class
Really caught me off-guard, yeah
You a cornball and I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
Thought you all cash
But you fucking with a star, yeah
Thought you all class
Really caught me off-guard, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde

Yeah, I move fast, getting that bag
I don't get mad, I just get bad
Champagne bubbling, chugging it
If he stuck in it, chill, I'm succulent
You dickriding and I cannot see the fun in it
That's why I'm popping off while you plummeting
That's why I'm getting calls
While you summonin'â€”summoning
Hello???
Weirdos think I want something when I'm showing love
But I'm really 'bout to run shit, what you scared of?
Worried 'bout mans, I'm just worried 'bout bands
If you a lame bih, then that's out of my hands

Yeah, you a cornball and I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
Thought you all cash
But you fucking with a star, yeah
Thought you all class
Really caught me off-guard, yeah
You a cornball and I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
Thought you all cash
But you fucking with a star, yeah
Thought you all class
Really caught me off-guard, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde, yeah
I'm avant-garde, yeah, I'm avant-garde
