Can't take another second of this hell
Making up stories and saying I'm better off dead
They want me to be this perfect thing
Like everything is fine
Like everything is ok

But I'm not close to perfect
I'm not close to sane
I'm not the one to worship
And I'm not the one to blame
But you made up your mind
And put me on your stage
Just take it all back
I'm not the king of anything

Can't take another second of this pain
I've tried to be the person all of you want me to be
Maybe I'm ok with who I am
I know I'm just a child but I'll try to be a man

But I'm not close to perfect
I'm not close to sane
I'm not the one to worship
And I'm not the one to blame
But you made up your mind
And put me on your stage
Just take it all back
I'm not the king of anything
