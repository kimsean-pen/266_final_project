There's a star in the east
Over pyramids, at Giza.
Where there once lived a girl,
She ruled the world.
Then down the Nile,
He came with a smile.

He was a King,
She was a Queen
Under the moonlight.
Your eyes won't believe,
What your mind can't conceive.

Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt,
Nights over Egypt.

Incense and myrrh.
Girls that swirl,
To the music.
Nights over Egypt.

Women Fellahin,
Wear veils to be seen,
By no one.
Take a caravan,
Across the Sudan.
Saharan facade,
It's just a mirage.

Oasis in the sand,
Where life once began,
Under the moonlight.
Your eyes won't believe,
What your mind can't conceive.
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.

Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.
Nights over Egypt.
