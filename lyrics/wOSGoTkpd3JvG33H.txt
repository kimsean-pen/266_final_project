She asked me
Are you lonely
And she took me
To the back seat
And she told me
She told me don't breathe

I'll be the boy you be the girl I'll be the girl you be the boy
I'll be the girl
(wonderful feeling)
I'll be the boy you be the girl I'll be the girl you be the boy
I'll be the boy
(Conderful feeling)

Chain me, chain me, chain me, chain me

I'll be the boy you be the boy
Until I see a broken mirror in the sun

I'll be the boy you be the girl I'll be the girl you be the boy
I'll be the girl (Come up to feel it)
And in the golden light the sun began to set
On her red lips and her words

Chain me, chain me, chain me, chain me
Chain me, chain me, chain me, chain me

She asked me
Do you feel free
And she told me
She told me don't breathe

Ahahh
Ahahh

I'll be the boy you be the girl I'll be the girl you be the boy
And in the golden light the sun began to set
On her red lips and her words
