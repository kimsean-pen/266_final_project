I ran away from myself,
But I don't like to think about it
I became someone else
Which doesn't actually require a lot of thought
Just a little noise and decay
Well I'll tell you now, I can't wait
So sick being of somewhere that I can't stand
Chipping away at the days
Think I'd be better off at a distant planet
2000 light years away

I fell in love in the rain, but I forget about it
I gave up all of my pain
Well I guess I don't really need it
Beyond the seas and highways
None of the stars know my name
'Cause I'm sick of being someone that I can't stand
Chipping away at my brain
Think I'd be better off at a distant planet
2000 light years away
