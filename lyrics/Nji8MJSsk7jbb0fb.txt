Sometimes, the congregation takes the other side
An inquisition of familiar lies
A grave distraction from a quiet rise
Sometimes, the congregation can't make up its mind
Incarceration creeps up from behind
The implication is its own device
In the middle of a synod fight
Sometimes, the congregation can't be satisfied
Can't be bothered with the ways and times
Generations like the ways and time
