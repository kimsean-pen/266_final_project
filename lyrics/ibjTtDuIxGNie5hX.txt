I was a man
Who always played around in love
So quick to take
But so afraid to give enough

But now, I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
And time can't take away

I was a girl
Who trusted no one with my heart
And the dreams that young girls dream
Were just vanishing in the dark

But now, I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
They say

That I will (I will)
Take you (take you) forever
And there will never be anyone else in my heart but you
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you

Now, my touch belongs to you
And I will always be your best friend
Now, my secrets are safe with you
And the magic will never end
Now, you are the one
And heaven will only know
What only our eyes can say
They say

That I will (I will)
Take you (take you) forever
And there will never be anyone else in
my heart but you (in my heart but you)
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you
Anyone else but you

And I will take you forever (oh yes
I will, yes I will, take you forever)
And there will never be anyone else in
my heart but you (in my heart but you)
And I will take you forever (yes I will)
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else, anyone else
And I will (I will)
Take you (take you) forever (take you forever)
And there will never be anyone else in my heart but you
And I will...
