I've felt better
I've been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light

The air is so cold here
It's so hard to breath
We better take cover
Will you cover me?

We appeared with the northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached

And you know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down
Not today

The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me

We appeared with the northern lights
Beyond this broken
I picture us in another life
Where we are simple stars
