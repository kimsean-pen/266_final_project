You can drive, you don't even know me
I don't mind, I'll just take the back seat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Get in line, just another repeat
Keep in time, we're moving to the new beat
Close my eyes, 'cause I just need to rest now
I'm so tired, from always running in and out

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

You can drive, I don't even know me
Take your time, it's only for the lonely
It's in your eyes, and I don't need to rest now
I'm alright, it's never hard to figure out

Find the time, we don't need a repeat
Keep in mind, we're moving to a new beat
A rise in tide, out there is the feeling
I'm so tired, but only when I'm breathing

Of all the places I have gone
And all the faces I have known
They never seem to feel like home
And now it's time for letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go

I hope to see your smile again
But some day's far too long of a road

The art of letting go
I may be setting myself up to have to
Walk the streets alone
For letting go
