Pound for pound and cheek to cheek
Cheek paler than a lamp light
Take me down to light the box
And play super Scalextric

And turn this
Darkness
Into light
And I'll turn too bright
Forget all the hype

I'll need heart and I'll need courage
We all need...

Toe to toe, there's nowhere to go
So I'm tiptoeing around it
I held you down and I held my own
And now I feel like I'm floating

So turn to this
Head on
And keep on
Keeping on

I'll need heart and you'll need courage
We all need time

So let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us

Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it

Don't you know, nobody knows
If there's somebody waiting
So you'll hold yourself up and you'll hold yourself in
And then pray that you are growing

And turn to this
Darkness
You turn it into light, and you'll turn too bright
Forget all the hype

You'll need heart and I'll need courage
We all need time

So let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us
Let's make time work for us

Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about it
Let's take our precious time about

'cause we'll need heart and we'll need courage
In these times
We'll need heart and we'll need courage
In these times

Because time can mean so much
Are you still mine?
