I like to stick to walls
Observing conversations and lifting them when they fall
I am a fire escape, my spine's made of iron
My heart pumps that old red paint

Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

I see the seasons change
All the young faces come and replaces the dying ones
Sit out on Lexington and Vine
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs

Save yourself, save your yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself

Los Angeles I've been waiting for you
To pick yourself up and change
The city you've made this ocean and sand
Its founded on liars and self made men

I've seen the dreamers find their legs
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags
'Cause I am a fire escape, my spine's made of iron
My heart pumps that old red paint
Save yourself, save yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
