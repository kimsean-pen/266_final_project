Why so many would have to pay for just one man to stand his way
Why so often no one denies primacy of one over others
Is there not enough self-consciousness in everyone to make him real
Haven't we all inside of us what makes a man worth being one

I wish that i could take you by the hand
Lead you through blurry views and
Give you access to your own self

Between a Caesar and nothing there are plenty of ways to be
Life is full of differences and so should be society
Hope is a fuel we get for free while fear demands security
So why are those two always used as if they were power tools

I wish that i could take you by the hand
Lead you through blurry views and
Give you access to your own self

Sleeping with eyes wide open
While someone else is getting in charge
To lead the way in his own way

I wish that i could take you by the hand
Lead you through blurry views and
Give you access to your own self

I wish that i could take you by the hand
Lead you through blurry views and
Give you access to your own self
