Soon I will be here no more
You'll hear the tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle's cry
The bear within will never lay to rest

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears

White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace 'n war 'n death

Wandering on Horizon Road...
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have been since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Wandering on Horizon Road...
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have been since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Hanhepi iyuha mi ihanbla ohinni yelo
Òn sunkmanitutankapi hena, sunkawakanpi watogha hena,
Oblaye t'ankapi oihankesni hena
T'at'epi kin asni kiyasni he akatanhanpi iwankal
Oblaye t'anka kin osicesni mitakuyepi òn

Makoce kin wakan wakan Tanka kin òn
Miwicala ohinni - Hanhepi iyuha kici - Anpetu iyuha kici yelo
Mi yececa hehaka kin yelo, na ni yececa sunkmanitutankapi
Kin ka mikaga wowasaka isom
Uncinpi tuweni nitaku keyas ta k'u

Unwakupi e'cela e wiconi wanji unmakainapi ta yelo
Anpetu waste e wan olowan le talowan winyan ta yelo
Unwanagi pi lel e nita it'okab o'ta ye
Untapi it'okab o'ta
Na e kte ena òn hanska ohakap ni itansni a'u nita ni ihanke yelo.
