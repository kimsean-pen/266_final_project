Take my hand
You'll, never find
Another, quite like mine
If you look
You'll see that I'm
A lonely one
I lost my soul
Deep inside
Oh And it's so
Black And cold, deep inside

Sistine smile
You'll, never know
The trap it's set
And if you did
You'd, never look
Into it's eyes again
lost my soul
Deep inside
Oh And it's so
Black And cold, deep inside

And The sun don't shine
The wind won't blow
When you go hide
and Without your love
I'm lonely
Deep inside

Take my hand
You'll, never find
Another, quite like it
And If you did
You'll see that I'm
A lonely one
I lost my soul
Deep inside
Oh And it's so
Black And cold, deep inside

And The sun don't shine
The wind won't blow
When you go hide
and Without your love
I'm lonely
Deep inside
