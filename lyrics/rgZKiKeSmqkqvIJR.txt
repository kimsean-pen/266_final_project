Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting, long enough for our lastbreath of life.
You stare at nothing, right through me, at times resembling the Devil's concubine.
And me, I am the idol that would long to caress our eyes until they would open no more.
I would comfort you if I only could, but as we all know, by now... I am just thin air.
Unaware as you are of my presence, you are losing yourself.
Hiding within The Amen Corner...
