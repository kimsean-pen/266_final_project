all I see is fading light
all around are whispers
it's damp outside, a chill tonight
my fingers all are blisters
what you see, I can't explain
my reason is to glisten
all I see, I can't contain
if you forget to listen
can't you listen
just be still
it's almost over
a thousand blisters
on my tongue
it's already over
it's clear outside, the stars are bright
all the while we listen
I've split into my thoughts of you
sugar coats, it glistens
all I need is what you have
as it drips on down your fingers
coats your lips in its sweet taste
of lemon flavored kisses
