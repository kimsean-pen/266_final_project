You let me into your life unaware
That there was magic and fire in the night
In lovin' I was just a little boy
I made mistakes that caused you so much pain
All I know is that I'm older now

Some people think that it's best to refrain
From the conventions of old fashioned love
Their hearts are filled with holes and emptiness
They tell themselves that they're too young to settle down
Girl, I promise that I'm older now

And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
In telling myself that I can roll with the changes

And when the water gets high above your head
Darling, don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on me

I wasn't looking when we built these walls
Let me spread my dreams at your feet
Let's not let times build the flood rise
Before my thoughts begin to run
I think I'm getting older now

And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
In telling myself that I can roll with the changes

And when the water gets high above your head
Darling, don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on me

Can't stand the thought of another
Talking to you sweet, my dear
Where would I be tonight
If you hadn't held me here, in your arms?

And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
In telling myself that I can't roll with the changes

And when the water gets high above your head
Darling, don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on me
