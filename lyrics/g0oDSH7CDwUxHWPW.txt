This is a song about somebody else
So don't worry yourself, worry yourself
The devil's right there right there in the details
And you don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Looking too closely
Looking too closely
Oh, no, no, no!

Put your arms around somebody else
Don't punish yourself, punish yourself
Truth is like blood underneath your fingernails
And you don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Looking too closely
Looking too closely
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, no, no, no!

You don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
You don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Oh, no, no, no!
And I could be wrong about anybody else

So don't kid yourself, kid yourself
It's you right there, right there in the mirror
And you don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Looking too closely
(Mmmm mmmm mmmm)
Looking too closely

(Mmmm mmmm mmmm)
Yeaaah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Looking too closely
You don't wanna hurt yourself
You don't wanna hurt yourself, hurt yourself
Looking too closely
