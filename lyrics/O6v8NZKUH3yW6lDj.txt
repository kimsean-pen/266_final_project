I wanna let you in
Let meduce you to my skeletons
Get underneath my skin
We can always dive into irrelevance

Driving round their houses
Finding open doors
Walk into my secrets
There is so much more, oh-oh

It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful
We could be vulnerable
It could be wonderful

I wanna let you in
Through the looking glass I'll show you everything
Would it be a sin
If I let you be my medicine

Driving round their houses
Finding open doors
Walk into my secrets
There is so much more, oh-oh

It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful
We could be vulnerable
It could be wonderful

It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful
We could be vulnerable
It could be wonderful

Get underneath my skin
I wanna let you in
You'll be my skeleton
It could be wonderful It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful
We could be vulnerable
It could be wonderful

It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful
We could be vulnerable
It could be wonderful
