Days spent you go away
Is nothing but pure joy
If I told you, all this is for you
would you believe me or would you leave me
What if I showed you
my heart is all yours
would you believe me
or would you leave me

I dream in vibrant colours
just for you,
just for you,
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you
This one I got for you
all things you look so blue
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you

Drink-k-k-ing a potion
we go deep, as a notion
What if I told you
all this is for you
Would you believe me?
or would you leave me?
What if I showed you
my heart is all yours?
Would you believe me?
Or would you leave me?

I dream in vibrant colours
just for you,
just for you,
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you
This one I got for you
all things you look so blue
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you

I dream in vibrant colours
just for you,
just for you,
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you
This one I got for you
all things you look so blue
I dream in vibrant colours
just for you
just for you
