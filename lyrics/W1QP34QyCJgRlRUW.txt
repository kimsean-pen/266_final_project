I pull a mad scheme
All around the North Side
Chasin' a sweet thing
But so unsatisfied
Every time I try
Crazy 'bout a North Side Gal

I got some good talk
But not enough game
Wooin' a sweet thing
Oh, Ain't it a shame
Every time I try
Crazy 'bout a North Side Gal

Well, She gets colder
Every time I try to hold her
Pleasantly saying no to
Bolder and younger gentlemen
All of 'em try
They're crazy 'bout a North Side Gal

I got some money
And some wheels to drive
Old beat up guitars
And old sleazy dives
Every song I sing
It swings about a North Side Gal

Well, She gets colder
Every time I try to hold her
Pleasantly saying no to
Bolder and younger gentlemen
All of 'em tried
They're Crazy 'bout a North Side Gal

Well, I said they're Crazy 'bout a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
Well, they're Crazy 'bout a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
Crazy about a North Side Gal
