Go!

Born to believe anything
So sure that you can see it all clearly
Feeling your way through the dark
Set up to fail, hand over heart

Cut the lights, do you feel in control?
Cut the lights, do you feel all alone?
My eyes have finally adjusted
I'm seeing red, I'm seeing red
(Yeah) I'm seeing red, I'm seeing red

Cause we were born (born) to believe anything
I'll never stop, I'll never stop, give it up
Born (born) to believe anything
Seize the moment, all or nothing

Champions, dare to be, champions
Leave your legacy
I'm not the only one tired of running
Seize the moment, all or nothing
Seize the moment, it's all or naught
Seize the moment it's all
All for nothing again

Dreams die, you wake up in the end
That's what they want you to think
Fall back in line, it's all out of reach
But as I'm facing the crowd
I see your face in the crowd, and you're just like me
Fed up and torn at the seams

Born (born) to believe anything
I'll never stop, I'll never stop, give it up
Born (born) to believe anything
Seize the moment, all or nothing

Champions, dare to be, champions
Leave your legacy
I'm not the only one tired of running
Seize the moment, all or nothing
Seize the moment, it's all or naught

(Seize the moment, all or nothing
Seize the moment, it's all or naught
Seize the moment, all or nothing)
Seize the moment

This is where the rubber meets the road
Where it's do or die
Where you go at it alone
And you don't stop 'til you get there
Where the rubber meets the road
Where it's do or die
Where you go at it alone
And you don't stop
Change your world
Dare to be
