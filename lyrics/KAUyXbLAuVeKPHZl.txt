Indochina, Capa jumps Jeep, two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance, ohh
Very yellow white flash

A violent wrench grips mass, rips light, tears limbs like rags
Burst so high finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance

From medic from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
Him five yards from his leg, From you Taro, oh
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

3: 10 pm
Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey

Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not, ohh
le photographe est mort
3.1415, alive no longer my amour
Faded for home May of '54
Doors open like arms my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
Re-united with his leg and with you, Taro, ohh
Taro, ohh

Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes
Hey Taro!
