Brainshift
Came like a tidal wave
Closest to the the Sun you've been
One thousand miles away
There you'll see the clouds
And crawl out the rain

The world wants to know
But all you can say
Is "I promise to take up space
I can only promise to take up space"

Brainshift
You forgot what it was you were trying to say
To the friend you're talking to
But you can't remember his name
Or your reason for being

He wants a word
But all you can think is
"He's playing these blues for you
Two bucks maybe you know [?]
All I'm trying to
Resemble a type of life I once knew"

Brainshift
Going ballistic over the horizon
Everything's changing
And your minds playing all these time tricks
While a machine on display
Tells you what day it is

Cause it all feels the same
You're just a container containing space
You're just a container containing space

During this brainshift
