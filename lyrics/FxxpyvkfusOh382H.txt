The one eyed old man told me that the face that I will see
Has paralysed a thousand brave men sure of victory
I cannot fight blindfolded and I'd freeze if I should see
So I need to sacrifice my eyes to see all from within
The one eyed old man had told me of a lake that no one knows of
Where the end of the sky unites with the bottom
Countless feet down deep
And he told me when this world was young
Into its depths his eye he had thrown
So that, though one eyed, he could see more than can be seen

I'll throw my eyes into the lake
So that I will see from within
I'll throw my eyes into the lake
And when blind I will still see

At the bottom of the lake
My two eyes will shine like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I will see no matter how near or far

Regardless at which speed my horse
Takes me through the night
No matter how sharp the blade
Of my sword seems to be
Even with the aid of two pair
Of eyes way up high
In the end before the Beast its face
I would have had to see

But with my two eyes in the depths
My vision is supreme
I see all things that can't be seen
But not my hand held out in front of me
The face that makes men freeze
I now need not see at all
I'll feel the presence of the Beast
But will not need to stare him down no more

I've thrown down my eyes into the lake
So that I will see from within
I've thrown my eyes into the lake
And now when blind I still see

At the bottom of the lake
My two eyes are shining like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I now see no matter how near or far
