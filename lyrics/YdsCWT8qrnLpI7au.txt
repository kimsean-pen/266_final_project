As he's dying in his dreams
I hope you're choking in your sleep
Try and breathe
Justice push this pillow
Try and breathe
Try and breathe

My sweet
I wish you the best and that you'll sleep
Dragging it back into my dreams
Lay your head down try and rest

You left him sweating summer nights facedown
Foreplay with the streets
The salt to garnish his wounds
And you just danced your way home
(Paint your walls with his insides and hang his life above your bed
Paint your walls with his insides try and sleep now)
You made it so

As he's dying in his dreams
I hope you're choking in your sleep
Try and breathe
Justice push this pillow
Try and breathe
Try and breathe

My sweet
I wish you the best and that you'll sleep
Dragging it back into my dreams
Lay your head down try and rest

I bet you love this, don't you?
I bet you love this, don't you?
I bet you love this...
Now peel back his skin dear, peel back his skin
And he'll just smile...
But he's only smiling to deny the pain
And he's only smiling
And I bet you love this, don't you?
I bet you love this, don't you?
I bet you love this, don't you?
I bet you

My sweet
I wish you the best and that you'll sleep
Dragging it back into my dreams
Lay your head down try to rest

(One last breath, I'll watch you,
I'll watch you breathe your last
One last breath
I won't even close my eyes)
