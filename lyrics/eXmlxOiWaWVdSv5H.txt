Did you see her walking?
Did she come around here, sir?
Black hair, brown eyes
My beautiful leah
She was always so needing
Said, I have no-one
Even as I held her
She went out looking for someone
She only had nightmares,
And her sadness never lifted
And slowly over the years
Her lovely face twisted
Did she come around here, sir?
I swear you would remember
Black hair, brown eyes
Late september
October
November
December
It never leaves my mind
The last words she said
If I don't find it this time,
Then I'm better off dead.
