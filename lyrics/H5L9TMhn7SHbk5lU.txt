To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved

That force you to frame (that force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)

To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell, tell that the promised have been failed
