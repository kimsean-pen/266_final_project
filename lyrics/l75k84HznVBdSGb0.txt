Music and lights

Music and lights

Forget your sorrow
Let it all fade away
Forget tomorrow
Let's start living for today
Let me take you through a night of ecstasy
I like to hear the sound of a mystic melody
In the spotlight with the music playing loud

No distraction together we have found
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world

Music and lights, I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
You got to have rhythm

Whenever you're dancing and you glide across the floor
Your heart is singing and they're calling out for more
Let me take you through a night of ecstasy
I like to hear the sound of a mystic melody

Music and lights, I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
You got to have rhythm
Music and lights, I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
Give me rhythm

Forget your sorrow
let it all fade away
Forget tomorrow
Let's start living for today
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world

Music and lights, I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
You got to have rhythm
Music and lights, I'll sing and dance for you all night
Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
Give me rhythm, give me
