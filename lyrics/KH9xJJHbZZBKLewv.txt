nothing gets ()
cause i know you could be the best
how was i to ever had known
when i first heard you on the phone
that you would be my perfect fit
i don't know what to do with it
'cos your piece goes with mine alone
()

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go together just right
like puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go just like
puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

your's and mine

when i saw you standing there
i didn't know you'd ever care
i didn't know we'd talk at night
i didn't know you'd hold me tight

puzzle makes a picture of
a perfect heart for all my love
your hand in mine
all of the time

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go together just right
like puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go just like
puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

how was i
to have known you'd catch my eye?
now you have my everything

i told you i'd never been
you said you would take me then
now we're here until the end
in a puzzle picture

we're so close and fit so well
that nothing comes between us
tell me everything i want to hear
whisper to me hold me dear

no more tears and no more sadness
when you smile it makes me glad
when you say you love me
i will know it's true 'cos we have kissed like

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go together just right
like puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces
we go just like
puzzle pieces, puzzle pieces

puzzle pieces
you and me
are just like puzzle pieces
till the end of time
