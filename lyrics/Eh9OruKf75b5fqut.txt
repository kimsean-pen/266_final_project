Slaughtering the innocent,
Massacring the weak
Intimidate their fearful minds
Corrupt their structurer world
Afflict with terror, their lives suppressed
Consuming all their hopes
Expurgate their thoughts, oppressing all,
Nauseate with fright
Hollowed shells of living corpses
Pay homage to their art
Frail and weak, despondent souls,
Are prematurely dead...

Cherished hopes beyond Your grasp
Trepidation grows within
Time exists to test Your brain
Tormenting fast Your sanity
Dormant lives are cast aside
Evil slaughter, vile and sick
...Feel the pain!

Deep below... damp and cold
Chambers filled... with rotting dead
Sealed together... cryptic cells
Twisted corpses... in a mangled grave
Maggots grow... deep inside
Multiply... savored feast
Concealed to all... unknown their fate
Plea for life... their cries obscure

Slaughtering the innocent,
Massacring the weak
Intimidate their fearful minds
Corrupt their structurer world
Afflict with terror, their lives suppressed
Consuming all their hopes
Expurgate their thoughts, oppressing all,
Nauseate with fright
Hollowed shells of living corpses
Pay homage to their art
Frail and weak, despondent souls,
Are prematurely dead...

Cherished hopes beyond Your grasp
Trepidation grows within
Time exists to test Your brain
Tormenting fast Your sanity
Dormant lives are cast aside
Evil slaughter, vile and sick
...Feel the pain!
