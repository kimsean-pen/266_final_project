Holding on to something
That I know I can't control
And I could not have it any other way
Restless anxious is all I've known
Defenseless against this
This changes in my soul
What was once reluctance soon becomes the will to grow
And I would not have it any other way

So I let go, lose control
Let go to the unknown

Nothing changes in refusing to grow
Wisdom engages those who will grasp for something more
Take this leap of faith (take this leap of faith)
There's no time to waste
And I cannot have it any other way (any other way)

So I let go, lose control
Just let go, let go

Yeah
Just let go

See behind the hue
Reject what I once knew
I'll let go (I'll let go)
Surrender

Let go (let go)
Just let go (let go), surrender
