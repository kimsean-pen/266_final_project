I'm parting the sea between brightness and me.
Before I drown myself and everyone and everything.
I got my hands behind my back
With two fingers overlapped.
'cause I can never keep my word
And I share with the undeserved
For some cheap acceptance in return.
The water will shape the sides
And I'll walk with my head held high,
And when it all comes crashing in
It will be worth it if I'm still breathing.
If actions speak louder than words,
I'm the most deafening noise you've heard.
I'll be that ringing in your ears
That will stick around for years.
