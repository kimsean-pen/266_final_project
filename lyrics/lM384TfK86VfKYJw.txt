Walls trapped within yellow eyes the cutters
drooling face rips apart cuts to the heart
disease shown let it out movement crosses
crimson light washes darkened corners
gently forces open wide and lingering awhile
pouring thoughts electric fingers blinding pressure
sockets stream matter grey the nerve free fall
safely buried out behind a face let it out
be carefull watching living mask misshapen
tumors ride the pressing tinted nightmare breeze
mental shock disturbed thoughts rotting
long lasting reaction make it stop stir up the
pot taking away means nothing
distorted moodswing smile altered music shadow
covers melted honey bitter pie she utters
tasting quite lovely motion on towards a truthful
state mincing with words align order form
to multiply mental shock relentless and leaning
compiling the list alone at the top before
before it was not this way i thought... it did
