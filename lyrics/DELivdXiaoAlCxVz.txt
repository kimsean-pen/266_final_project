Never leave me
Walk close beside me
Your hand my hand
Fits so easy

No tomorrow
Let us stop here
We did some great things
Didn't we?

Dry and dusty
I am a capsule of energy
You speak softly
We are capsules of energy

Work as I've been told
In return I get money
Small feet in the hall
And I long for every moment
