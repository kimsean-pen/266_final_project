There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
In a moment of silence (for myself), After a shock to the soul

With a look of disbelief, Alone and numb to the cold
I knew the last moment had passed, Before enduring years of sorrow

There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, as they were erased from my life.

There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
Twas just the moment of change, Before years of sorrow

The shock and awe, the fright and woe
I only had one life to live, and life said no.

The loss of love, has left me hollow
All bliss twists into pain, Where there was joy, years of grief have followed!

There was a flash of lightning, followed by snow
It struck my heart, only once... which made me want it more

The emptiness it left in me, will always need to be filled
For it will be there all the time, from now on, forever more.

There was a crack of electric light, coming down from a darkened sky
My dreams flashed before my eyes, AS they were erased from my life.

There was a flash of lightning, Followed by snow
Twas just a moment of pain, Before years of sorrow

The shock and awe, the fright and woe
And when I asked for a second chance, life said no.
