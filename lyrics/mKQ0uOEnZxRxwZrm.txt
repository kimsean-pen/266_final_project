I'm not lonely when I'm alone
I see the sunrise
But it's the signs
I can't tell where they want me to go
I want to throw something
Into the eyes

High tide
Into my eyes
I've waited so long
For it to rise
High tide
Into my eyes
I'm like a fountain
But in rewind

I remember what it was like
To be a sailor
To know the water
Know there's something beyond the sky
But is it colder, I want it hotter
Know there's something beyond the signs
I want to throw something
Into the eyes

(Spoken french)

High tide into my eyes
I'm like a fountain
But in rewind
High tide into my eyes
I'm like a fountain
But in rewind
High tide into my eyes
I'm like a fountain
But in rewind
