I've been trying to make you love me
But everything I try
Just takes you further from me
You don't love me, no no
So you treat me cruel (baby I need you)
But no matter how you hurt me
I'll always be a fool

If you don't want me (forever)
If you don't need me (forever)
If you don't love me (forever)
Take me for a little while
I've got to make you love me
Take me for a little while
I've just got to make you love me

I've got to stop it
There should be a law (baby I need you)
But no matter how you put me down
I love you more
I feel so helpless (baby I need you)
And it ain't funny (you know that I need you)
Cause deep down inside I know
You're never gonna love me

If you don't want me (forever)
If you don't need me (forever)
If you can't love me (forever)
Take me for a little while
I've got to make you love me
Take me a little while
I've got to make you love me
Take me for a little while
I've got to make you love me
Take me for a little while
Take me for a little while
