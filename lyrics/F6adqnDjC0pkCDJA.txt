We lie awake at night
We're tired of waiting
Too high to sleep
Too tired to try
Life is strange
We die, and we don't know why

We lie awake at night
We're tired of waiting
Yeah life, is pain
But I'm afraid to die
We fall apart
It's not our fault
We fall apart
Life is strange but it's all we've got
I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what I want
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows

I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what I want
I don't know what I want but I know that I don't know what I want
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows
