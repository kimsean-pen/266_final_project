Melody unfair
You think she aims to please
You turn and she's not there
She's tuned to tease

She crept up to my front door
Rang the bell and now she's leaving

Melody unfair
Her cries distract, she plays
She moves
You follow
Where?
Comfort decays

Melody unfair
Melody unfair

Melody unfair
All she gives will wash away
A hum
She's almost there
Sweet melo
Delayed

Melody unfair
Melody unfair
