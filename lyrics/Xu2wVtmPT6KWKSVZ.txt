Well, the readin' and the writin' arithmetic
Never did get through to me
It ain't because I'm square or thick
'Cause I learned my A, be, see

But when I graduated from the grammar school
And I moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books
But I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra
But I'd bring home see's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me?

Oh, my grades are low on my card, I know
But they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learnin' in the dark
I'd have straight A's in love

Now in my senior year with graduation near
I did my homework every night
And when my momma said I oughta go to bed
I turn out all the lights

But my sweetie pie was waitin' right outside
She'd be a coolin' like a dove
Though I did my best, I failed semester test
But I made straight A's in love

Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra
But I'd bring home see's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me

Oh, my grades are low on my card, I know
But they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learnin' in the dark
I'd have straight A's in love
