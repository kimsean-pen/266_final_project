I walked (walked and walked)
Like a zombie in the night (zombie in the night)
You came
(You came, you came)
And you brought me back to life
I tried so hard
(I tried, I tried)
To become the one you need,
But now you think that you're not enough for me

You don't have to change for me
I love you just the way you are
I'd rather change the sun and the moon
Or see December snow in June
