don't push me cause i'll fall in love
with whatever you just said
don't push me cause i'll fall in love
with the way you wear your head

CHORUS:
out in the corner
you're glowing white. (X2)

i want to want you
i need to need you
i'd love to love you
i want to want you
i need to need you
i'm begging to beg you

CHORUS:
out in the corner
you're glowing white. (X2)

i'd like to say good-bye
to a complicated mind
but when i walk and wave
i'm stalked all day
by california lives
and things i didn't try
ways you were unkind
and the strangest colored eyes

CHORUS:
out in the corner
you're glowing white. (X2)
