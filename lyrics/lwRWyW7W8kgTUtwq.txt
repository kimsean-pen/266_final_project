Oh, na, na, na, na, na
She hosts a TV show
She rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band

She's an astronaut
A valet at the parking lot
A farmer workin' the land
She is a champion
She gets the gold
She's a ballerina
The star of the show

She's not
Just a pretty face
She's got
Everything it takes

She has a fashion line
A journalist for "Time"
Coaches a football team
She's a geologist
A romance novelist
She is a mother of three

She is a soldier
She is a wife
She is a surgeon
She'll save your life

She's not
Just a pretty face
She's got
Everything it takes

She's mother
Of the human race
She's not
Just a pretty face

Oh
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
She is your waitress
She is your judge
She is a teacher
She is every woman in the world

Oh, la, la, la, la, la
She flies an airplane
Drives a subway train
At night she pumps gasoline

She's on the council
She's on the board
She's a politician
She praises the Lord

She's not
Just a pretty face
She's got
Everything it takes

She's mother
Of the human race
She's not - oh no she's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
She's got everything it takes
She's not just a pretty face
