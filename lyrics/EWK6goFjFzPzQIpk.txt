I've been thinking of giving up
Cause every time I fill my cup
It goes away my motivation
It's too bad you can't take well
The shitty lies that hide behind my eyes

I'm just a tin man
Searching for something that I never had
You just could never get that

All along
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded
All along
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded

I keep on trying to stay away
Sleeping at my own place
To keep my head straight
It's too bad you can't see through
The shitty lies that hide behind my eyes

I'm just a tin man
Searching for something that I never had
You just could never get that

All along
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded
All along
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded

I'm not saying sorry anymore
I'm not saying sorry anymore

All along (I'm not saying sorry anymore)
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded
All along (I'm not saying sorry anymore)
I was something you could always take for granted
So it goes
I'm the one left standing stranded (anymore)
