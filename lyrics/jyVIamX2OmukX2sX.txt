Where there's truth the green valley steals cottonwood
Where there's peace a little cloud of music gleams brotherhood
Where there's love I'd be a boy if I could
Where there's woman I'd hold her when I should
Where there's woman

Where there's woman honey wine
Where there's woman loving time
Where there's love for a lover of my kind

Where there's evil a hounds tooth bears white
Where there's good is where I'll be tonight
Where there's love there burn eternal light
Where there's woman I'll take her without spite
Where there's woman

Where there's woman honey wine
Where there's woman lovin' time
Where there's love for a lover of my kind
Where there's woman (repeat)
maybe a little baby girl ooooooh!
