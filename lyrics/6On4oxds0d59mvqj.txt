Look for answers
I never use to wonder why
Search for loving
But that always comes in time
Make it look easy
Wish I didn't have to try
Out with with strangers
Use to take all my nights

Would you tell me if I'm right
Is it worth your time
You can try all day to change my mind
But I can't do that

I don't need ya now
I don't need ya now
Baby who?
Now you want me bad
But I don't want you back
Baby who?

Stay to together
When it starts to fall apart
Nothing's forever
It doesn't have to break your heart
If you let it
Time will always do u right
For the moment
We can push this all aside

Would you tell me if I'm right
Is it worth your time
You can try all day to change my mind
But I can't do that

I don't need ya now
I don't need ya now
Baby who?
Now you want me bad
But I don't want you back
Baby who?
Cause I ain't good with names
If you don't feel the same
Baby who
Cause I don't need ya now
I don't need ya now
Baby who?

You can dry your eyes if you like
You can take your time, you can take your time
Turn it all around if it don't feel right
You can dry your eyes if you like
You can take your time, you can take your time
Turn it all around if it don't feel right
Take all your time
Now you want me bad, I don't want you back
Baby who

Well I don't need ya now
I don't need ya now
Baby who?
Now you want me bad
But I don't want you back
Baby who?
Cause I ain't good with names
If you don't feel the same
Baby who
Cause I don't need ya now
I don't need ya now
Baby who?
