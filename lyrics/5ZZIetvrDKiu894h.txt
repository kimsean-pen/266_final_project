Come one, come all
You're just in time
To witness my first breakdown
Cause there's a mile gone
For every minute passed
When I'm stuck in this town

I've got a bone to pick with you, Mr. DJ
The traffic and the sound
Is just as bad as it is in LA

So go on and lock me up
You better throw away that key
Before I find out where you broadcast from
Because your play list is killing me

I'll change that station
Light it up like the 4th of July
It's me, I'm caller fifteen
Time to play my last request

Come one, come all
You're just in time
To witness my first breakdown
Cause there's a mile gone
For every minute passed
When I'm wasting space in this town
Don't call the doctors
I don't need no medication
I just need one more vacation
And make it last

Hear me out, please, judge and jury
I'm an innocent man
And it would be such a terrible injustice
To put me away without thinking about
All the terrible mistakes
That goddamn radio jockey makes
I swear he's out to get me
Oh, I swear he's out to get me

I'll change that station
Light it up like the 4th of July
It's me, I'm caller fifteen
But it's too late for explanations
This broadcast will be your last

Come one, come all
You're just in time
To witness my first breakdown
Cause there's a mile gone
For every minute passed
When I'm wasting space in this town
Don't call the doctors
I don't need no medication
I just need one more vacation
And make it last

Hear me out, please, judge and jury
And I swear he's out to get me
Oh, I swear he's out to get me
Go on and lock me up
You better throw away that key
I swear he's out to get me
I swear he's out to get me

I've got a bone to pick with you, Mr. DJ
You really ought to lock me up
Because your play list is killing me

Come one, come all
You're just in time
To witness my first breakdown
Cause there's a mile gone
For every minute passed
When I'm wasting space in this town
Don't call the doctors
I don't need no medication
I just need one more vacation
And make it last
