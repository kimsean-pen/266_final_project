I used to get dressed up for ya
You were the center of my plans
I had nothin' but love for ya
And your Friday nights made me dance
Thought you had my back
I was wrong
Everything's changed since he's been gone

Now you're just a bring me down town
I can't ever drive around
You used to be my favorite place
Now you're another one I see his face
And I hate how I can't even go out
I need someone new to do my drinkin'
'Cause you ain't nothin' but up brinin', downtown
I bring me downtown
Why you gotta bring me down town?

I used to see your neon Main Street
But now I see a dead end road
Nothin' for me now, it's hard to believe
I used to call your home and

Now you're just a bring me down town
I can't ever drive around
You used to be my favorite place
Now you're another one I see his face
And I hate how I can't even go out
I need someone new to do my drinkin'
'Cause you ain't nothin' but up brinin', down town
Why you gotta bring me down town?

Ain't nothin' I did or didn't do
It's not me it's you

Now you're just a bring me down town
I can't ever drive around
You used to be my favorite place
Now you're another one I see his face
And I hate how I can't even go out
(I can't even go out)
I need someone new to do my drinkin'
'Cause you ain't nothin' but up brinin', down town
Bring me downtown
Why you gotta bring down, down, down, down town
