The moon shines cold with ice tonight
and i can see your face now in the violet light
and though you're a thousand miles away
i can hear you clearly
i hear every word you say
(chorus)
i just can't breakaway
no matter how i try
i just can't get away
i just can't find no peace of mind anyway
i have dreams that i don't understand
they're all tangled up like your hair in my hands
and though you're a thousand miles away
i can see you clearly
i feel every breath you take
(repeat chorus)
the moon strikes fear in hearts of men
and i thought i would never see your face again
and though you're a thousand miles away
i can hear you clearly
i tremble with every word you say
(repeat chorus x 3 to fade)
