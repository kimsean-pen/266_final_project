I-I, just died in your eyes, eyes; (Ohh ...)
Just died in your eyes, eyes;
Just died in your eyes ...

There's a silence in the air tonight
There's a secret we can't hide behind no more
There's a distance we don't dare to go,
And a million things that I don't wanna know-oh-ohh ...

Your hands start undressing me,
Your lips won't stop kissing me,
I hear you say you love me ...

But baby you're lying, lying.
I see the truth you're hiding, hiding.
I look at you and I-I, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Before I start crying, crying,
Give me a reason for trying, trying.
The one thing that keeps me alive,
I, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Just died in your eyes-eyes.

From the window I've been looking through,
I have seen the end of me and you, oh-ohh ...
And it's not about who's right or wrong,
When you wake up in the morning I'll be gone ...

Your hands start undressing me;
Your lips won't stop kissing me;
I hear you say you love me ...

But baby you're lying, lying.
I see the truth you're hiding, hiding.
I look at you and I-I, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Before I start crying, crying,
Give me a reason for trying, trying.
The one thing that keeps me alive,
I, just died in your eyes-eyes.

My hopes ...
My dreams ...
All I believed ...
Just died-died, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Baby you're all I know, it's what matters most
Just died-died, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Just died in your eyes-eyes.

There's a silence in the air tonight,
There's a secret we can't hide behind, no more

But baby you're lying, lying.
I see the truth you're hiding, hiding.
I look at you and I-I, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Before I start crying, crying,
Give me a reason for trying, trying.
The one thing that keeps me alive,
I, just died in your eyes-eyes.
Just died in your eyes-eyes.

Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh ...

Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes-eyes.

Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh ...

Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes-eyes.

Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh ...

I-I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes.

Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohh-ohhh-ohhh ...

I-I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes.
