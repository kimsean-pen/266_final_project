Yeah, suite twenty three at the Chateau
Had a heart, man I'm tryna get it back though
Tryna get it back, tryna get it back, tryna get it back

Age twenty five and I'm rich now
No excuse, you be actin' like a bitch now
I gave you diamond, a pool, write the checklist
She want a ring, ain't fuckin' with a necklace
I'm a fool for these thangs with the big butts
Take her home, body turn into a rich slut
Feel like I can't trust nobody, even day ones
Watch out for them snake ones

Suite veintitré at the Chateau
Had a heart, man, I'm tryna get it back though
White linen, white rose
Let's go, oh, oh

So please, baby, please, baby, talk slow
Talk slow, I'm off to blow, I'm off to dro', I'm in my zone
Grab your girls, grab your phone, and let's go
Get ready, we goin' to the Chateau
Legs around my neck
I got your nails up in my back
Get ready, we goin' to the Chateau
No love, no love, no love, no love
Just fuckin' in a California king, baby

No love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, babe
No love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love
Fuckin' in a California king
