all alone in the darkness
I can feel your smile
I wanna be free just set me free
and in the pale moonlight i can hear your voice when the shadows roam you had no choice
its gotta be me
its gotta be me

Debbie Debbie tell me what to do
my heart feels lonely when i think of you
Debbie I wanna talk to you
you took a boy from the crowd and you made him a man
you stuck a gun to my head but I just cant understand what it feels to be in love

all alone in the darkness
I can feel your smile
I wanna be free
just set me free
I can feel your smile
I wanna be free
just set me free
and in the pale moonlight I can hear your voice when the shadows roam you had no choice
its gotta be me
its gotta be me

Debbie Debbie tell me what to do my heart feels lonely when I think of you
Debbie I love you. you know I do
you took a boy from the crowd and you made him a man
you put a gun to my head but I just cant understand what it feels to be in love
when I looked over in the corner I saw Linda walking towards me
she wanted to ask me a question
but I turned and I ran and I saw Debbie
and then Cindy started coming over
they started to talk about me
they wanted to touch my head
Debbie and Cindy and Linda
they just kept on touching me
all alone in the darkness
I can feel your smile
I wanna be free just set me free
and in the pale moonlight I can hear your voice when the shadows roam you had no choice
its gotta be me
its gotta be me

Debbie Debbie tell me what to do my heart feels lonely when I think of you
Debbie I need you
you know I do
you took a boy from the crowd and you made him a man
you stuck a gun to my head but I just cant understand what it feels to be in love
Debbie Debbie tell me what to do my heart feels lonely when i think of you
I wanna walk with debbie down Vermont Avenue
you took a boy from the crowd and you made him a man
you stuck a gun to my head but I just cant understand what it feels to be in love
when I walked through the woods
I can see debbie standing by the trees
she wants to be free
free from me
I walked down the avenue and I held your hand
and then i walked through the park and I'm on my land
I'm free
set me free
