Call the police, this whole place is gonna burn!
Come on Holly, put the gun down for me
Call the police, this whole place is gonna burn!
You love money and the sex in your veins
Call the police!
This whole place is gonna burn!
They're trying to take it from us
They're trying to take it from us

Call the police!
This whole place is gonna burn!
You're so pretty

When you dress for the grave

Yeah, ooh
Love me as you lay dizzy and falling
Your legs dangling
Although accidents happen they happen to me
I'm trying to forget the beginning and end

Forget the world!
Without removing the glass from your lips

Call the police, this whole place is gonna burn!
You love money and the sex in your veins
Call the police!

This whole place is gonna burn!
They're trying to take it from us
They're trying to take it from us

Call the police!
This whole place is gonna burn!
The sun's coming up
And we're still awake (still awake)
Am I the trigger of your gun? (gun)
Your pretty eyes
Don't give me much choice
But I'll take them home
I've done some thinking of my own
And when I come home
I wanna be done
Don't wanna be famous no more
Leave that girl alone!
My teenage heart-attack
Keeps talking back
Keeps talking back to her
And I can't pretend
That off this balcony
We wouldn't want to jump off of it
And put an end to this
Call the police, this whole place is gonna burn!
You love money and the sex in your veins
Call the police, this whole place is gonna burn!
Yeah!
Doll up and sleepwalk
Until we have some teeth marks
Narcotic sweet talk
Until we have some teeth marks
This whole place is gonna burn!
