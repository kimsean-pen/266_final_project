I've been having a dream
And in it, I am just a machine
And only she has the potion that can give back emotion
To the meaningless thing I'm becoming

She's every image that could ever be seen
She's in the air, if you know what I mean

And I know that it will not be easy
Singing a song that has to be sung

Only you
Can make one out of two
After all that we've been through
You keep on giving me a reason
To see love through your eyes

You can make one out of two
After all that we've been through
You keep on giving me a reason
To see love through your eyes

I've been planning a scheme
Ever since I was 17
To build my home in your nation
To enter your station
Where the people can feel as one

Sometimes I wish that it was only a dream
But I am just a machine
And only you have the potion that can give back emotion
To the meaningless thing I've become

So go (Hey Now)
Only you
Can make one out of two
After all that we've been through
You keep on giving me a reason
To see love through your eyes

You can make one out of two
After all that we've been through
You keep on giving me a reason
To see love through your eyes

To see love through your eyes
To see love through your eyes
