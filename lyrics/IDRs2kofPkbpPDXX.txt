I look back on the years, can't pretend to forget
A picture, lost progress, I wonder how you've been
Your laugh and your smile, while I'm losing sleep lost inside my head

Tell me you're passed this, it's over and you've moved on
'Cause I can't explain why the past few years were meaningless
Forgive me, I did everything that I could
Forgive me, I wish you saw it from where I stood

I've read over the words that you left in my head
A look on your face I could never forget
I know it's been a while, I still live in denial
Nowhere to be found when you needed a friend
Couldn't handle the pressure I started to cave in
So I told myself that you were fine

Tell me you're passed this, it's over and you've moved on
'Cause I can't explain why the past few years were meaningless
Forgive me, I did everything that I could
Forgive me, I wish you saw it from where I stood

I've read over the words that you left inside my head
And I stayed up all night trying to ease the pain, but nothing changes

I punish myself and fall into a wretched whim
The guilt that burns inside my chest, the memories they freeze within
These empty picture frames, (I couldn't ask for your forgiveness.)
Torturing these cold and lonely nights. (I couldn't ever apologize.)
I can't escape. (How could I ask for your forgiveness?)
I suffocate from outside in. (How could I ever apologize?)
I punish myself

I called for help, they took you away
Forgive me, please forgive me
I punish myself with each passing day
Let the tears fall from your eyes as you fade away
