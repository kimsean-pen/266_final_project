You can dance
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Oh I know
That the music is fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun

Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much

You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

Cause don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Cause don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
