Sometimes you just can't believe the things your eyes see
So much injustice in this life
If it's happenin' right on your TV screen
So you drop to your knees and you're prayin'
'Cause you can hear him sayin' he can't breathe
And it's all so overwhelming
Because you know there's nothing you can do to help him

Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In times like these
That's what your heart is for
Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In honor of your brother
That's what your heart is for

There's always someone tryin' to take someone's power away
The history of the world is violent, will it ever change?
Now we're livin' in a time where you just can't hide
There's a camera in every hand
It's not elusive, even when they treat you like you're useless
We know what the truth is

Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In times like these
That's what your heart is for
Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In honor of your brother
That's what your heart is for

Fight for your life
Fight for your life
In the face of a society
That doesn't value your life
For the men in your life
For the boys in your life
For your brothers, for your fathers
For the ones that came before us
For the future, for the future
For the future, for the future

Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In times like these
That's what your heart is for
Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In honor of your brother
That's what your heart is for
Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In times like these
Nothing matters more
Continue to breathe
Continue to breathe
In honor of your brother
That's what your heart is for
