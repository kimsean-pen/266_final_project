A waterfall
A wonderful bliss but a teardrop falls
You say your goodbye it means nothing
I say that we've tried and we gave our all
We fall to the floor
I'm not buying, I'm not for this
And all you ever do is stall
I am so damn sick of trying
And now we are fucked cause we've wrecked it all
I will not save you

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends

I can't complain
It's been good not great but the time flew by
It came from behind it was flying
It was hard to hold on every time we'd fight
And though it would end it's exhausting
In the cracks that would grow in and out of mind
And into your heart like a virus
It would crawl and would crawl as we laid there blind
And broke you and I

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends
Today it ends
Today it ends

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends

So dry your eyes
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry
Or fix you and I
Yeah we're here again
So phony and today is the day it ends
