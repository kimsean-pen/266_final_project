Special
You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

Just one more fight
About your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed (yeah)

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way
My way or the highway

Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again
Free again (yeah)

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way
It's my way
My way or the highway

Someday you'll see things my way
Cause you never know
No, ya never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
Cause you never know
No, ya never know
When you're gonna go

Yes I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me (yeah)
