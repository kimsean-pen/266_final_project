Too many fools blocking my motion
Clouding my eyes... must be the potion
Spots on my eyes... must be the lotion
Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void

Too many bigots for my liking
Too many critics... too few writing
Rabid dogs that just ain't biting

Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void

Jaded reputation on which you're staking
Lots of money for the making
For all the stars they're just faking

Love in a void... it's so numb
Avoid in love... it's so dumb
Love in a void
