Operator can you help me, help me if you please
Give me the right area code and the number, that I need
My rider left upon a midnight flyer singin' like a summer breeze
I think she's somewhere down south
Down about baton rouge
But I just can't remember no number, a number I can use
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it
Got to find a number to use
Tryin' to check out a number, tryin' to run down a line
Operator said that's privelaged information
And it ain't no business of mine
Its flooding down in Texas, the polls are out in Utah
Got to find a private line
She could be hangin round a steel mill working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus outta Oakland, talkin' to the night
I don't know where she's goin, I don't care where she's been
Long as she's been doin' it right
