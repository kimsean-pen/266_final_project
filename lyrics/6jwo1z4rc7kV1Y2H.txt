OoOo yeah yeah oOo

I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave everything that I had
But you left me in the cold
But still I have faith
Somehow I believe
That if I keep love in my heart
It will find it's way to me

I could fight
Seek revenge
But that's not who I am
No i'm not giving in
I will rise above

Im gonna keep walking though it may seem far
Im gunna keep preaching when life gets too hard
Not gunna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

Im gunna keep climbing 'till I see the top
Im gunna keep trying though I may get lost
Not gunna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

Im gunna get by on the high road
Im gunna get by on the high road

This pain that I feel
I will overcome
I know somewhere deep down inside
Its the pain that makes us strong

I could curse
I could shout
Take the easy way out
I forgive you some how
I will rise above

Im gonna keep walking though it may seem far
Im gunna keep preaching when life gets too hard
Not gunna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

Im gunna keep climbing 'till I see the top
Im gunna keep trying though I may get lost
Not gunna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

I'll get by

Oh I know I'll get by
To be real [to be real]
I can't keep it inside [though I can't keep it inside]
I may hurt sometimes
But i will survive

Im gunna keep reaching
Im gunna keep climbing
[Say it with me now]
Im gunna keep trying
Yeahh OOhhh

Im gonna keep walking though it may seem far
Im gunna keep preaching when life gets too hard
Not gunna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get down on the high road
I'm' gonna be fine on the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna be fine on the high road
