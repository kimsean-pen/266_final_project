I guess it never was
The way I thought it was
I say this only just because
You never came to love
I guess it wasn't so
Guess that'show the story goes
You didn't dig my flow
You didn't dig my flow

But you're still welcome... welcome
Anytime you want some
Make yourself at home 'cause you're
Welcome

Tonight will make one week
Tonight's the anniversary
And if you don't talk to me
Tomorrow will never be

But you're still welcome... welcome
Anyitme you want some
Make yourself at home 'cause you're
Welcome

Six in the morning everything's nothing
Six in the eve everything's still the same
Wish you knew I just wish that you knew that
I really love you deep like a mother loves a child
I wanna love you like water hot runnin' wild
Inside you momma sophisticated style
Check my dictionary...

I guess it never was the way I thought it was
I say this only just because
You never came to love
Welcome
