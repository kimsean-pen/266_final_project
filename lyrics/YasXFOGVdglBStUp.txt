Long gone the days of summer
In LA stretches longer
Maybe waiting
Tryna heal but the pain it won't go
Star with less always sees the cosmo
Maybe waking

Remember the calm December
One day can last forever
Ain't nowhere that safe
For a lonely pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target center

Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely
And I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire
To watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm really empty
I'm inspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore
Can you smile yet
Our love is untied
Let it die

I'd be lying if I said it felt right
Even though I got a dog this fight
woah yeah, know this
People talk in and out the words go
Be the one from where the wind does blow
Cowards surround me

Remember the calm December
One lie can live forever
Ain't nowhere that safe
For a lonely pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target centre

Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely
And I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire
To watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm really empty
I'm inspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore
Can you smile yet
Our love is untied
Let it die

Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely
And I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire
To watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm really empty
I'm inspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore
Can you smile yet
Our love is untied
Let it die
