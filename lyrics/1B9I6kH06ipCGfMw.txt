All the walls coming down around me

I know that I'm fucked up and infected
I've been hiding and I feel rejected
Thank God that you finally found me
'Cause you gotta get me outta here
I've been shacken disconnected
I've been loving like I've been neglected
All the walls coming down around me
And you gotta get me outta here

I can't take anymore

I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!

I know I'm a walking contradiction
I'm a truth that you wish was fiction
And it's hard 'cause I know you hate me
I just wanna disappear
I've been on a self-inflicted mission
To destroy everything I'm giving
Thank God that you finally found me
'Cause you gotta get me outta here

I can't take anymore

I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!

You took my pride
You took control
It's not that sacred anymore
Give back what's mine
Give back my soul

Breathe...
but I don't wanna die...

I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna die
I can't feel, I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my.
I can't breathe, I can't fight
I will feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life!
