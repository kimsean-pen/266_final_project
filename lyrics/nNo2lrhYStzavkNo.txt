500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 letters words like scars no one can see

It felt so innocent, a childish game
Lines of poetry without a name
Waves of paranoia washed upon the page
And soon obsession turned to rage
Why do you love me?
Why do you want to hurt me?

500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 weapons I can't take it anymore
500 letters words like scars no one can see
500 secrets slowly killing me

At the mercy of a violent hand
Drawing images in my head
I can't escape the way I feel inside
In every shadow just a breath behind
Why do you love me?
Why do you want to hurt me?

500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 weapons I can't take it anymore
500 letters words like scars no one can see
500 secrets slowly killing me

They found the final letter lying by his side
A smile was on his face, cold as ice
One last message written only for me
"Now you won't forget
I see you in your dreams"

500 letters from a stranger at my door
500 weapons I can't take it anymore
500 letters words like scars no one can see
500 secrets slowly killing me
