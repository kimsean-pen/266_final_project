Useless
Why'd you call me useless?
Boy, you're not the only one
Who's running in their sleep

Ruthless
Only call me ruthless
Boy, you're not the only one
Who's opened up to me

Wanna be there
You won't fall harder
Wanna be there
Just like your mama
Wanna be there
You caught me craving you from underneath the sheets

Two of us
I won't pay for your omissions
You are death
I won't fuel your love or addictions

Clueless
Why'd you call me clueless?
Do you know that everything you say is killing me?

Wanna be there
You won't fall harder
Wanna be there
Just like your mama
Wanna be there
You caught me craving you from underneath the sheets
Wanna be there
You cut me harder
Wanna be there
But who'd you rather?
Wanna be there
So how is it you keep yourself away from me?

Two of us
I won't pay for your omissions
You are death
I won't fuel your love or addictions
