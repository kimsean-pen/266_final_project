In the life of a rose I've lived and died a 100 times
You've watched me open, bloom, wilt, rot
And start over (Start over)
You watch me again and again, and again, and again
And each time
My time, measured in light, final breaths, finding, losing
Time, giving so much and then taking everything away
And I wonder this time, next year what will it look like?
With my guesses so often, so wrong
I wonder what beginning, what end waits for me?
Will I have accepted the things that I cannot change?
And will I have changed the things I cannot accept?
This time, next time, about time
