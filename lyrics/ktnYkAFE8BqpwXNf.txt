There's a man walking
With a rope and a shovel in his hand
And he's digging, he's digging
Down to clay
I lean back and watch the ceiling sway

But you make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You love who floods

Seeing him's easy when no one's around
Finding him's easy when all that you've found
Are gardens and sirens both move to the sound
Of little worms writhing

But you make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You make these feelings go away
You love who floods

So come then come over and sit by me
Follow the arrow following me
Nothing to fill in, nothing to free
Nothing here love but a cavity

Swallow the arrow following me
Nothing to fill in, nothing to free
Nothing here love but a cavity
