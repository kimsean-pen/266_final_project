Everything she sees
She says she wants.
Everything she wants
I see she gets.

That's my daughter in the water
Everything she owns I bought her
Everything she owns.
That's my daughter in the water,
Everything she knows I taught her.
Everything she knows.

Everything I say
She takes to heart.
Everything she takes
She takes apart.

That's my daughter in the water
Every time she fell I caught her.
Every time she fell.
That's my daughter in the water,
I lost every time I fought her.
I lost every time.

Every time she blinks
She strikes somebody blind.
Everything she thinks
Blows her tiny mind.
That's my daughter in the water,
Who'd have ever thought her?
Who'd have ever thought?
That's my daughter in the water,
I lost everytime I fought her
Yea, I lost every time.
