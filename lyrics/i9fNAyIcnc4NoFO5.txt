Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?

Where would I be? and what would you be?
Then zip it up and just follow me
I'm addicted to shining and glowing
You gon' be addicted to my eyes

I'ma be zero class then you gon' be loyal
I'm addicted to the show you've never done before

Look in the mirror again and again
Don't forget I'm taking the initiative
All the glance is mine 'til I lose my mind

I'll be shining on you everywhere
Day and night, hot cold light
You can't deny
'Cause you're already addicted to me

Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?
Who's running the show?

Me
