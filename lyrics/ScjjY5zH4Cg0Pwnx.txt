I can see the world at breakneck speed, passing me by
Everybody takes a piece of life and cutting line

I seem to think I can wait my turn
All the entitled can crash and burn
Give to the need my place in line
A few seconds of my time

Don't forget the golden rule is live and let
Live your life without regret
Or be a prisoner in time

Broke down, need the help, can't you see I'm struggling on by
You would think out of all of these that one would stop and try

I seem to think it's no big deal
All the entitled can burn at the wheel
Give to the need my sweat and time
A soul to save and I think it's mine

Look up to the sky
In a tear you wonder why
We turn ourselves into a prisoner of time
