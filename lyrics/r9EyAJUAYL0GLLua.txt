Here in the city, where the sun beats down on the streets
My demons talking to me and they just trying to eat
Sunset's pretty when the waves crash down on my feet
Ain't this life so sweet? Cruising a hundred and three
I'm in the fast lane, I'm moving rapid
It's do or die, you need to catch back up, man
I'll never slow down, just like a ghost town
James Dean, curtain call, silver screen, showdown

I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young

I'd rather burn out than fade away, living day to day
I was born an outcast, but who are they to say
What I do is wrong? And I keep moving on
You might choke on these words, but you sing along
So with your heart stops or your hands tied
Be the rainfall, cause a landslide
And if they condescend, then something's wrong with them
I've been off, now I'm on again
I just wanna live while the feeling's there
A hundred on the highway, put the top down, feel the air, kill the snare
Life's a movie, we're the directors
We're the star, don't bother us, no time for the lectures
Many memories, I wouldn't trade for the planet
Life is short, I never take it for granted
God, take me now, in the place that I'm standing
I got no regret, and that's the way that I planned it

I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young

It's never been in my fate to run
I was born to chase the sun
Mama always told me I was like no one
But I'll know when the time comes
It's never been in my fate to run
I was born to chase the sun
Mama knew I wouldn't be here for long
And I'll smile when the time comes

I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young
