Hold back, my woman
I've been a fool
'Cause I've did nothing and
I forgot to love you
Hold back, my woman
I will never know
How you've been doing anymore

'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
That's alright
'Cause I can wait till the morning
If that's what you like
'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
But that's alright
'Cause I can wait till the morning
'Cause I can wait till the morning

(I can wait for, I can wait for)
(I can wait for, no no no)
(I can wait for, I can wait for)
(I can wait for, no no no)

Don't you cry, cry, woman
We don't need tears
I'm sorry for the wrong doings
I've been regretting that (I've been regretting that)

Been a backstab beauty
I'm going call you
Hold back, my woman
I've been a fool
I've been a fool

(I can wait for, I can wait for)
I've been a fool
(I can wait for, no no no)
I've been a fool
(I can wait for, I can wait for)
I've been a fool
(I can wait for, no)

'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
That's alright
'Cause I can wait till the morning
If that's what you like
'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
But that's alright
'Cause I can wait till the morning
'Cause I can wait till the morning

(I can wait for, I can wait for)
(I can wait for, no no no)
(I can wait for, I can wait for)
(I can wait for, no)

'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
(I can wait for)
But that's alright
(I can wait for)
'Cause I can wait till the morning
(I can wait for)
If that's what you like (no no no)
'Cause you're not ready to talk yet
(I can wait for)
But that's alright
(I can wait for)
'Cause I can wait till the morning
(I can wait for, no)
'Cause I can wait till the morning
(Can wait for, no)
