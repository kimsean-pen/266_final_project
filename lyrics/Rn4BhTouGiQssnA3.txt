One, two, one, two, three
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah
Do do do do

Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
I found your address got your phone number too
Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
Been to secret places you think nobody knows

If I have to breathe without you
Nobody could
I need to be around you
Watchin' you

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you
Creepin' up on you

I been hangin' round all the places you haunt
Spyin' on your friends to find out what you want
Drinkin' from the glass that you left on the bar
Follow you around drivin' home in your car

Do I have to breathe without you?
'Coz nobody could
I need to be around you
Watchin' you

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you
I'm creepin' up on you

I know this must be wrong
It can't go on
This kind of thing
It's taking all my sanity and making a mockery

This must be wrong
It can't go on
So won't somebody free me from this misery
Bring my baby closer to me, yeah, yeah?

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do, yeah, oh

'Coz no one else can love you like I do
You feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin'

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you

'Coz no one else can love you, no, no, like I do
And when I peekin' in on you
Watchin' everything you do

'Coz noone else can love you, no, like I do
No one else should love you, no, like I do
Baby creepin' up on you
Watchin' everything you do, yeah

No one else can love you, no
No one else should touch you, no
No one else can love you, touch you
Love you, be with you
No, let me do, ooh
Since I do
