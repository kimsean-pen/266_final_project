I've got the diamonds and a feather
Give me three reasons why we we're together
I push my body through the floor, lurk
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

You're in the corner waiting for my love
I put two walls behind you just to lean on
Kinda need 'em cause I stood you up
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(it's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(it's all love)
'Cause my love's so good
(So I fuck with myself more than anybody else)

I got you fishing through the fodder
This whole relationship is underwater
We're facing dangers in the third strike
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(it's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(it's all love)
'Cause my love's so good
(So I fuck with myself more than anybody else)

I used to care about what you think, baby
You words burn me in the third degree
And baby now look what it's come to
'Cause my love is the one, my love is the one

So I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(it's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(it's all love)
'Cause my love's so good
(So I fuck with myself more than anybody else)
(I used to care what you think about me)
(Love's so good)
