Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Start in on your story and I'll go
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow

Glowing 'cuz you're sweatin' on our floor
Glowing 'cuz you're sweatin' on our floor
Dancing like you'll never dance no more
Glowing 'cuz you're sweating on our floor

Then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cuz she's a-coming to fight
And then she'll go

Death row smoking gettin' to your face
Death row smoking gettin' to your face
Showin' off your something shaved and lac, see
Death row smoking gettin' to your face

Then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cuz she's a-coming to fight
And then she'll go

And then you go and when you go
You get to going way too fast and I'm so slow
Turn out the lights 'cuz she's a-coming to fight
And then she'll go

Little Jo she warned me not to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city where you came from
