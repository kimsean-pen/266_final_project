You bring me right back down to the Earth from the Promised Land
We're getting close to the centre of the Earth with an honest plan.
You'll never be your mother or your father do you understand?
Until you understand!
We don't have too much time here, and time it travels far too fast!
We're not too far we're too near, before they take it from our hands!

Why don't you teach your heart to feel, and give your love love,
Give your love love and give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk and give your love love,
Give your love love.
Gimme, gimme what I need.

We'll take you right back down to the Earth from the Motherland,
This is a first-class journey from the gods to the son of man.
You're at the gates of human evolution don't you understand?
Why don't you understand?

(Understand) We don't have too much time
here, and time it travels far too fast!
We're not too far we're too near, before they take it from our hands!
Why don't you teach your heart to feel, and give your love love,
Give your love love, give it all away.
Why don't you teach your heart to talk and give your love love,
Give your love love and give it all away.
Why don't you teach your heart to feel, and give your love love,
Give your love love, give it all away.
Why don't you teach your heart to talk and give your love love,
Give your love love,
Gimme, gimme what I need.

We don't have too much time here, and time it travels far too fast!
