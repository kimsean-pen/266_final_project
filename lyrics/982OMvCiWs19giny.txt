I felt the blisters below the verse
And the universe waiting to explode
And I felt the words crawl out of my skull
And now you know exactly what you showed

Don't bother pretending
I seem fine, I like that, I'm a mess
I can't stand much longer in my head
I think it's time for pulling this

Became so-so suicidal
And now I know the ugly form of kill

Don't bother pretending
I seem fine, I like that, I'm a mess
I can't stand much longer in my head
I think it's time for pulling this

Don't bother pretending
I seem fine, I'm trying to confess
I can't stand much longer in my head
But it's not time for pulling this

You can't remember

Don't bother pretending
I seem fine, I like that, I'm a mess
I can't stand much longer in my head
I think it's time for pulling this

Don't bother pretending
I seem fine, I'm trying to confess
I can't stand much longer in my head
But it's not time for pulling this
