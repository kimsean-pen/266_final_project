The tide made it easier
And time made us reasonable
The currents no longer deceivers

We were the reasons for us losing ground
We were the reasons for why the lights went out
We were the reasons for the years we had
And we were the reasons to why it end at last

The struggling, the reaching
The searching for feelings
That weren't there no longer
From splendor to nothing
The rising, the falling
The giving, the taking
To fathom it's over
It's over It's over
I left without knowing and withered without it showing
Discontent made us seekers
Silence has never been this silent and the winter never so widened

We were the reasons for us losing ground
We were the reasons for why the lights went out on us
We were the reasons for all the years we had
And we were the reasons to why it end at last

My heartbeats echoes lonely
And the emptiness the same
It's not about the breaking
But the rising with an aim
The rising with an aim

Too many reasons to not stand my ground
Too many reasons to not carry on this blind
Too many seasons where we held on tight
And too many reasons to not leave this night

The struggling the stretching
The inventing of feelings
We're feeling no longer
We're feeling no longer
The tension the sensing the knowing you are lacking
To the chasing of pieces the hunting so tiring
The missing the longing
The essence that was needed
To knowing it's over
To knowing that it's over
