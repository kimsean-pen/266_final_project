Everybody's talking 'bout the way you left your man
So wave goodbye and
Everybody's talking 'bout the way you held his hand
So we'll grip real tight

Cause we're all just drowning
All just drowning
These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

Everybody's talking 'bout the way you cut your hair
I could give a fuck and
Everybody's talking 'bout the way you smoke that there
I don't care at all

Cause we're all just drowning
All just drowning
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you!

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

All your life
I let
You down

All your life
I let
You down

Not again,
Not again,
Not again

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

So say goodbye to all my friends
I fell in love with her again, my baby
'Cause I'm not that kind of girl

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
My friend 'cause I'm not that kind of girl.
