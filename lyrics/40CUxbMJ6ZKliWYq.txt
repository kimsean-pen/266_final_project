No one's getting to wait for me
The useless boy so lost and afraid
Now I need to numb the endless pain
Ever since you left things just aren't the same

You were the pill that was stuck in my throat
Never around when I needed you most
Do we take this resentment to our unmarked graves?
Bitter goodbyes, we left thing in lies and mistakes that we made

Lost touch, it's been so long since we caught up (We caught up)
The life we left behind has crossed my mind all the time
Was it all just too much?
Cause we're losing touch. A silhouette you won't take shape to
What's worse than to say farewell to a
friend in a casket they made all by themselves?

I didn't want to be the nail in your
heel or the itch on your back you always feel
Lips move so fast when you speak our past
Did you forget the part where we couldn't make this last?
I don't know how it got this bad
Was it wrong to leave and not forgive?
But look at all the damage you did from backhanded compliments
So, please understand
I left home to find my place in life

Lost touch, it's been so long since we caught up (We caught up)
The life we left behind has crossed my mind all the time
Was it all just too much?
Cause we're losing touch. A silhouette you won't take shape to
What's worse than to say farewell to a
friend in a casket they made all by themselves?
(Made all by themselves,
made all by themselves, made all by themselves)

I'm not one to think of salvation with people like you so complacent
I know I'll never be one you'll
missed, so I'll step back to try and erase it

It's so difficult to be honest with yourself
Leaving you with a peace of mind
Is closure that I hope to find
And this broken head heard every word you said
Maybe one day I'll learn from it
All the lies and the hate you spit

And I gave it all up, to be used as just a crutch
When it rained, it poured
We had planned for so much more

Lost touch, it's been so long since we caught up (We caught up)
The life we left behind has crossed my mind all the time
Was it all just too much?
Cause we're losing touch. A silhouette you won't take shape to
What's worse than to say farewell to a
friend in a casket they made all by themselves?
