People always change
But I'm scared that I will always stay the same
Hear them talking 'bout my picture in the frame
But it's upside down
I don't know who to blame
In twenty years I will be nothing
To you and your mind
But in your heart you're holding something
For the rest of your life
Say what you have to say
It's just the way it goes
I don't have any answers
You're programmed to be mine
I took you for a ride
It's time we all let go now
I remember all the nights
Alone together on the roof 'till it was bright
Gone forever like the wind that took the kite
We leave it all behind
Say what you have to say
It's just the way it goes
I don't have any answers
You're programmed to be mine
I took you for a ride
It's time we all let go now
The truth may never be revealed
Because your heart is a spinning wheel
You said so many things that couldn't be true
So tonight, I'll say I knew!
Oh yeah you'll find your way back
I'm sure but I don't know how
You know I'd like to stay
But my instincts tell me
Say what you have to say
It's just the way it goes
I don't have any answers
You're programmed to be mine
I took you for a ride
It's time we all let go now
We'll find our way back
In such a crazy world
We'll find our way back
In such a crazy world
We'll find our way back
In such a crazy world
We'll find our way back
In such a crazy world
