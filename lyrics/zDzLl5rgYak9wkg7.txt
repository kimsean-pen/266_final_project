In here, every shadow in the ground passes
Me by... slow... flickering above me. and
Silently they (like in a dream) growl over
Me... be-witched i do follow their beautiful
Ways, beside tis wintry frozen palace. take
Me to another world, to another conscious-
Ness... away of this time. and they do arose
Me... and i do watch... with broken eyes
How this weather... forever will stay...
In my frozen heart...
