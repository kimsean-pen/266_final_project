Now that everybody's here
Could we please have your attention?
There is nothing left to fear
No, now that bigfoot is captured
But are the children really right, alright, alright
But are the children really right, alright, alright
Now are the children all alright

There is danger in the night
There are things we can't control but
Will we give ourselves a fright
When we become less than human?
There are people who say why
Oh why, oh why?
Now there are other ways to die
Oh why, oh why?
But upon this tidal wave
Oh God, oh God
But upon this tidal wave
Oh God, oh God
Of young blood, young blood, young blood, young blood
Young blood, young blood, young blood, young blood

We are men who stay alive
Who send your children away now
We are calling from a tower
Expressing what must be
Everyone's opinion
"They are going out to bars
And they are getting into cars
I have seen them with my own eyes"
"America please help them!"
Now they are child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars, child stars, child stars
Child stars, child stars
With their sex
And their drugs
And their rock
And rock
And rock
And rock and roll, hey!
