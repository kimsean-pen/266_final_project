You're used to grey England Skies
Cloudy days, colder nights
And your heart's not right
Thought you'd be quite happy there

In that warm New York air
But your heart's not right
But if you sing along with me
Do you think you could ever smile again?

If you sing this melody
Do you think you could laugh again my friend?
Just try for me

Sing oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Don't wait for England to chime
Not for your heart or mine
I know time is never kind
You missed your warm winter boots

Say the tea's not as good
But you'll be alright
Everyone is going out in summer hats
And colored T-shirts now
Take a walk around the park
I know it will be better soon somehow
Just try for me

Sing oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

And I'll keep on waiting
I'll keep on waiting
I'll keep on waiting
For you

Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
