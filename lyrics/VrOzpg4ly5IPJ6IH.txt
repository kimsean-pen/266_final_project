I think it's time to let go
'Cause I know this ain't worth it anymore
I got a mind of my own
It's clear that I don't miss you like I did before

Said you're falling out of love
Guess you had enough
Packed up all your stuff and disappeared
And I thought I gave a fuck, but I already gave you up
When you left me in a flood of my own tears

What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Said you wanna leave me, leave me
You're the one that needs me
What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Boy you made it easy, easy
You're the one that needs me

Why you acting concerned?
Does it hurt now you know I'm moving on?
It's like the roles have reversed
Tables have turned
How does it feel to be alone?

Said you're falling out of love
Guess you had enough
Packed up all your stuff and disappeared
And I thought I gave a fuck
But I already gave you up
When you left me in a flood of my own tears

What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Said you wanna leave me, leave me
You're the one that needs me
What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Boy you made it easy, easy
You're the one that needs me

(Bounce right back, bounce right back)
(Bounce right back)

What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Said you wanna leave me, leave me
You're the one that needs me
What you gonna do when I bounce right back?
Bet you wouldn't expect that
Boy you made it easy, easy
You're the one that needs me

(Bounce right back, bounce right back)
(Bounce right back, bounce right back)
