Somewhere down on Fullerton
There's a place we used to go to get away from it all
But I'm still trying to figure out why
Things feel so wrong when they felt so right
Felt so right four years ago

So please don't go away
I just want this feeling to stay with me forever
Forever I said
Please don't go away
I just want you to stay with me forever

Somewhere down on Fullerton
There's a place that meant so much to everybody like me
