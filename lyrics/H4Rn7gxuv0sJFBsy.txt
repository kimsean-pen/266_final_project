Breaking in a sweat, like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out?
Nothing left to lose, detonate the fuse
Another breaking news blowout

Ain't it beautiful?
So unusual
Life's a gas and it's running out
Living a cliche, gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
Alright

A blink of an eye, barely scraping by
Dominated by passer by's
Feeling out of luck when the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind

Getting off a bin, get a second wind
Another promise, just make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
With the signal is out of range, ain't it strange?, ain't it strange?

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
Alright

Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
Alright

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?

Carpe diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
