Breaker, breaker, one, two, three
This pipe dream has a grip on me
Mother, Father, tell me please
Why did I come here just to leave?

A tribe of low lives
A pack of deadbeats
Fuck a slow life
I want the fresh meat
An old dog in dire straits
Like a rat I took the bait

And I question everything
What have I done to me?
This failure starts to sing
I've got nothing to say
Not enough fuel to go very far
So let's stay here and burn down the bar

Despite my running in place, I'm making good time
(Making good time)
But how can we make it to the top
If we're dying on the climb
I'm really losing my faith to keep this dream alive
(Keep this dream alive)
We're in love with what we lost
And I'm burning in the hell inside my mind

Why'd you stopped believing?
Look alive, it's killing season
The future's scratching at my door
Wretched filthy to the core

And I question everything
Left with the bitter taste
Might have to disagree
That this was all for good
Not enough fuel to go very far
So let's stay here and burn down the bar
If we're going down, we're going down hard

Despite my running in place, I'm making good time
(Making good time)
But how can we make it to the top
If we're dying on the climb
I'm really losing my faith to keep this dream alive
(Keep this dream alive)
We're in love with what we lost
And I'm burning in hell

Botched messiah
Part-time god
Social pariah
Full-time fraud (A fucking fraud)
I need the wasted soul
I face the leading role
I feed on snuffed out wishes
I piss on all my burned down bridges
My bleeding heart might tip the scale
'Cause I'm living life beyond the pale, yeah
Why'd you stop believing?
Look alive motherfucker, it's killing season

Despite my running in place, I'm making good time
But how can we make it to the top
If we're dying on the climb
I'm really losing my faith to keep this dream alive
(Keep this dream alive)
We're in love with what we lost
And I'm burning in the hell inside my mind

Breaker, breaker, one, two, three
This pipe dream has a grip on me
Mother, Father, tell me please
Why did I come here just to leave?
I've eaten crow, lost skeleton keys
The nomad life is the life for me
When hope gives up the ghost
Just shove the truth back down their throats
