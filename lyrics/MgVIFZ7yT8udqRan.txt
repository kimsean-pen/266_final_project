Love is blind
Love is only sorrow
Love is no tomorrow
Since you went away
Love is blind
How well I remember
In the heat of summer pleasure
Winter fades

How long will it take
Before I can't remember
Memories I should forget
I've been burning
Since the day we met

Love is blind
Love is without a mercy
Love is "now you've hurt me
"now you've gone away"
Love is blind
Love is no horizon
And I'm slowly dying
Here in yesterday

In the morning
Waking to the sound of weeping
Someone else should weep for me
Now it's over
Lover, let me be

Love is blind
Love is your caress
Love is tenderness
And momentary pain
Love is blind
How well I remember
In the heat of summer pleasure
Winter fades
