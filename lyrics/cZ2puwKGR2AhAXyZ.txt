You say love, I say killing time,
What's mine is yours, and yours is mine.
You make me laugh, I make you cry,
I guess that rhymes...

You're contained by doors and walls,
I'm contained by your control.
Your overthrown, but under warn,
I told you so...

We're singing for the stingin' belle,
She's clearly lost her way.
Craving all the simple times,
Inside her tragic game.

Grow some balls, and speak your mind,
You think you're cool like a porcupine.
You're more like doves, that are taking flight,
The sky is mine.

We're singing for the stingin' belle,
She's clearly lost her way.
Craving all the simple times,
Inside her tragic game.

We're singing for the stingin' belle,
She's clearly lost her way.
Craving all the simple times,
Inside her tragic game.
