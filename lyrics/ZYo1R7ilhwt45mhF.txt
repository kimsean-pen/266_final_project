So here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to keep
The ground on my feet
It seems the world's
Falling down around me
The nights are long
I'm singing this song
To try and make the answers
More than maybe

And I'm so confused
About what to do
Sometimes I want
To throw it all away

So here I am
Growing older all the time
Looking older all the time
Feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman

I'm trying to sleep
I lost count of the sheep
My mind is racing faster
Every minute
What could I do more
Yeah I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles
But I can't quit

And I'm so confused
About what to do
Sometimes I want
To throw it all away

Controlling everything in site
I'm feeling weak
I don't feel right
You're telling me
I have to change
Telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do
Is just sit and watch time go
Then I'll have to say good-bye
Life's too short to watch it fly
To watch it fly

So here I am
Growing older all the time
Looking older all the time
Feeling younger in my mind

And here I am
Doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am
Pretending I'm a superman
