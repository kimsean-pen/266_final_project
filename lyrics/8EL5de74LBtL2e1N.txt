A bright blue sky's what I used to see but
My vision's been torn after all that's been
And I know it's not right and I've crossed the line but
Please understand that there was a time when

I let my heart go just to watch it burn
So I told myself it's a lesson learned
But did I really learn?

Jealousy
I guess you're finally taking over me
Jealousy
I'm suffering from your control
And you're covering me like a bear skin coat
Getting harder to breathe under your control
Jealousy
Oh can't you stay away from me?

The voices inside of my head
Keep me wondering where we're at
Like a fire, it starts to spread
Covering up my skin and flesh and

I keep fighting
But the monster won't let me win, oh
I keep fighting
But the monster won't let me win, oh

Jealousy
I guess you're finally taking over me
Jealousy
I'm suffering from your control
And you're covering me like a bear skin coat
Getting harder to breathe under your control
Jealousy
Oh can't you stay away from me?
Uh uh...

I can't breathe
I've lost my soul
'Cause you've taken all
I thought I'd know

Jealousy
I guess you're finally taking over me
Jealousy
I'm suffering from your control

And you're covering me like a bear skin coat
Getting harder to breathe under your control
And you're covering me like a bear skin coat
Getting harder to breathe under your control

Jealousy
I guess you're finally taking over me
Jealousy
I'm suffering from your control
And you're covering me like a bear skin coat
Getting harder to breathe under your control
Jealousy
Oh can't you stay away from me?
Uh uh...
