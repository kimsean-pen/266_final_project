I am a boy
From the high country
And I got a little love
For the offering
I come down from the mountain
I bow to the sea
And Carolina low
I will carry thee

Gonna take you up
Gonna take you round
But O your poor little pant legs
All dragging down
Did you crack your lip?
Did you skin your knee?
And Carolina low

I will carry thee

What is sealed with a handshake
Is spoiled with a kiss
You gotta a ugly little mouth, boy
And it's come to this
I'm bound for the hilltop
Gonna make it bleed

And Carolina low
I will carry thee

I am a boy
From the high country
And I got a little love
For the offering
And I got a little love
For the offering
And I got a little love
For the offering
