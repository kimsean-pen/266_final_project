Career boy
Working overtime
Career boy
One thing on my mind

Cheap office coffee
Is pumping through my veins (pumping through my veins now)
I work for the man, yeah
But you know I love the chains

I could never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
Workin' so hard after hours
'Til I see the sunlight
Stuck up in the office tower
You know it's pure joy
And that's my superpower
I'm a career boy

Career boy
You know they've got me working overtime, yeah
Career boy
And you know I've got that one track mind
Oh, yeah

Even after I get what I want
I can see baby, baby
That it's lonely at the top, yeah
Career boy
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop

Business and pleasure
I like to mix the two (mix it up, mix it up)
Hangin' in the break room, I'm mixin' it with you

I could never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
Workin' so hard after hours
'Til I see the sunlight
Stuck up in the office tower
You know it's pure joy
And that's my superpower
I'm a career boy

Career boy (career boy)
You know they've got me working

Oh, yeah

Even after I get what I want

Career boy (career boy)
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop

I'm addicted to the work, I
I love the way it hurts, I
The suits and pencil skirts
I get what I need 'cause I'm greedy for it

'Cause I'm addicted to the pressure
Yeah, but the burden is a pleasure
Come on, hit me with your ledger
Close to the edge, face down on the desk I'm

Career boy (career boy)
