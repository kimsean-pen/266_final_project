Do you remember when
We were young, adventure had no end
Those were the days my friend
But I'm not talking about that at all

Do you remember when
You marred my future with a sickly parasitic pall?
That was the day that the earth stalled
That was the day the earth stalled
On that day that the earth stalled

Friction, bonds and gravity
All harmonic motion ceased
Life itself could not maintain
From that singularity

Try to withstand a magnetic storm
With no one to keep you warm
Waiting for the rest to fall
Since the day that the earth stalled

That was the day the earth stalled
Since the day that the earth stalled
That was the day the earth stalled
On that day that the earth stalled
