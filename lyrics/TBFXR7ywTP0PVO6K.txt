I wanna dance till my legs break
I wanna love till my heart aches
I want the cause of my death
To be amazing sex
And I'll laugh with my last breath

Let's grow old and die young
Let's grow old and die young
We ain't done the best is yet to come
Let's grow old and die young

愛すほどに壊して
君は僕を試してる
そんな君を許して
そして僕を許して
その答えを探して
まわって

Let's grow old and die young
Let's grow old and die young
We ain't done the best is yet to come
Let's grow old and die young

So, they say our days
Are numbers on the page
Can't take our youth away

Let's grow old and die young
Let's grow old and die young
We ain't done the best is yet to come
Let's grow old and die young

Let's grow old and die young
We ain't done the best is yet to come
Let's grow old and die young
