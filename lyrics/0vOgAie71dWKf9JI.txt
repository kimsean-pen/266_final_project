No, it's not how you do it
It's not like your being discrete
Running round the nation
Your world is in reality
And what we have and who we know
And walking down our street

So you're gonna run
So you're gonna run
So you're gonna run
(I can see the way this will go down)
So you're gonna run
(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)
So you're gonna run

It's not how you do it
Its not like you're being discrete
Saying we need time
But just backboarding the shit out of me
So I can't let things go back to the place they used to be

'Cause you're gonna run
'Cause you're gonna run
'Cause you're gonna run
(I can see the way this will go down)
'Cause you're gonna run
(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)
And you're gonna run

I can see the way this will go down
You're just another lost and found
And if you're fine with how we parted
We can finish what we started
If you can't look me in the eyes
I won't look back, don't be surprised
Please just don't kick me when I'm down
You're just another lost and found
Out of all my friends I'm the only person
That understands the thought
They said go and get her
And part of me thinks you will put down your guard
The other part knows better

And you're gonna run
So you're gonna run
So you're gonna run
(I can see the way this will go down
You're just another lost and found)
So you're gonna run
(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)
