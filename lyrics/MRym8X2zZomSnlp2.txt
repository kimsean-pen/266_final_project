Mechanized patterns, fed since birth method
Separate spirit, disconnect every end
Breeding a thought, relieving the soul I'm growing
Fragments of hope awake inside me
Consciousness failed, the path to control eroding
Originate repressive measures

I'm the one the parasite's sucking on
We're the ones the parasite's sucking on
Disconnect every end

Unnecessary meaningless device
thought controlled, programmed
Balanced walk on the line
Radiant light, expansive and bright, is covered
Swallow the lie, let them take over
Greed is a horde that comes like a storm and conquers
strongly implying unfair methods

I'm the one the parasite's sucking on, you're the one the parasite's sucking on.

I have more than you
I have more than you, I have more than you
I need a lot to care for; I need a lot to slow me down
I have more than you, I have more than you
I need a lot to care for; I need a lot to hold you down
I will stand when things burn down

Never fought harder than this, I built my temple on this
Pushing, fighting, bleeding, taking, giving
Every second closer to the ceiling
I will assemble all this, down to the last broken piece
Tension in the atmosphere is lower, gravity is slowly taking over.
