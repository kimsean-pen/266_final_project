Ryan: "This next song is from our brand new album by the name of 'Pretty odd'

And, uh, this song, it's a rock and roll song called 'She's A Handsome Woman'
And it goes like this..."
Go On (oh oh oh ah)
Innocence.
Sunk the glow and drowned in covers

send for all your absent lovers things.
Sheepish Wolves.
Looking lived in eating buttons
Wink, just don't put your teeth on me.
Go On (oh oh oh ah)

Accidents.
Let the evening in the backdoor
filled the room ceiling to the floor.
Beat backbones.
Grazed the poem and made it strange

I wasn't born to be a skeleton.
Go on
grab your hat and fetch a camera.
Go on, film the world before it happens.
Go on

grab your hat and fetch a camera.
Go on, film the world before it happens.
Go on
Jealous orchard.
The sky is falling off the ceiling

while I'm tucking fibs into a cookie jar.
Reverie.
It's useless searching in the cupboards
when everything you have is on your back.
Go on (oh oh oh ah)
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on, grab your hat and fetch a camera
Go on, film the world before it happens
Go on (oh oh oh ah)
Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happens
Film the world before it happensfr
