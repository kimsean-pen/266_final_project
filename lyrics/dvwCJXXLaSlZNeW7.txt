I'm blessed, I am a witch
And I float above everyone who would do harm on me
They crane their necks
They call me a bitch
For using my powers at a party
I don't wanna spend another night in jail
For possessing the skills which I learned to defend myself

What if I say I'm one in five
Grown accustomed to violence
Can I levitate past it?
On the ground, my tongue's too honest
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to spend another night in jail
For hiding the truth which I did to defend myself

I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you

Oh, I wanted to be
In a portrait of love, but there's food in your teeth
Oh, I wanted to be
An example of love, but my spell's getting weak

Oh, now I can see
That he won't stop running, won't stop running from me
Oh, now I can see
That he won't stop running, won't stop running from me

I don't want to love you
I don't want to love you

But I'm not a mind reader
Nor still the coyote ripping at your throat
I'm not the one you feel you owe your sorries to

Along the wilted heather
He shook me by the feather in my cloak
It's now, or it's for never
Even if you're sorry
Sorry as a snake
As a snake can be

I'm blessed with perfect pitch
I waste it on songs that you never even heard of
I'm not gonna spend another night in jail
I know I'll survive
And I don't need your belief or your help
No I don't need your belief or your help
Oh, I wanted to be
In a portrait of love but you're running from me
