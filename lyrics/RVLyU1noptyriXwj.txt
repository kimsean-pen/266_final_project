Yesterday there was a man
Standing in my expensive boots
It's hard to say where he came from
I can't seem to shake these substitutes

And isn't it fun losing your mind
Bending underneath that pressure
Here what it's like pieces of life
Pieces of mind

It's here again scratching at the door
Just when you thought the coast was clear
It's hard to say how this begins
But why can't you let me under your skin

Isn't it fun losing your mind
Bending underneath that pressure
Here what it's like pieces of life
Pieces of mind

Isn't it fun losing your mind
Kneeling inside that pressure
Here what it's like pieces of life
Pieces of mind
