Remember oceans
Violet parasols
Black sand beach, where we'd lay
You had stones for irises
I was so sure it was fate
Sea was lapdancing the tide
He said "Don't look back, we're heading south"
I loved this world with all I had
Now I'm ready to go

Waltz me to the grave
Savour every moment we've made
Dance me down to the ground that I came from
Waltz me to the grave
Waltz me into sleep that won't wake
Spin me round to the sound that I came from

Holy head of stone
Finally I am found
So dance me down to the ground

Remember floating on lakes of evergreen
So much love and disarray
You were always my unrest
But I was so sure it was fate
Sea was lapdancing the tide
He said "Don't look back, come with us now"
I loved this world with all I had
Now I'm ready to go

Waltz me to the grave
Savor every moment that's made
Dance me down to the ground that I came from
Waltz me to the grave
Life was not a moment of grace
Spin me round to the sound that I came from

Holy head of stone
Finally I am found
So dance me down to the ground

Waltz me to the grave
Waltz me into sleep that won't
Waltz me to the grave
Life was not a moment of grace
