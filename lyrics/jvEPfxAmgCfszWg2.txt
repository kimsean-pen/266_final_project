It's the time, it's the season
For you to come home to me
Come back home to me
No pressure, there's no reason
Other than I want to see just what you do to me

Bring a smile, bring me out of myself
Bring me to the edge till I hold my breath and say
"It's the time, it's the season for you to run right through me"

I love how you move me around
Around
Around
Move me around
Around
Around

Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you
Everyone can hear when you're near I can never stay cool
When you come around, it's so clear I'm the colour of you
Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you

It's so easy for you to come home to me, come back home to me
People change, get so needy, but I know how to wait
So let them go crazy
Make me smile and I'll give you my best
I'll take my time and I'll push my fears away
Till the time, till the season when you come back to me

I love how you move me around
Around
Around
Move me around
Around
Around

Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you
Everyone can hear when you're near I can never stay cool
When you come around, it's so clear I'm the colour of you
Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you

Ooh your smile brings me out of myself
And over the edge until I almost lose and then just catch my breath

Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you
Everyone can hear when you're near I can never stay cool
When you come around, it's so clear I'm the colour of you
Everyone can see how I feel, how I feel about you
