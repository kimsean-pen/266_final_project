Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me.
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Feeding, feeding me.
And I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday,
But I look in the mirror, and I'm bigger in every way.

She said:
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."

I'm in Heaven now.
I can see you, Richard.
Goodbye, Hollywood.
Goodbye, Downey.
Hello, Janis.
Hello, Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends.
I'm so glad you're all here with me until the very end.

Dreaming, dreaming of how it's supposed to be,
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees.
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday,
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way.

She said:
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."

Hey, Mom, look! I'm up here!
I finally made it.
I'm playing the drums again, too.
Don't be sad - the band doesn't sound that bad.
And I remember, Mom, what you said.
You said, "Honey, you look so underfed."

Another green salad, another iced tea.
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me.
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday,
But I look in your eyes, and I'm bigger in every way.

She said:
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."

Goodbye, Richard, gotta go now.
I'm finally on my own, the band's got a gig.
Keep the love lights glowing.
Little girl's got the blues.
I can still hear Mama say, "Honey, don't let it go to your head."
