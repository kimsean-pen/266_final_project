Stuck in a hard place in the middle, walking on coals
Caught in holes, sorting the souls like the Sphinx and the riddle
Your invisible ripples surround me little by little

He's my only saviour
Living in a stateless zone
Searching for an answer
Everywhere he goes

Widening circles, the surface a living, physical mirror
Connecting fire with the fever, reflecting, I'm a believer
Let the whispers enfold you, pull you nearer and nearer
Little by little

He's my only saviour
Standing in a stateless zone
Waiting for the answer
Frozen to the bone
