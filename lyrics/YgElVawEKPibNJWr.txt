Now I'm a stranger in my own world
It's not your fault that I can't use words
Your eyes, a force I can't fight
Never touching they're dark as night, holding on
Now I'm a stranger, I know I'm gone

The highest love isn't always the best
Racing, my heart breaks through my chest
An electric reaction in me
It's not a choice to dance dangerously
Sometimes the highest love is to far to feel

I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up these dreams into the sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong

When there's nothing left, we'll walk away
Chasing a feeling we can't tame
You know the darkness no one believes
And know there's no relief in these dreams
When there's nothing left for us to feel

I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up these dreams into the sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong

In a time without memory
It's more than a fantasy
In a time without memory

I'm giving up, I'm giving up, I'm giving

Go, don't try to hold it
Go, don't cry about it
Go, don't try to hold it
Go, don't cry about it

I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up before the night is gone
I'm giving in, giving up strong
I'm giving up, you say it's now or never
I'm giving up, in time it's for the better
I'm giving up these dreams into the sun
I'm giving in, giving up strong
