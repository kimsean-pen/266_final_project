No I don't want to love you
cause I know how you are
thats why I have been staying away from you
thats why I haven't called ya
cause I know you could possess my body
I know you can make me scrawl
I know you can have me shaking
I know you could have me climbing the walls
thats why I don't want to love you
cause I know how you are
sure you say your right on and your righteous
but with me I know you'd be right off
you know I could possess your body too?
Dont cha?
You know I could make you crawl
and just as hard as I fall for you
boy
well you know you'd fall for me harder
thats why I dont want to love you
cause I know what you do to my heart
you'd scorch it just like hot iron
wow
leave me burning alone in the dark
cause I know you could make me suffer
I know you could drive me mad
when it got real
I know you'd disappear
thats why I AIN'T gonna love you
cause I know you like to be in charge
well with me
you know you couldn't control me
dontcha?
Cause you know i'd make you drop your guard
i'd have you eaten your ego
i'd make you pocket your pride
just as hard as I'd be loving you
you know you'd be loving me harder
thats why I dont want to love you.
