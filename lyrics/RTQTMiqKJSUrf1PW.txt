I think I dug a hole so deep
And lately it's been hard to sleep
Maybe I should dig
A little
More

Buried under covers, friend
Don't wanna play those songs again
Until I found someone
To play them for
Don't speak for me
I'll get with it; give it just a little longer
Don't speak for me
Yeah, I'll be there soon

Honestly
Everyday I feel a little bit stronger than I was when I was
When I was with you
Yeah, it's true
Yeah, it's true

You keep trying to box me in
Telling me it's sink or swim
Maybe I should sink
Until I
Stand

Out here where the water's deep
I think I found a voice in me
And someday we will walk
Upon dry land
Don't speak for me
I'll get with it; give it just a little longer
Don't speak for me
Yeah, I'll be there soon
Honestly
Every day I feel a little bit stronger than I was when I was
When I was with you
Yeah, it's true
Yeah, it's true
Yeah, it's true

I couldn't find myself in you
You led me the long way down
I couldn't find myself in you
You led me the long way down
I couldn't find myself in you
I couldn't find myself, it's true
Don't speak for me
I'll get with it; give it just a little longer
Don't speak for me
Yeah I'll be there soon

Honestly
Every day I feel a little bit stronger than I was when I was
When I was with you
Yeah, it's true (You don't speak for me)
Yeah, it's true (You don't speak for me)
Yeah, it's true (You don't speak for me)
No, you don't speak for me
