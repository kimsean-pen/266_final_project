Order
And nearly the time for empty rain
Describes me better
Or maybe the You and the I and your night sky eyes
Would mean we fold, fold, collapse

And I can see through
Waves hand, one less you
Without it was torn in two
They coloured our lips
Green flash lit
As if we lived out in nature

Listen, they're shouting the slogans we forgot
As time went with us
I know now
We were never young in the mesh of youth
And we are told, told to love

And I can see through
Waves hand, one less you
Without it was torn in two
They coloured our lips
Green flash lit
As if we lived out in nature

Scarred with no pain
Slow day, blown away
I'm a reprobate
Our ways don't change
