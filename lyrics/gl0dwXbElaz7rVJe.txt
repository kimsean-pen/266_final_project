Tho' you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster white walls
T.V. antenna's in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you got
Tho' you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangster lean
Gangster white walls
T.V. antenna's in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you got
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangster lean, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangster lean, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene with a gangster lean, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Tho' you may not drive a great big Cadillac
Gangster white walls
T.V. antenna's in the back
You may not have a car at all
But remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
