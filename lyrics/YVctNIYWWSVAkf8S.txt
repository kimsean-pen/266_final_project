Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it

Went to the No Nukes rally
The Don Quixotes made me feel silly
Went to the punk rock show
Nobody that I know did go
Went to my university
Boys and girls dress up and look pretty
Went to the party last night
I was there, but it was really out of sight

My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them

Well I just came from my girl's bed
Don't think I'll ever forget what she said
I tried to show her my song
She laughed and said the chords were all wrong
Went out to look at the moon
Blood red and the water was too
Just ran away from her house
Not another word from her pretty little mouth

My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them
Not my world

So stop koncka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Oh stop knocking
Stop it

Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it

Well let me tell you what I did
I went to the toilet and sat down
There was no one else around
I went inside my closet
Took my guitar and strummed upon it
Went out to run 10 miles
Sifted through my personal files
Went to my desk to study
There's no world, no love, nobody but me
And that's the way it's gonna be yeah
That's the way it's gonna be yeah
That's the way it's gonna be cuz'
My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
Oh I have no use for them
Not my world

So stop koncka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocka-knocka-knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Knocking on my world
