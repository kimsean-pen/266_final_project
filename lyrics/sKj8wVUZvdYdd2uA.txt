Hey sugar, Hey
You think I'd ever let you go get away
Ain't gonna happen you know what I mean
Hard as it seems
Everybody's got to dream a little dream

Chill baby, Chill
I wish I could but I can't stop until
Need a shot of you to the brain
Here we go again
Keep em moving baby like a runaway train

Like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the only chance we get to live
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Cause my love won't wait for tomorrow
Like it's the last dance at the disco
Like it's the only song we get to sing
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Till the sun comes up sugar
Don't stop

Shake baby, Shake
The only habit I don't want to break
Your sending a shiver down my spine
Playing with my mind
Accelerate cause were running out of time

Feel baby, Feel
I want you from your head to your heals
Like I want you from your heart to your soul
Baby now you know
Move a little closer and we're gonna loose control

Like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the only chance we get to live
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Cause my love won't wait for tomorrow
Like it's the last dance at the disco
Like it's the only song we get to sing
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Till the sun comes up sugar
Don't stop
Don't stop (don't stop oooohhhh)
Don't stop (don't stop oooohhhh)
Don't stop (don't stop oooohhhh)
Don't stop (don't stop)

Shake baby, Shake
Shake baby, Shake
The only habit I don't want to break
Shake baby, Shake

Like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the only chance we get to live
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Cause my love won't wait for tomorrow
Like it's the last dance at the disco
Like it's the only song we get to sing
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Till the sun comes up sugar

Like it's the last night on earth
Like it's the only chance we get to live
Let's give it all away
Give it all we got
Till the sun comes up sugar
Don't stop
