Lustily fall I into an apocalypse
Hungrily cry I for something behind your lips

Guess I believed in a system
Where the bodies outweigh the cost
Guess I believed in a system, a system

(Stop!)

Skin to skin
Deprived, I know that you need me now
Wipe the conscience dry for something we both allow

Yeah, we believed in a system
Where the temperature fuels the fire
Yeah, we believed in a system, a system

(Stop!)

But everybody knows it's wrong
Everybody knows it's wrong
And I can't do this to the one I love
I hope I can't go on
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong

Skin to skin
Deprived, I know that you need me now
Wipe the conscience dry for something we both allow

Yeah, we believed in a system
Where the bodies outweigh the cost
Yeah, we believed in a system, a system

Everybody knows it's wrong
Everybody knows it's wrong
Everybody knows it's wrong
Everybody knows it's wrong
Everybody knows it's wrong

And I can't do this to the one I love
I hope I can't go on
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
I hope I prove myself wrong
