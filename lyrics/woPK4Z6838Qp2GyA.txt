Hand me your doubts, worries and fears
Within this embrace they shall all disappear
A love beyond, a love unreal
This sadness you felt you will no longer feel

This world and all that there is
I'll give it to you, all to you
Hand me your love and all that you are
Could you promise me, as I promised you

Abandoned lies, the uncovered truth
Of who you are and who's of worth
A love beyond, a love unreal
This sadness you felt you will no longer feel

This world and all that there is
I'll give it to you, all to you
Hand me your love and all that you are
Could you promise me, as I promised you

Hear my words
I speak no lies
The dawn of the new
With open eyes

A love beyond, a love unreal
This sadness you felt you will no longer feel

This world and all that there is
I'll give it to you, all to you
Hand me your love and all that you are
Could you promise me, as I promised you
