It's time to tear this place down
I've got the last game on my mind
Not seen my friends in ages
Have I been left behind?

It's time to figure out why
I find myself in custody
With each and every question
Words come so easily

Fly to El Salvador
I don't know why and I don't know what for
I've seen the picture for myself
Where did that label go?
I tried it out but it didn't work so
I'll choose the picture for myself

It's time to start all over
Take only one thing spare to wear
Head for the check-in lights and
Get up into the air

It's time to take new measures
Someone will put us up tonight
Far from my place of rest
I've almost got you in sight

Fly to El Salvador
I don't know why and I don't know what for
I've seen the picture for myself
Where did that label go?
I tried it out but it didn't work so
I'll choose the picture for myself

First class and big hotels
(I can't quite put my finger on it)
Videos and global sales
(I can't quite put my finger on it)
Free drinks that you pay yourselves
(I can't quite put my finger on it)

Fly to El Salvador
I don't know why and I don't know what for
I've seen the picture for myself
Where did that label go?
I tried it out but it didn't work so
I'll choose the picture for myself
