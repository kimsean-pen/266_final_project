Turn it up, turn it up

(Verse x2)
You're playing games, oh oh
Do you think that you can break my heart again?
Everything's changed, oh oh
Are you happy that you're driving me insane?

(Pre-Chorus x2)
Everything's changed,
You're not the same
Who can I blame?
Who can I blame?

(Chorus)
I've been caught up in a lie
Haven't called you in a while
Confusion, confusion
You've been up in a lie
But at least you could've tried
Confusion, confusion

Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion

(Verse x2)
Can you explain? Oh oh
Do you really think my heart could take the pain?
It's such a shame, oh oh
Now you're happy, now you've nothing left to gain

(Pre-Chorus x2)
Everything's changed,
You're not the same
Who can I blame?
Who can I blame?

(Chorus)
I've been caught up in a lie
Haven't called you in a while
Confusion, confusion
You've been up in a lie
But at least you could've tried
Confusion, confusion

Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion

(Bridge)
Never lie to me again, never lie to me again
Never lie to me again, never lie to me again
Never lie to me again, never lie to me again
Never lie to me again, never lie to me again

(Chorus x2)
I've been caught up in a lie
Haven't called you in a while
Confusion, confusion
You've been up in a lie
But at least you could've tried
Confusion, confusion

Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion

I've been caught up in a lie... caught up in a lie...
I've been caught up in a lie... caught up in a lie...
