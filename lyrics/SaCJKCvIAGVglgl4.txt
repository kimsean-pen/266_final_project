Where she collapses into the shore
Pump a light bottle down, ask her for me
There a man lay dying in ice gasket had busted out
Pinned him like a vice
As the sun sank into repose
A friend knelt down listened to his dying words as he froze

Tell my love don't mourn, too intense
I'm going down to her great good expense
Now the air is quiet and still
Wish I was back home on the knell of the hill

Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Whatever the people will drive,
That's what I will survive

All of my friends, my enemies too
Live in the shadows of the dirtiest fuel
Burns the land down the paper to ruin
While wind's always whistling an infinite tune

Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Whatever the people will drive,
That's where I will be live

Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Whatever the people will drive,
That's where I will be live

Now so long he waits for something
Closing his eyelids with his face turning grey
When the workers cleaned up the spill
Sent the man home to his knell in the hill
