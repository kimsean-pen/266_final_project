Once I had a close friend
I knew him for quite a while
He seemed alright to me

We had this deal together
Took all my money and time
And then he went away
Taking all that was mine

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end

Once it was fun to worry
About who was in control
Could look into the future

But now it don't seem right
Passion is filling the air
Profits are better than life

And things are harder to bear
Things are harder to bear

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end

It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead end
Dead end, end, end, dead end!
Oh!

Once I had a lover
I knew her for quite a while
She seemed alright to me

And then she was gone
She took my lovin' and time
Taking all that was mine

And leaving me far behind
Leaving me far behind

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end

It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead end
Dead end
