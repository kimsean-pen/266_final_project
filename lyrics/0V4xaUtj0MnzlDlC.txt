The moon is an ad for the planet that I'm on
It's a channel that I'm on
I let it remind me
The roof is a lid
To a big compartment
Where I store my body and move with my mind

I want some help
Find me something else

Shackled to a window
Anything but open
I'm giving myself to
(what does it mean to send and receive at the same time?)
Shackled to a window
All but open
I'm giving myself to
Double vision

I move on the map to a new coordinate
I'm a dot on a grid
I know what I am
The flow of a place is a passive document
And I surprise myself by being part of it

Shackled to a window
Anything but open
I'm giving myself to
(what does it mean to send and receive at the same time?)
Shackled to a window
All but open
I'm giving myself to
Double vision
