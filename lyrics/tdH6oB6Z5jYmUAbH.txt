I need a little casual conversation girl with you
And you ain't gotta worry about a thing no more
Cause baby I got the keys for us

How about I pick you up at night
Meet me outside
Baby its a vibe

Roll down the windows
We can fly
I can see the stars baby in your eyes

And I can't wait no more

Baby cause I like you
You like me
Let's just get together

I like you
You like me
We don't need no invitation

Cause I like you
You like me
Let's just get together

I like you
You like me
We don't need no invitation girl

I need a little casual conversation girl with you
And you ain't gotta worry about a thing no more

I can see the stars baby in your eyes

And I can't wait no more

Baby cause I like you
