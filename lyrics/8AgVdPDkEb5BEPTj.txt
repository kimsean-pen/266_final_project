Every fall is weird
Every drop is painful
Oh, my
How you suffocate

As a pantomime
Your illegally
Oh my
How you suffocate

Every calling is a scream and don't step
You don't believe me and love
How you suffocate

My eyes reflect
The air
Flowing through your hair
How you suffocate

Look
Flowers are placed
The sun goes down and the mind seeks shelter
How to fix everything?
Oh

Every fall is weird
Every drop is painful
Oh, my
How you suffocate

Every calling is a scream and don't step
You don't believe me
And love
How you suffocate

Look, flowers are placed
The sun goes down and the mind seeks shelter
How to fix everything?
Oh

Look, flowers are placed
The sun goes down and the mind seeks shelter
How to fix everything?
Oh
