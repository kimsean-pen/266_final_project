I've never stolen a snack from the pharmacy
Jack asks me where I go, I reply slowly
He said what do you eat? Reply again slowly
I told him I eat anything but meat
And then he looked at me, and then she looked at me
And then I felt too strange to be seen

I always wear my hair up
I don't want to get the children's lice
He said what do you eat? Reply again slowly
I told him I eat anything but meat
And then he looked at me, and then she looked at me
And then I felt too strange to be seen

If you really love me, you will know when to leave me alone
I'm sorry that it's often, but I am not ready to let go
But I am not ready to let go
But I am not ready to let go

Can you feel it pouring out of me?
Is it cooling all around your feet?

If you really love me, you will know when to leave me alone
I'm sorry that it's often, but I am not ready to let go
But I am not ready to let go
But I am not ready to let go

I feel unique
I feel complete
There's a spell on me
I feel complete
