Must be disconcerting
How I discombob your mode
I've always been the only
Every classroom, every home
Case of chocolate on the moon
Collard greens and silver spoon
Little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes you can stick unto me

My weaponry is my energy
I tenderly fill my enemies with white lie

You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me, so you up the creek
You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me, couldn't possibly

Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh I

None of us are free
but some of us are brave
I dare you to shrink my wave
I'm on a new plane,
I'm all outta fucks to give, yeah
Fear ain't no way to live, yeah

Must be disconcerting
How I discombob your mode
I've always been the only, you're so unoriginal
Your words don't leave scars
Trust me I've heard them all
I may be small, I may speak soft,
But you can see the change in the water

Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, I, oh I
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh I

You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me, so you up the creek
You will never know everything, everything
I will never know everything, everything
You will never know everything, everything
And you don't know me
