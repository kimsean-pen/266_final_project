Shhhhhh
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
It's on the hush, only you and I will know

Shhhhhhh
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
I'm not gonna tell yo' mamma

It's on the hush, only you and I will know
You can trust in me

It's on the hush, only you and I will know
Hang a little while longer
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
I'm not gonna tell yo' daddy baby
It's on the hush, yeah
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
Hang a little while longer
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
Hang a little while longer
Don't go away baby, hang a while longer
If you don't mind, I know
If you don't mind, if you got the time, come on...

(Spoken) Come on y'all, come on, what's up, get up, come on

If you know the words...

It's on the hush, only you and I will know
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
Keep hanging, (just don't stop my love)
It's on the hush, only you and I will know

It's on the hush
