Oh, I've heard about Noah's flood
Washed away a world of sin
Some say destruction is an act of love
And think it should happen again
Let's go rain
Let's go rain again
Let's go rain
Let's go rain again
Once upon a time I was a Christian
I didn't know I didn't need to know
Now when the sky speaks I'm going to listen
And when it's pissing I'll just figure I'm alone
Let's go rain
Let's go rain again
Come on rain
Let's go rain again
Oh I should
Build a wooden ark
Wouldn't you rather live
On an ocean of guitars?

Come on rain
Let's go rain again
Let's go rain
Let's go rain again

Maybe you're not a believer
Or maybe you don't have a choice
Or maybe it's a fever that you haven't caught yet
'Cause you haven't met Scott McCaughey
Let's go rain
Let's go rain again
Let's go rain
Still no rain again
