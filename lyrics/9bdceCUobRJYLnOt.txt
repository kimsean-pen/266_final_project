Nights we are young
I was invincible
I was living for myself
My survival suicidal cult
You can live that way
And I find myself begging you

I pretend I was good to you
That you're always on my mind
For a moment you believed it too
But I can lie forever
And you found the truth hunting you
(Hunting you)

I know you're leaving
Cos I always take too long
Cos I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
And I've got to find a way
To make things right with you

I never wanted you to save me
Another crystal holding you
Oh, once you met a man

Every day I see him beside you
Is he treating you alright?
The things I'd do if I was in his shoes
No more taking for granted
Everything I get from you
Get from you

I know you're leaving
Cos I always take too long
Cos I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I should've seen it
It's gonna be a lonely, lonely road ahead
But I can find a way
To make things right with you

Yeah, I feel it
But before you walk away
I only need a chance to tell you how I feel
I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
And I've got to find a way
To make things right with you

You're never gonna save me
Don't say the difference settle maybe
Maybe I missed the point the answer was a lesson
Too late

I know you're leaing
Cos I always take too long
Cos I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I should've seen it
It's gonna be a lonely, lonely road ahead
But I can find a way
To make things right with you

Yeah, I feel it
But before you walk away
I only need a chance to tell you how I feel
I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
And I've got to find a way
To make things right with you
