Almost all my life they told me that I couldn't
Dreaming every night, they told me that I shouldn't
Told me that I should've quit, that I'll never finish it
That I'll never reach the top and no one knows that I exist
But I kept climbing, kept grinding every day
And I kept writing everything I had to say
Now they wanna shut me up, shut me in, shut me out
Yeah, I'd be mad too if someone made me shut my mouth
But it's different when you never had a voice
When no one ever listened, so you never had a choice
Never had a path, only people in your way
Never had a mask or a reason to be fake
All you had was you and a reason to succeed
All you had to do was keep believing in the dream
All you ever knew was being weak and on your knees
But you're only gonna lose if you don't learn from your defeats
Yeah, gotta make the world know my name

I've got my head in the clouds, my feet on the ground
Yeah, I'm standing now and I am not afraid
With my head in the clouds, never looking down
Yeah, I'll never stop until the world knows my name

I wish I could go back, back when we were kids
When everything had passion with everything we did
Everything was honest, everything that we were promised
And the thought of what we wanted is what makes it so ironic
That it's different than the shit that we were told
How the rules were written, how the story really goes
"Everyone's your friend, give everyone a chance"
So everyone pretends that they really give a damn
Man, fuck that, nothing's ever what it seems
People stepping over people, people preying on the weak
'Cause it's business and we're feeding the machine
Time is money, money's living, so we live with the disease
What happened to the magic? What happened to the thrill?
What happened to the passion, the way we used to feel?
All we see is fashion, fame, and dollar bills
And now I'm looking back, I wish the world I saw was real

I've got my head in the clouds, my feet on the ground
Yeah, I'm standing now and I am not afraid
With my head in the clouds, never looking down
Yeah, I'll never stop until the world knows my name

I woke up one day
With the world outside telling me I should walk away
But I can't, I won't break
That's how I know it, everything will be okay
I woke up one day
With the world outside telling me I should walk away
But I can't, I won't break
That's how I know that, everything will be okay
I woke up one day
With the world outside telling me I should walk away
But I can't, I won't break
I'm gonna make the world know my name

I've got my head in the clouds, my feet on the ground
Yeah, I'm standing now and I am not afraid
With my head in the clouds, never looking down
Yeah, I'll never stop until the world knows my name

I woke up one day
With the world outside telling me I should walk away
But I can't, I won't break
I'll make the world know my name
I woke up one day
With the world outside telling me I should walk away
But I can't, I won't break
I'll make the world know my name
