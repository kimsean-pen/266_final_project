Four years old
With my back to the door
All I could hear was the family war

Your selfish hands
Always expecting more
Am I your child?
Or just a charity award?

You have a hollowed out heart
But it's heavy in your chest
Yah, I tried so hard to fight it
But it's hopeless, hopeless (hopeless)
You're hopeless

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone
But I can't let you go

Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down
For the love of a daughter

It's been five years
Since we've spoken last
And you can't take back
What we never had

Oh, I can be manipulated
Only so many times
Before even "I love you"
Starts to sound like a lie

You have a hollowed out heart
But it's heavy in your chest
I tried so hard to fight it
But it's hopeless, hopeless (hopeless)
You're hopeless

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone
But I can't let you go

Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down
For the love of a daughter

Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you push me out of your world?
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones
That you swore you loved

Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you throw me right out of your world?
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone
But I can't let you go

Oh, father
Please, father

Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down
For the love of a daughter
For the love of a daughter
