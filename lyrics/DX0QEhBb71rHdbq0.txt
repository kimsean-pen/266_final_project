i've been avoiding the void
but i can't see the point
were you talkin to me
o, my eyes were closed i'm sorry

when you talk in your sleep
you draw me out from underneath
take your hand in my hand
bloodbrother ampersand

& the blood will flow
in the morning when my thoughts are flowing also
you only know what you notice
& no, you don't know me.

if you're askin 'how could I know'
then you don't know me
or if i want it bad enough
broken
branches in your eyelids
& your iris:
a violent violet

if you could see me now!
