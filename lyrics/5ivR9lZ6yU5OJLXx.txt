All hail to the old king
To a dead sea
To the same old trash
Never washed clean

I'm dying, not changing anytime soon

Turn another page
Let the bottom fade
Poisoning the ground
When you plant a seed

I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
The pressures building
Gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

(Used and abused)
(Used and abused)
(Used and abused)

I'm done trying to reset
I'm a reject
Caught up at the knees from this stop
Can't come back
Don't even care if I die

Chain my ankles up
From the outer sea
Benefit the world
Hide the empathy

I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
The pressures building
Gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

I don't have a home
I don't fit your mold
You can't push me out
Take me to the battle-ground

I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
The pressures building
Gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Cause you're just some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

Used and abused
Used and abused
Gotta find my way through
Used and abused
Used and abused
It's paralyzing being used and abused
