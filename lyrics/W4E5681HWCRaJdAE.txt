Slip through the door
Like someone you've never seen before
And I teach you the way
To forget all the pain
But I can't let go
Of what's inside
Grasping for sand
Time won't let me stand
Against the wall
Against the wall
So I rise up
They will be gone
Just wait for your turn
Say goodnight
Say goodnight
And this will all be yours
This will all be yours
This will all be yours
This will all be yours
When you tell me your grace
I know you baby
I'll see this at?
Just wait it out
Just wait a couple more years
And you will have it all
When the room does fall
And your clothes don't mend
Well they never fail
They've never had it all
So don't you worry
Don't you worry
About a thing
About a thing
They will be gone
Just wait for your turn
Say goodnight
Say goodnight
And this will all be yours
This will all be yours
This will all be yours
