Arcane arts we call into the
everblack On this day we shall bring you back
Our blood for hers
Equivalent exchange

Dematerialized before my eyes and devoured by the void
To save his life I'll sacrifice yet another limb

Deformed, but not defeated
We will get our bodies back

Cursed are you who have broken the
taboo, for your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities
For a fleeting glimpse of eternity

Unforeseen complication
Ripped you from my womb to the tomb
Distraught I sought reclamation
An eerie calm before the storm

Ill cries cracked thunderous skies
As I gave birth to gloom
For what lie in the center circle
Was no longer the fruit of my womb

From shadows abound, out of sight, without sound
I find myself hopelessly pinned to the ground
A dastardly qualm, a blade impales each palm
As homunculi psalm a grim requiem
Shadows swell in as my nightmare begins
Forced to complete human transmutation
Banished from light for this perilous plight
Has cast me into a realm of eternal night

Cursed are you who have broken the taboo
For your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities
For a fleeting glimpse of eternity

Cursed are you who have broken the taboo
For your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities
For a fleeting glimpse of eternity
