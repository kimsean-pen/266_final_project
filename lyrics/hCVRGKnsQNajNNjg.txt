I wish I was you
A piece of gold of the bottom of the blue
To heavy to swim
But too beautiful to lose
Hold in my breath
And diving down to give you air
I never knew the colours that surround you

(Wake up, wake up)
Holding on forever to keep you
To keep from slipping too deep
If you want to escape you don't need to
Just look for me
I'm taking in water for you, my love
For you I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water my breath I'll remember
I'm taking water for you

You picked up the light
The spectrum back to turn to white
Too bright to be seen
Wish the beautiful boy was me
Never alone, sky's a different shade of grey
Making you glow, the colours dance around you

(Wake up, wake up)
Holding on forever to keep you
To keep from slipping too deep
If you want to escape you don't need to
Just look for me
I'm taking in water for you, my love
For you I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water my breath I'll remember
I'm taking water for you

Treasures are lost in depth
And they'll buried down on you soon
Buried down in you soon

(Wake up, wake up)
Holding on forever to keep you
To keep from slipping too deep
If you want to escape you don't need to
Just look for me
I'm taking in water for you, my love
For you I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water my breath I'll remember
I'm taking water for you
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
