Late at night i close my eyes
and think how things coulda been
and when i look back
i remember some words you had said to me

it's better to have lost at love
then never to have loved at all

*i won't forget you baby, (i won't forget you)
even though i could
i won't forget you baby, (i won't forget you)
even though i should, yeah*

Sometimes, in my head
i can still see pictures of you
and i laugh to myself
when i think of all those crazy things that we used to do

all the miles come between us
just between you and me

oh,
** well,
I should let you fade away
but that just wouldn't be me

oh, baby

All the miles come between us

just between you and me
**
I won't forget you baby (i won't forget you)
memories slowly fade
i won't forget you baby (i won't forget you)
and all the plans we made
I won't forget you baby
