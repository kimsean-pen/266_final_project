How many times must I tell you, babe?
How many bridges I've got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself?
Before I can talk to the boss
'Fore I can talk to the boss

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I'll try to be your forever man
(Forever man)
Try to be your forever man

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I'll try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man
(Forever man)

'Rever man, 'rever man, 'rever man
(Forever man)
'Rever man, 'rever man, 'rever man
Try to be your forever man
'Rever man, 'rever man, 'rever man
(Forever man)
'Rever man, 'rever man, 'rever man
(Forever man)
'Rever man, 'rever man, 'rever man
(Forever man)
Try to be your forever man
