Brothers of abandonment
Sisters of despair
Orphans to the watching ones above
Too far removed
Too far to care
We are the unwanted
We are the one true threat
We raise our hands to this World's throat
And choke away its dying breath

This is the end of days
This is the end of days
This is the end of days
Set to destroy

Fathers to our faithless days
Mothers to our twisted ways
Bow your heads
Fold your hands and pray
Your time has come

This is the end of days
This is the end of days
This is the end of days
Set
To destroy

Set
Set to destroy
Set
Set to destroy

Your flame is faded
So sink below
Rest now your heavy head
Upon your bed of bones
Too far removed
Too far to care
Set to destroy
