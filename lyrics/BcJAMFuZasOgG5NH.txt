The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
But we don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
But we don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn

Just a little and nothing, now it's over
Just a little and nothing, now it's done
What you said, no you're never gonna say again
In your own special way you tear me down

Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

Neither up nor down just been turned and turned
It just sits inside so it burns and burns
If I can't decide that what makes you hurt
In your own special way you tear me down

Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker, burn

So ask me please
So ask me please
So ask me please

Sway so push me this way
So push me this way
So push me this way
So push me

So push me this way
So push me this way
So push me please

The fire
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic
Sway so hypnotic

Come sway this way
Come sway this way
Come sway this way
