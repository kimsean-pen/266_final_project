everybody is nobody
Joey apologizes anyway
when I stay still
I can still feel my body inside my body
i am nodding inside of my body
Im goin to the bathroom
because they all got the moves
he tries not to think of you
I do
I do too
i could be thrilling
if you could be willing
to overlook a few things
I am crazy
I have no idea what I'm doing
when he thinks of you
I try not to
I do too
he tries not to think of you
I do too
I do too
