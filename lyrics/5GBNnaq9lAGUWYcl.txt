Everything, it's so quiet here
Seasons last, more than thousand years
Suddenly my vision is clear,
consciousness into clarity

I can hear echoes from the sea
overwhelmed by tranquility
Radiance unfolds gradually,
every wound now begins to heal

Take on my burden, shake of my head
Chained by what I understand, won't let me grow

New found sight opens up for each
step into similarity
Void is all coming into reach,
mistakable familiarity

Take on my burden, shake of my head
Chained by what I understand, won't let me grow
Lay down my burden, take all my years away
Release me within emptiness and make me whole

There is a desire, there's a need of finding faith,
I decide by painting it all in grey
Inner transformation turns a weakness to a strength,
through the times the spirit will remain

Tethered by restrictions of the way to be aware,
all is gone the hindrance will fade away
Fundamentals separate transcending into where
time that flows is neither night nor day

Every piece that we retrieve from covering our eyes,
dawns on us we cannot leave with everything inside
I will reach my hand and try to open up the sky,
on my part the reason why is stated in a lie.
