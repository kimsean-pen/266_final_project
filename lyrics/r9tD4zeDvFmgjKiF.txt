I can't analize like that love
Cause you turn the beat to thunder
You're 25 below
Gonna make you wonder why
Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on
Let's get it on, and on, and on
Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y

So you wanna find a real man?
Make him fall in love?
No matter how thick your skin is
Never thick enough
Someone that you can lean on
When times are tough
Baby, there's a reason

Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
When I touch ya
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
And you love it, yeah
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
Sometimes I wonder 'cause
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y

Maybe you came from outer space
Maybe I can help you let go
When you walk around the place
All that I can hear is your echo
If I heard what you've been saying
Then you know it isn't right
There's always something I'm not doing
That won't keep you satisfied
Let's get it on, and on, and on, and on
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y

So you wanna find a real man?
Make him fall in love?
No matter how thick your skin is
Never thick enough
Someone that you can lean on
When times are tough
Baby, there's a reason

Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
When I touch ya
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
And you love it, yeah
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
Sometimes I wonder 'cause
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y

What's the reason?
Girl, I can make you happy, happy
Just one damn reason
Girl, I can make you happy at all

Girl, I don't know why you get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
When I touch ya
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
And you love it, yeah
You get so sensitive, sensitive, sensitive
Sometimes I wonder 'cause
Girl, I don't know why you're not H-A-P-P-Y
