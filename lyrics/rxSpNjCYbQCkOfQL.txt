It just takes me longer
And I can feel, what you feel
It just makes you stronger

You can take me for a little while
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end
Whao yes, you can
Woo yeah

Well, I can see, what you mean
It just takes me longer
Lord and I can feel, what you feel
It just makes you stronger

Well I know, I know, I know
Oh, the feeling grows
Well I see, I see, I see
Ohh no, it's got to be
Ohh yeah
Whao yeah
Whao yeah

Ohh you can take me for a little while
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end
Woo yeah
Yes, you can

Well, I can shine like you shine
It doesn't make me brighter
But if I think, no like you think
It don't make my load much lighter
Whao

It just takes me longer
And I can feel, what you feel?
It just makes you stronger
Woo yea yeah
