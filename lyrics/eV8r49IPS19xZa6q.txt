Unscorch the ground and look around unpack a picnic feast on
filet of fertile sound but your unrenown keeps defenses down
Don't turn around unless you want to see me
Hear them in the west again distance keeps the best protection
I know you know it I know you love it
The kill will cost you your right arm do you want to feel electric
'Cause I feel it's time
Will take the century
To pay off all of our fines it's the only way
Bombs away
Bad bombs away good bombs away
Gone too long to leave the lights on stayed too long to be asked
back I've got to ask you one thing do you want to feel electric?
'Cause I feels it's time it's the only way
Bombs away
Bad bombs away good bombs away
About these things
Who would believe all these things?
who could you tell all these things?
You can come with me
And you can see what I'm talking about
Do you want to go?
Do you want to be my valentine?
