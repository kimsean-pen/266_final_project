Losing
Losing my faith in
The world that surrounds me
Am I
Am I the only one
To constantly question it all

So
So far away
It's ourselves that we betray
How has it come to this
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Blind leading the blind to the sea
They're drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They're falling down
You hear them calling
But it's too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself

Calling
Calling for action
I demand that you question
Are you
Are you content with the truth
That they have fed down to you

Think
Think for yourselves
You must break out from this hell
How has it come to this
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Blind leading the blind to the sea
They're drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They're falling down
You hear them calling
But it's too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself

We must break
We must break free from this hell
We must break
We must break free from this hell

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Your blind leading the blind to the sea
They're drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They're falling down
You hear them calling
But it's too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
Just save yourself
Save yourself
