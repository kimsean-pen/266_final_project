No remedy, it's my cry
We feel it in our eyes, but we don't touch

With you I am alone
With you I am alone

So many times my eyes won't blink
And many times your touch makes me sick

With you I am alone
With you I am alone

Suddenly, the rain has clouded your view
Now everything that you knew is lost

With you I am alone
With you I am alone
With you I am alone
With you I am alone
