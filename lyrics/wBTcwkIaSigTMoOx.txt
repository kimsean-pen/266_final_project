Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet
Are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops

Are falling on my head
They keep falling.
So i just did me some
Talking to the sun
And i said i didn't like the way

He got things done
He's sleeping on the job
Those raindrops

Are falling on my head
They keep fallin'
But theres one thing i know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me it won't be long
Till happiness

Steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complaining
Because i'm free
Nothings worrying me
It won't be long
Till happiness
Steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complaining
Because i'm free
Nothing's worrying me
