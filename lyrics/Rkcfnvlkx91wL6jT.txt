Wave goodbye I love you the more
You wanna take the other side
All the way I couldn't believe
But there was way between my eyes
Make you change I needed to feel
With all the breaks inside my mind
Looking back it's pretty surreal
I think I won't be to disguise
My regret for eyes

This is why I'm sorry to feel
I'll never take another dime
Chasing what I'll never believe
I'll never take the other side
