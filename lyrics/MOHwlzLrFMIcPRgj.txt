So you're on the floor, at fifty-four
Think you can last, at the palace
Does your body go, to the to and fro
Tonight's the night, or didn't you know

That Ivan meets G. I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe

He tried his tricks, that ruskie bear
The United Nations said it's all fair
He did the radiation, he did the chemical plague
He could not win, with a cossacks spin

The Vostok bomb, the Stalin strike
He tried every move, he tried to hitch hike
He drilled a hole, like a Russian star
He made every move, in his repertoire

When Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe

Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G I. Joe

It's G.I. Joe's, turn to blow
He turned it on, cool and slow
He tried a payphone call, to the Pentagon
A radar scan, a Leviathan

He wiped the earth, clean as a plate
What does it take, to make a ruskie break?
But the crowd are bored, and off they go
Over the road, to watch China go

Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
Ivan meets G.I. Joe
