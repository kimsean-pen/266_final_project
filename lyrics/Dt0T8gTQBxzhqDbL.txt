Yeah, man
Jah will be waiting there, we a shout
Jah will be waiting there

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety, boom

The youngest veteran a go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin' sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnu watch mek I clear out my voice now Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow

Mi hammer dem a slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Biggalow
Bust of trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi bust dem inna stereo 'cause

I got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
We got to keeps it burning
On the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there, we a shout
Jah will be waiting there

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety

Single parents weh need some charity
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and strategy

Say, we got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
I've been waiting to do this track with you man, yeah, ha, ha
Yeah, yeah

You know, they know
We got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
Yeah, you gotta keep walking y'all
You gotta keep

Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin' daymares in daytime
Wide awake try to relate
This can't be happenin' like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'

Cause what I'm seein' is haunting
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies
In Zimbabwe

They make John Pope seem Godly
Sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime I look back at paths I've walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught

Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots
And badges screaming,"Young black children, stop or I will shoot"
I look back at cooked crack
Plus cars that pass by

Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison
Trust that

So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marching to Zion
You know how Nas be NYC, state of mind I'm in

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety, boom

The youngest veteran a go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin' sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnu watch mek I clear out my voice now Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow

Mi hammer dem a slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Biggalow
Bust of trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi bust dem inna stereo 'cause

I got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
We got to keeps it burning
On the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there, we a shout
Jah will be waiting there

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there, we a shout
Jah will be waiting there

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety

Single parents weh need some charity
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and strategy

Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and any strategy, ay, say

I got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
You know, we got to keep on walking
On the road to Zion, man
