I pray to God
To stop these thoughts
It works for me
Can't you see?

Now I know that I'm better
I'm writing this letter
To my past self
Sitting on the shelf

Nothing lasts
It's for the past
I won't stay here
I won't stay there

Cause now I'm happy
For you have change me
I am so thankful
No longer painful
