You are the original template
You are the original exemplary
How seen were you actually?
How revered were you (honestly) at the time?

Why pleased with your low maintenance?
You loved us more than we could've loved you back
Where was your ally your partner in feminine crime?
Oh mother who's your buddy?
Oh mother who's got you back?

The heart of the house
The heart of the house
All hail the goddess!

You were good ol' you were count on 'er 'til four A.M.
You saw me run from the house in the snow melodramatically
Oh mother who's your sister?
Oh mother who's your friend?

The heart of the house
The heart of that house
All hail the goddess!

We left the men and we went for a walk in the Gatineaus
And talked like women like women to women would
Womyn to womyn would, where did you get that from?

Must've been your father your dad
I got it from you I got it from you
Do you see me yourself in my gypsy garage sale ways?
In my fits of laughter?
In my Tinkerbell tendencies?
In my lack of color coordination?
