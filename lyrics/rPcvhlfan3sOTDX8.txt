Let's get started, the faint and brokenhearted
hold it up! I've got something I cannot hide.
The worst painkiller, the all in filler,
apart and departed, look in my eye.

Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land,
up through the clouds then back here.
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb,
at all hours...

I'm empty like the day after Christmas,
swept beneath the wave of your goodbye.
You left me on the day after Christmas,
there's nothing left to say, and so goodnight.

I will follow the trail to tomorrow,
with my loneliness with sorrow all through the night.
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers.
Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind.

Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land,
up through the clouds then back here.
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb,
at all hours...

I'm empty like the day after Christmas,
swept beneath the wave of your goodbye.
You left me on the day after Christmas,
there's nothing left to say, and so goodnight.

I'm empty like the day after Christmas,
swept beneath the wave of your goodbye.
You left me on the day after Christmas,
there's nothing left to say, and so goodnight.
Goodnight.
