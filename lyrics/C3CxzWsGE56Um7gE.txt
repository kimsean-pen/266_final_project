I wish I'd known you had other plans to meet,
You're not certain eyes as paradise,
I waited patiently,
I tried to save it all,
I tried,
You were looking for ways to phrase a rejection.

You've been answering back since the days,
And the council flag,
And now our kitchen table's silent,
I tried to save it all,
I tried,
You were looking for ways to phrase a rejection.

Oh now you've gone,
Oh now you've gone.
I was patiently the anvil
Before you fell apart.

I tried to save it all,
I tried,
You were looking for ways to phrase a rejection.
