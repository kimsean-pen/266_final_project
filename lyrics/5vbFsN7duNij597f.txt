Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
And oh so shame on the night

And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run

Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh lord just go the way you came again
And oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better run

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
Here I go, I've got to run

Shame on the night
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Shame on the night

Well I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Shame on the night
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
Shame on the night
