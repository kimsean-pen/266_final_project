Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your head to your toes
You're not much, heaven knows
But you are so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

Oh, baby of mine
Oh, baby of mine
Oh, baby of mine
