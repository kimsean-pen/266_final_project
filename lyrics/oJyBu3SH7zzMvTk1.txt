If you knew the death I'd wanted
Or measure that hole that I'm in
If you knew just how far I'd travel
Then, maybe then, only then

All of friends would be there
All to greet me, inside me is not air
If you knew just how far I travel
Miles, Miles, Miles

If you saw that heat I was on
All the view from that mountain tall
If you knew just how far I travel
Maybe then I wouldn't seem so odd

Then, they wouldn't stop to stare
Ooh, no then, they wouldn't even dare
If you knew just how far I travel
Miles, Miles, Miles

That devil hang up on that cross
All the evil that I came upon
If you knew just how far I travel
Miles, Miles, Miles
