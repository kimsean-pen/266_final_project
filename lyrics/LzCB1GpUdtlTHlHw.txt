See the days go by, how do you live your life
You try to figure out how to, staying on the ground
And the days move faster than they ever did before
Why are you so sad? You know one day we will go
Come on with me and we'll go own the streets
And I won't leave you behind

Or else I'll see you standing in line
You don't have to, no need to hide

Come and look outside 'cause we have cotton skies

And there's no place around here for me
I'll love you till I die
Come on with me and we'll go own the streets

And I won't leave you behind
Or else I'll see you standing in line
You don't have to, no need to hide
