아무것도 없는 듯
이 작은 방 안에서
난 눈만 뜨고 있어
눈을 떠도 감은 듯해
공허함만 있는 난
벽만 보고 있어

Where did that wall come from
Could I break that wall or make holes on the wall, the wall
And someone is knocking on
The other side of the wall and make holes in my wall, my wall

Bright light comes through the holes
And I found you through one of the holes
You are standing in front of me with that smile
And there are shining lights behind you
Yeah there are lights behind you
