I'm sorry I forsake you
I'm sorry that I left you
I'm sorry I did forget you

And I'm sorry that I made myself feel better
By making you feel never good enough
I know you'll shine much brighter than I ever could
Maybe that is why I was

Chorus:
Scared of you
(And in everything I do I'm still thinking of you)
Oh, you
And I know you were scared of me
(But everytime I tried to love you I just fell through)
Too

Desculpa-me se te-ofendi
Desculpa-me se te-esqueci
Desculpa me se-eu te-deixei
Eu te-deixei
E desculpa-me por mi sintir bem com tua dor
Sabes que te-adore mais sei que tu estrela a maior do que minha,
do que minha
E por isso

Chorus:
Eu tenho medo deste amor (os dias passo pensando en ti) amor
Medo deste amor (Salve-me porque agora estou caindo) amor

Scared of you I was
Scared of you I was
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
