Time
Time
Time
Forever time
It's time to walk by me
One last time, it's time
At first Relax
Get set
Get your message from time
Time, time, time, time
Time
Time
Time
Forever time
It's time to look into my eyes
One last time, it's time
I feel I'm some kind of death machine
With skin and muscles and a heart
That pumps my blood
Time, time, time, time
Time Time Time
Forever time
It's time to kiss me goodbye
One last time, it's time
This is the first time
This is the last time
It's my only time
But it's only time
Time
Time
Time.
