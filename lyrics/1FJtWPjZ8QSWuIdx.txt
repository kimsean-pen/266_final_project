Coming from the other side
Where my soul has no price
Coming from a senseless war
And I find myself denied
Coming from the other side
Where my soul has no price
Coming from a senseless war
And I find myself denied

My aching soul
Has no more tears
Where is my identity?
My broken home
I left behind
Why am I an enemy?
My aching soul
Has no more tears
Where is my identity?
My broken home
I left behind
Why am I an enemy?

'Cause the war in our city
Is the peace in your community
'Cause the loss of our city
Is the win of your mentality
'Cause the war in our city
Is the peace in your community
'Cause the loss of our city
Is the win of your mentality

We can not stay like this
We are human not animal
We come to continue our life
Because we can not live in Syria from the war
We want to know
Tell us now how much time we must stay here
Evey day we die, every time we die
Life as a refugee is very difficult not easy

Coming from the other side
Where my soul has no price
Coming from a senseless war
And I find myself denied
Coming from the other side
Where my soul has no price
Coming from a senseless war
And I find myself denied

My aching soul
Has no more tears
Where is my identity?
My broken home
I left behind
Why am I an enemy?
My aching soul
Has no more tears
Where is my identity?
My broken home
I left behind
Why am I an enemy?

'Cause the war in our city
Is the peace in your community
'Cause the loss of our city
Is the win of your mentality
'Cause the war in our city
Is the peace in your community
'Cause the loss of our city
Is the win of your mentality
