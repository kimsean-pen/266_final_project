So what's it gonna be, the fix up or the falling out?
It's hard to get a read of the signal that you're sending out
And if you're wanna leave, then there's not much to talk about
I'm looking for relief but still wanting if you stick around

So I don't wanna take the blame tonight
I wanna get lost in far behind
But I don't wanna let it go
No I don't wanna let it go
It's funny how you found complacency
You tuning up the thought of you and me
Now you gotta let it go
Now you gotta let me go

I thought the worst was you giving up
But now it's chasing feelings just to be okay
You knew the northern weather wasn't enough
To bother at all, it's all drifting away
With the way we used to be

So what did you expect, a rescue or a getaway
If I had your back, I'd take you getting over me
So tell it to my face, don't hide behind poetry
I'll find a better place for you and all your apathy

So I don't wanna take the blame tonight
I wanna get lost in far behind
But I don't wanna let it go
No I don't wanna let it go
It's funny how you found complacency
You tuning up the thought of you and me
Now you gotta let it go
Now you gotta let me go

I thought the worst was you giving up
But now it's chasing feelings just to be okay
You knew the northern weather wasn't enough
To bother at all, it's all drifting away
With the way we used to be

When did you get up causing problems
When did you get up and I'm not around
It's hard to blush it off when you constantly calling me
'Cause baby you get up when I'm down

I thought the worst was you giving up
But now it's chasing feelings just to be okay
You knew the northern weather wasn't enough
To bother at all, it's all drifting away
With the way we used to be

It's all drifting away
With the way we used to be
