Kings of Leon Frontier City Letras:
Find yourself a new frontier
Cause life is going, going gone
Fly yourself away from here into the clear
Before it's going, going, gone

Say it loud and in the light
For it's going, going gone
Shake the hands, the hands that pick,
pick the fight
Cause life is going, going gone

Yes I'll find you and cut you down
Friends and neighbours, sleepy town
If you wake up before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, we go
We live until we live no more

Travel with the dead black eye
Before it's come and come and gone
Cradles and rocking chairs
beneath the light
Before it's come and come and gone

Yes I'll find you and cut you down
Friends and neighbours, sleepy town
If you wake up before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, and go
We come and go, go
We come and go, go
