Words of love, so soft and tender
Won't win a girl's heart anymore

If you love her then you must send her
Somewhere where she's never been before
Worn out phrases and longing gazes
Won't get you where you want to go, no

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win her

You ought to know by now
You ought to know
You ought to know by now

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win her anymore

You ought to know by now
You ought to know
You ought to know by now

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win a girl's heart anymore

If you love her then you must send her
Somewhere where she's never been before
Worn out phrases and longing gazes
Won't get you where you want to go

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win her anymore, anymore
