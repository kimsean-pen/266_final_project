I wanna grow old before I grow up
I wanna die with my chin up
And definitely maybe I will live to love
Definitely maybe I will live to love

Heart and soul
Never know
Heart and soul

I wanna shine before I show up
I wanna die with my chin up
And definitely maybe I will live to love
Definitely maybe I will live to love

Heart and soul
Never know
Heart and soul
Never know

And I can tell by the look in your eyes
You didn't know the way

All die young
Love is lovely when you are young
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young (repeat)

It takes all my time to be in love with you
It takes all of my time, what do I do?

All die young
Love is lovely when you are young
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young (repeat)
