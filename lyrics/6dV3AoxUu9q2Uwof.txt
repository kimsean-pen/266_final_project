I am the Baker
I bake the cake
Make no mistake, I like to bake
Once I discover
My innate behavior
To mix, to make, to bake!

Up in the morning
To start my work
I cannot help wanting to bake a dessert
Like a gladiator
About to meet his fate
I enter my arena, bow my head and start to bake!

You want a cookie?!?
Or Baked Alaska,
Truly, the opus of bakers everywhere.

Flour, Sugar, Milk,
I send out for more
An unsung hero I need no reward
A short vacation I'd like to take
After I bake a chocolate cake

Sometimes It's mighty lonely
When you're all alone
(With a loaf of bread)
But I'm just doing my job
The best that I can

So the children can be fed

I am the Baker
(A!)
I bake the cake
(K!)
Make no mistake, I like to bake
(ER!)
Once I discover
(BAKER!)
My innate behavior
(BAKER!)
To mix, to make, to bake!
(BAKER!)

(B!)
I am the Baker
(A!)
I bake the cake
(K!)
You're the decorator and you decorate
(ER!)
You take the credit
(BAKER!)
While I slave away
(BAKER!)
I mixed, I made, I baked!
