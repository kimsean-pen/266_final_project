You said you love me
But you wont come down
So I'm leaving tomorrow

I'm a traveler making my way around the world
Airplanes and automobiles carry me away
I got my whole life ahead of me, but
I want to make you my priority
I got my eyes on you
I could be ready to settle down real soon

Oh love!
I see you up in the air, Love!
I know how much you care, Love!
But if you stay up there for too long
I know I will be gone

You said you love me
But you wont come down
So I'm leaving tomorrow

And when the long road is calling me
Like a smile that comes with a summer breeze
I know somewhere down here
There's a place for you and me

Oh love!
I see you next to the moon, Love!
I know how much you care, Love!
But if you stay up there for too long
I know I will be gone

But if you Say Yes! to following your heart
Yes! To keeping me on
Your mind and in your arms tonight
Where I can celebrate
The day that you will ask for me to stay
