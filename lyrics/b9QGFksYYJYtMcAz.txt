Chicane-autumn tactics

Deep river runs it's course
To a warm horizon
Shadows of falling leaves
October moon and rusty skies
Ever changing feelings
The seeds of autumn in my mind
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like its just begun
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
Hiding summer's age no more
No more leaves in summer sky
Turning dark on empty carlots
When summer was my only friend
Sail back this way again
Winter's one breath away
Sail back this way again
Winter's one breath away
It's turning cold...
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like its just begun
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like its just begun
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
Hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like its just begun
