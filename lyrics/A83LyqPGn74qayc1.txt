The room is closing in
And you can't cross the floor
The music drives you
Sends you climbing the wall

The tears of recollection
Collect across your face
There are some lines you put there
And some you erase

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

You'd better get awake now
It's time to stand up tall
I can't touch you
So far behind the wall

And see the sun is rising
In an almost perfect sky
See how far we travel
And how hard we try

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Inside, inside, inside, inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside

Just don't wanna come over
Can't seem to love one another
You wanna run and take cover
Your silence hides you from the inside
