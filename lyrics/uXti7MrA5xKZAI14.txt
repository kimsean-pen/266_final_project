Run out of money
Run outta good
Run outta reasons and misunderstood
Run out of rhythm
Run out of rhyme
Right out of feelings and right out of time

Living in limbo, hanging around
Head on the ceiling and mind in the clouds
Blind is the morning and deaf is the night
Comes without warning and leaves me in fright

Saving all my money, yeah, for the rainy days
I'm packin' up my suitcase, make it pay

(guitar solo (Joey Molland))

Run out of patience
And run out of lies
Run out of spaces and nowhere to hide
Living and loving is easy to get
Living is something we haven't tried yet

Yeah, I've been saving all my money, yeah, for the rainy days
Well, I'm packin' up my suitcase, make it pay

Hey
(double guitar solo (Joey Molland & Pete Ham))

I run out of money
Run out of good
Run out of reasons and misunderstood
Run out of rhythm
Run out of rhyme
Right out of feelings and right out of time

Blind is the morning and deaf is the night
Comes without warning and leaves me in fright

I've been saving all my money, yeah, for the rainy days
I'm packin' up my suitcase, make it pay.
