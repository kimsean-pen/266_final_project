Born from the void and still pristine
Tranquil, vast and cold
See the orb of blue and green
When he spake the light shone gold

Brought to life, in the image of god
In this holy place
settled amoung the creatures odd
Eve, dear girl, avert thy gaze

Claims to love them all
his world below
Minding not their fall
a mirthful show

Merriments in the centerpiece
Weird things in galore
Is this the cradle of the disease
that man alone must answer for?

Joy and delight, forever ceased
Sufferings abloom
Eaten alive by the cauldron beast
Let the drones ring to the sound of doom
