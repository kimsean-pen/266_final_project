I see you over there looking like a millionaire
Wind blowing through my hair making you wanna stare
Come closer, I want you, you can see it in my eyes
I hope you're ready for the ride

Zoom, zoom, zoom, ah
The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized
Zoom, zoom, zoom, ah
I'mma give you a look, you gon' memorize

Jump in my painted windows, baby, let's go
My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
I'll show ya, I can love ya

In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows
In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows, oh

I got you so hot in a daze looking like a moron
My hoods up, gimme a jump baby time to get me started
Be careful, don't let go somebody might scare you go
Boy, you shouldn't let it come to this side

Zoom, zoom, zoom, ah
The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized
Zoom, zoom, zoom, ah
I'mma give you a look, you gon' memorize

Jump in my painted windows, baby, let's go
My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
I'll show ya, I can love ya

In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows
In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows, oh

Affection in my eyes
While I watch the way you move
Temptation's no surprise
I can't get enough of you

Jump in my painted windows, baby, let's go
My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
I'll show ya, I can love ya

Jump in my painted windows, baby, let's go
My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
I'll show ya, I can love ya

In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows
In the blink of an eye, painted window
In the blink of an eye, my painted windows
