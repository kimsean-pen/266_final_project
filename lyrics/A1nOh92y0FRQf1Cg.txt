Flying secret mission into the unknown
Leave the people in the dark
Spraying our sky's with chemicals and poison
Keep population intact
Controlling births, controlling food,
Control everything you are
Medicine is what you need
So they can make all the money on you
And spread the fucking disease

How blind we are
Why can't anyone see?

Controlled by the eye that sees
Try to escape
But we'll never be free
Blinded by fear we are
We're living like slaves
Now it's gone too far

They turn us into freaks
Then they lock us up
For disturbing the peace
Those motherfuckers got us pinned down
Where they want us
See how we flee
Run for your life
Run as fast as you can
They're gonna turn up the heat
Living on the edge is what they want
Just fight for your life until you bleed

How blind we are
Why can't anyone see?
Like cattle we live
Crack the whip
It's time to stand up and expose the truth

Controlled by the eye that sees
Try to escape
But we'll never be free
Blinded by fear we are
We're living like slaves
Now it's gone too far

Controlled by the eye that sees
Try to escape
But we'll never be free
Blinded by fear we are
We're living like slaves
Now it's gone too far

Controlled by the eye that sees
Try to escape
But we'll never be free
Blinded by fear we are
We're living like slaves
Now it's gone too far
