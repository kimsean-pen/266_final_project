Reaching out for something to hold

Though it seems I laugh when I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
What I'm looking for
Though it seems I laugh when I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know

Reaching out for something to hold
For something to hold...

Reaching out for something to hold
For something to hold...

Though it seems I laugh when I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know
What I'm looking for
Though it seems I laugh when I can't find
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know

Reaching out for something to hold
For something to hold...

Reaching out for something to hold
For something to hold...
