crawling blue mice bore holes through my walls
you were the best thing in my life 'til now
heater moves, puts warmth in my heart
and stops without a word

mouth full of your face & truth
and I've been waiting for a man like you
I waited, seated, a year or two
your scowl was alone

you were in love
but you are in love
you were in... you are in...
