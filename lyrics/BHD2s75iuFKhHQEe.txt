[Thurston]
Sleepin around, sleepin around
What will the neighbors say?
Sleepin around, all over town
What will the neighbors say?

What you did was wrong
What you did good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight

Sleepin around, sleepin around
What will the neighbors do?
Sleepin around, all over town
What will the neighbors do?

What you did was wrong
What you did good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight

Sleepin around, sleepin around
What will the neighbors think?
Sleepin around, all over town
What will the neighbors think?

What you did was wrong
What you did good is gone
Nothing you do is right
Always ends up in a fight
