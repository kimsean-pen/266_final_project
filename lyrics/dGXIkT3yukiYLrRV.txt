I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins

'96 Impala with a bottle full of Roxys
Know I got Suboxone when I run out from the popping
Drug addicted
I admit it
I said before I ain't trying to quit it
Codeine, codeine
Got it dripping on my shirt from sloppy sipping
Popping some percs and some Vicodins
Leaning back hoping that life would end
Again and again
That's everyday
Everyday
Fuck a rehab I just wither my life away
Grey forever-ever
Drug possessors

My life expectancy up on the dresser

Pathetic
I need anesthetics
I ain't energetic
All these drugs never regret it
I guess it's genetic
It ain't my aesthetic
That's fucking generic
$uicide the epidemic
Make the kids quit academics
Take drugs til' you're epileptic
Call the paramedics
Depression magnetic
I'm anti-kinetic
Fucking apathetic
Again I'm pathetic

Just move on without me and then fucking forget it
Thought I moved on but I keep forgetting

I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
