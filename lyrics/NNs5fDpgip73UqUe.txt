Downfall, look beside you
Don't crawl to remind you
Downfall will come before anything at all
Downfall, it defines you
Don't stall to remind you
Downfall will come before

Downfall, downfall
Not all for nothing

Careful, can't divide you
Don't dwell on behind
Downfall will come before it all
Everything I have come
Everything I have come to us

Downfall, downfall
Not all for nothing

Two sides polarising
Seeing blind, it's mesmerising
We're chasing time, chasing it
Two sides polarising
Seeing blind, it's mesmerising
We're chasing time too

Downfall, downfall
Not all for nothing

Pieces of no hope
Blisters with no hope
Lift it till I fold
I'll come, I'll come

Downfall, look beside you
Don't crawl to remind you
Downfall will come before
