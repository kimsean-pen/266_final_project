Oh lord, oh lord I truly feel blessed
Been trapped inside so long, but now I feel blessed
I'll break rules like Rick Ross'd be saying
Spit fire like flame tools them burn it all
Money and fame don't define me
Ain't nobody give a woo bout a rule that's what I do
The system is the problem it made a new me
Kingdom of freedom bow I'm run by me

All they care about is profit nah they don't see me
Hustling with my crew all day faithfully
Don't try pull me over for that penalty
Don't try to kill my vibe follow me

Team wang do it Imma stay up on my grind
I'm living feeling like a classic papillon
Team wang do it Imma stay up on my grind
I'm living feeling like a classic papillon

Yeah!

Riding on with my attitude, do what you are told says who
better dodge for your life fool, pull the trigger if I have to
X X X headshot rambo, be the sniper aiming at you
Team wang be my label, ride for Jacky it's my crew code

All they care about is profit nah they don't see me
Hustling with my crew all day faithfully
Don't try pull me over for that penalty
Don't try to kill my vibe follow me

Team wang do it Imma stay up on my grind
I'm living feeling like a classic papillon
Team wang do it Imma stay up on my grind
