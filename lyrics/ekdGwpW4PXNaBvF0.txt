Everytime you come around, you come around
you're harder than a fever
and you got me shaking down on my knees.
You can either run around, run around
I just want your love now so give it to me.
cause I'm burning inside
and I'm locked in your eyes
and you got me sweating all night long
And I'm feeling alive,
for the first time I'm dying.
we're all
lika a mob to a fame
i don't need you in my brain
My freak machine
My saturday
I can't take you off, shake you off, when you got your hands on me.
You got me doin time
so hypnotized
I can't take you off, and shake you off, no matter how hard I try
Someone call the doctor now, I'm feeling weak
My heart is dropping to the ground,
I don't know why you do this to me,
You say you love me now, love me now
well, I can make you run around, get closer to me
cause I'm burning inside when I look in your eyes
and you got me sweating all night long
And I'm feeling alive,
for the first time I'm dying
like a mob to a fame
I don't need you in my brain
My freak machine
My saturday
I can't take you off, and shake you off, when you got your hands on me.
You got me doin time
so hypnotized
I can't take you off, shake you off, no matter how hard I try
no, I can't shake you off, shake you off.
(c'mon shake it, shake it)

1, 2, 3 baby get on your knees,

1, 2, 3 baby get on your knees,
