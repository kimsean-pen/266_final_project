Beautiful, you're not mine
You can't stop that, it's a crime,
We're gonna blow out cover
'bout to surrender unless we

Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it . cool
Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, keep it cool.

Rounding round inside our heads
We're going nowhere
Focusing is hot get telling me, 'cause I'm not there
This ain't no cool, it's sadistic in all I got
I own more surrender . sweet.

Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it . cool
Keep it, keep it cool
Keep it, keep it cool.

Oh what day the . a lot
I, you're deep within me
Can you give it up?
We can't surrender, you're not .

Keep it, keep it cool
(hope one day the sun)
Keep it . cool
(till we give it up)
Keep it, keep it cool
(we can't surrender)
Keep it, keep it cool.
When you surrender, you make it hot
Then we'll surrender, make it hot hot hot
You know I hide, make it hot hot hot hot hot hot.
