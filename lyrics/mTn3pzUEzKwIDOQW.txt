Do you believe in astrology?
Or do you think it"s all made up to be
something to talk about with strangers
when you go out
Saying he had lost his friends
'They must be the bar' I said,
'that"s where all friends are'
Always wishing it would last forever

Something in the night,
something in the fading light
and the background smiles
I never like the music but I love it loud,
love sitting quiet and watch the crowd
Always wishing it would last forever

Do you believe in infinity?
Or is it just something we"re meant to believe
to make some sense of it all,
or to make no sense at all
I thought I saw you was it you?
Hiding behind the things we do
I thought I saw you was it you?
Hiding behind the things we do

Something in the night,
something in the fading light
and the background smiles
I never like the music but I love it loud,
love sitting quiet and watch the crowd
Always wishing it would last forever
