Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two one's have made inseparable two

Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said, "You've found that lover-friend"
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

I lay awake
So full with hope of things to come
For heaven's sake
I pray I'm not the only one

I never dreamed I'd be so bold
I'm standing here, my heart's been sold
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

Think of love as wings, yeah
Not a ball and chain
And your fear of things unnecessary
I only want to share your name, share your name

I never dreamed I'd be so bold
I'm standing here, my heart's been sold
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Ohh will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now
Will you, will you
Come on baby now

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, so

Maybe Sunday, come on Monday
Baby any time this week
Get an old house, find a back yard
Buy some flowers down street

Tell your mother, tell your father
Don't tell anyone at all
All we need is just the two of us
And ooh
