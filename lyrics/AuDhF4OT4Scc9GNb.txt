The hands of wars are touching me
Ashed out the stars so easily
Too sick to breathe in seas of sleep
The sky will see fear in me
Salute the thief and trust in hate
Sold the lie that dreams aren't free
The hands of force are blinding me
To think the world so happily

The hands of madness order me
Peace let loose insanity
Too sick to breathe in seas of sleep
The sky will see fear in me
Salute the thief and trust in hate
Sold the lie that dreams aren't free
The hands of force are blinding me
To think the world so happily

LIAR
LIAR
LIAR

As i believe in you
As i believe
As i breathe for you
