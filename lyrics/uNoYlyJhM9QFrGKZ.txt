Don't lose the key to my heart boy your love's
Like the double trouble drum
That I bang bang bang
Don't let go of me,
Hold me till I've had enough
Watch my body rum-pa-pum
B-b-bang bang

We came here to have fun,
Tell em we don't care
Hold me like a shot gun,
Hit me everywhere
We came here to have fun,
So tell em we don't care
Hold me like a shot gun,
Hit me everywhere
We came here to ...
(party and party and party and party)
You got me feeling

Sexy then a mutha...
Got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
You got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
Got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
You make me say oh oh ohhh...
We be like oh oh ohhh...
You make say oh oh ohhh...
We be like oh oh ohhh...

Don't slow down,
Get me moving from the start
Watch me beating up ya heart
B-b-bang bang bang
Kick it off and get low
Let my body steal the show
Bout to lose it here I go b-b-bang bang

We came here to have fun,
Tell em we don't care
Hold me like a shot gun,
Hit me everywhere
We came here to have fun,
Tell em we don't care
Hold me like a shot gun,
Hit me everywhere
We came here to
(party and party and party and party)
You got me feeling

Sexy then a mutha...
Got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
You got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
Got me feeling sexy then a mutha...
You make me say oh oh ohhh...
