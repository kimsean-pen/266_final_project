D most precious stone is the world
I want to be a diamond
A diamond
M for millions of years
O as in too old for tears
N as in never cry and never die
D as in diamonds, D as in diamonds

D as in diamonds never die
I means me and not you
A as I like being alone
M for a mine of my own
O you would like to own me
N for never never never
D for diamonds are forever

The hardest substance in the world
I wanna cut through glass
Say, nothing gonna brake me
No hands could ever make me
There may be millions of stones
But I relay on brilliant Zion
Ain't nobody gonna make jewelery out of me
Ain't nobody gonna make jewelery out of me

Diamonds, oh...
I wanna be a diamond, oh...
Diamonds, oh...
I'm gonna be a diamond, oh...

Diamonds, oh...
I wanna be a diamond, oh...
Diamonds, oh...
I'm gonna be a diamond, oh...
