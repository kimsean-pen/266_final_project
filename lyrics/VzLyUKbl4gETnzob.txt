Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
It was where everyone could see
He belong to someone, but not me

On his hand was a plain gold ring

Plain gold ring had a story to tell
It was one that I knew too well
In my heart it will never be spring
Long as he wears a plain golden ring

When nighttime comes callin' on me
I know, why I will never be free
I can't stop these teardrops of mine
So I'm gonna love him till the end of time

Plain gold ring has but one thing to say
I'll remember till my dyin' day
In my heart it will never be spring

Long as he wears a plain golden ring

Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
