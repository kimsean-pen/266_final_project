One day you came into my mind
And everything looked as though it was all mine
Loveliness to gaze upon
To feel your magic pulling me away
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
And I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do
Often think of times when all your thoughts and words
Come close to making me lose my mind
Moment now recalling
All the time involving minutes that we spent alone
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
And I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do

One day you came into my mind
And everything looked as though it was all mine
Loveliness to gaze upon
To feel your magic pulling me away
I thought I was on top of it all
Everyone else was so small
And I knew what you wanted to do
I knew what you wanted to do
