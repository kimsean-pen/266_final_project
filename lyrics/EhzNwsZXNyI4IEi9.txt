There's a fireman hosing off a metal gurney outside
And my mind goes to the bend in the road and bloody asphalt salt

And I wonder how different some days go
I smell the grass and the trees after the rain in the breeze
And I wonder how different some days go
I wonder how different some days go

I believe you when you say you've been sad for your whole life
Your body looks impossibly small when you hang your head and cry
Meanwhile people on Tumblr unpack neuroses
And all you ever wanted was the one
you love the most not to suddenly leave

You thought you'd never get out
You thought you'd never get out, never get out
You thought you'd never get out, never get out
You thought you'd never get out, never get out

I don't know why
But it seems like there's a reason for it all
Why some ancient slime crossed a line
Now there's a war on all life on Earth

I am uneasy
Yeah, I am uneasy
Like I was in school when I thought and I thought

I thought I'd never get out, never get out
I thought I'd never get out, never get out
I thought I'd never get out, never get out
I thought I'd never get out, never get out
