I dont want to say goodbye
Everythings a little hazy till im halfway down the road
I know I could have done better
Im damned if I breath in water
You never gave a sign of pieced together phrases that Ive heard
And the star gets brighter the longer
Tell me what youre feeling anytime, anywhere
Give the words new meanings if youd like
If you even care
I dont want to walk away
I could just come and say it
Youre the light Ive needed in my life
Oooh
Everybody wants the dawn
Everybody wants a peace of sacred art to call their own
And the urge gets stronger
Honey when you say hello
Its only when you say hello
The sweetest sound ive ever known
Does it all get calmer
And lighter
Tell me what youre feeling anytime, anywhere
Give the words new meaning
If youd like
If you even care
I dont want to walk away
I could just come out and say it
Youre light Ive needed in my life
I dont want to walk away
I could just come out and say it
Youre light Ive needed in my life
In my life
In my life
Need you in my life
In my life
In my life
Need you in my life
