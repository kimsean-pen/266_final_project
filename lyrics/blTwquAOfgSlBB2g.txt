I can't remember a word they said
With my shrink in Bahamas resting his head
Newlywed, go to bed
Conversation with the laundry machine
I'm tired now, don't be mean
Make me fit, make me clean

'Cause we're running out of time and I'm losing my mind
They said I would be fine but I'm never fine
We're running out of time 'cause I'm losing my mind
And where are you?

'Cause I don't know where I should go
Darling
I am borderline
Thought things would change, but I'm deranged
It's just another Saturday night
Come watch me drown and get what's left at the lost and found

Four AM, did I lock the door?
I always miss you but I'm never sure how you feel
Is there more?
The monster that sub-let my head
is making new friends under the bed
"I'll make it stop", that's what you said

But we're running out of time 'cause I'm losing my mind
They said I would be fine but I'm never fine
We're running out of time 'cause I'm losing my mind
And where are you?

'Cause I don't know where I should go
Darling
I am borderline
Thought things would change, but I'm deranged
It's just another Saturday night
Come watch me drown and get what's left at the lost and found
Watch me drown
You'll get what's left at the lost and found
