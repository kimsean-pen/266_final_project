I know what you're saying
It's all got to go
At times driven along by the meaning
I need colors around me to fade

Everything falls into place
Everything falls in to favor
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad and throw it away
We all go mad and throw it away

I see what you're doing
Makes sense after all
My heart's telling me I'm not mistaken
It feels better than I can believe

Everything falls into place
(lnto place)
Everything falls into favor again
(All go mad)
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad and throw it away
(All go mad)
We all go mad and throw it away

Everything falls into place
(lnto place)
Everything falls into favor again
(All go mad)
Everything falls into place
And then we all go mad and throw it away
(All go mad)
We all go mad and throw it away

We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and throw it away
We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and throw it away

We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and throw it away
We all go mad and we throw it away
I said we all go mad and throw it away
