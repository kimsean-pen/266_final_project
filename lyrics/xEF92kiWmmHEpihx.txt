Light her darken horse a tempers lie and thought
Its always insane, its always insane
Custom and retrend the course its . to play
I noticed its there, I noticed its there, I noticed.

Light her darken horse
The tempers lie and .
Its all insane, its all insane
Monster for a friend
A liar to defend
I noticed its there, I noticed its there, I noticed.
Chorus:
Hold her by the reins
And ...
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

Nothing patient, nothing stable here.
Light her darken horse
The passway to the end
Seems all alone, seems all alone,
cause whats never there
Its .who needs the .
I notice its there, I noticed its there, I noticed.
Chorus:
Hold her by the reins
And ...
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay
Nothing patient, nothing stable here.
