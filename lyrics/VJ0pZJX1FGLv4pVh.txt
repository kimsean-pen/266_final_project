There's the words you ought to explain
As your walking your heart away
And I can hear the silence between your eyes
As I watch you leave with all my pride
All my pride

There's a fire in your lips I long to kiss
And if there's demons, want all of it
Now, every second goes so slow when your stuck in this curse
I can hear the sounds but they're all in reverse

And all my scars will heal in time
Now he's gone with all my pride
And everybody's saying what I need to do
But I haven't got a thing to prove
Prove to you

There's the smell I know to be home
Then the wonder when I wake up alone
And I'll pretend we're in true romance again
Whilst your at pots damer platz with another girl in your hand

And all my scars will heal in time
Now he's gone with all my pride
And everybody's saying what I need to do
But I haven't got a thing to prove
Prove to you

And all my scars will heal in time
Now he's gone with all my pride
And everybody's saying what I need to do
But I haven't got a thing to prove to you

And all my scars will heal in time
Now he's gone with all my pride
And everybody's saying what I need to do
But I haven't got a thing to prove
Prove to you
