Wander, there's no return
Keep moving on as the paradise burns
Leaving your trace in the sand
Harbor my soul for the final descent

Feeling alive, we are free in the silence
We have lived our lives, no hope in your eyes to find

Join me, come join me
Dancing in melancholy
Join me, won't you join me
Enter this chapter, infinitely

Choosing to give in to fate
Standing together as death allocates
Sorrow evaporates
Now our ties are an endless embrace

Join me, come join me
Dancing in melancholy
Join me, won't you join me
Enter this chapter, infinitely

A union in life, breathing silence together
Walking the stairs that have led us this way
Thinking of how to return to the page
Now that our times run out
