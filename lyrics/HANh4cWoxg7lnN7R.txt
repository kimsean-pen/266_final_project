Oh, hey, oh
Baby, baby, are you listening?
When you say you love me
Know I love you more

And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you

I adore you
Boy I adore You
Baby, can you hear me?
When I'm crying out for you

I'm scared oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more

And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
