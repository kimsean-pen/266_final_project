You remind me of a song
Got it on an old cassette
Sounded like an angel singing
About a pain in her chest

She sees the future
In mysterious ways
She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

People gathered around
Filled up auditorium
They wanna hear you sing your song
You sound like an angel from above

But she sees the future
In mysterious ways
She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

She can't calm down
I don't know why
She can calm down
I don't know why

It'll be peace sign, middle finger
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

She can calm down
(It'll be peace sign, middle finger)
I don't know why
She can't calm down
I don't know why

She started talking backwards
But nothing good it brings her
So next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
Peace sign, middle finger
The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign, middle finger

The next time that she sees him
It'll be peace sign middle finger
