Cuz I'm just tryna get to you
Shits been hard
But I'm making moves
Well I'm trying,
I'm trying
And I just hope you understand
All the pain in my back
And blisters on my hands
It's all you
Now you're screaming
At the top of your lungs
I don't need you

Ask me what's my problem
Baby come outside
Pulling on my hand like everything's alright
Messing with my heart
Something's just not right
I don't wanna go back
Baby you should know that

Ask me what's my problem
Baby come outside
Pulling on my hand like everything's alright
Messing with my heart
Something's just not right
I don't wanna go back
Baby you should know that

Yeah baby I don't really wanna let go
Drive 90 down the highway with my eyes closed
Yeah baby girl it's crazy,
I'm psycho
Yeah baby girl it's crazy,
I'm psycho

Cuz I'm just tryna get to you
Shits been hard
But I'm making moves
Well I'm trying,
I'm trying
And I just hope you understand
All the pain in my back
And blisters on my hands
It's all you
Now you're screaming
At the top of your lungs
I don't need you
