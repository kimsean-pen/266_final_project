Downstairs there's a party,
Won't you stay for me?
We're safe for the moment,
Love over you

Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,

The smiles on the faces,
But they dont know
This new life has started,
I'm leaving her.

Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex,
Teenage sex.
