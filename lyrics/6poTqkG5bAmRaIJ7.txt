Is there another being before this?
Is there another life?
Is there another? Are you willing to die?
Cause Im about to submerge the ocean
And resurrect the sky
And Im about to recognize all of your body
But all you say to me is what you wanna see
Youre not the man I need, thats what you said to me
Youre not the man I need, youre not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be
Was there another being before this?
Was there another life?
Life, we would go by, youre Mr. Blindfold
Cause Im about to submerge the ocean
And resurrect the sky
And Im about to recognize all of your body
But all you say to me is what you wanna see
Youre not the man I need, thats what you said to me

Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be
Understand your options, baby
I cant believe
Taking it all the love to keep
I cant believe
You can take a promise, baby
Throw it in the sea
Cause all the waves that come this way
Wash you path to me
But all you say to me is what you wanna see
Youre not the man I need, thats what you said to me
Youre not the man I need, youre not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be
All you say to me is what you wanna see
Youre not the man I need, thats what you said to me
Youre not the man I need, youre not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be
I love you
Exercise your chemistry
