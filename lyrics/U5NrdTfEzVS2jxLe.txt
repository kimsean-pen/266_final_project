Black eyes and hardly breathing
When there's no light
You sacrifice Alone, a monster living
You lost the fight before the fall

How did you end up in hell?

Hysterical, tragical Victim of ritual
Cynical, critical Victim of ritual
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer

Cold eyes, for every seeing
They try to hide, in thin disguise
Denied your soul from singing
The darkest night, the night you died

How did you end up in hell?

Hysterical, tragical Victim of ritual
Cynical, critical Victim of ritual
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer

Pandemonium, where's your heart from?
Pandemonium, where's your heart from?

Hysterical, tragical Victim of ritual
Cynical, critical Victim of ritual
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer
Ooohhh Ooohhh
She's a killer, killer
