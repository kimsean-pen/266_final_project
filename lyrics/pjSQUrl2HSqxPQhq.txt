The heat is on
On the street
Inside your head
On every beat

And the beat's so loud
Deep inside
The pressure's high
Just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on
Wooh!

Oh whoh oh ho, oh whoh oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh whoh oh ho, oh whoh oh ho
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
Oh it's on the street
The heat is
On

Oh whoh oh ho, oh whoh oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh whoh oh ho, oh whoh oh ho
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on
(Yeah!)
The heat is on
(Oh yeah)
The heat is on
(Burnin', burnin', burnin')
It's on the street
Woo... hoo
The heat is on

The shadow's high
On the darker side
Behind the doors
It's a wilder ride

You can make a break
Can win or lose
That's a chance you take
When the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh wha oh ho, oh wha oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh wha oh ho, oh wha oh ho
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on
Yeah!
The heat is on
Oh yeah
The heat is on
Burnin', burnin', burnin'
It's on the street
Woo-hoo
The heat is on
I can feel the fire
The heat is on
Flames (oh-oh) are burnin' bright
The heat is on
Baby can't you feel it?
Yeah it's on the street
Woo-hoo
The heat is on
I can feel the fire
The heat is on
Flames are burnin' bright
