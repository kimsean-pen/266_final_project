Before you jump in, tryna get under my skin
There's something I should let you know
It's gonna be impossible
'Cause I'm a made up mess in a backless dress
I don't wanna lead you on
'Cause I'll only do you wrong, oh!

You can have my heart, but you're not gonna leave with it
Light in the dark, yeah you almost believed in it
You've got me wrong
I've got you hanging round my neck saying "Romance isn't dead"

Oh you know, that I'm down for whatever
Uh huh, I told you that it won't be forever
So how come you still think that you're the one?
Baby, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh
I, I, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone

Let me tell you straight, I could be your worst mistake
Or you could get the best of me
Forget about the rest of me
With your cigarette in between your teeth
You could light me up
If i forget to breathe, oh!

You can have my heart, but you're not gonna leave with it
Light in the dark, yeah you almost believed in it
Thought you were strong
Now I've got you tied up in the bed screaming "Romance isn't dead"

Oh you know, that I'm down for whatever
Uh huh, I told you that it won't be forever
So how come you still think that you're the one?
Baby, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh
I, I, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh
I, I, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone

Yeah, you're stuck on me and now I can't move
Give it just a night and I'll cut you loose
Oh what a thing to do, yeah

Oh you know, that I'm down for whatever
Uh huh, I told you that it won't be forever
So how come you still think that you're the one?
I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
You know, oh, 'cause I'm
I told, I told you
Oh, how come you still think that you're the one?
Baby I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh
I, I, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
Oh oh oh
I, I, I'm just Chewing Gum until the flavour's gone
