Took you in the vineyard a couple hours after I met you
Didn't need my passport, said I'd let you keep it forever
I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in cape town
In cape town

I saw you, I met you
I loved you, I left you
In cape town

Woke me in the morning, asked me if I meant it
I didn't
Asked to be her husband, she already had one
In prison

I hardly knew a thing about you
I got lost in cape town
In cape town

I saw you, I met you
I loved you, I left you
In cape town
In cape town

Ran all of out paper, lost it all in pontoon when I was in Asia
I forgot how to call you
Went out to a grave yard to pick a couple flowers to give to you
When I got back to cape town
To cape town
To cape town
To cape town
To cape town
To cape town
To cape town
