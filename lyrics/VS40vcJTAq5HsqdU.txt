I want to know you
There's so much at stake
Can't face the memories
They bend me till I break
Hiding from the past

But it's eating me alive
Can't block it out
When it's coming from inside

Every turn leads me to a new dead end
Lost again, I'm screaming your name

Come close, come close
And call my name

How can you turn your back on me
When you know my pain
Stay close, stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me

That's begging to die

Precious denial, a stone to break my back

The chains I carry won't cut me any slack
Imprisoned by fear with no room for my heart
My only hope, only you can heal the scars
Every turn leads me to a new dead end
Lost again, I'm screaming your name

Come close, come close
And call my name
How can you turn your back on me
When you know my pain
Stay close, stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me
That's begging to die

Stay by my side
If you leave me I will die
Stay by my side
If you leave me I will die
Stay by my side
If you hold me I will fly
If you hold me I will fly
Will you hold me
Come close, come close
And call my name
How can you turn your back on me
When you know my pain
Stay close, stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me
That's begging to die
Come close, come close
And call my name
How can you turn your back on me
When you know my pain
Stay close, stay close
Light up the night
Save me from the part of me
That's begging to die
