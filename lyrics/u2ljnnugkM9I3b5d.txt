There's a little creepy house
In a little creepy place
Little creepy town
In a little creepy world

Little creepy girl
With her little creepy face
Saying funny things
That you have never heard

Do you know what it's all about?
Are you brave enough to figure out?
Know that you could set your world on fire
If you are strong enough to leave your doubts

Feel it and breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly so high
And you'll be walking on air

You feel this, unless you kill this
Go on and you're forgiven
I knew that, I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air

She has a little creepy cat
And a little creepy bat
Little rocking chair
And an old blue hat

That little creepy girl
Oh, she loves to sing
She has a little gift
An amazing thing

With her little funny eyes of hazel
With her little funny old blue hat
She will go and set the world on fire
No one ever thought she could do that

Feel it and breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly so high
And you'll be walking on air

You feel this, unless you kill this
Go on and you're forgiven
I knew that, I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air

Flitter up and hover down
Be all around, be all around
You know that I love you, go on

Feel it and breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly so high
And you'll be walking on air
You feel this, unless you kill this
Go on and you're forgiven
I knew that, I could feel that
I feel like I am walking on air
I am walking on air
I am walking on air
I am walking on air
