In my way did I use you, do you think I really abused you
On reflection now it doesn't matter:
How can you say I made you need me more than anyone else
Who can say it right now it's finished over:
It's my act, it's my calling, I explained exactly the falling
Different ways of life can never even:
Be the same when you saw me, could you always take me the
same way As I came and went I tried to remember you:
Still you stay
Tied in your way
Changing times
Watching the signs

How:
Could you see in me what you thought about all you want me to be
Now:
On reflection why should have I changed my ways for you
All around all around

Cry my sympathy's with you but I never lied to you all in all
it seems it's just an experience:
Placed my cards on the table told of everything I was able,

Understanding still not anything different:
Find another to lean on, start again for I should have long
gone, on reflection now it's just an experience.
Soon the pain will have ended, together never intended, as I
come and go I'll try to remember you.
Still you stay
Tied in your way
Changing times
Watching the signs
How:
All around all around...

I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
that we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
our time drifting away:

Look back it's not your game, together just in name.

I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
that we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
our time drifting away:

All around all around...
