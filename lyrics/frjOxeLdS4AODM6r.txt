I'm who I want
Living on emotion, ooh
I'm always on top when I get a notion
I know what I wanted
Boy, you looking real good, ooh
Get a little closer
I'm about to hook you up (oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

Just for tonight there's no tomorrow
I wanna see just how we can feel
It's time to let go
My body's talking
Just for tonight I'm feeling free
No chance to hold you
Ready for that, let's get it started

Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want you body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat
Turn up the fire
Turn up the fire

I'm who I want
Moving like the ocean, ooh
Take it to the top
Keep it in motion, mhm
It's getting close
Yeah, I'm all you know, ooh
Come over here
Baby, don't you blow it

Just for tonight I'm feeling free
No chance to hold you
Ready for that, let's get it started

Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want you body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat
Turn up the fire
Turn up the fire

We just began, we just began, we just began, ooh
Into the sun, into the sun, into the sun, ooh
Answer to none, answer to none, answer to none, ooh
Go higher, just fire, ooh

Turn up the fire
Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want you body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat
Turn up the fire
Turn up the fire

Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want you body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat
Turn up the fire
Turn up the fire

We just began, we just began, we just began, ooh
Into the sun, into the sun, into the sun, ooh
Answer to none, answer to none, answer to none, ooh
Go higher, just fire, ooh

Skin on my skin, I can't believe just how
Turn up the fire
I want you body next to my body now
Burning desire
Sparks in my brain, so crazy good right now
Turn up the fire
We turn up the heat
Turn up the fire
Turn up the fire
