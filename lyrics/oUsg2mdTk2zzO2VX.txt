To ends unknown
By means unworthy
To answer wishes long dead and gone
Old empty promises
A just reward for the blind
Belief makes work for idle minds
We lost our way
We lost our way
The only dream that matters
Is the one you wake up from

Go
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

I call for a world
Where we are nothing
More than the sum of what we know
Are we to be held hostage
By our tolerance for the intolerant
Then we've lost our way
We've lost our way
To hope is to surrender
In this series of defeats

Go
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

We've lost our way
A pain far too familiar
Denounce your savage self

Go
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default
Faithless by default
