I just don't understand
Why you're running from a good man, baby
Why you wanna turn your back on love
Why you've already given up
See I know you've been hurt before
But I swear I'll give you so much more
I swear I'll never let you down
Cause I swear it's you that I adore
And I can't help myself babe
Cause I think about you constantly
And my heart gets no rest over you

You, you, yeah
You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
You can call me hopeless
(Hopeless)
Baby, cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect
Tell me what do I gotta do

To prove that I'm the only one for you

What's wrong with being selfish
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll be taking up your time
Until the day I make you realize
(Realize)
That for you there could be no one else
I just gotta have you for myself
(For myself)
Baby, I would take good care of you
(Good care)

No matter what it is you're going through
I'll be there for you when you're in need

Baby, believe in me
Cause if love was a crime
Then punish me
I would die for you
Cause I don't want to live without you

Oh, what can I do
You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love

(Ooh, your love)
You can call me hopeless

(Hopeless)
Baby, cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect

Tell me what do I gotta do
To prove that I'm the only one for you
Why do you keep us apart

Why won't you give up your heart
You know that we're meant to be together
Why do you push me away
All that I want is to give you love
Forever and ever and ever

(Forever and ever and ever)
You can call me selfish
But all I want is your love
(All I want is your love)
You can call me hopeless, hopeless
(Hopeless)
Cause I'm hopelessly in love
You can call me unperfect
But who's perfect
Tell me what do I gotta do, baby
To prove that I'm the only one for you, oh
(To prove that I'm the only one)
Selfishly I'm in love with you
(Yeah, yeah)
Cause I've searched my soul
(Oh, searched my soul, baby)
And know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
(Selfishly, I'm)
Cause I've searched my soul
(Searched my soul)
And know that it's you
Selfishly I'm in love with you
(So in love with you)
Cause I've searched my soul
And know that it's you
To prove that I'm the only one for you
So what's wrong with being selfish
Selfish
Selfish, yeah, yeah
So what's wrong with being selfish
