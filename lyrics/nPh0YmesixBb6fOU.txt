Remembering the first time we made love
Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling

Sitting here glad as I am with your photograph
I hold it in my hands aching for a vision of you
You're right in front of me looking at the photograph
And the way you were looking at me

I was remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

Sitting here looking at the table, it's just like a photograph
There's you and me, fruit, drink, good food
All the things we did, the things we did
From the shower we took to the very first look

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

You're rich, you're beautiful, you're in love
How wonderful life can be
Just the way that you wanted it to be

I am the color of the night
I am the color of the night
If you could only make it right
If you could only make it right

Remembering the first time we made love
I was just recalling
Remembering the first time we made love

Remembering the first time we made love
I will never forget you girl
Remembering the first time we made love

Remembering the first time we made love
Love you, love you, love you girl
Remembering the first time we made love
