Take me alive
Leave me to die
Bound to the earth
This isn't goodbye

Cut through the heart
Mangle my veins
Till i'm no more
Teach me these pains

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me

I couldn't run
I wouldn't hide
Lay on the ground
I should've died

Red river flows
Lights start to fade
Your work is done
Please, let me decay

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me

(I need you to hurt me)
(I need you to fight me)
(I need you to kill me)
(I need you to destroy me)

(I need you to hurt me)
(I need you to fight me)
(I need you to kill me)
(I need you to destroy me)

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me

I need you to hurt me
I need you to fight me
I need you to kill me
I need you to destroy me
