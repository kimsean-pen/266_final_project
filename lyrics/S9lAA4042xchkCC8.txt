You'll never be alright till you get it done
Drowning in the silence, c away the ones you love
And I've been told you'd be my only friend
And if that is true, I'll hold on to the end.

Give it a try,
You won't deny,
You will never be alone and we'll never be
We'll clean up the mess that was meant to be
You will never be alone
In another fantasy

Tried so hard to find someone new
But I'm a lonely child, I'm a lonely child longing for it
I've been told you'd be my only friend
And if that is true, I'll hold on to the end.

Give it a try,
You won't deny,
You will never be alone and we'll never be
We'll clean up the mess that was meant to be
In another fantasy
In another fantasy

In another fantasy
In another fantasy
In another fantasy
In another fantasy
In another fantasy, you will never be alone and you'll never be
Another fantasy
