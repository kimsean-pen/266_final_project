Goddamn your righteous hand
I eat innocent meat
The housewife I will beat
The prolife I will kill

What you sow I will reap
I scar myself you see
I wish I wasn't me
I am the little stick
You stir me into shit
I hate therefore I am
Goddamn your righteous hand
Goddamn ooh Lord, Goddamn ooh Lord
Goddamn ooh Lord, Goddamn ooh Lord

On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak

Don't mean a fuck to me
I am the VHS
Record me with your fist
You want me to save the world
I'm just a little girl
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgements and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me
Get your gunn, get your gunn
Get your gunn, get your gunn, get...
