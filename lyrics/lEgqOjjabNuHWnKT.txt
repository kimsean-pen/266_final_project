When your parents met,
It was a lonely night
They figured, yeah, who cares?
People get married all the time
Then they made you up
And they brought you home
And they laid you down
And said "God, what have we done?"
What have we done?

Now you're a spec of dust on a floating rock
You're the fastest hand on the smallest clock
You're a paper bird in a body cage
And when you break out, it'll leave everyone in pain
Oh, in pain

No god above
There's evil all around
I think it's safe to day that I know that now
Sometimes I laugh
And sometimes I cry
Maybe I've been feeling like I'll never know why
