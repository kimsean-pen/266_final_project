I was stumbling into battle
i was walking into walls
'till i walked myself to peter
and i let my shadows fall.

he's a boy who never ages.
rides a goat around the lake
he's a friend who never falters
to change my circling fate.

he said dance across the battle
but punch straight through that wall
though your knuckles may be bleeding
they'll be healed before the fall.

after war comes peace
after peace comes war
but remember
if it weren't for fighting.
we'ld be fighting for ever mo
