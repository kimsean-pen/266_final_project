My hands are searching for You
My arms are outstretched towards You
I feel You on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips for You
This fire rising through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing You
I'm alive

I'm alive

I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
& You whisper You love me
& I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing say we are alone with You
I am alone, & they are, too, with You
I'm alive

I'm alive
I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing

Holding on to what I'm feeling

Savoring this heart that's healing
& so I cry (holy)
The light is white (holy)
& I see You

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing
Take my hand, I give it to You
Now You own me, all I am
You said You would never leave me
I believe You, I believe
I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healed
