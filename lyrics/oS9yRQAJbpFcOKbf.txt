Hey baby, you said you need someone to be there for you
To love you all night long?
It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here and I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do

Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you're nothing when you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'd give the world to make you mine (la la la la la)
I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
I'll touch all the places he would not
And some he never knew would get you hot
Nothing is forbidden when we touch

Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do (every little thing)
I'll do them for you
Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

Take you out on a night cruise on a yatch just can't lose
Cause we got a lot to look forward to one two whatcha gonna do
What good is a diamond nobody can see
I hear he got you on lockdown but I got the master key yeah
I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway I'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love

Baby when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden when we touch baby

Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do (every little thing)
I'll do them for you
Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

(La la la la la)
I'll light up all the candles all around
Show me to the subway I'll go down
Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love
Baby when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothing is forbidden when we touch oooh yeah

Baby I wanna do all the things your man won't do (I'm gonna I'm gonna ohhh)
I'll do them for you
Sweet lady I wanna do all the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you

Oooh I gotta a jones in my bones for you
There ain't a damn thing that I won't do
Make your body cream with my sex machine
I won't stop until I hear your mother scream

All the things your man won't do...
All the things your man won't do...
All the things your man won't do...
