Good times for a change
See the luck I've had
Would make a good man turn bad
So please please please
Let me let me let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had would make a good man
Bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
