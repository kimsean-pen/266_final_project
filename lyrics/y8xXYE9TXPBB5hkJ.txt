I like you simple
I like the way you walk
You liked me simple
You fell for the way I talk

You were making me high
I didn't know it wasn't meant to last
I turn the lights down
Hearts can fall out of love
Out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love
Nothing's gonna heal it
Out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love

But I can't let you go
Put your heart on repeat
Remember love, remember me
And I can't let you go
Put your heart on repeat
Remember us
Remember me

Falling in and out of love is a part of us
I keep hanging on to secret promises
You broke me apart like shattered glass
Our love is gross
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold, gold
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold, covered in gold

It should be easy
Guess I never figured you out
It's not easy
Finding love in the applause

Am I gonna be healed
When I rip apart the history
When you forgot us
You destroyed the rest of love in me

Out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love
Nothing's gonna heal it
Out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love, out of love

But I can't let you go
Put your heart on repeat
Remember love, remember me
And I can't let you go
Put your heart on repeat
Remember us
Remember me

Falling in and out of love is a part of us
I keep hanging on to secret promises
You broke me apart like shattered glass
Our love is gross
But I'm covered in gold
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold

Cause we're loving loving loving ah ey
Cause we're loving loving loving ah ey
Loving loving loving ah ey
Cause we're loving loving loving ah ey

Falling in and out of love is a part of us
I keep hanging on to secret promises
You broke me apart like shattered glass
Our love is gross
But I'm covered in gold
Gold, gold, gold, gold
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold, gold.

But I can't let you go
Put your heart on repeat
Remember us
Remember me

Falling in and out of love is a part of us
I keep hanging on to secret promises
You broke me apart like shattered glass
Our love is gross
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold, gold
But I'm covered in gold, gold, gold, gold
But I'm covered in gold.
