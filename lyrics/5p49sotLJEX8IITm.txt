I've been waiting for the day you say you want me back
I've been alone but baby I can't seem to understand

You threw my heart into the flames I took our pictures out the frames
I tried to throw 'em out but I still keep 'em just in case
If you're wondering if I still love you after so much time has passed
Since you asked

I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't

No, I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't

And I remember all the times you said you had my back
But now we're separated going down a separate path

You threw my heart into the flames I took our pictures out the frames
I tried to throw 'em out but I still keep 'em just in case
If you're still wondering if I still love you after so much time away
Here's what I say

I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't
I don't
And I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't

But I don't want to let you go
No, I don't want to let you go
Oh I don't want to let you go
No, I don't want to let you go

I don't really want you back
I just want the life we had
I don't really want you back
No, I don't
No, I don't really want you close
I just needed you to know
That I don't really want you back
No, I don't

But I don't want to let you go
No, I don't want to let you go
No, I don't want to let you go
No, I don't want to let you go
No, I don't
