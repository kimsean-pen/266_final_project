What, what, what, what
One, two!
One, two, three, ow!

Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age 14, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please

Frenemies
Who when you're down, ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through

Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby
You're the tops
Give it to me now

Four A.M. we ran the Miracle Mile
We're flat broke, but, hey, we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
Ha-ha-ha

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (Friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through

Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give

This whole damn world can fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through

Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give
Don't let go
I feel the music in you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
(Don't give up) Just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance, ripoff lying
FDA, big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in

Don't let go
One dance left
Don't give up
Can't forget
Don't let go
