Don't listen what your girlfriend says

She reads those magazines

That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper
And get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways
To help you forget about her
That bitch can eat her heart out...
Love bites
But so do I

So do I
Love bites
But so do I
So do I
LOVE BITES!
My lips are pale and vicious

You're foaming at the mouth

You've suffered in the darkness?
Well, I'll suck the pain right out!
So come and taste the reason
I'm nothing like the rest
I'll kiss you in a way
You'll never forget about me
That chick can eat her heart out...
Love bites
But so do I

So do I
Love bites
But so do I
So do I
So do I...
It tucks you in and kicks you down

It chews you up and spits you out

It messes with your sanity
By twisting all your thoughts around
They say it's blind
They say it waits

But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls
And won't let go until you fall
I WAS DOWN AND OUT, GOT UP!
I SAID "HEY LOVE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH!"

I'VE FELT PLEASURE WITHOUT PAIN!
MY SOUL, YOU'LL NEVER TAKE!
Love bites
But so do I...

Love bites
But so do I
So do I
Love bites
But so do I
So do I
So do I
Love bites
(And so do I
So do I)
Love bites
Love BITES!
