She cried to the southern wind
About a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown

Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's rainin' all over the world
It's raining all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown

Save me, oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's rainin' all over the world
It's raining all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

(Raining, raining)
(Raining, raining)

Raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
The longest night

And it's raining all over the world
Raining all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

You gotta save me, girl
When I'm ready for save
Oh, I'm a fool for you
You know I need you child
Come on and save me

Can't you feel what you're doin' to me now?
I'm on the run again
Gotta save your soul
