Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why? Your own child

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why?

It's alright

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fucked your own child
I rape, no-one hears me
It hurt as a child
Tied down, no-one hit me
And raped your own child

I sit, no-one hears me
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fucked your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt as a child
Tied down, no-one hears me
Mommy, why? Your own child

"I didn't touch you there"
Mommy said she didn't care
"I didn't touch you there"
That's why mommy stopped and stared

Little child, looking so sweet
I rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fucked your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why? Your own child

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Tell me why, your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why? Your own child

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why? Your own child
I scream, no-one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, I saw you watching
Mommy, why?

Motherfucker, I fucking hate you!
Fuck you!
Son of a bitch, you fucking ruined my life!
You fucked... I'm sick of it...

I hate you!
I fucking hate you!
Fuck you!
Piece of shit!

When I awake, I'll see your face
When I awake, I'll see your light
When I awake, I'll see your face
When I awake, I'll see your light
Mother, wake me from my dream
Mother, wake me in the night
