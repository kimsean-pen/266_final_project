You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, to last
'Cause baby you know I'm worth it

Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth
Hmm

'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (Oh)
And a real man just can't deny A Woman's Worth (A Woman's Worth)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm, hmm, hold up

'Cause If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
'Cause baby I know you're worth it

She walks the mile, makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth, oh!

'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me!)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby!)
And a real man just can't deny A Woman's Worth

No need to read between the lines
Spell it out for you (Spell it out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't
Go wrong when you value (Better value)
A Woman's (Woman's) Woman's (Woman's) Worth! Yeah

'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me!)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First baby)
And a real man just can't deny A Woman's Worth (A Woman's Worth)

'Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her (Nothin' like A Woman's Woth)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Ooh, ooh!)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (Comes first)
And a real man just can't deny A Woman's Worth (Woman's Worth!)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Stoo-bi-doo-bi-doo, doo
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Doo-doo-doo-dwee, doo-doo-dwee
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Ooh!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
