can you show me?'
the way that I should move
show me what I should do
to let me feel you
let me control you

one on one,
feels with you then it's you

closer than paradise
you stay in my head
and I'll move slow

closer than paradise
you stay my head
and I'll move slow

move your body
tell me what you need most
undress you with my eyes
singing to you times

let your lips tell you what you need most
if tonight's all we have
I'll give you all of me

uuuh,
all of me,
oooh,
I'll give you all of me

closer than paradise
you stay in my head
and I'll move slow

closer than paradise
you stay my head
and I'll move slow

I'll give you all of me
I'll give you all of me
and I'll move slow
