When evening shadows fade, I turn to my true love
She has the strength to say, the words thay I cannot

In darkness, our darkness
So heartless, this darkness

I'm lost here in the grey, I wait for your returning
I watch firelight play, flames flicker with my yearning

For darkness, our darkness
So heartfelt, this darkness

Through streets and avenues, will you come back to your lover
The place for me and you, is here with no other

In darkness, our darkness
So heartfelt, this darkness

My arms they open up for you
And where they fall it cuts the root
We talk of understanding
And we talk of love

When evening shadows change, I turn back to my true love
She has the strength to say, the words that I cannot

In darkness, our darkness
So heartfelt, our darkness
So heartless, this darkness
Our darkness, in darkness

We talk of love
