Hi
Hi
Welcome
Who's this?
Jonny.
Oh, okay, just checking.

Shrink-wrapped magazines in a paper bag
He hugged me when I came home
Only boy in a ballet class
He hugged me when I came home
Dad's on the pulpit talking about love
Mum's in the nursery cussing me out
He hugged me when I came home
Jean was crazy but she loved me,
when she died I slept in her car
He hugged me when I came home

Here, here I go again,
all these memories,
coming back at me
Here, here I go again,
all these memories,
get the best of me,
get the best of me

Have a headache?
We'll grab the oil
If you complain,
well, thats the devil talking
He hugs me when I come home
Your sister got married fourteen times
but if you fall in love, son, that's a crime
He hugs me when I come home
Well I fell in love and told them I was happy
My dad hugged me and said this would be the last hug
This would be the last hug,
This would be the last hug

Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me,
Get the best of me

Philip took me out for pizza in London
He said they were his friends and they weren't mine
Philip took me for a walk in New York City
Please hug me when I come home
He told me my story was boring
He told me my story was boring

Here, here I go again,
All these memories,
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of m

Here I go,
Here I go again
Here I go,
Here I go again
Here I go,
Here I go again
Here I go,
Here I go again
