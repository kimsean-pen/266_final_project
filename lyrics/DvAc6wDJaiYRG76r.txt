Lord, don't send me down
To that frustrating sound
Too many years
Always bringing me down

I'll keep doing what I'm doing
Heading down a lonesome track
Save all my lovin'
So they can't give it back

Lord keep me away
What you may cross my path
I don't burn my bridges with you I can't build them back

Now I'll keep doing what I'm doing
Heading down a lonesome track
Save all my lovin'
So they can't give it back
Save all my lovin'
So they can't give it back
