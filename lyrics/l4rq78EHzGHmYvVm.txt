She was dancing so hard
She danced herself into a diamond
Dancing all by herself
Dancing all by herself
And not minding

Doing the the thing as she dreamed it
Doing the the thing as she dreamed it

Her skin was sky blue
Her skin was sky blue
Under the lights
Diamond dancer, diamond dancer

She was dancing so hard
She danced herself into a diamond
Dancing all by herself
Dancing all by herself
And not minding

And the one thing on her mind was
The one thing on her mind was:
It's time I gave the world my light
It's time I gave the world my light
Starting tonight

Diamond dancer, diamond dancer
