Whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh, it's unforgettable
Whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh

Another change is comin'
A separation from defiant
(To self-reliant baby)
I feel the weather breakin'
It's turnin' rain into fire
(To take it higher baby)

With blind eyes open wide
I'm seeing it

I feel a rise inside me
It's untouchable, whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh
Like breathing fire in me, ohh ohh, it's unforgettable

My river's overflowin'
Into an endless sea of changes
(And rearranges baby)
I wanna break it open
I'm gonna take it to define it
(And realign it baby)

With blind eyes open wide
I'm seeing it
A lifeless life never comes alive
(Now I'm bringing it)

I feel a rise inside me
It's untouchable, whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh
Like breathing fire in me, ohh ohh, it's unforgettable
I feel a rise inside me
It's untouchable, whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh
I'm feeling higher, it's unforgettable

I'm getting higher (higher, higher)
I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive
I'm feeling higher (higher, higher)
I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive

I feel a rise inside me
It's untouchable, whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh
Like breathing fire in me, ohh ohh, it's unforgettable
I feel a rise inside me
It's untouchable, whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh
I'm feeling higher, it's unforgettable
Whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh, it's unforgettable
Whoa ohh ohh ohh ohh, it's unforgettable
