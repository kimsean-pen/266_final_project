You're tone deaf but you're singing a song
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
Your head swims in electric blues
If all fails, you can't lose

You lie low but your cover is blown
You turned on but there's nobody home
You think straight but your mind is not your own
You feed back with static shock

Your ears ring, your knees knock
I got all that I wanted
I got all that I need
I've got a plan for the future
And that's what I believe
But my fingers are cold, she's so old
And I cannot believe that you wanna be here

On your own, in this cradle of love

You're tone deaf but you're singing a song

You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
You're tone deaf but you're singing a song
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
