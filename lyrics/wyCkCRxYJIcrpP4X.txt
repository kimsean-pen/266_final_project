There are too many of us
That's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
We pose these questions to our children
Because the mountain ---
And live in tiny houses
Oh, same mistakes we make

'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses, here and there
Just passing out somewhere,
But you don't care

There are too many of us
That's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
For a moment I was dislocated
My terror on the loop, I swear
Flashing lights are vacating
and fake screens everywhere

'Cause there are too many of us
In tiny houses, here and there
Just passing out somewhere,
But you don't care

There are too many of us
In tiny houses, here and there
All looking through the windows
On everything we share

We pose these questions to our children
Leave the mountain strain
And live in tiny houses
Oh, same mistakes we make
There are too many of us
Oh, that's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
