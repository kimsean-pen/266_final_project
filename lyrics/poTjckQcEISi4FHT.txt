Who's that woman on your arm?
All dressed up to do you harm
And I'm hip to what she'll do
Give her just about a month or two

Bit off more than I can chew
And I knew, yeah, I knew what it was leading to
Some things, well, I can't refuse
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues

She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off your shoes
Yeah, right off your shoes
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues

Oh, yeah, in the bar you're getting drunk
Oh, yeah, yeah, I ain't in love
I ain't in lust, oh, no, no, no
Find the switch and shut the light
Won't you shut it? Yeah
Let it all come down tonight

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
Some face I'll never see no more, wrong
Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight, yeah

Let it loose, yeah, let it loose, let it loose
Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it loose, yeah, yeah

Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it all come down
