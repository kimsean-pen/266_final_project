We got in your car and we hit the highway
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains
Yellow and blood-red bits
Like a kaleidoscope

And flaming swords may guard the garden of Eden
But we consulted maps from earlier days
Dead languages on our tongues
Holding onto our last hope

And the day was bright and fine
And the highway sign
Said "San Bernardino
Welcomes you!"

I checked us into our motel and filled the bathtub
And you got in the warm, warm water
I pulled petals from my pocket
I loved you so much just then

And it was hard, but you were brave, you are splendid
And we will never be alone in this world
No matter what they say
We're going to be okay

We were safe inside
And our new son cried
"San Bernardino
Welcomes you!"
