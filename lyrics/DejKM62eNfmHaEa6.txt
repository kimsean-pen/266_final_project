With all we've been through
I know I'll never miss you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone

It all seemed so perfect
I believed everything was worth it
But you changed, started turning
Into a monster, a different person
Now you keep and hide your demons
And give fake a brand new meaning
You gave me a million reasons
To run, but one was all I needed

Now you're nothing but a memory!
So R.I.P to who you used to be!

With all we've been through
I know I'll never miss you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever
What I've been through
Felt like it wasn't with you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever

You played games, made excuses
I'm done with all your shit and the truth is
You forced me to do this
Pushed me 'cause you knew I'd lose it
You bend me to where I'm breaking
I should've known you'd try to play me
Every breath is a step I'm taking
A step away from the pain you gave me

Now you're nothing but a memory!
So R.I.P to who you used to be!

With all we've been through
I know I'll never miss you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever
What I've been through
Felt like it wasn't with you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever

Yeah, gone forever
No coming back
Listen

Everything we've been through, I didn't see it in you
With all your fucking issues, I just can't continue
I won't defend you, I won't pretend to
Act like I believe 'cause now I read you like a menu
So please get out of my face, you just keep crowding my space
With every inch you take, you push me in a thousand ways
So now I'm counting the days that I've allowed you to stay
Here past your welcome, I'd say about an hour late

With all we've been through
I know I'll never miss you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever
What I've been through
Felt like it wasn't with you
Because you're not who I remember
You're gone forever

You're gone forever
You're gone forever
You're not who I remember
You're gone forever
