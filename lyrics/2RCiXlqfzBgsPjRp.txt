I never get no sleep how my money all spent
But one day I'mma die and it won't mean shit
I'm sick of seein' kids tryin' to rap like this
Take that band tee off you don't listen to that shit
Bitch I'm an introverted, inverted cross rappin'
Mothafucker, go bump please leave me alone
Black metal bumpin'
Out my whip I'm gettin' in touch with Lucifer again
I was doin' fine but now I think I'm givin' into temptation
Mane
I don't work a job no more
I don't hate life no more
JK really just wanna croak
Granny find me dead on the floor
But I won't overdose
I don't pop pills like you
Speakin' to Hermes alone
You'll know what I mean, you lost

Friday I'mma trip all day
Saturday I'mma drink codeine
Sunday I'mma post up at the church
Burn it down Yung Varg I'm cursed

I forgot how to smile can somebody show me
Then again I never knew I just put on a show
Aye
I can not recall a time that I did not wanna keep my face under the surface of acid fillin' up my bathtub and dissolvin' in it until I am bone

I don't know what life is without a constant
Feelin' that I'm bein' held down under the water

You a big shot now you think you Satan's son huh?
Until you see him face to face and then he drag you under

Friday I'mma trip all day
Saturday I'mma drink codeine
Sunday I'mma post up at the church
Burn it down Yung Varg, I'm cursed
