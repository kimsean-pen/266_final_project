I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching
Well we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby can't you see through me
We're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was fighting
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

This song is for you (this song, this song)
This song is for you (this song, this song)
This song is for you (this song, this song)
This song is for you, you, you, you

I love you in place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you

(We were alone and I was)
Singing this song to you (We were alone and I was)
Singing this song (To you)

Oh yeah, singing songs
I was singing this song, it's for you
