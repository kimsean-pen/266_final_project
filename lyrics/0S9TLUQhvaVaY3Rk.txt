Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

When you are ready I will surrender
Take me and do as you wish
Have what you want your way's always the best way

I have succumbed to this passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie your wish will command me
Laugh as i fall to my knees

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Cannot control this empty delusion lost in the fire below
And you come running your eyes will be open
And when you come back i'll be as you want me only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me thinking your name as i sing

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Come
Come
Come to my sweet melody
Come
Come
Come to my sweet melody

Now you can't help it if you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And i feel useless don't care what the truth is
you will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me? don't try to come near me
so tired I sleep through the lie
If you desire to lay here beside me
Come to my sweet melody

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it back
Sing it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it back
Sing it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it back
Sing it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it back
Sing it back
Sing it back to me

Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me

Sing it back

Sing it back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back...

Bring it back
