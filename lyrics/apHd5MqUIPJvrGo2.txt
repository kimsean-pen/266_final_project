Halfway around the world
Lies the one thing that you want
Buried in the ground, hundreds of miles down
The first thing that arises in your mind while you awake
Is bending you til you break
Let me hold you now

Baby close your eyes
Don't open til the morning light
Baby don't forget
We haven't lost it all yet

Don't know what your made of
Til the one thing that you want
Id coming with the dawn and suddenly changes
Monday, syndicate meets everyone the same
But all we've lost to the flame
Listen to me now

Baby close your eyes
Don't open til the morning light
Don't ever forget
We haven't lost it all yet
All we know for sure
Is all that we are fighting for
Baby don't forget
We haven't lost it all yet

Someday when this is over
We may still have no answer
For now it's when I hold her
We are closer, we are closer
We are closer, we are closer

Baby close your eyes
Don't open til the morning light
Don't ever forget
We haven't lost it all yet
And all we know for sure
Is all that we are fighting for
Baby don't forget
We haven't lost it all yet

We are closer
We are closer
(We haven't lost it all yet)
Now we are closer
(We haven't lost it all yet)
We are closer
