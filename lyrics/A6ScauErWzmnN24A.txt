Thought you'd have my babi
Let me down, I never could fathom
Told me you were ready
Rearranged my life just to fight for you
Tell me why should I change for you?

Opened it up, gave you my all
It always seemed like it wasn't enough
I've tried to forget, peace and reset
But I can't forgive no more (Forgive no more)

I left you in the corners of my mind
I erased you from my life
There's no in-betweens this time
Said, I lost you in the corners of my mind
Can't let you dim my light
Got control of it this time
I left you (Left you)
I lost you (Lost you)

It was yesterday
You couldn't look me in my eyes, and then
There was nothing more that I could say
I thought what we had was unbreakable
Guess I was wrong

Opened it up, gave you my all
I know it seemed like you weren't enough
Try to forget, peace and reset
But I can't forgive you no more

I left you in the corners of my mind
I erased you from my life
There's no in-betweens this time
Said, I lost you in the corners of my mind
Can't let you dim my light
Got control of it this time

I left you (Left you)
I lost you (Lost you)

We never said goodbye
We used to fantasize
I only dream about you, without you
Oh, our love ain't one to follow
Our love won't see tomorrow
I only dream about us, without us

I left you in the corners of my mind
I erased you from my life
There's no in-betweens this time
Said, I lost you in the corners of my mind
Can't let you dim my light
Got control of it this time
