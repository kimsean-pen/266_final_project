I wanna write a song
One that can explain my loss
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and

Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn from the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return
To the wall and then down the floor

But I keep only seein' ra-a-ain
I will say no
But you keep crawlin' in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away-ay-ay-ay
In the dark is where I'll stray

I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Throw it all to the wall

And I keep only seein' ra-a-ain
I will say no
But you keep crawlin' in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away-ay-ay-ay
In the dark is where I'll...

I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to gro-o-o-o-ove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to gro-o-o-o-ove

I keep only seein' rain
I keep saying no
But you find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away-ay-ay-ay
In the dark is where I

I keep only seein' ra-a-ain
I will say no
But you keep crawlin' in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away-ay-ay-ay
In the dark is where I'll stray

I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to mo-o-o-o-ove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to
