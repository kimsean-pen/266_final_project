It's winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming
Oh, seagulls are flying over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's silky moon up in the sky
Yeah, children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

(Dreaming)
So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming)
Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming)
There's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming)
What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming)
A breathtaking scene
(With the dreams of the world)
(In the palm of your hand)

(Dreaming)
A cosy fireside chat
(Dreaming)
A little this, a little that
(Dreaming)
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming)
Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming)
What an extraordinary place
(And the dream of the child)
(Is the hope of the man)

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky
Yeah, mountains are zoomin' higher
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinnin'
And spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Oh, it's a bliss
