I just lie here waiting on you
And you're late, did you miss your train?

I been up here thinking of you
Saved your plate, but it's gone cold

Wonder if you're travelling with two
Nah that's crazy, you wouldn't would you?

So i'll just lie here waiting on you
Might seem crazy, but that's what i'll do
(I lie here waiting, I lie here waiting, I lie here waiting)

Yes i'm crazy, but that's what i'll do
(I lie here waiting, I lie here waiting, I lie here waiting)
