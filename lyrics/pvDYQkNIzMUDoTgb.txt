five, four, three, two, one

He holds...
the gun...
against.
my head
I close...
my eyes...
and bang...
I am dead
I know...
he knows...
that he's
killing me,
for mercy

And here I go
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

And here I go
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

And he holds my body
in his arms
He didn't mean
to do no harm
And he holds
me tight

Oh, he did it all
to spare me from
the awful things in life that come
And he cries
and cries
I know...
he knows...
that he's
killing me
for mercy

And here I go
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

And here I go
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

He holds my body
in his arms
He didn't mean
to do no harm
And he holds
me tight

Oh, he did it all
to spare me from
the awful things
in life that come
And he cries
and cries

five, four, three, two, one
five, four, three, two, one
five, four, three, two, one

The gun is gone and so am I,
and here I go
