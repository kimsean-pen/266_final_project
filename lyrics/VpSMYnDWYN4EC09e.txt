My soul can't be sold
Shake me cold, shake me cold
That's hallowed ground
That's hallowed ground
My spirit never told
Break my bone, break my bone
That's hallowed ground

Do your dirt, make your mark
My heart is a church of scars
That's hallowed ground
Break my skin, crack my skull
My holy land still grows
That's hallowed ground

That's hallowed ground, yeah yeah

Nothing's sacred, if it's wasted
We'll be safer, buried alive
But I still taste it
And hate but this won't turn me blind
Won't turn me blind
That's hallowed ground
That's hallowed ground, oho
