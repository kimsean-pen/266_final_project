Take a drag of your cigarette
Blow smoke til it fills my head
Make love till the break of light
Oh, flexing on that boy all night

Can we ratchet, all the time, make shit up, pretend that it's real
Can we turnt, up, every move, like it's written, for me and you

Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty
Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty

Sweat runs down the back of ur spine
And collects at the base of mine
I could swim fast but i never do
'Cuss i love the nasty mind on you

Can we ratchet, all the time, make shit up, pretend that it's real
Can we turnt, up, every move, like it's written, for me and you

Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty
Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty

Maybe i'm in a cage or something
Maybe the past night wasn't real
But if i only imagined you
Then let me stay inside my head

Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty
Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty,
Some things are best left unsaid
Some should even stay in your head
It's too naughty, it's too naughty,
Some things are best left unsaid
Move your body, move your body.
Oh, stay in my head (it's too naughty, it's too naughty)
Oh, huh
Oh Yeah, Yeah
Oh, huh
Oh, huh
