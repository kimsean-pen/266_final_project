Those times I waited for you seem so long ago
I wanted you far too much to ever let you go
You know you never got by, I feel it too
And I guess I never could stand to lose
It's such a pity to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh

Could I ever love someone
Like the one I see in you
I remember the good times baby now
And the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh

'Cause baby it's over now
No need to talk about it
It's not the same
My love for you's just not the same
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love
And my love won't stand the pain
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love
And my love

Goodbye to you-ooh
Goodbye to you-ooh
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh

Now, could I ever love someone
Like the one I see in you
Yeah, I remember the good times baby now
And the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh

Goodbye baby (Goodbye baby)
So long, darlin'
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you-ooh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Bye-bye, baby (Bye-bye, baby)
So long darlin'
Goodbye to you (bye-bye baby)
Goodbye to you-ooh
