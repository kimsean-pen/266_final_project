It's late
And we're up at night
Baby, you touch me right
Kissing my genders
In our bedroom light
You're touching me tender
You make me so wet

With my body all femme, uh uh
And my face all masc, mm mm
Touch me again, baby
You make me wet, baby

Transome
Kissing me tender
You make me so wet

With my body all femme, uh uh
And my face all masc, mm mm
Touch me again, baby
You make me wet, baby
