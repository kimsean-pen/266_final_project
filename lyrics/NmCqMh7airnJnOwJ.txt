Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

Did you anticipate another day?
A longer stay, yeah
At least it wasn't mother's day
No roses to buy
Had control, had quite the hold
But the world gets what it wants when it needs it
Silver to silver, it's out of reach
Give to your giver, you're on your knees
Back home for dinner, the wind lets me speak
And every September you know right where I'll be, yeah

Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

And I'd die for you
You were taking your polaroids
I never saw you leave in the morning
By the suicide bridge
Said have a good summer
Before I grabbed your number
We became more than friends
Am I enough? Higher up
I was scared to fall in love but you got me to jump

I'm head over heels
Layin' in a field and you're next to me
Your hair gold
Like you drive by the coast seven days a week
I must be dreamin'
'Cause shit never works out with the girl of my dreams
And I'd do anything for you, for you
That's how much you mean to me

Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

Give it all I can for you
Write it in the sand for you
Everything I do is for you
For you, for you

Yeah, yeah
We can fade in, yeah
We can fade in, yeah
We can fade in, yeah

I know who has my heart
I know who has my heart
I know who has my heart
