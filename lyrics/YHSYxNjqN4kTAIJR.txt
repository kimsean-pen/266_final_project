Outrunning karma that boy
He's such a charmer all the
Bugs and their larva follow
Him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying he'll drag
Them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it all the
Poor people he's forsaken karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escaping till he dies

Outrunning karma that boy
Can't run no farther it's the
Last days of Sparta follow
Him down to meet Apollo

Then he'll brace for battle in the night
They'll fight because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it all the
Poor people he's forsaken karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down a saint in karma
There's really no escaping till he dies

La la la, la la
La la la, la la
La la la, la la, la la
La la la, la la
La la la, la la
La la la, la la, la la

He's never gonna make it all the
Poor people he's forsaken karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escaping till he dies

La la la, la la
La la la, la la
La la la, la la, la la
