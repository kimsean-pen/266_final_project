Here it comes
The unavoidable sun
Where's my head?
And what the hell have I done?
And you know
I don't remember a thing
I don't remember

A thing
So I'm dumb
Am I placating the numb?
Should I fold?
Cut off my tongue
So you say
Apparently I'm digging it in
I can't feel

A thing

And you've won
So I go bury my head in the ground
Yet I won't lose what I said
In the sound of the words and the numb that it brings
Now I can't feel a thing

Here it comes
The unavoidable sum
Of what's just happened
And what's been done
And you know
I don't remember a thing
I don't remember
A thing

But it keeps on coming and I stop
But it keeps on coming and I stop
But it keeps on coming and I stop

But it keeps on coming and I stop
But it keeps on coming and I just stand still
But it keeps on coming and I just stop moving

But it keeps coming, it keeps on coming
So I start running and I stop
But it keeps on coming and I just stand still
But it keeps on coming and I just stop moving
But it keeps coming, it keeps on coming
So I start running and I stop
But it keeps on coming and I just stand still

But it keeps on coming and I just stop moving
But it keeps coming, it keeps on coming
So I start running and I just stop
But it keeps on coming and I just stop moving
But it keeps on coming and I just stop moving
But it keeps coming, it keeps on coming
So I start running and I just stop
But it keeps on coming and I just stand still
But it keeps on coming and I just stand still
But it keeps coming, it keeps on coming
So I start running
And I run, and I run, and I run, and I run
And I run, and I run, and I run, and I run
And I run, and I run, and I run, and I run
And I run, and I run, and I run
