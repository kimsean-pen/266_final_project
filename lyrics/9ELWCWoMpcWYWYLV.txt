I saw you hiding in the ivy
I know you're too afraid to call
They're getting ready for the winter here
They've gathered pyramids of salt
You saw them having trouble breathing
I know you think that it's your fault
I saw you hiding in the ivy
Keeping quiet through the fall

There's a bird inside your rib cage
He screams so I never forget
I wanna break open your sternum
I wanna rip him from his nest
And sow you back up like a garden
Growing flowers from your chest
There's a bird inside your rib cage
I keep trying to forget

I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand
You washed it away again

I saw you hiding in the ivy
Watched the night start to decay
And you wonder in the morning who's gonna drag
The sun out of the lake
You move gently off the sore spots
I can see that you're in pain
Everything left in the light here long enough
Is someday gonna fade

I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand
You washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands
I drew a line in the sand,
you washed it away again

We're so vacant
These bodies
Collapsing
So gracefully
And I love you
And I'm sorry
And I understand if you blame me
And I'm helpless
And you're drowning
And I'm beating at the water here so desperately
So desperately

I drew a line in the sand with these worthless fucking hands
I drew a line in the sand
You washed it away again
I drew a line in the sand with these goddamn worthless hands
I drew a line in the sand
You washed it away again

Don't wash me away again
