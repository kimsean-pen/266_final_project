Looking for drugs in all the wrong places
Wanted to be famous, but ended up nameless
Love is not the answer, I'm in love with this stuff
I spent every last dime in a stranger's trunk

It's alright, it's okay
I'm alright, I'll be okay

First time I felt like I was gonna die
But I've gotten pretty good at telling myself it's fine
Anna talks me down and gives me sips off her beer
Head pounding reveille, how did I get here?

It's alright, I'll be okay
Let it go, let it go all the way down 'til there's no where left to fall
It's a shame, all the ways we build ourselves up, just to let each other down

Looking for drugs in all the wrong places
Felt a change coming, but I couldn't face it
Tried to keep my cool when I finally made it home
I had a bloodshot excuse for every lie I told

It's alright, it's okay
I'm alright, I'll be okay
Let it go, let it go all the way down 'til there's no where left to fall
It's a shame, all the ways we build ourselves up, just to let each other down

Last night is all a blur to me
I don't remember anything
But I vaguely recall being alone

It's alright, it's okay
I'm alright, I'll be okay
Let it go, let it go all the way down 'til there's no where left to fall
It's a shame, all the ways we build ourselves up, just to let each other down
Let it go, let it go all the way down 'til there's no where left to fall
It's a shame, all the ways we build ourselves up, just to let each other down
