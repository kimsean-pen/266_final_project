Binary lie never scratch it on my skin
But you'd loved to see the mark just to fill the blackness in
I know what you are
You're the last thing I see as my lungs fill
I'll be god damned if you didn't love the sin
While you offer up advice just to keep your secrets in
I know what you are
You're the last breath I breathe as my lungs fill

Fuck love
It only goes away
There's no god damn good in this goodbye you made me say
Don't love ever again
Fuck love
Your promise was in vain
There's no god damn good in this goodbye you made me say
Don't love ever again

Counting all the days that deception was the game
I lived every single day just to keep my promises
I can't hide the scar
Now my last breath is yours and my lungs fill
Didn't see the snake that was signaling the change
I'll be damned for my sleep but still I hold you to blame
Still hold you to

Fuck love
It only goes away
There's no god damn good in this goodbye you made me say
Don't love ever again
Fuck love
Your promise was in vain
There's no god damn good in this goodbye you made me say
Don't love ever again

I can't hide these scars
I can't hide these scars

Fuck love
Fuck love
