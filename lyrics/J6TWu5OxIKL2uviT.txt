Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I can't bear the thought of you
Moving on with someone else
Pressing on her throat I could feel it turning cold now
I can't bear the thought of you
Locking arms with someone else
Hold it very tight, crystal lights, image in my mind
I won't tell a lie now

I'm on time, on Adderall
You'da think I learned my lesson
Hollywoodland has it all

California you're a god
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I can't bear the thought of you
Making love to someone else
Pressing on her throat, I can make it colorful, yeah
There's a lot that I can bear
But I can't see you really dancing with a girl
Bash her in the head 'til she dead
I was just a kid, I was innocent, yeah

I'm on time, on Adderall
You'da think I learned my lesson
There was writing on the wall
Making anything a blessing
Building castles and they fall
You can taste it on my accent
Hollywoodland has it all

California you're a god
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Praise be to Hollywood now I'm a rockstar
I stay awesome on the plug, don't get no phone calls
Don't say my name around these parts
This is my boulevard

Cali you're a god, California you're a
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
California you're a god (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
California you're a god
