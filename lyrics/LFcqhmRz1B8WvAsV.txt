I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
And I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
Yeah I've paid my dues just to make it
Everyone wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, no

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
It's 'cause I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
'Cause I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
