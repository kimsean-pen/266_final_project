The future me I haven't met
There's some things you might regret
Like giving up on love too fast
Chasing shadows from your past
Future me I haven't met

There's gonna be some pain
It's good to feel something

Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am
Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am
Right now
Right now

They don't know you like I do
They don't know what you've been through
They're hands up black and blue
Never letting go of you
They don't know you like I do

There's gonna be some pain
It's good to feel something

Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am
Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am
Right now
Right now
Right now

I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow

Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am
Right now, I'm already who I wanna be tomorrow
Who I wanna be tomorrow is who I am

Right now
What are you waiting for?
Right now
What are you waiting for?
Right now
What are you waiting for?
Right now
What are you waiting for?
Right now
