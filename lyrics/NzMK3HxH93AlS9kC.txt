Cries of outrage
Seem to go unanswered
The sound of dying on the bridge
The sound of pleading for dear life
No justice for the loss
The empty disavowals of the wicked
As endless incarnations play out in tandem
Our fundamentals are gone
How is it that the more we evolve
The more we endlessly regress?
"To protect and serve", and yet no one is safe
After so many mistakes we haven't learned a thing
