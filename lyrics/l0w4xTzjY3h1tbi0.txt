Wil' out club, baby told you bout the plan, it ain't
Just won't fall in love, I can tell the way you grill
Me? I don't even have to trill
Tripping' so long that the neighbors know yo name
Just might call the hotel, maybe we should dip
Vegas is waiting' on the strip right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know what would happen if we kissed right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Right here and right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Already know, but I wanna be sure
Know that I wanna be yours right here and right now.
