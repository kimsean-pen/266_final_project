Fresh off the block cuz these bitches can't hold me
Thug motivation bumping Jeezy with my OG
Word to the Bible and the dope fiends
I could hit a switch make this bitch catch the holy

Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy off the block

Bad boy bad boys what you gonna do
When the pigs come for you with a loaded 22
You a dead man got a make a different plan
Gotta get rich then switch when shit hit the fan
Nigga i'm the top gun of the block,
New age 2Pac, modern day rico, robe on with two Glocks,
Black Michael jackson smooth motherfucking criminal,
Fuck a knife fight let my guns go digital
(BITCH I'M A)

Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy off the block

Dreadlocks on my state ID,
I lead an army to your rally put your
State on freeze,
They put your faces on the wall but they want it for free,
They pay you nothin cuz they know yo ass ain't gon' read
Now we on 10, can we say amen,
