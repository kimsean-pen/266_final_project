A white house, a white room
The program of today
Lights on, switch on
Your eyes are far away

The map represents you
And the tape is your voice
Follow all along you
Till you recognize the choice

I take pictures
Photographic pictures

Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room

I said I'd write a letter
But I never got the time
And looking to the day
I mesmerize the light

The years I spend just thinking
Of a moment we both knew
A second boss looking into
It seems it can't be true

I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room

I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
