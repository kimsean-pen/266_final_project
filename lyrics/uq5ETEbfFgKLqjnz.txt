I remember standin on the corner at midnight
Tryin to get my courage up
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown
Loved to watch her do her stuff

Through the long lonely nights
She filled my sleep
Her body softly swayin
To that smokey beat
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

And the poolhalls, the hustlers, and the losers
Used to watch em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closin time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies
She looked so young and sweet
As she made her alone down that empty street
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet
Oooooh

Sometimes even now, when I'm feelin lonely and beat
I drift back in time and I find my feet
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet
