Mama save me, save me
Mama bless me to my bones
You have start the fire
Ooh, reignite my soul
With your poison sting
Is deep and true
I'd do anything
Your sweet perfume, you bleed
'Til the well is overflow
You're my gold, my hunger
Where you go I will follow
Sweet poison sting
I see the light
I see everything
In you tonight, breathe

In and out here we go
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Mama I'mma give it back to you

All the stars, in the sky
So beautiful, In your eyes
Sunshine
Reachin' out
Reachin' out for you
Just to kiss your mouth
Wanna turn you inside out
Is there such a thing as you do to me
Sweet poison sting lets me see
I'll be your king
'Cause you are my queen

In and out here we go
Over and again and again
All of the love you give to me
Mama I'm gonna give it back to you

Don't let it get away
And if we did
We're gonna get it back
And in time you and me
We will, we will, we will, we will be
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Mama I'm gonna give it back to you

Turn around here we go
Over and again and again
All of the love you give to me
Mama I'm gonna give it back to you
Oh and the love
I'm gonna give it back to you
And the love
Mama I'm gonna give it back to you

All of the love you give to me
Mama I'm gonna give it back to you...
