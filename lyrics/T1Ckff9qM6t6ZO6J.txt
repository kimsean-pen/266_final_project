Would you remember me
When we were only seventeen
When we were living in our dreams
When we were young.

And all of those midnight skies
Swallowed up our childish eyes
Everything we thought was a lie,
When we were young.

And I know when your world it shakes
It can make you ache
It can bring you to your knees
It's not where you go it's just where you're going
And who's the company.

Through the tears we cry let them pass us by,
And get washed into the sea
Wont you just remember me when I was your life?
I was yours and you were mine.

When we were never scared at all
Broken hearts and alcohol
Never seemed to fill the holes when I was yours.

Ohh

And I know when your world it shakes
It can make you ache
It can bring you to your knees
It's not where you go it's just where you're going
And who's the company.

Through the tears we cry let them pass us by
And get washed into the sea.
Wont you just remember me when I was your life?
Oh, I was yours and you were mine.

And oh oh oooh. And oh oh oooh.

Now I just sleep all day
Dreaming that you'll steal me away
But in my dreams you'll always stay
But I'm awake

Oh I'm awake ohh.

And I know when your world it shakes
It can make you ache
It can bring you to your knees
It's not where you go it's just where you're going
And who's the company.

Through the tears we cry let them pass us by
And get washed into the sea.
Wont you just remember me when I was your life?
Oh when I was your life.
I was yours and you were mine.
