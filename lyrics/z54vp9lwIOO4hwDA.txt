I love when it's raining
So quiet all morning
The sun breaks through the broken clouds
Like painted pictures in old hotels

Keep the light on
So I can see
In the hallway
Everything that I could be
I am so scared
That I'm failing
I don't know why
I can't seem to sleep these days

In summer we're waiting til winter forever
We can't forget good times we've had
With blurry pictures of candid laughs

I love when it's raining
So quiet all morning
The sun breaks through the broken clouds
Like painted pictures in old hotels

I remember
We were smiling
It was bright out
There were no clouds in the way
Now we're older
And it is colder
I don't know why
I can't seem to sleep these days

In summer we're waiting til winter orever
We can't forget good times we've had
With blurry pictures of candid laughs

I love when it's raining
So quiet all morning
The sun breaks through the broken clouds
Like painted pictures in old hotels
In old hotels...
