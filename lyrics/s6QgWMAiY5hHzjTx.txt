Who am I, is this me?
Am I one of the team?
I've gone cold, hard to deal
Used to stand where I kneel

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

I want more, than I need
I don't know what is real

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

Whispering their names, faces, uniforms I've worn
And now that is gone
Always climbing, to fall down again
Holding onto everything that's not what it seems

I've been told, dreaming's free
Think I'll go back to sleep

Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?

Calling out the names, faces, uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing, to fall down again
Holding onto everything that's not what it seems
