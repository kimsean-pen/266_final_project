Hey kid
You look much cooler on these drugs
Fight kid
Some motherfucker wants your blood
Your blood
And I'm not scared, I know this type of shit
They want blood but they hate the taste of it
And I know that everything's alright

Cuz I'm alive.
But I'll kill myself.
When my worlds. Are coming down

White noise. This TV screen she's like my mother
Hey boys, some naked body in my arms
My arms
But I'm not sure if I'm in love with her
She's young so I know she'll say it first
But I'm sure that everything's alright.

Cuz I'm alive.
But I'll kill myself.
When my worlds. Are coming down
I hate coming down

I'll kill myself. Hold my breath. Watch me
I'll kill myself. Hold my breath. (garbled)

And I'll kill myself when my worlds are coming down
I hate coming down
I hate coming down.
