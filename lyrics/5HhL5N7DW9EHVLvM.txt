What if you do it for me?
It's so hard to stop the sun

(Choose to forget, don't be afraid
Try to find comfort and strenght in me
No time to rest, no time to waist
And don't try to change everything in me)

So I haven't thought it's done
My illusions left me alone
Now I'm seeking it at night
And I'm heading home

(The shadows following me, the shadows hunting me)

You're cross the borderline
So fast you turned me and left alone
You're closing last frontier and faking that's for me - stumbling-stone

So I haven't thought it's done
My illusions left me
Now I'm seeking it at night
And I'm heading home

So be for me

(There is no way to fight back
There is no time to waste
The shadows hunting me
I'm never come back)

You're cross the borderline
So fast you turned me and left alone
(It's living nightmare)
You're closing last frontier and faking that's for me - stumbling-stone
(Breaking down reality)

So be for me
