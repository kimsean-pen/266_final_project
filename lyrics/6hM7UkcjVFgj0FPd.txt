Slow, don't take it slow when you put on that hands
That black velvet cap
Well, this is that
Long due occasion
You can wear it as
Don't send this invite back

Slow, don't kill me slow, don't kill me slow
No, never never
No don't kill me slow
No, never never
Kill me quick, kill me quicker
If you can, I can not take it slow
Don't kill me slow

When you showed your executioner's cap to me
You put it on for me
Said that I would see
You'd kill whatever
Sapped your love for me
So put it on for me
Put it on again, oh

Slow, don't kill me slow
No, never never, no don't kill me slow
No, never never
Kill me quick, kill me quicker
If you can, I can not take it slow
Don't kill me

Don't go back to high-res timelapses
And shift or pass me
Be least then snow into still life ripens
Stop motion, perishing
Feast of larvae explode
Blue dust shadow of mould

Slow, slow, slow, slow
Slow, slow, slow, slow
Slow, slow, slow, slow
Slow, slow, slow, slow
Slow
Slow
Slow
