Look away
you paint me in
Sometimes I
grow older
funny how
the moment comes
closer still
to know you

So you gave
a quiet life
My own chance
at order
I won't toss
your way aside
for any corner
of the world

There's no answer to the question
We are a mutual possession
This is the circle that we live in
These are the people that we've been
There is no answer to the question
We are a mutual possession
This is the Circle that we live in
These are the people that we've been
