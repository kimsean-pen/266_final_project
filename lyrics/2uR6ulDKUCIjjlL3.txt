So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again, I think I missed again, oh
I think about it from time to time

When I'm lonely and on my own
I try to forget and yet

Still rush to the telephone
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again, I think I missed again, oh
Or did I miss again, I think I missed again, oh
Well it feels like something you want so bad
And then you think you've got it

But it's something you already had
You can feel it all around you
But it's something you just can't touch
And I feel it coming at me
Yes I can feel it coming at me

Or did I miss again, I think I missed again, oh
Oh I missed again, I think I missed again, oh
So I'm waiting in line
But would you say if I was wasting my time
Did I miss again, I think I missed again, oh
Oh I missed again, I think I missed again, oh
Oh I missed again, I think I missed again, oh
Oh I missed again, I think I missed again, oh
Oh I missed again
