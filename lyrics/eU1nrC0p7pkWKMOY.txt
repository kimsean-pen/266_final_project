* Gonna get, gonna get over you, over you
Gonna get, gonna get over you
Gonna get, gonna get over you, over you
Gonna get, gonna get over you
'Cause tomorrow I know I'll get over you
'Cause tomorrow I know I'll get over you
Today you're heavy on my mind, baby
I just can't face the face that you said goodbye
Why you said goodbye, why you made me cry
Why you lived in lie,
you said your love wouldn't die
But baby, I can't let this get me down
I've got my life to live, I've got more love to give

So I'm crying out, nursing this pain
in my heart, in my heart
Everyone has a destiny, so do I
I've got no time to waste
I'm the star in my life, you see
Yes, it's me and only meant for me
Better get myself together, enjoy my life forever
Not thinking of you, 'cause you made me blue
Shame on you 'cause
my love was true, it was true
I'd better get myself together
And I'll enjoy my life forever
