I'm keeping it confidential, this is serious stuff
My secret heart will hold out for your love
But it's confidential, you don't know how I feel
And I am too shy to keep it real

Woah uh oh oh
A true Aquarius
Woah uh oh
I won't step on your toes

Love Songs are for losers, baby
And I have already lost
Love Songs are for dreamers, honey
And I may never wake up

And superstition it is poisonous stuff
But my patient heart will hold out for your touch
I'm very sorry if I lose my head
By playing it cool just to get in your bed

Woah uh oh oh
A true Aquarius
Woah uh oh
I won't step on your toes

Love Songs are for losers, baby
And I have already lost
Love Songs are for dreamers, honey
And I may never wake up
Woah uh oh oh oh oh oh
Love Songs are for losers
Woah uh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Love Songs are for losers

And I'm hopelessly dreaming
No eating, no sleeping
No writing no reading
Just endlessly feeling
Maybe you'll see, all the letters of love from me
Oh maybe, you'll see all the letters of love from me
You don't have to return my calls, I'm too nervous to call you at all
I'm a fool, but I play the fool every time
Like Adam and Eve, I'll take the fall cause for you it's fine
Because when i'm not lying to myself, I already know it's not anyone else
Thought if you found out I'd probably die
Too scared to take the risk in case you decline
"Just be yourself," my friends say and in front of you I try
But I end up being silent or even sexually violent
And that's only a small part of the whole pie but you'll never know
Cause I'm too shy
Instead I'd rather love you forever from the sideline
Rather sit it out on the bench than try
Then you'll never get a chance to say goodbye
I'll never give you the chance, to say goodbye and thats why

Love Songs are for losers, baby
And I have already lost
Oh Love Songs are for dreamers, honey
And I may never wake up
Woah uh oh oh oh oh oh
Love Songs are for losers
Woah uh oh oh oh oh oh
Love Songs are for losers
