Well it ain't no use to wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
Well it ain't no use to wonder why, babe
It will never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window, I'll be gone
'Cause you're the reason I'm travelin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

Don't think twice, it's all right

Well, It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
Well, It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To make me change my mind and stay

We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right
Oh no no don't think twice, it's all right

So long my honey baby
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Well goodbye's just too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well

I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
Well you could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right
Oh no, don't think twice, it's all right
Oh oh oh
