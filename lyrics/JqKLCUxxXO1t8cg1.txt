She was born in November
1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed that every man could be free
So her mama got high, high, high and her Daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs and he pictured all the places
Where he knew that she'd belong but he failed and taught her young
The only thing she'd need to carry on

He taught her how to
Run baby run baby run baby
Run baby run
So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run

Past the arms of the familiar and their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers slipping out before they say
So long baby loves to run

She counts out all her money in the taxi on the way to meet her plane
In stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting through the pouring rain
And she's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song
And she's think of all the places where she knows she still belongs
She smiles the secret smile and sure she knows exactly how to carry on

So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run
So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run

From their old familiar faces and their old familiar ways
To the comfort of the strangers and slipping out before they say
So long, and baby loves to run

And she's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song
And she pictures all the places where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile because she knows exactly how
To carry on

So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run
So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run

So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run
So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run

So run baby run baby
Run baby run baby run
So run baby run baby
Run baby
