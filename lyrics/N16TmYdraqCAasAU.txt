wiping my eyes of sleep
drinking yesterday morning's coffee
slam my head against the wall
put the same black jeans on
wear a hat so you can't see my hair

maybe I won't die this time
maybe I'll be fine this time
maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
maybe i'm not the person
that i never wanted to be
maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
i might not be as dark as i think

so here's the thing, i'm doing fine
i know that i'm not worth your time
you need a change, i'm still the same
took everything but my name

maybe i won't die this time
maybe i'll be fine this time
maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
maybe i'm not the person
that i never wanted to be
maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
i might not be as dark as i think

maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
maybe i'm not the person
that i never wanted to be
maybe i'm my own greatest fear
maybe i'm too scared to admit that
i might not be as dark as i think
i might not be as dark as i think
