Even when the sky is falling down
Even when the earth is crumbling around my feet
Even when we try say goodbye
You can cut the tension with a knife in here
Cause I know what will happen
If we get through this

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees then baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

I feel so damn lost
And it comes with a cost of being alone
Everything is falling down, were suffering
Helpless thoughts, and out we sing
Prayers go to the sky

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees then baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

And if we fall, it's not your fault
Shadows covering, our selfish foes

As our love can go out on a high note
Even when the sky is falling down,
even when the earth is crumbling around my feet
around my feet

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees then baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees then baby
we just gotta get out
we just gotta get out
