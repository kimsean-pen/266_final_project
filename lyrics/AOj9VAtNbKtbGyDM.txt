I was out stumbling in the rain staring at your lips so red
You said, "'Blah, blah, blah" you got a pillow stuck in your head"

She looked at me. Yes, I hear her.
When I see the glory, I ain't gotta worry

She said, "There's a halo on that truck, won't you please get it for me?"

She got mad. She said, "you're too steep."
She put on her boxing gloves and went to sleep â€“
When I see the glory
A I ain't got no worries
