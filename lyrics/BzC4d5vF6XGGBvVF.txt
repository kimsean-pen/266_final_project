I used to work for people, I made a couple hundred dollars
Wasn't worth it even, I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up bill collectors, "Leave my fuckin' family 'lone"
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon?

Young K.A., never quit your day job, uh
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the [censored], this hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up and make stuff, uh
These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talkin' shit, we bring that work right to your lap
I love my niggas like white people love rap
We make the shit you'll probably never say on track again

Walked through doors all my life
Just to close them
Tore down walls all my life
Here's to the other side

A whole new life (Feeling the brand new feeling)
(Feeling the brand new feeling)
A whole new life (Feeling the brand new feeling)
(Feeling the brand new feeling)
A whole new life (New feeling)
(Brand new feeling, brand new feeling)
A whole new life (New feeling)
(Brand new feeling, brand new)
(Brand new, brand new)

(A whole new life)
Back then when I was hustlin', ain't get no love from them (uh)
(A whole new life)
I paid my own bills and came up with the illest shit (uh)
(A whole new life)
I was tryna find a way to get my family out of it (uh)
(A whole new life)
Spent my days in basements tryna write a motherfuckin' hit
Nowadays he's stumblin', they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, we set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'

I don't do what they say, it's unorthodox
Like bears sharin' porridge inside with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no Sharon, he just called his parents
So fuck what I'm doin' and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Get my head rubbed by fingers of fuckin' hand models
Middle finger, fuck the hair up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear a hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five
Dropped out of Lone Star, booked flight from Lone Star
Was workin' a couple jobs and quit, became a star, uh
