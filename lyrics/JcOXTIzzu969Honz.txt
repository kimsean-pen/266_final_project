As soon as the doors slammed
And silence that fell
Was all that you left me
With a story to tell
But I'll take your hands and as chance
Then I'll smoke with you

I tried to find the truth
And I ain't there with you
I never listen,
I never listen
All the things you said
I'll never hear again
I should've listened

Don't say goodnight
Know your love didn't mean goodbye
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept going by
I should be loving you
I should be loving you

Your makeup on my sheets
Your clothes on the floor
The photos that I'll keep
How we were before
Before I took you for granted
Before the memories were torn

I tried to find the truth
And I ain't there with you
I never listen,
I never listen
All the things you said
I'll never hear again
I should've listened

Don't say goodnight
Know your love didn't mean goodbye
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept going by
I should be loving you
I should be loving you

It's time to confess, I'm doing my best
But this time I won't get it wrong
It's time to confess, I'm doing my best
But this time I won't lead you wrong

Don't say goodnight
Know your love didn't mean goodbye
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept going by
I should be loving you
I should be loving you
