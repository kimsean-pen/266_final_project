I want to take you with me
What's wrong, what's wrong with that?

You put yourself within me
What's wrong, what's wrong with that?

You tell me get it out now
What's wrong, what's wrong with that?
I've seen it through, I've seen enough

Please, let's waste no more time, please
Please, let's waste no more time, please

Don't tell me that it's alright
What's wrong, what's wrong with you?
I've seen it through, I've seen enough

Please, let's waste no more time, please
Please, let's waste no more time, please

Please, please, let's waste no more time
Please, please, let's waste no more time
