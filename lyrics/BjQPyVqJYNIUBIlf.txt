I'm your lie
I am your pretending
I'm the cause
Of your shame and anger

I'm your crime
Swept under the carpet
Your vanity
With all consequences

Living a distorted day
Distorted life
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?

Living in a fallen land
With fallen minds
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?
What have we done?

I'm your sloth
I am your aversion
Intolerance
I'm your private wasteland

Living a distorted day
Distorted life
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?

Living in a fallen land
With fallen minds
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?

Living in a fallen land
With fallen minds
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?
What have we done?
Where are we now?
Who have we become?

(Where are we now?)
(Where are we now?)
(Where are we now?)

We've been waiting for brighter days
How could we've known we were happy?

Dancing ghosts, singing ghosts
Where are we now?
Dancing ghosts, singing ghosts
