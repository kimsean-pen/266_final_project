Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Take a gun
Or how you say
That's no way, to behave

so now we meet again
To sing a song that doesn't sing
It grows
You know

Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last to get away to sing a song another day?
Or do we know
Well, we know
does it seem to be conveyed that way?

Are we, are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
If your the last living soul

Get up, get up, get up, get up

What you say?
Cause all I had sung
I got it down and wrong
I see myself to get
The Lord, seeing all now
Can you take us in
The part that comin' on
The coldest man doesn't see is all

and when you go to the car
I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me
Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
