Fly!

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick
Just like Hollywood, but laced in sick
The sun goes down, and so does she
The sun goes down, and so does she

Sold out the love that she had
Left with cut of the throat
Drinks all round on her
Before she strolls to the moat

The sun goes down, and so does she
The sun goes down, and so does she

Oh!
Christ!
Count your fucking blessings!
Come on!

Count your blessings, cause I'm counting every lie
Count your blessings, cause I'm counting every lie
Counting every lie
Christ, I'm asking you for just one thing
I'm asking you for just one thing
Eradicate, this disease

Close your eyes
Pray for plagues
Oh Lord cleanse this earth
And bring upon our doomsday, oh

Close your eyes
Pray for plagues
Cleanse this earth
Bring doomsday

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick
Just like Hollywood, but laced in sick
The sun goes down, and so does she
The sun goes down, and so does she

So clap your hands to the sound
Of every first born dying now
Watch the rivers flow with blood
Death will stand where life once stood

So clap your hands to the sound
Of every first born dying now
Watch the rivers turn to blood
Death will stand where life once stood

So clap your hands to the sound
Of every first born dying now
Watch the rivers turn to blood
Death will stand where life once stood

Close your eyes
Pray for plagues
Cleanse this earth
Bring our doomsday
