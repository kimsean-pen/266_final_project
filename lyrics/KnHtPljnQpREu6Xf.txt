In this spare room
We better see what we have and whom
An I.O.U. for the Same Thing
Only angels have wings
So they say

Here I stand, alive unto you

My fate's mercy seat
Sought blood to gulp and flesh to eat
And I can't blame you enough
But I'm indebted to your mercy and your love

Here I stand, alive unto you, alive unto you
Because you saved my life
Now I see there's so much to lose so much to lose
Because you saved my life
My life, you saved my life

Darling, now I must live for you
One reprieve grants another until each world is born anew

Here I stand, alive unto you, alive unto you
Because you saved my life
Now I see there's so much to lose, so much to lose
Because you saved my life

Here I stand, alive unto you, alive unto you
Because you saved my life
Now I see there's so much to lose, so much to lose
Because you saved my life

Never understand, never can ignore
I'm rotten to the core, since 1994
