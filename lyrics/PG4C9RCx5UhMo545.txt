Here come my tears
Like a dancer on a stage
I got nothing to fear
Just a hurricane of feeling
Baby, come here
Show me how to shake
I wanna move like the air
A pirouette of pain

Now, I must cry
Yes, I must cry
Yes, I must cry out loud

Why do I sing (like loe-la-loe-la-le)
That's why I sing
I'm a force in the wind (like loe-la-loe-la-he)
Can you hear me?
Why do we live (yeah)
We live so we might live a little bit
Why do we dig (yeah)
We dig so we might find it, can you dig it?

Now, I must cry
Yes, I must cry
Yes, I must cry out loud

(I must cry out loud)
(I must cry out loud)
