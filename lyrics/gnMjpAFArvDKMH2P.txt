And I can't sleep a wink these nights
You're still here with me
And I feel you pull me
Pulling me down

I can't escape from ya (oh)
I can still feel you claws in me (twistin 'round)
I can't explain what you did to me
And now I'm stuck here

Dreaming in my mind
Rubbing on my chest
You're all up in my brain
Baby, you are taking the best of me
Parts of me are gone
I'm about to break
'Cause I know this isn't how it should be

And I can't sleep a wink these nights
You're still here with me
And I feel you pull me
Pulling me down

I can't escape from ya (oh)
I can still feel your claws in me (twistin 'round)
I can't explain what you did to me
And now I'm stuck here

Dreaming in my mind
Rubbing on my chest
You're all up in my brain
Baby, you are taking the best of me
Parts of me are gone
I'm about to break
'Cause I know this isn't how it should be
