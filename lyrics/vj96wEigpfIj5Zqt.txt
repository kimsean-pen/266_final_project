I know you plan out
Everything that you hope to say
I wish that we didn't
Have to go about things this way
I love the rock and roll, I love the rock and roll

Don't get so uptight
Don't get so uptight

Go...
Go away...

Tell me if you love me like
You think you want to be loved
Pull on my hand and say
'Please just let's make it this way'
I love the rock and roll, I love the rock and roll

Don't get so uptight
Don't get so uptight

Go...
Go away...
Go...
Go away...
