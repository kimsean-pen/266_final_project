Look for the girl
This world is surreal
She's not alone in her mind
When I'm with her
I feel I can fly
Lost in her words and her smile

Oh, and when I'm in need
She's right by my side
Oh, I'm down on my knees
She's working the over time

She's so purple haze
You know what I mean
I'm counting the days 'til she's mine
When I'm with her
I feel I'm alive
I'm lost in her world and her smile

Oh, and when I'm in need
She's right by my side
Oh, I'm down on my knees
She's working the over time

Come and hold me
I want to show me
Gonna slowly
Blow your mind

Come and hold me
I want to show me
Gonna slowly
Blow your mind

Come and hold me
I want to show me
Gonna slowly
Blow your mind

She
She
