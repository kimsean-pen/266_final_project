It's a hard world
To get a break in
All the good things
Have been taken

But girl there are ways to make
Certain things pay
Though I'm
Dressed in these rags I'll wear sable

Some day
Hear what I say,
I'm gonna ride that serpent
No more time spent
Sweatin' rent
Hear my command,

I'm breakin' loose,
And ain't no use
Holdin' me down,
Stick around

But baby
Baby
Remember
Remember

It's my life
And I'll do what I want
It's my mind
And I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong,

Hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women
And their fortunes
Who just want to
Mother orphans
Are you gonna cry
While I'm squeezin' them dry?
Takin' all I can get,
No regrets,
When I
Openly lie
And live on their money,
Believe me honey
That money
Can you believe
I ain't no saint?
No complaints,
So girl throw out
Any doubt
And baby,
Baby
Remember
Remember
It's my life
And I'll do what I want
It's my mind
And I'll think what I want
You show me I'm wrong,
Hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

It's my life
And I'll do what I want
Don't push it
It's my mind
And I'll think what I want
It's my life
It's my life
And I do what I want
Can't get do what I want
It's my mind
And I'll think what I want
You can't tell me
It's my life
And I'll do what I want
It's my mind
