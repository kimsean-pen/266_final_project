Turn this bitch into Virginia Tech, aye
Got the chopper just to make 'em wet, aye
Dynamite around my vest, aye
We them G59 terrorists, aye
Keep throwing threats and I'll keep yawning
Light my cigarette, you just keep on talking
Watch where you tread, please watch where you walking
I'm from Vietnam, better known as New Orleans
The smell of death is so, so familiar
I'm that silhouette, that all black figure
Grave digger, grey killer, Lil Cut Throat
Drag 'em to the river, watch his fucking body float

Two empty pill bottles, I'm fucking ducking
I can't call my plug no more, oh no, but I'll probably say fuck it
Oh, how I love it, really, it ain't for discussion
But the truth ain't that far from it, I keep on bugging
Like fuck it, I'ma say it
Like fuck it, I'ma fuck up
Like fuck it, I'm a "fuck up" and it's fucked up
It's just my dumb luck, it's just my dumb luck
You'll never put me down more than I have
You'd have been down and it's more than I have
Fake fucking smile with the knife in my back
Fake fucking child, bitch, that's just how you act
