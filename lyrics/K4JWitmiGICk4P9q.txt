Frozen fingertips all stiff and tired
Trucks scream by and my eyes stay wired
Shaking vibrations from the howling wind
Whispering everything will eventually cave in

Self pity for being in a pile
The lonely clown in exile
Got my doctor on speed dial
He's put me under the suicidal file
There's a better way than being this fragile
And I know I'll be waiting for awhile
I'm sure I'll be watching this hour glass
Slowing down over every bump in my path

I think I might just stay outside tonight
Sit on the couch stare out til I lose my sight
Wander bout the miner felons locked up in juvenile camps
Sedated til they become more of a sensible man
Passing swiftly with a frequent dash
You can imagine the fast crash
Not a second more to elaborate
They're all bound to jailbait

Self pity for being in a pile
The lonely clown in exile
Got my doctor on speed dial
He's put me under the suicidal file
There's a better way than being this fragile
And I know I'll be waiting for awhile
I'm sure I'll be watching this hour glass
Slowing down over every bump in my path

Yes I am the loneliest lonely clown, I'm renown for being down
Somehow I'm a magnet for this roundabout
