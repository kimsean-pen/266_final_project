Jesus is just a Spanish boy's name
How come one man got so much fame?
To enemy, it's pointless to anybody
That doesn't have faith
Give me the cloth and I'll wipe my face

When it's all gone
Something carries on
And it's not morbid at all
Just that nature's had enough of you

When my blood stops
Someone else's will thaw
When my head rolls off
Someone else's will turn
And while I'm alive, I'll make tiny changes to earth

So you can burn me
'Cause we'll all be the same, the same way
Dirt in someone's eyes cried down the drain
I believe in a house in the clouds
And God's got his dead friends 'round
He's painted all the walls red
To remind them they're all dead

And you know when it's all gone

Something carries on
And it's not morbid at all
Just that nature's had enough of you

When my blood stops
Someone else's will thaw
When my head rolls off
Someone else's will turn
You can mark my words, I'll make tiny changes to earth

While I'm alive, I'll make tiny changes to earth
Tiny changes to earth
Tiny changes to earth
