Your mind tells you that you've lost your confidence
You're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone
To lose what little you have left to be proud of
Afraid you can't do this again, ah!

You said that nothing come in-between us
And the way of getting things we wanted done
Then enissophobia held you under its influence
Until you compromised your style

Everything about you has been one big charade
What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry?
To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not

When you forced me into doing what you love
Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em'
And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me
I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm!

Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know
Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby
To choke out the voice that told ya "money and the fame"
Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself

Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget
You didn't ever make Metal, buddy; Metal made you
To crush and run over everyone along the way
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not

A stranger to yourself, ha! Ya pissed me off again
I won't be driven by your needs anymore
What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me
It's something that you are; something that I'm not

It makes me sick to hear you say you "love me"
I know you only love what I can do for you
If you were the one that was leading the charge
Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible!

We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become
Now your pain slowly paid back has begun
So, accept my resignation, or in your words "betrayal"
Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage

Something that I'm not
Something that you are
Something I'm not

Something that I'm not
Something that you are
Something I'm not
Something that you are
Something I'm not, yet
