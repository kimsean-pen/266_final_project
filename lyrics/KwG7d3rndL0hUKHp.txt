The day that I've met you, I started dreaming
Now I'm writing down if I remember,
in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston,
but I like the sound it makes
When it starts to pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out, and I miss you right about now
Oh, uhmm uhmm

Baby, tell me where you wanna go
Baby, tell me what you wanna know
Give you everything I have and more

He said, Baby
(that's what he called me)
I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It's the thought of you that's likely scares me
but it takes my breath away,
forget what I was gonna say
The day that I've met you, I started dreaming
Now I'm writing down if I remember,
in the morning time
Uhmm, uhmm

Baby, tell me where you wanna go
Baby, tell me what you wanna know
Give you everything I have and more
