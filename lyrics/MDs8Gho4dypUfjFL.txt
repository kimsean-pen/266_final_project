I can't forget it, though I've tried
I know you regret it, love
you told me so many times.
But I still wonder

why...
You left with her
and left me behind
Take your hands off him

'cause he's the only one that I
have ever loved
And please don't find her skin
When you turn the lights out

I can't erase it
from my mind
I just replay it, love
Think of it all the time.

But I don't want to imagine
words you spoke to her that night.
Naked bodies look like porcelain
You both knew I'd be bleeding inside...

Ooh x2 Ah x5
Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh, nights of loveless love, I hope it made you feel good
knowing how much I adored you
Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
On nights so loveless, love, I hope it made you feel good
Knowing how much I adored you
You're making me sick, love...
