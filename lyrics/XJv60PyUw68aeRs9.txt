If I know, what I know, then no one will watch over you
So someone shouldn't really tell me what I want to know
I know, I owe, and I know that matters don't matter as much
As you think they do

'Cause you will only be yourself, you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself when you understand what you know, oh

How long will we go on with a modern way of letting go?
Tell me how long will we go on with the modern way of letting you go?

If I know, what I know, losing isn't learning to be lost
It's learning to know when you're lost
If I know, what I know
I'll want to make the most of what it seems like

You will only be yourself, you can never be yourself
And you will only be yourself when you understand what you know, oh

How long will we go on with a modern way of letting go?
Tell me how long will we go on with the modern way of letting you go?
