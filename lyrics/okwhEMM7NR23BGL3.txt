everything is out of focus
autofocus has brought a new disease
how can i focus full of
distraction and insecurity
we run through the grass
if i fall would you take me or just leave

throw your potential
throw it all in the bin
how can you work in
a world full of inactivity
we lie beneath an oak and
when i close my eyes i still see a screen

everything is out of focus
autofocus has ruined quality
we run through the rain
and this mess is like the blurry life of me
