Relieve the ache
This endless craving for unattainable matters like
Love...
A heartfelt smile
Relighting of the fire that once burned
... Or just simple meaning

Could I dull it all by removing feeling?
What would it be like?
And would the price be too high?
A life for peace...
Tears for still waters

Oh sweet release come hither
Drowning in desire for things that can not be
So then, feed me morphia
I let go of all
Anything but the yearning that stings so relentless

Better the dead numbness than whatever beauty melancholy
May host
Still it is with fear I lay down my swords
