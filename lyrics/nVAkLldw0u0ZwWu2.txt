song by YUCK

You will understand everything that you need
You will comprehend everything, don't you see
How honest and true
How honest and true

You don't even know WHO I AM
Oh, but I am
You don't even know WHERE I
Where do I stop
You don't even know WHO I AM
Oh, but I am
You don't even know WHERE I
Where do I
Where do I

You've been sending me messages for so long
You don't understand, maybe you could be wrong
I won't forget you
I won't forget you

You don't even know WHO I AM
Oh, but I am
You don't even know WHERE I
Where do I stop
You don't even know WHO I AM
Oh, but I am
You don't even know WHERE I
Where do I
Where do I

Where do I

You will understand everything that you need
You will comprehend everything, don't you see
How honest and true
How honest and true
