There's lots of smoke around
The sound of woman, she's, I feel
So scared I just can't stand it,
I feel like crying

You can't go far away,
Sometimes it's hard to believe it
For real you're just the one I need,
I want to hear you,
And when you scream in my ear
I know that you've come back to me dear

Turn it up, Turn it up
I hear your voice scream
Turn it up, turn it up
I hear it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning me on
My love, my love, my love

Your face is in my dreams
The walls are made of steel
I feel so cold, the moon is full tonight
I feel like howling

Vibrations in my room
No matter where you are
Tonight I want to be with you
I want to hear you

And when you scream in my ear
I know that you've come, yeah!

Turn it up, Turn it up
I hear your voice scream
Turn it up, turn it up
I hear it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning me on
My love, my love, my love

There's lots of smoke around
The sound of woman, she's, I feel
So scared I just can't stand it,
I feel like crying
And when you scream in my ear
I know that you've come back to me dear

Turn it up, Turn it up
I hear your voice scream
Turn it up, turn it up
I hear it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning me on
My love
Turn it up, Turn it up
I hear your voice scream
Turn it up, turn it up
I hear it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning me on
My love
Turn it up, Turn it up
I hear your voice scream
Turn it up, turn it up
I hear it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning me on
