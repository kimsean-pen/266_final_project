His after moan though cries, oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here, in time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain

But he sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over

She said, uh "What would your mother think of all this, and how would your father
react?
Oh, would he take it all back what they've done?"
No way, they said "Take it, take it" and he said "Make it with your own two hands"
That was my old man and he said

"If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it"
Oh, what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
Oh, recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
And time to compromise our lives just a little while
And it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons

But time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight
And we sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over

Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over
and over and over and over again
And as time goes by we get a little bit tired of waking and baked another Marlboro
mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath over outside, still they're reading between the lines
But they remember the part in the Hallmark card where they read about the dreams
And the reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
Say they knew it was time, time to take, take love
Time to take a chance here

Time to compromise to occupy their lives
And it was time for all the wrong reasons, oh

But time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy
Sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over and
over
She said "What, oh what did your mother think of all this and how would your father
react?" Oh lord
"Would he take it all back what they've done?"
No way, they said "Take it, take it, take it" He said "Make it, don't break it with
your own two hands"
See that was my old man and he said
"If all, all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it"
Love go make a mountain, go on and on and on and on
But you should go on make a mountain out of it
And hey love go on and go on and go on and
Go on and make a mountain, go on and make a mountain
Go on oh you should go on and make a mountain out of it
