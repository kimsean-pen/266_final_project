One, two, three

Fish fell out of water
Birds stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go, ah
Trouble's on the outside, I know

But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two

Go
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

Everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing left that's true
