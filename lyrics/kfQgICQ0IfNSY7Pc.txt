Enough...
With the light...
Tell me one...
More time...
My blood...
Your line...

Is this you, inside?

Death.
To the living...
The flame has no living heart.

In the order, of life, they know you there...
As you saw it, your plan, a real shot in the dark...

Came a little, too late...
It's over!

Calling, the children...
Conception, and dying...
Silent, but screaming!

Damage done to the flesh, what they said, in the name of the...
Damage done to the heart, is the start, of the end!
Damage done to my soul, I know, it knows where my...
Damage done to my life, cursing loud, at the chaos!

You're here, you're gone...
It's not fair, I'm lost...
Your god, your fear...
Was it worth...
The price?

Pray, for the children!
You lost along the way.
Still remember, the names, and faces...
Cold. And abandoned.
They cry, their fate put in your hands.

When it's over, they come to haunt you...

Wasted... Confusion...
Deadly... Illusion...
Nightmare... Intrusion!

One more soul to the call, for all, in silence...
Comes two more souls to the call, for all, and in time!
Three more souls to the call, they fall...
Unknowing that four more souls to the call, won't be all, and you know it!

Sacrifice...
Wasted life...
Destiny, redefined...
Someone, chooses you...
Lucky one, close your eyes, your family knows you're here!

Calling, the children...
Conception, and dying...
Silent, but screaming!

Damage done to the flesh, what they said, in the name of the...
Damage done to the heart, is the start, of the end!
Damage done to my soul, I know, it knows where my...
Damage done to my life, cursing loud, at the chaos!

One more soul to the call, for all, in silence...
Comes two more souls to the call, for all, and in time!
Three more souls to the call, they fall...
Unknowing that four more souls to the call, won't be all, and you know it!
