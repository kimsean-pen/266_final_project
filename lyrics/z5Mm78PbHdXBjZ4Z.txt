And in the end
When the bell comes doom
I'll pay the price
And you will too
You'll drift away
All alone in your room
And I'll say to myself
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would

You're too far gone
To know where it goes
And I know you're not coming home
Done too much wrong to know what's right
And it's too late to say goodbye

Oh turn around kid
You're a little bit old for this
So many lessons left unlearned
All those warning signs you missed
You drink yourself to sleep
Beneath the pale red moon
And I'll say to myself
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would

You're too far gone
To know where it goes
And I know you're not coming home
Done too much wrong to know what's right
And it's too late to say goodbye
(To say goodbye, to say goodbye)
It's too late to say goodbye
(It's too late to say goodbye)

If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you I would
If I could reach you

You've done too much wrong
To know what's right
And it's too late to say goodbye
(If I could reach you I would)
(If I could reach you I would)
(If I could reach you I would)
It's too late to say goodbye
