I was raised on distractions
Out of sync with the rest of humanity
I really tried to blend in
Pretending I was part of the scenery

It made me seem more human
In a world less gruesome
It made me pass for normal
Among the high and neutral

On the best of days I'm a loaded gun
On the worst of days I'm a burned out candle
And the wind keeps blowing down my house
Changing direction north to south

I always spoke my mind
Like a rhinoceros charging into walls
And when I courted you
I never said the words at all

Maybe it came out wrong
I don't know where it came from
The truth can hurt sometimes
Like the greatest lies

On the best of days I'm a loaded gun
On the worst of days I'm a burned out candle
And the wind keeps blowing down my house
Changing direction north to south
