I'm feeling all messed up
I have a voice inside my head it says
Turn to the left then it says turn to the right
Don't want to bring you down
But I am really needing guidance now
What would you do within my shoes

(Don't cry)
I'm going crazy
(Stay high)
I've never felt so low
(Don't hide)
I want to turn and run
We've got to find a place to go

So when you're feeling kind of mixed up
Just remember it's a mixed up world
And when you're feeing life is just too tough
Just remember you're a real tough girl

I look around my life
And all I see is contradiction and a lack of faith
Cynicism rules the day I know it has its place
But I am really needing guidance now
Reminding me I'm strong inside

(Don't cry)
I know you love me
(Stay high)
And we'll make it through this time
(Don't hide)
I want to feel the sun
We've got to start to take control

(Why)
Do I feel this pain
(Why)
Has this world gone insane
