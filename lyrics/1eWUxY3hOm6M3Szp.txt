I am lost in the world of lights
Mesmerize my nights
The sky scrapes on building sites
I'm feelin' so alive
Whatever's clever
Whatever's clever will have to wait

Thinking on the world at large
The city's got it all
Culture clash and sidewalk trash
Don't look down you might fall

And now we just feel like energy!
New York city will never sleep!
And now we just feel like synergy!
New York city, it's the place to be!

I'm gonna win, I'm gonna lose
I'm gonna chase it till the end
And if you're walkin' in my shoes
You're gonna make it or pretend

Whatever's clever
Whatever's clever will have to wait

And now we just feel like energy!
New York city will never sleep!
And now we just feel like synergy!
New York city, it's the place to be!

And now we just feel like energy!
New York city will never sleep!
And now we just feel like synergy!
New York city, it's the place to be!

And now we just feel like energy!
New York city will never sleep!
And now we just feel like synergy!
New York city, it's the place to be!

And now we just feel like energy!
New York city will never sleep!
And now we just feel like synergy!
New York city, it's the place to be!

New York City
And now we just feel like energy!
Oh yeah
New York city will never sleep!
It's the place to be
And now we just feel like synergy!
Oh yeah
New York city, it's the place to be!
It's the place to be.
