Pristine
Untraced by the world outside you
Anyways
I'll never get real
And you'll never change to me 'cause I'm not looking
Anyways

[Verse 2]
Same night
Same humility for those that love you
Anyways, anyways
And if you do find someone better
I'll still see you in everything
Tomorrow and all the time

Don't you like me for me?
Is there any better feeling than coming clean?
And I know myself and I'll never love anyone else
I won't love anyone else
I'll never love anyone else

It just feels like
The same party every weekend
Doesn't it? Doesn't it?
And if you do find someone better
I'll still see you in everything
For always, tomorrow and all the time

Don't you like me for me?
Is there any better feeling than coming clean?
And I know myself and I'll never love anyone else
I won't love anyone else
I'll never love anyone else

If it's not supposed to be
Then I'll just let it be
And out of everyone
Be honest with me
Who do you change for?
Who's top of your world?
And out of everyone
Who's your type of girl?

We can be anything
Even apart
Out of everything
It doesn't have to be this hard
I could be anyone
But I'm so entwined
And out of everyone
Who's on your mind?
No more changes
I'll still love you the same
