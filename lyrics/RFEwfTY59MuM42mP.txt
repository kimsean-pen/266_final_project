Girlfriend tell me what you did,
I don't have the time to worry who you kissed
I been spending my whole day
In a phased out haze
You say we feel outta touch,
but gimme some more time I'm back within a month
I know you don't like to wait,
But this love is not a race
So take that watch that's on your wrist,
Hide it in a drawer and don't let it exist
I will shine within your shade

Until you feel awake
It's no road that I'd run without a curve
So baby would you come in close at the turn
And let a different love song pass your lips

Or we might suffer shipwreck
With the ship

Without love
You're just a stupefied dove
Let me linger in your dreams,
There's all the other guys but I'm the one you need
Baby you stay in my thoughts,
But is that enough?

All the songs that i could sing, to show you that I feel this - would they change a thing?
No matter which way this wind blows
You know I'm coming home
It's no road that I'd run without a curve

So baby would you come in close at the turn
And let a different love song pass your lips
Or we might suffer shipwreck with the ship
Without love
You're just a stupefied dove
Without love
You're just a stupefied dove
Without love
You're just a stupefied dove
