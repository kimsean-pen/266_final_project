Now I Can Tell You About Success
About Fame
About The Rise And The Fall
Of All The Stars In The Sky
Don't It Make You Smile

Now I Can Tell You About The Place I Belong
You Know It Won't Last Long

And All Those Lights They Will Turn Down
Let It Will Be
Oh Let It Be
Got To Let It Be

Won't You Let It Be
Now I Can See Things For What, They Really Are

You Know I'm Not That Far
I'm At The Point Of No Return
Just Watch Me Burn
Oh Let It Be

Got to You Let It Be
Won't You Let It Be
Won't You Let It Be

Got To Let It Be

Anyone Can See
Let It Will Be
Just Watch Me Burn

Now I Can See Things For What They, Really Are
You Know I'm Not That Far
I'm At The Point Of No Return
(No Return, No Return)

Just Watch Me Burn
You Got To Let It Be
Won't You Let It Be
You Got To Let It Be
Won't You Let It Be
You Got To Let It Be
Anyone Can See
Let It Will
Be
