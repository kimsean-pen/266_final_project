I never knew you were standing on this shore
It says everything, explains everything
And then from then on it couldn't be just like before
It says everything, changes everything

So don't just stand there
Wishing life would fade away
Don't you go around with anyone
That makes you feel ashamed

Goodbye paradise
I hope that someday you could try
Goodbye, you're so changed that you'd give it all away
Goodbye, goodbye

Saw your face in a faded light
Said everything, explained everything
In home saw you dazed and it comes to you and I
You did everything, blamed anything

But don't you cut those ribbons
To take away the pain
Don't you go around with that same old crowd
That makes you feel ashamed

Goodbye paradise
I hope there's something you could try
Goodbye but you're so changed that you give it all away
Goodbye, goodbye paradise

The sea, the majestic sea
Breaks everything, crushes everything
Cleans everything, takes everything from me
