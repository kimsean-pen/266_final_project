She wants to be up there
in the air where the clouds live
the sweetest seeds make the best trees
30,000 feet she can smile and now
she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
she wants to hit the clouds
honey up there now
she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?

Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there

Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there

She wants to introduce me
to her friend Daddy
What is she tryin' to do to me?
He got words the rhyme
He got a dirty mind
Persuade yourself
what am I bout to do right now?

And now she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
she wants to hit the clouds
honey up there now
she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?

Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there

Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there

Bounce, bounce, bounce...
Bounce, bounce, bounce...

And now she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
she wants to hit the clouds
honey up there now
she puts the shot glass down
she ask for another round
girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kickin' in?

Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Can you feel it Kickin' in
Honey are you up there

Can you feel it Kickin' in
