Ayy

Don't kiss in front of me, it makes me sick
I'm not bitter, well, maybe a little bit
I'd sniff glitter if it'd help me feel something real
And if it was my birthday, I'd make a wish
To not be bitter 'cause I'm getting sick of this
I'd skip dinner if it'd help me feel something real

And sometimes I think I kill relationships for art
I start up all this shit to watch 'em fall apart
I pay my bills with it, I watch 'em fall apart
Then pay the price for it, I watch 'em fall apart, but...

Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, yeah

I'm sending out texts at 4 a.m
I'm not desperate, I just want somebody's skin
In my denim, 'cause it helps me feel something (Oh, oh)

And sometimes I think I kill relationships for art
I start up all this shit to watch 'em fall apart
I pay my bills with it, I watch 'em fall apart
Then pay the price for it, I watch 'em fall apart, but...

Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy

And sometimes I think I kill relationships for art
I start up all this shit to watch 'em fall apart
I pay my bills with it, I watch 'em fall apart
Then pay the price for it, I watch 'em fall apart...

Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I just wanna be fucking happy, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh (I just wanna be ha...)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy
I just wanna be happy (Uh)
I just wanna be happy (Uh)
I just wanna be...
