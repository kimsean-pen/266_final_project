Walking on air, living in the
Stratosphere
Still there's something wrong up here
Living without you
I don't have a care running round the stratosphere
But it's awfully lonely here
Running without you
Sitting high on top the world
was all I ever wanted
But now I see it wasn't worth
the casualty I suffered in this dark sky
I never meant to have to
Start all over
Start all over without you
Drifting out alone, lying in the
Stratosphere
Wishing I was anywhere else
Lying next to you
There's nothing in this galaxy
Holding my attention
The sun has lost it's gravity
and severed my connection to the starlight
I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you, without you
I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you
I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you
I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you
I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you
