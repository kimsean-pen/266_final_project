Does this not take
Got any paper
chasses et damer
Give you ladies exercise
its stolen light
no one betrayed you
but sleeping without a key
only fox can wake your world

Does this not take
If I could old school
leave it on the line
Give you ladies exercise
its stolen light
no one betrayed you
but sleeping without a key
only fox can wake your world

So sad this wont kill you
Tonight I sleep in the car
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog
So sad this wont kill you
Tonight I sleep in the car
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog

Does this not take
Got any paper
chasses et damer
Give you ladies exercise
its stolen light
ok, I betrayed you
but sleeping without a key
only fox can wake your world

So sad this wont kill you
Tonight I sleep in the car
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog
So sad, so sad
Tonight I sleep in the car
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog
I release you
I'm a girl
when it's cold out I'm a Dog
