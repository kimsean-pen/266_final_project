I have a long list of tepid disappointments
it doesn't mention you
And if I'm honest your name could be upon it
if this didn't feel so good

In an otherwise disappointing life made right
On an otherwise disappointing night, there's a fire
I don't need water I just want to wave goodbye, goodbye
to an otherwise disappointing life

I took a pain pill to scrape a hole we could both get lost in
and cover love's bruise
So lay upon me and push until it's all forgotten
There are worse ways to lose you

In an otherwise disppointing life made right
On an otherwise disappointing night, there's a fire
I don't need water I just want to wave goodbye
and bring this otherwise disappointing life back to life

I have a long list of tepid disappointments
and you should burn that too

In an otherwise disappointing life, you made right
On an otherwise disappointing night, there is a fire
that sings this otherwise disappointing life back to life
