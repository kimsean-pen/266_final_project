What do you think they would say
If I stood up, and I walked away
Nobody here really understands me
And so I wave goodbye, I'm fine
I'm fine...

Tones of home
Said you don't like the way I'm living
You don't like me
Tones of home, tones of home
And so I wave goodbye
I'm flyin', I'm flyin' home

And I always thought this would be
See the land of milk and honey
Oh but I come to find out that it's all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holding me down

Tones of home
Said you don't like the way I'm living
You don't like me
Tones of home, tones of home
And so I wave goodbye
I'm flyin', I'm flyin' home

See I'm so high to you, so I'll fade away
I said you're on your own

Your mom and daddy said
That you sister said
And you brother's saying everybody
Is saying everybody
Is saying I, eye, god I gotta go!

All my friends patronize me
They say yo hey boy! Have you found what you're looking for?
It seems they don't really know me
Cause it's here, and it's what they can't see...

Tones of home
Said you don't like the way I'm living
You don't like me
Tones of home, tones of home
And so I wave goodbye
I'm flyin', I'm flyin' home
