You can't kill me
I am living inside you
I am a part
Of your existence
Twisted thoughts
In a twisted mind
Provoking you

Black is my heart
Dark is my soul
My hatred I can not control
Evil seed growing stronger
Your freewill
Dying!
Dying!

Inside you
Heart of darkness
A part of you
Heart of darkness

To deny me, is
To deny yourself
The illusion is dissolved
You are no longer in control
The fa√ßade crumbles
The transition is incomplete
The transition is incomplete

Inside you
Heart of darkness
A part of you
Heart of darkness

I come to you in the night
I am your dark sub-conscience
I keep you awake, knowing
I am the heart, of darkness

-Solos-

Inside you
Heart of darkness
A part of you
Heart of darkness
I come to you in the night
I am your dark sub-conscience
I keep you awake, knowing
I am the heart, heart of darkness
