Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay

There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down

You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

You can't believe all the things
I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying
I've lived on the edge of a knife

Well, I'm playing with fire
and I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true
So I think that it's time for a turn

Before I burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

Take a good look in your heart
Tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark
Now is that how you want it to be?

It's up to you
What you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now
For tomorrow may be far too late

And then you'll burn in hell
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
(Oh, burn in hell)
Lay no evil down on me

You're gonna burn in hell
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
(Oh, burn in hell)
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free

Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Lay no evil down on me
(You're gonna burn in hell)

Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
(You're gonna burn in hell)

Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Lay no evil down on me
(You're gonna burn in hell)

Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
(You're gonna burn in hell)
Hear no evil, don't you see no evil
(Oh, burn in hell)
Don't you lay no evil down on me
(You're gonna burn in hell)
Speak no evil, don't you think no evil
(Oh, burn in hell)
Don't you play with evil, 'cause I'm free
(You're gonna burn in hell)
Hear no evil, don't you see no evil
(Oh, burn in hell)
Don't you lay no evil down on me
