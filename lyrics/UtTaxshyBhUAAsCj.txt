It's hard to think it over when you're trapped
Beneath the mud
All the kids are ravers 'cause the church
Is now the club
Lose yourself in something just escape
Your body's flaws
Baby you don't have to be you anymore

And there's nothing in the devil
Nothing in the sin
There's nothing in a hero
Nothing from within
There's nothing in the devil
Nothing in the sin
There's nothing in a hero
Nothing from within

But I found you
And you found me
And we're happy being nobody
I found you
And you found me
And we're happy being nobody

We'll never see the colour if we live
In black and white
Guided by the blinkers that
We wear instead of pride
Guilty of pretending and you know
I'm one to blame
Would it not be wrong if we were all the same

And there's nothing in the devil
Nothing in the sin
There's nothing in a hero
Nothing from within
There's nothing in the devil
Nothing in the sin
There's nothing in a hero
Nothing from within

But I found you
And you found me
And we're happy being nobody
I found you
And you found me
And we're happy being nobody
