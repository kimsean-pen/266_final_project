No regrets if just a few
Somehow they're entwined with you
No regrets I'm glad it's through and you
Left my mind

Rainy Sundays, kid's TV
Fish and chips in NYC
You said we were meant to be
To be

Those super bossanova nights
Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last
For all eternity

No regrets, no memories
Just forget those heart felt pleas
No regrets, no baby
Not for me

Those super bossanova nights
Slow dancing by the sea
So sure the cocktail hour would last
For all eternity

No regrets, no memories
Just forget those heart felt pleas
No regrets, no baby
Not for me

Not for me
Not for me
