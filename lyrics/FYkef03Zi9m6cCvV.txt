As I'm gettin' older, chip up on my shoulder
Rollin' through life, you roll over and die

La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
Oh

Missin' Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Rememberin' things just to tell 'em so long

La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
Oh

Oh, mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh, dear
Act your age and try another year

Always feelin' tired, smilin' when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
Oh

Salad days are gone, missin' hippy Jon
Remembering days just to tell 'em so long

La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
La-li-la-lala
Oh

Oh, mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh, dear
Act your age and try another year

Oh, mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh, dear
Act your age and try another year
