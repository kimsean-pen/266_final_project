Yeah it's easier to come back
But it's harder to let go
I can tell by the nights and the blur in my eyes
And the tears on my pillow
So I guess this is goodbye
Fall out like a petal
No more Sun in the sky, no more life 'til we cry
No more kissin' your freckles

When love is gone and truth is where we hide
It's all we know, it's all we know
When love is gone, know it'll be alright
Just hold on, it's all we know

When love is gone, gone
When love is gone, gone
When love is gone

There's a break in the silence
Tell me, did you get the message?
I keep wonderin' why, tell my mind to remind me
That life is a lesson
Maybe I was all wrong
I'm slowly confessin'
All my friends tell me I will be better in time, but

Love is gone and truth is where we hide
It's all we know, it's all we know
When love is gone, know it'll be alright
Just hold on, it's all we know

When love is gone, gone
When love is gone, gone
When love is gone

In the city, wasted, tryna paint the sky
Tryna bring back the colors to these faded lights
You can call me crazy, you can call me blind
But I'm not wastin'... time

When love is gone and truth is where we hide
It's all we know, it's all we know
When love is gone, know it'll be alright
It's all we know, so just hold on

When love is gone, gone
When love is gone, gone
When love is gone
