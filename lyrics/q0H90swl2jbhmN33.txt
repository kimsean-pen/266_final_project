So after all that we have done
Are you feeling cold
Like the winter sun
And have you thought of all the words
We left unsaid
Don't be scared
You shouldn't be

Hearts at war
Drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost now
Let them bleed
Just let them

Run away as far as you can
And hide behind all the promises
But I'll find you
Cause you're a fire
And I'm the rain
Don't be afraid

Hearts at war
Drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost now
Let them bleed
Hearts at war
Think of love
There's no escaping
What we have brought upon ourselves again

Hearts at war
Drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost now
Let them bleed
Hearts at war
For think of love
And there's no escaping
What we have brought upon ourselves again

There is no way I'm waiting
We've brought this upon ourselves again
