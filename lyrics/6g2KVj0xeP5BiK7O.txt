Endless run, endless pain
Thousands of words, beating my brain
Thousands of lips, try to explain
But never found the answer

Pushed around, edge to edge
Never felt safe, never felt home
Different system, another parole
Decision demanded, what do i do

Take that stone and replace my body
Take that stone and replace my soul
Take that stone and replace my heart
Take that stone and replace it all

I'm lost, born on the dark side
My life, a tunnel of pain

Take that stone and replace my body
Take that stone and replace my soul

Burned out, head down
Still on search, cry'n out
Take me away, far away
Take me away, away from it all
