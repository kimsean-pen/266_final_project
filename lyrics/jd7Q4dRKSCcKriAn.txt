Today's my graduation
I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw!
Today's my graduation
So long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway!

"These are the best days of our lives!"
That's what the grownups told us right?
Tapping my pencil waiting for the bell
Thinking what to say in my last farewell
Hey teacher! Leave those kids alone!
Saigo no chaimu ga natteru yo!
And everyone's happy but ikitakunai
What shall I do now the world is mine?

Today's my graduation
I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw! (But I'm not going)
Today's my graduation
So long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway!

(Full japanese verse)
Say: "Sensei minna sayonara!"
Sensei minna sayonara!
Sensei minna sayonara!
Mimi no naka de sotsugyou!

Today's my graduation
I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw!
I'd like to thank my pets,
My friends, my family
I didn't learn a thing anyway!

Whatchu wanna be?
There's so much you can do with a degree!
Now I can apply for a Ph.D
Get a nice job with a high salary!
Chasing after hyakuten nante
Zenbu (Japanese)

Today's my graduation
So long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway!

But I'm not going
But I'm not going
But I'm not going
But I'm not going today!
