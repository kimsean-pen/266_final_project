Let's hide out
Just you and me
No more subtleties

I know now
I'll never leave
I'm fast asleep

I try to play it cool
Late nights getting through
Waiting up for you

I'm falling at your feet
Lost in apathy
Still you wait for me
(Hmm)

Slow light
Within my lungs
I'm overcome

We collide
And come undone
I lost someone

I try to play it cool
Late nights getting through
Waiting up for you

I'm falling at your feet
Lost in apathy
Still you wait for me

I try to play it cool
Late nights getting through
Waiting up for you

I'm falling at your feet
Lost in apathy
Still you wait for me

I try to play it cool
Late nights getting through
Waiting up for you

I'm falling at your feet
Lost in apathy
Still you wait for me
(Hmm)
