I dedicate this song to recession
depression and unemployment.
This song's for you.

Today's a new day, and there is no sunshine.
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
and it feels like a cold night.
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies
where is the love and the joy that you promised me
you tell me it's alright.

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
fell from heaven like a shower.
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)

I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile.
it's so hard to look up when you look down.
I sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile.
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine.

Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
and it feels like a cold night.
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies
where is the love and the joy that you promised me
you tell me it's alright.
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain

fell from heaven like a shower.
I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile

Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile.
it's so hard to look up when you look down.
Sure would hate to see you give up now.
You look so much better when you smile.
Smile. for me
Can you just smile... for me.
Smile. for me

Can you just smile... for me.
Ohohoh you look so much better when you

ohohoh you look so much better when you
ohohoh you look so much better when you
ohohoh you look so much better when you
ohohoh you look so much better when you
You look so much better when you smile
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
fell from heaven like a shower.
I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile.
it's so hard to look up when you look down.

Sure would hate to see you give up now.
You look so much better when you smile.
