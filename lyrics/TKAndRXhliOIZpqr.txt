Aye, put the tops down, fucking oath (party and bullshit)
Crank the speakers
It's a vibe, it's a motherfucking vibe
Call the bitches, t's a party
It's a vibe, it's a motherfucking vibe
It's a motherfucking vibe, girl we smoking on the kush
Find me rolling up the George, 'cause you knows I gots the bush
Got me praying to the Lord, Jesus knows I gots the push
Still got J's up in my draw,
I be balling with the swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
It's a vibe, girl we smoking on the kush
Find me rolling up the George, 'cause you knows I gots the bush
Got me praying to the Lord, Jesus knows I gots the push
Still got J's up in my draw
I be ballin' with the swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
Old hoes see my old money
Now these old hoes wanna fuck around
That's why the 5-0 see my old man out in town
He's just giving run around
He's said "Who? What? When? Where?"
I don't care, nah I don't know nothin' 'bout it
At the same time I was on a plane out in Adelaide
The plane touching down
I was back on it with the fly raps
Got my grime back so I'm buzzing out
That's why I rap zombie had a five stack
I made times that, I made double nowe
Everybody's got my IG
And no ID, you know nothing 'bout
What I go through, why I smoke fumes
'Cause I'm Goku when I puff a cloud
Find me chillin' in a lobby (ayy)
Always chillin' with a thotty (ayy)
All these women gotta body (ayy)
Make' em shake it Ricky Bobby (nah)
I don't do this for myself (nah)
I don't do this for myself (yeah)
Yeah, this shit is for my blood (yeah)
Yeah, this shit is for my wealth (yeah)
I don't wanna see my little brothers
Getting little money at these shitty jobs
Yeah, my mum and dad are doing running backs
In a smashed van to the ciggie shop
Out here going beast mode
On the east coast in my diddy bop
With the good vibes and the bad hoes
And the triple two and my city rocks
16 with like 16
Caps, caught with a little pot
Chiddy chiddy to the bang bang
You ain't gang gang, it's my city block
I was puffing weed like its rugby league
Get you knocked on if I kick it off
Dressed fresh in a red dress
Rock bongs girl strip it off
'Cause I got the weed, and we light it up
She be my queen (yeah), and we high as fuck
I live my dream (nah), come try your luck
Try and be me (yeah), you die in a month
It's a motherfucking vibe, girl we smoking on the kush
Find me rolling up the George, 'cause you knows I gots the bush
Got me praying to the Lord, Jesus knows I gots the push
Still got J's up in my draw,
I be balling with the swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
It's a vibe, girl we smoking on the kush
Find me rolling up the George, 'cause you knows I gots the bush
Got me praying to the Lord, Jesus knows I gots the push
Still got J's up in my draw
I be balling with the swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
