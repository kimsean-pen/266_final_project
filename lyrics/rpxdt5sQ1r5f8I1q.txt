This time I know I'll get it
As long as I shine on your way
You'll be my friend everyday
But the eyes they can see what you're hiding from me
The smiles that you wear on your face,
The gold that you chase is on me

I got to say this about you (about you)
I got you more than you know
Right where I want you
I got you more than you'll ever know
Right where I want you

These wall I, I could not burn it
Though I feel renew for this place
I'll be this fake I can not bare it

I got to say this about you (about you)
I got you more than you know
Right where I want you
I got you more than you'll ever know
Right where I want you
I got you more than you know
Right where I want you
You know it's time that you go
Right where I want you
I got you more than you could know
Right where I want you
And whatever I do
I got you right where I want you
