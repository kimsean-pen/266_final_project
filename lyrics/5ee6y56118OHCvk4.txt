And no red lights
Down the ride of night (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

Excuse me
Can I lift you up and take you there
I set the mood right when
I light it up, light it up
Had me from the first hit
Never felt this high before
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

So why don't we take it back
To my place at Atlanta State
(Oh oh oh oh)
Don't wanna hit and run

And no red lights
Down the ride of night (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run
The mood's just right
Make you come alive (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

We're twisted so tight
Caught up in the sweat and skin
Hot in the moonlight when I
Fire it up, fire it up
I got the green light
Failing for you finishline
(oh oh oh oh oh)

So why don't we take it back
To my place at Atlanta State
(Oh oh oh oh)
Don't wanna hit and run

And no red lights
Down the ride of night (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run
The mood's just right
Make you come alive (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

I wanna lift you up
I wanna take you there
And I wanna lift you up
I wanna take you there

I don't wanna hit and run

And no red lights
Down the ride of night (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run
The mood's just right
Make you come alive (oh oh)
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run

They see you drop the love
Don't want no hit and run
Tell me that you're ready
'Cause I don't wanna hit and run
