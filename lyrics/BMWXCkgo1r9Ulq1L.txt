In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
The times without number
Daring that I say to you

Do you love me
Like I love you
Are you my life to be
My dream come true
Or will that dream fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night
