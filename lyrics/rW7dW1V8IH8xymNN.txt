You gotta believe in yourself for a change
You better believe it's the truth
I'm sittin here asking why
And I find there's no reply
Well if I were you
I wouldn't even try
Everything drowned so beautifully
You're gonna make me cry

Abracadabra you
Making me feel so good
How I forget so easily
All of my pain tonight
Abracadabra you

I wanna believe that we're goin somewhere
I wanna believe I'm still me
Makin me feel so young
And I find I'm not even done
Well if I were you
Welcome to my heart
Everything drowned so beautifully
Before it even starts

Abracadabra you
Making me feel so good
How i forget so easily
Everything i'm reminded
Abracadabra you

Hey you
You come around my house
All of you move so quickly now
I can't forget that sound
Abracadabra me
Peelin apart the sky
You make it feel so good inside
Everything i forget
Abracadabra you
Oh I love you
Oh how I love you
