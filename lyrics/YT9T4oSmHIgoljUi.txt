Walking out, walking out in this cold winter light
And the pretty girls, all the pretty ones have tears in their eyes
I can't speak because I don't have you here by my side
And I'll always be, I'll always be the girl that was denied

Driving my car in the night
(Honeymooning alone)
The cans on the road in tail light
(Honeymooning alone)
And your empty seat by my side
(Honeymooning alone)
If I drive far enough, will I find my love?

My love, my love
My love, my love

Crying now, crying as the stars fail to shine
Pining now, pining for your warmth and your smile
And I waited all, and I waited all my life for this night
But there's no moon, the moon has turned out all the lights

Driving my car in the night
(Honeymooning alone)
The cans on the road in tail light
(Honeymooning alone)
And your empty seat by my side
(Honeymooning alone)
If I drive far enough, will I find my love?

My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love
My love
