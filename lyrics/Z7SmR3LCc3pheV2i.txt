From the album the hurdy gurdy man

Oh, the waters flow over rock and stone
O'er the waters blow windy wind so cold
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old.
O'er the rivers fly stately kingfishers
Through the waters swim stickleback fishes
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old.
Oh, the waters flow over rock and stone
Through the waters swim stickleback fishes
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Through the rivers swim so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old.
Ooh.
