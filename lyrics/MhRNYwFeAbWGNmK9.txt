You gon', You gon', die, dieâ€“ (Out of the way kids!)
They be actin' for a fuckin' bitch (ay, ay, ay)
I'm 'bout to shoot this bitch

Bitch, I smoked crack, now I count fucking racks
the smack, lickin up powder bags
Back on my bullshit, white bands, scoof it
Three in the back, and that's not including your bitch tushy
Mutt hit the blunt like a bump
$lick in the cut with the cut, no, we never gave a fuck
In my counts, suck it up, bitch I'm fucked
Lead in the brain, I got tar in the lungs
Dreads full of stank, til' my car fuckin'
Nothing to gain, I got nothing but bad fucking luck

Lean the seat back as I'm swerving, I crash
Yeah, this blunt mixed with glass, as my dreams turn to black
I'm ash
Put 'em in the back, no strap in the backpack
Just a bunch of trash
Told Zac, "If we ever fell off with G9 or FTP
Let's just be terrorists"
Well punk boy let me see

Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
They be actin' for a fuckin' bitch
I'm 'bout to shoot this bitch
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
They be actin' for a fuckin' bitch
I'm 'bout to shoot this bitch

This for any pussy boy wanna act up (ac' up)
Fight self-doubt with no guts (no guts)
Voice in my head say, "Ya ain't kill yourself!"
So, so, so I wrote a note
Hot boy, Torkoal
Told homie make a circle

Fuck you and the runners
These Xanax anxiety on panic
Fuck, fuck, fuck! I got to go!
I got a sixty pack waitin' at home
Feel like a zombie; I'm all alone
Everyone clones, please tell your bitch to stop hitting my phone

Let's get it, get that hoe
Motherfucking gang (gang!)
I don't damn care, aye
So am I right?

Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
They be actin' for a fuckin' bitch
I'm 'bout to shoot this bitch
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
Bitch, you gon' die, hoe
They be actin' for a fuckin' bitch
I'm 'bout to shoot this bitch
