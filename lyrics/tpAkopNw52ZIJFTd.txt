Isn't very difficult to see why
You are the way you are
Doesn't take a genius to realize
That sometimes life is hard

It's gonna take time
But you'll just have to wait
You're gonna be fine
But in the meantime

Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over, heal over someday

And I don't wanna hear you tell yourself
That these feelings are in the past
You know it doesn't mean they're off the shelf
Because pain is built to last

Everybody sails alone
Oh, but we can travel side by side
Even if you fail
You know that no one really minds

Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over, heal over someday

Then don't hold on but don't let go
I know it's so hard
You've got to try to trust yourself
I know it's so hard, so hard, yeah

Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby, yeah
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over, heal over someday

Yeah you're gonna heal over
