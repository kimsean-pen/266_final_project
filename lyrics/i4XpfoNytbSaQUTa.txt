America is stressed
That's according to a recent survey
Conducted by this country's leading
Non-profit mental health organization
This mental health association
I was exhausted

And I didn't realize it, like, physically
Because it wasn't physical
It was definitely 100% emotional
And just in my head, I just felt tired

That is the problem
Because ultimately, people are not able
To get control of that stress
It will start to have serious
Consequences on their health
