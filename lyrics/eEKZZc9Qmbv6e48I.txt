They question the king upon leaving
Said, "Open your eyes when you see."
With her, the singing came easy
All gold, cut the sun in the evening
But the birds have stopped singing this season
Alright, alright, definite scheming
I've never been good at this really, I started to see
That birds need a reason to sing
I'll be making my way
Walk tall and don't go, when you're lonely

Curse of us sinning and healing
I do all of this hoping she'll see me
I envy the sea, heavy seething
The water and all of it breathing
Sacred, the secrets I'm keeping
How we danced under circular ceilings
All the embraces we've been in

Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second guessing and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you call
I'd love if you called
Now, I couldn't tell
But she's keeping me well
All of my secrets releasing as pieces of me alone
Honestly, destined to fail, but
You were all on my mind, 'til
We made what we are
'Til we kissed in the car
Now, I couldn't

All in, fall in, vulnerable as hell, let's
Stall in, crawl in, girl, you knew me well
Mmmmmmmmm
I like how the forest is leaning

Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second guessing and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you called
I'd love if you called
Now, I couldn't tell
But she's keeping me well
All of my secrets releasing as pieces of me alone
Honestly, destined to fail, but
You were all on my mind, 'til
We made what we are
'Til we kissed in the car
Now, I couldn't

Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second guessing and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you called
I'd love if you called
Now, I couldn't tell

All of my secrets releasing as pieces of me alone
