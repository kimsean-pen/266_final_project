Well, I'm goin' down to Rosie's, stop at Fannie Mae's
Gonna tell Fannie what I heard, her boyfriend say
Don't start me to talkin', I'll tell her everything I know
I'm gonna break up this
signifyin', 'cause somebody's got to go
Jack give his wife two dollars, go downtown and get some margarine
Gets out on the streets, ol' George stopped her
He knocked her down, and blackened her eye
She gets back home, tell her husband a lie
Don't start me to talkin, I'll tell everything I know
I'm gonna break up this signifyin', somebody's got to go
She borrowed some money, go to the beauty shop
Jim honked his horn, she begin to stop
She said, "Take me, baby," around the block,
I'm goin to the beauty shop, where I can get my hair sock
Don't start me to talkin', I'll tell everything I know
Well, to break up this signifyin', somebody's got to go
