A look so quick
A movement so slight
You could almost imagine
It didn't just happen
But everything will change
In just one look, one little glance
It's not passing fascination now

It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obession

And it's physical
It's like standing at the edge
Your blood starts to pump
'Cause you're worried you might jump
And your head throbbing like a heart
Heart throbbing like a drum
Drums throbbing like the points
Just go ahead and jump.

It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obsession

There's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's only one way out

A look so quick
A movement so slight
Oh it's not passing fascination now

It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obsession
Uh huh, it's obsession
It's obsession
