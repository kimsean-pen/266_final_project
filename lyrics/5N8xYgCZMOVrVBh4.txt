I'll say goodnight
In the morning I will wake up to a blinding light
And curse all my mistakes
And say I'm not what you think
I'll break all the links
I'll ignore all the exit signs

Cause you've had your own mountains to climb
And I've got skeletons I hide
In the back of my mind where I question myself
I dwell on the past just like everyone else

Don't bear the weight of the world on your shoulders
It's not too heavy
I'll break my back so you can feel like someone's on your side

Forget the past and all the heartache
The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep
With songs that let you know that we'll be ok
Round and round and round this goes
Playing on your stereo
When I'm away and you can't sleep
Just know that it's the same for me

And every time I see you I remember why I made you mine
That day in mid-December
Still so young and na√Øve with our hearts on our sleeves
But I know we'll be alright

They don't know what we share in the briefest of moments
I'm head over heels for the smallest components
That light in your eye or that look on your face
Secure in the fact that we both know our place

No one like you girl
No one in the world
The perfect touch to the picture I had in my head
No one like you girl
Nowhere in the world
That I would rather be

Don't bear the weight of the world on your shoulders
It's not too heavy
Since we met it seems like we've crossed paths at the right time

Forget the past and all the heartache
The growing pains that keep you awake
I'll sing you to sleep
With songs that let you know that we'll be ok
Round and round and round this goes
Playing on your stereo
When I'm away and you can't sleep
Just know that it's the same for me
