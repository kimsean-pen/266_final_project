Conceived and born was one of light (give me your hand)
Blood is spilled and man will follow
Rain and dark, the other born black night (infernal man)
Punishment too great to bear
Raise your head and taste the courage (the one of the light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you, won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance, I closed my brother's eyes tonight

Conceived and born was one of light (give me your hand)
Blood is spilled and man will follow
Rain and dark, the other born black night (infernal man)
Punishment too great to bear
Raise your head and taste the courage (the one of the light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you, won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance, I closed my brother's eyes tonight

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man
Crestfallen man

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the site of the One
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the site of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the site of the One
A punishment sent from is hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the site of the One
Away in this land you must go
