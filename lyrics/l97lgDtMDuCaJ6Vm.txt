The horror has gone, it's become the darkness
The horror has gone, it's become the darkness
The horror has gone, the horror has gone

The fear in my heart has gone forever after
The fear in my heart has gone forever after
The fear has gone, fear has gone

I killed a fish, but I found my baby
I lost my bird and I know it seems crazy
But now I feel we were one
Now I feel we were one, now I feel we were one

The horror has gone, it's become the darkness
The horror has gone, it's become the darkness
The horror has gone, the horror has gone

Horror, the horror, it's gone
The horror, the horror is gone
The horror is gone
