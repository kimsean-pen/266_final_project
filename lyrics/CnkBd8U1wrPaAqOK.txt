Watch for me
In darkness turn
For as shadow I shall return
After touch with spirit world
However there I may be hurled...

The dream of immortality
Are we drifting in shades of nowhere

Breath of death from wisp of life
Ingest in me
I ever stride
Among the shores of tranquil nights
Between the set and dawn of light...

The dream of immortality
Is leaving the joy of returning home

Wisper's clouds envelope frail
Colorless gaze which ever sails
Across the world
Once known to me
I cease To begin To ever be...

Somewhere inside ourselves we lie
