Why are there so many, songs about rainbow?
And whats on the other side?

Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
And rainbows have nothing to hide.

So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
I know theyre wrong, wait and see.

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish, would be heard and answered, and wished on the morning star?

Somebody thought of it, and someone believed it. And look what its done so far.

What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing?
What do we think we might see?

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers, and me.

All of us, under its spell. We know that its probably magic.

Have you been half-asleep, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name.

Is this the sweet sound, to call the young sailors?

The voice might be one and the same.

I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Its something that I'm s'posed to be...

Someday we'll find it the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.
