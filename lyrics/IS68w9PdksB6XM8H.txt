Oh, it's Saturday night
Or has Sunday started?
'Cause when mornin' light comes and
You're broken hearted
We were close to somethin'

Ended up with nothin'
All I hear is echoes
Of the words we said
All the battles they played over in my head
We were close to heaven

Now it's gone to hell
And so I roll the windows down
And I just fade you out
And it rolls like thunder and it hits like lightnin'

When you are goin' under, it lifts you up again
Right now that kick drum feels like a heartbeat
And I'm fallin' for that long lost melody
I put the radio on
Savin' myself with a song
I put the radio on

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
If I keep drivin'
Keep movin' forward
'Cause there's nothin' worth me turnin' this around
I've been hidin' these miles between us

So I'll keep the volume up to drown you out
Forget you were around
And it rolls like thunder and it hits like lightnin'
When you are goin' under, it lifts you up again
Right now that kick drum feels like a heartbeat

And I'm fallin' for that long lost melody
I'll put the radio on
Savin' myself with a song
I'll put the radio on

I really need a love song to rescue me
I really need a love song that I believe
And it rolls like thunder and it hits like lightnin'
When you are goin' under, it lifts you up again
Right now that kick drum feels like a heartbeat

I'll start fallin' for that long lost melody
And I'll find out who it is I'm supposed to be
I put the radio on
Savin' myself with a song
I find the strength to move on
There in the moment, I'm strong
I put the radio on

Ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah
