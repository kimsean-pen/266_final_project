I've seen this place before,
back when I was young and I had something more to prove.
Now that I'm older,
I've seen all the things that I want, and I'm ready to make my move.
Stare straight-faced, don't hesitate.
Tell you, Why would we want to make you bastards wait?
Thank God I got the chance. Now I can say.
So now we'll say, we'll say.
(We're going to do what we want)

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes falling down
We'll do what we want to,
So we'll do what we want to, Yeah.
Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
Well look who's laughing now
We'll do what we want to
So well do what we want to, Yeah.

Oh my, don't they hate to see us try?
Come on, say what you think, it won't mean a thing.
In the end we're gonna be just fine.
Stare straight-faced, don't hessitate.
Tell you, Why would we want to make you bastards wait?
Thank God I got the chance. Now I can say.
So now we'll say, we'll say.
(We're going to do what we want)

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?

With or without you
Don't you cross the line, don't you cross that line?

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes crashing down
We'll do what we want to,
So we'll do what we want to, Yeah.

Remember when they said that what we want could never be done?
When it all comes falling down
We'll do what we want to,
So we'll do what we want to, Yeah.
Remember when they said the world we want could never be done?
Well look who's laughing now
We'll do what we want to
So we'll do what we want to, Yeah.
