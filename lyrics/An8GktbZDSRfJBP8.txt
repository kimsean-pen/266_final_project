Together. Together or Separate.
The gate is open.
If there's a fence between us, we'll pull it down; and by the way it starts again.
Self congratulations are not my pleasure.
Please don't join us here in the clouds.
It's no better here than on the ground where the birds are just giant bugs.
Your mouth is full of spit but has no words.
I'm dying to see you.
