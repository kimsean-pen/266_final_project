Oh the last time I saw Adrianne, she sang about the seasons
And what I can't seem to do, she can
The Eternal's moving in her hands
And I knew her singing signaled Spring
And whirring my heart pounds
For all the want and doubt are now upon me
And I hear it in the sounds
Of all the rain and all the baseball games
That it rains out

In the garden by the blooming trees
Ants swarm the peonies
And I took a look at Lolo's knees, as she sneezed up at the sun
And I thought her sneezing signaled - something, I don't know
For all the want and doubt are not behind me
Though I blamed it on the snow
Is it all the sweetness of the bacchanals that I'll never know?

And I look outside, at the storm forming o'er the lake
I could not hide, even in this wallpaper shirt
Is it all the sweetness?
Is it all the sweetness?
And whirring my heart pounds
