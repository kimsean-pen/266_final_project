For so long I have felt alone
Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless
Nights that buried my weary heart
You brought an end to this dead hour
And meaning to a
A calloused life

Held in Your arms
But too far from my heart
Held in Your arms
But too far from my heart

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in...
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in mine

I remember the way you looked
At me not the way you drew, drew me close
With one deep sigh scattering pieces of my
My restless mind
Forgetting all that we
We have left behind, we have left behind
We have left behind, we have left behind

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in...
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in...
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in...
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in...
