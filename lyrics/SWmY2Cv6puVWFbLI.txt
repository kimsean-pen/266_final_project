Why'd I try tearing apart this groove
When you only tried to show me what to do?
I wish that I could take you some place far real soon
Just like those others seem, seem to do

Home, when you gonna come back home?
Home, something I said put you in a throne
Home, when you gonna come back home?
Home weighs me down, just leave it alone

She forgot to tell him, "quit your job"
You could've lived your life like all those fools do
Dreamers know, I know you hide when he go
Trying to save my soul before I'm too old

Home, when you gonna come back home?
Home, something I said put you in a throne
Home, when you gonna come back home?
Home weighs me down, just leave it alone

There is no one coming home
Why'd you try and lock the door?
Don't you feel like giving in?
It's so much safer than before

Why'd I try tearing apart this groove
When you only tried to show me what to do?
