Maybe I need a new haircut this week
And maybe thats why I've been losing hours of sleep
But you wouldn't know
When the wind is pressed against my window

What's it's like to be worth it
What's it like to live inside your head
What's it's like to be worth it
To maintain homeostasis
I just want to be perfect
I just want to occupy your skin

Well I don't wanna lose a limb
From all the trouble that I'm in
