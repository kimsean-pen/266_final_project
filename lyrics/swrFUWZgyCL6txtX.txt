Cavity click keeps the rhythm, keeps it movin'
Any day it's gonna crack, popcorn kernel
Olive pit, at any moment smashed to bits (yeah)
Toothache's better than heartache baby, I've figured that much out
And I thought I knew a thing or two about the blues
But you've got me wonderin' now

Dog-eyed kindess (naive and trusting)
Fans the purest flame of morning fire
But once it fizzles out into charred, formless evening
How do you ignite without turning to ash (yeah)
Seasick's better than heartsick, baby, I know that much by now
And I thought I knew nausea from sea to cars but you've got me wonderin' now

Forced into morning, tempted into night
Tally all the things that you broke
Bending her branches, snapping, sapping and writhing
For me alone
Yeah, I guess sunburn's better than heartburn (barely)
Guess I never figured that out
And I thought I knew a thing or two about the blues but you've got me wonderin' now.
