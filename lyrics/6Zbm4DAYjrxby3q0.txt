Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!

If you have to ask, it's too late
Somewhere in between, your character grace
An eye on fantasy, touching nails
Sparks fly, off of me and onto you

Brothers in the dark, fight for your life!
Devils in the dark, fight for your life!
Fight for your life! Fight for your life!

Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!

Devil in my blood, living on the edge
Split myself in two, death is all around
Summoning the power, drag myself through pain
Blood spills, off of me and on to you

Brothers in the dark, fight for your life!
Devils in the dark, fight for your life!
Fight for your life! Fight for your life!

Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!

Crimson cloud! Evening sky!
Crimson cloud! Evening sky!

Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
Savior! Bloodstain! Hellfire! Shadow!
Heaven on a landslide!
