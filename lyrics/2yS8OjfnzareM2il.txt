Made me feel so stupid
When I burn your trust tonight
Don't know how it started
But we both destroyed the light

Now you don't hear me call
And I can't reach you
Over an empty room
One day if you can't sleep at all
And the fire is not enough

Come find me
If we're thrown into the dark
Come tell me
We will never feel apart

Made me feel so stupid
When you burned my trust tonight
I remember quite clearly
How we're both made it to the light

Now I won't take your call
You can't reach me
Over a crowded room
One day
If I can't sleep at all
And my memory's not enough

Come find me
If we're thrown into the dark
Come tell me
And we'll never feel apart
Because I'm not sure how to walk
Through the valleys of night
And if one day you just can sleep at all
And the memories not enough

I'm willing to start
You never listen to me
Sharing our life
And your looking for me

Come find me
If we're thrown into the dark
Come tell me
That we'll never feel apart

Come find me
If we're thrown into the dark
Cause I'm not sure I want to walk
Through the valleys of night

I'm willing to start
You never listen to me
Sharing our life
And your looking for me

I'm willing to start
You never listen to me
Sharing our life
And your looking for me
