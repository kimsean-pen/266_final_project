Oh I've been hurt
but I still love you,
I've been hurt like this before
Yeah, your loves teaching me
a new thing try to realize,
and call me when you're ready,
Yeah whenever you're ready

I know you left,
but I still love you,
and though I've cried like this before
your loves teaching me
a new thing,
and try to realize
then call me
when you're ready
whenever you're ready

But if you call me,
you gotta treat me
better in a different way
and if you call me,
you gotta listen girl
to what I tell you

and never hurt me
cuz I love you,

your loves teaching me
a new thing,
try to realize,
and call me
when you're ready,
whenever you're ready
