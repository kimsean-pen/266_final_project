I keep my heart
Under the floor boards
Deep in the dark
Far away from yours
A panic starts
In a little box
When you're at my door
And I'm fine
No I lied
I feel it screaming
I know what you've come for

Heart!
What is it I hear?
I'm moving towards the fear
And it wants to feel you
Call my name
Heart!
What is it I feel?
I'm moving past the real
And it wants to hear you
Call my name
You're in my brain
It's insane
(Call my name)
And in my brain
You call my name

I pass the time
In cool paranoia
Detail each crime
That killed me before ya
But your pale blue eyes
Trigger innocence
And bind to euphoria
Then I'm lost
And it throbs
I hear it laughing
My heart will destroy us

Heart!
What is it I hear?
I'm moving towards the fear
And it wants to feel you
Call my name
Heart!
What is it I feel?
I'm moving past the real
And it wants to hear you
Call my name

Knock, knock
On the door at night
I get a sickless pitless pleasured fright
Beat, beat
On the boards till light
My soul groans and moans when your moving right
Your silhouette and my darker side
To the edge of life (tick tock)
I wake up from the dream with your scent
upon my sheets and a phone that says good bye

Love runs it's course
A mark on a scoreboard
So I nail my heart
Under the floorboards

Heart!
What is it I hear?
I'm moving towards the fear
And it wants to feel you
Call my name
Heart!
What is it I feel?
I'm moving past the real
And it wants to hear you
Call my name
You're in my brain
It's insane
(Call my name)
And in my brain
You call my name
You're in my brain
It's insane
(Call my name)
And in my brain
You call my name
