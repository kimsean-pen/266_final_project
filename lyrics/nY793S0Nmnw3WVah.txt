Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this might be over soon
But you're bound to win
Cuz if I'm betting against you I think I'd rather lose
This is all that I have
So pleeeease
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
you know I only have so little so please
Mend your broken heart and leave

I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real real soon
But I'm on your side
And I dont want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon

But this is all that you have
So pleeease
Let me take what's left of your heart
and I will use
I swear I'll only use only what I need
I know you only have so little so please
Let me mend my broken heart
And you said this was all you have
And it's all I need
But blah blah
Because it fell apart
And I guess it's all you knew
And all I had
But now we have only confused hearts and
I guess all we had is really all we need

So please let's take these broken hearts and use
Let's use only what we really need
You know we only have so little
So pleeeeeease
Take these broken hearts and leave
