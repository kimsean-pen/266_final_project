She sits in a tub and relives, stories she never lived
And it makes me feel blank, it makes me feel blank like I missed
Lies in a bath with no water, and a bath full of blood
How happy are ya, to be alive
MARY, MARY, MARY, MARY
GET OUT
It makes me feel blank, it makes me feel blank like I missed
Read the words she wrote, she never lived
Lies in a tub with no water and a bath full of blood
How happy are ya, to be alive
MARY, MARY, MARY, MARY
