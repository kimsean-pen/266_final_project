She said baby our love's just like your songs
The beat ain't bad but the words are all wrong
It's time to pack my bags, it's time to just move on
She sang Johnny I'm gone, gone, gone
And she was gone
Me and Leigh met summer of '95
In a burgundy dress lookin' finer than a French wine
A Cajun queen with another side
She was a schoolboy's dream, I was out of my mind
She was lookin' fine
She said: You want to drive me home
But what I didn't know
Ooh, ooh, I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing in the street of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, it was almost like a dream
That night I made a move, man I fell hard
When I put my hands in her cookie jar
She was more than a girl, she was a cabaret star
I was a deer in the light of speeding car
Nothing's what it seems
She was a Venus de Milo in her sister's jeans
Ooh, ooh, I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing in the street of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, it was almost like a dream
Ooh, ooh, I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh? dancing in the street of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing cheek to cheek in New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing with the Queen down Bourbon Street
Ooh, ooh, I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh? dancing in the street of New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, nothing's what it seems in New Orleans
Ooh, ooh, dancing with the Queen down Bourbon Street
Ooh, ooh, I was dancing with the Queen of New Orleans
