And just stay there for a minute
And just don't move any closer
Move closer
I just don't know if I can take it
It feels like overexposure
Move closer

Brick by brick and scar by scar
It's taken me years to put up these guards
I don't wanna get hurt again
Is it agony or ecstasy?
I feel safer now you're close to me
And fall apart

Once again I've broken, Ive crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear
I just don't know what I'm doing
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?

You took my world as I know it
But I don't want any closure
Move closer
Cause you've become that one thing
That I don't wanna get over
Move closer

Is it disaster or destiny
That I feel so right with you next to me
And fall apart

Once again I've broken, Ive crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear
I just don't know what I'm doing
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?

Violent like a tidal wave
You hit me, blitz me, shattered in a hurricane
Your love is different
That holds me through it
I'm perfectly ruined

Once again I've broken, Ive crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear
I just don't know what I'm doing
(I just don't know what I'm doing)
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?
