Gather round people I'll tell you a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiari
Were opposite men on opposite sides

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Eighteen quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said "uhuh, we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land"
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
"You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow"
Vince said "if we fall others are rising"

Then Vincent Lingiari boarded an airplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
"This affair" they told him "is a matter of state.
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry"
Vincent said "no thanks, we know how to wait"

Then Vincent Lingiari returned in an airplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people "let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns."

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

That was the story of Vincent Lingairi
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand, and stand in the law

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
