Just because you find yourself
Off the streets again
That don't mean that I can help you
or I ain't your friend

Baby trouble is your middle name
Your trouble is that that's your game

Now you are out of circulation out of reach and out of touch
Let me keep you in the loop
Though I can't tell you much

Baby trouble is your middle name
The trouble is that that's your game

Just because I can't see you see you anymore
That's because honey you're doing 2-4

Baby trouble is your middle name
The trouble is that that's your game

Just because you find yourself
Back to jail again
That don't mean that we can connect you know
or I'm still your friend

Baby trouble is your middle name
The trouble is that that's your game

Even though you are still inside
I could get you off the hood
But I know if I get you out
I won't get a second look

Baby trouble is your middle name
The trouble is that that's your game

Trouble
Too much trouble

Too much trouble

Too much trouble
