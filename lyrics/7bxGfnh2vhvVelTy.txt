This is a calling out for you
Through the deep Pacific blue
You're my voice that echoes the waves
Pushing soundwaves out to you
Well let's make it to the room
We'll buy a candlelight or two
And in your sweet December haze
I'd have fell for love again
As the sand trickles in twos
Sadly you're in glass of truth
While I wash out the days
Will it hold a thin regrace?

Well either way
Oh I'll remember you

This is a calling out for truth
Even when the tides are cruel
I hear your voice, I hear it all
I hear your comments pushing through
Will I make it to your room?
We'd buy a candlelight or two

They say they watched us fall apart
But couldn't find us
They say they called it from the start
But couldn't guide us
They say they watched us fall apart
But couldn't find us

Well either way
Oh I'll remember you

Find me, I'd see
And tell me why you never loved me
Cause I gave you my all
I had to watch you fall

And even in the darkest silence
I could hear and see your guidance
But now we lost it all
I had to watch you fall
Don't miss the waterfall

This is a calling out in two
When of everything we knew
My voice just soften in your gaze
Quiet rank of one to two
I sat lost inside a room
By candlelight or two

They say they watched us fall apart
But couldn't find us
They say they called it from the start
But couldn't guide us
They say they watched us fall apart
But couldn't find us

Well either way
Oh I'll remember you

Find me, I'd see
And tell me why you never loved me
Cause I gave you my all
I had to watch you fall

And even in the darkest silence
I could hear and see your guidance
But now we lost it all
I had to watch you fall
Don't miss the waterfall

Truly fall
They say they caught us in a daze
We were away and never thought
That it would change
But now you ruined all the ways
And the ways will let them find us
They'll never find us

Find me, I'd see
And tell me why you never loved me
Cause I gave you my all
I had to watch you fall
