Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Life is never easy, the rest in unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Each and every moment searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
Sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can
May not make it easier but I have felt you near all the way

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me, I see the light
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
Sharing with me

Ever, I stand on the rock of your love
Ever, ever, can't nobody stop me, watch me
Ever, and ever, stand on the rock of your
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me, yes it's shining on me
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing, you're sharing with me, you're sharing with me
You're sharing with me, you're sharing with me
Cannot be in the dark, make it into the light, yea
You're love is shinning on me, shinning on me, shinning on me
See the light, I see the light, shinning, shinning on me
I didn't think that I could take it but your love helped me to make it
Coming out of the dark, I see the light now, see the light now
