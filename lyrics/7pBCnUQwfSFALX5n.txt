Sever the ties before they weigh you down
Tie your loose ends in the world space
Into the eyes I look, I don't see you back
To?

And this land is nobody's and when it fall apart
I'll be there waiting to claim it all
And this land is nobody's and when it fall apart
I'll be there waiting to claim it all

Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive

Remember goals and busy days when I bought all
And nobody could tell me I was wrong, no
And in my own desire I be owin' no-one other than myself
We gotta get used to enough
And in those older days, oh, I guess I'm lonely
And then those old days, all I could see that could hold me

And this land is nobody's and when it fall apart
I'll be there waiting to claim it all

Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive

And in those older days, oh, I guess I'm lonely
And in those old days, all I could see that could hold me
And in those older days, oh, I guess I'm lonely
And in those old days, all I could see that could hold me

Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
Give me all these stars, I got nothing I want more
Give it up?
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive
You either run or you take it
And I know I was built to make it out alive
