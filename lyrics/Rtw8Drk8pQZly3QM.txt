You were so exciting, like a bottle of lightning
Sex and no fighting, you left me Naked
You were always a mystery, the way that you kissed me
Hope nobody's listening, you left me Naked

What you done my cruel lover?
You burned these sheets we're under
You stripped me of my armour
You slipped then I blew your cover

You hesitated
You had a secret
My lips could taste it
Cause when you kissed him wasted, you left me Naked

You left me broken, my dignity stolen
Hanging out in the open, you left me Naked
Now all of my friends know, that you left me hollow
No shades on my window, you left me Naked

What you done my cruel lover?
You burned these sheets we're under
You stripped me of my armour
You slipped then I blew your cover

You hesitated
You had a secret
My lips could taste it
Cause when you kissed him wasted, you left me Naked

You hesitated
You had a secret
My lips could taste it
Cause when you kissed him wasted, you left me Naked
