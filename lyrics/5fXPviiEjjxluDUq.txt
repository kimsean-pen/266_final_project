After graduating from college,
I moved back home to my parents' house in Fenton

(It would be the first of three more separate stints)

My brother helped get me a part-time job
peddling paint at Sherwin-Williams

The idea was to stay for a year and save up
and plan for our wedding

All of our friends had already moved away
or were still off at school

So it felt like a ghost town
or defeat

I was not a model employee

I was frequently late and felt my education made me overqualified
and that the job was far beneath me

I reeked of youth! I thought the world was owed me!

Each morning, contractors would pour in like vultures on carrion
and pick the store clean
