Well this is it, this is where we make a stand
You and me time to face this man to man
Can't you see we cannot go on
It's me against me again
I'm sick of the man I am within
Fighting me, making me fall down again
I commit, I'll commit your suicide
Now death will breath you in

Sitting here at my grave side I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, never again what I was
You pulled the dead man out of me

I buried you, you were nearly my demise
Only by the grace of God that I survived
I admit I was wrong to let you in
Never come back again
I can see all the possibilities rising up
Now that your not holding me down
This is where I say goodbye
And put the last bullet between your eyes

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, never again what i was
You pulled the dead man out of me

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been more alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not who I was, I'll never be who I was
You pulled the dead man out of

Sitting here at my graveside I've never been so alive
You pulled the dead man out of me
I am not what I was, never again what i was
You pulled the dead man out of me
