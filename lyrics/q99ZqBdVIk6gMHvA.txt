On the day that your mentality
Decides to try to catch up with your biology

Come 'round 'cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure
These are the riches of the poor

And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on prisoner's aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
But it's written all over my face

Oh, these are the riches of the poor
These are the riches of the poor

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station
It's all over my face
