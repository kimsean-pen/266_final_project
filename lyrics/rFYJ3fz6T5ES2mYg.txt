Water water was
Water water was over me
Cool me down,
Cool me down!
Water water leave
Water leave through the valley
Lead you all down, wear me down!

Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
Lose me in the dark
Drag me to the deep
Let your water wash over me

Water water rise
Water rise up and roll through the islands
Roll down the streets
It's only voice, strongly voice
Find the woman and dance through the moon, like
Leave me the rain

Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
Lose me in the dark
Drag me to the deep
Let your water wash over me

Wash
Wash
Wash

Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
Drown me in the water
Drown me in the sea
