Bison on the plains
Stupid symphony streams
The same old tricks they used to get you to cry
Over nothing, over everything

Bison on the plains
I only packed a couple of things
This high was like a sorry parade
Of hearing traffic and going nowhere

Bison on the plains
The photograph is never the same
I learned this when I was seven or eight
This all means nothing, this all means everything

Bison on the plains
And those overused overture streams
The same old tricks they used to get you to cry
Over nothing, over everything

Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
Ah, bison on the plains
