Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today

Just my own sin
The walls, cold and pale

The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone, I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound

My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion

Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek are all in one

I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On a sad day of loss

A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally

Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning

Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
Should have been dead

On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning

Ain't got no time
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high

Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)

All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
I cry out to God

Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stand and confirms
I've created my own prison

I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stand and confirms
I've created my own prison
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
