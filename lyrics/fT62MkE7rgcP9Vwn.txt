Hold on this will
hurt more than anything has before
What it was
what it was
what it was
I've brought this on
us more than anyone
could ignore
What I've done
what I've done
what I've done
...
I've worked for so long
just to see you mess around
What you've done
what you've done
what you've done
I want back the years
that you took
when I was young
I was young
I was young
but it's done
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away

Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore

Oh take it all away

We'll fall just like stars being hung by only

string
Everything, everything, here is gone

No map can direct
how to ever make it home
We're alone, we're alone, we're alone

Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away

Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
