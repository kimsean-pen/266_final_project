Sunshine is a metaphoric ride
Caught in the middle of a lightning strike
We're all flowing along, changing with the tides
On the frontline in the back of our minds

With the battle song
That will lead us on

And we walk the Earth
With our heads held high
For the life we want
Yeah, we've got to fight
Yeah, we walk the Earth
Like champions
With heart and soul
Like champions

Our conscience weighs on all of our minds
So we lay our hearts right on the line
We keep pushing on, holding steady and strong
Knocking them down just to make our home

Like a battle hymn, yeah
That will lead us on

And we walk the Earth
With our heads held high
For the life we want
Yeah, we've got to fight
Yeah, we walk the Earth
Like champions
With heart and soul
Like champions

And we walk the Earth
With our heads held high
For the life we want
Yeah, we've got to fight
Yeah, we walk the Earth
Like champions
With heart and soul
Like champions

And we walk the Earth
With our heads held high
For the life we want
Like champions
