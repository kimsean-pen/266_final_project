Remember when we were lost at sea?
We would look at the bright night sky
Thinking of, what we could be
Oh, what we could be
How to spend our lives

Remember when we had nothing left?
We were strung out in the cold
Holding on, trying to save our breath
Trying to save our breath
We would not let go

Whoa, through the good, through the bad and ugly
Whoa, we'll conquer anything
'Cause one day, we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love

One day, we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love
With love, love

Remember down in the forest's heart
We were lost, lost in hope and faith
We put our trust in counting stars
We were counting stars
Trying to find our way
Remember up on the mountain top
Looking out on the rocks below
Thinking God, will we never stop?
We will never stop
No, we won't let go

'Cause one day, we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day, we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love
(With love, love)

Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white hope it lasts
With love, love
Like a scene from the past
Where we look back and laugh
With love, love
A thought like a flash
Black and white hope it lasts
With love

'Cause one day, we're gonna come back
And laugh at it all
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love
One day, we're gonna come back
And relive those thoughts
One day, we'll look at the past
With love, love
(Love, love)
With love, love
