I came to town to search for gold
And I brought with me a memory
And I seem to hear the night wind cry
Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
(Never be)
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

I searched tor gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too
But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory
(A memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

Now there were men who craved my gold
(Ooh ooh)
And meant to take my gold from me
(Ooh ooh)
When a man is gone he needs no gold
So they carried me to the hangin' tree
To join my dreams and a memory
(A memory)
Yes, they carried me to the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

To really live you must almost die
(What do I)
And it happened just that way with me
(What do I)
They took the gold and set me free
And I walked away from the hangin' tree
I walked away from the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)
And my own true love, she walked with me
(Aah aah aah aah)

That's when I knew that the hangin' tree
Was a tree of life, new life for me
(Aah aah, aah aah aah)
A tree of hope, new hope for me
A tree of love, new love tor me
The hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree
