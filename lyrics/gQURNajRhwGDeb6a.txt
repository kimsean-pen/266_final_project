On this day
All the trees in Rhodesia are aflame
As the eyes of the quivering flowers
Of aching replete

And the lions
Overflowing with vengeance for the pines
Not occupation but a sentence, and in time
We'll all be faking retreat

Have you got rid of it yet?
Is faith corroded with neglect?
Can we ever hide hurt?

At least at night the harvest sun's yoke
Is rising like the rebel smoke
Beyond the oceans and swirls

And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still
And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still

What a hollow promise
From hollow men
What a shallow grave
For shallow men
You're the bull that paws the earth
The leopard that teaches to run
You're the crocodile that eats the sun

So we walk on through and beyond the failures of men
And we know there's a void at the centre of everything

And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still
And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still

And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still
And it will shame us now
And it will shame us still
