Whoa, thought it was a nightmare
Lo, it's all so true
They told me, "Don't go walkin' slow
The Devil's on the loose"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Oh don't look back to see

Thought I heard a rumblin'
Callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim!"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Oh don't look back to see

Over on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Oh don't look back to see
