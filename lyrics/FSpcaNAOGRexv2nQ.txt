I've been drying for it
Bugging again
Now it won't bend
You've been frying for it

A mound of smack
Won't fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use

All the steps I've taken, hidin'
Not sure now what's left inside me
So I've taken nappin's
All the things I left unspoken
The one that fits, still got me joking
Hope it don't mean, I'm still nappin'

I've been drying for it
Bugging again
Now it won't bend
You've been frying for it

A mound of smack
Won't fill the crack
They always come in two's
All the space they always use

All the steps I've taken, hidin'
Not sure now what's left inside me
So I've taken nappin's
All the things I left unspoken
The one that fits, still got me joking

Hope it don't mean, I'm still nappin'
Can't face the [unverified]
The ones you left can trace me
Sky broke down, that rainy sound
Gotta save me
