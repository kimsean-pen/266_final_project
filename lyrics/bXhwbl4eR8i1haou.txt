Whose dream am I?
Whose dream am I?
Livin, livinn

American dreamin
Let the people, sleep
And the violence creep
And the fever, sink in
And the angels, swim for it, swim for it

One at a time
We're comin through
One at a time
We're comin, We're comin

One comin
One comin
One comin
One comin
One comin
One comin
One comin
One comin
At a time
