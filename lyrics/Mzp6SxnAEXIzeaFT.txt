This island has become an ocean
And my boat's too small
The waves are crashing in
And I can't save this sinking ship

I sent out signal flares
But no one out there seems to care
Now the voice inside my head
Is the only thing that I have left

This is the part where I'll admit
I'm getting what I deserve.

And now I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I won't be
I'm haunted by the sound
Sweet sound of my last breath

20 days at sea
My skin is blistered from the heat
I can beg and I can plea
But what I get is never what I need

This is the part where I'll admit
I'm getting what I deserve

And now I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I won't be
I'm haunted by the sound
Sweet sound of my last breath

I'm going down

This is the part where I'll admit
I'm getting what I deserve

And now I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I won't be
I'm haunted by the sound
Sweet sound of my last breath
