I will spend my whole life through
Loving you
Just loving you
Winter, summer, spring time too
Loving you
Loving you

Makes no difference where I go

Or what I do
You know that I'll always be
Loving you, just you and
If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue
Don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you

There is only one for me,
And you know who
You know that, I'll always be
Loving you
