I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados all night
To get you out my mind now, baby
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on all night
To keep you out my sight now, baby

Picture perfect features
And I'm looking like I just got made
Got the sunshine on my face
Starting up a party
On the pavement like I just got paid
And it's alright

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know

Let's talk about the base
You got the big blue eyes and all that bass
Oh father, let me break
'Cause I won't see another woman like this for days
I'm like, oh boy, look at that ass
Oh boy, look at that ass
Get your eyes up to my face
'Cause I see you right through your shades

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know
"Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know

Aye, oh, aaye
Oh-oh, ayye
Oh
Oh, aye
(I got my shades on, I got my shades on, all night)
Oh-oh, aye
Oh

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feelin' brand new like this
You know
