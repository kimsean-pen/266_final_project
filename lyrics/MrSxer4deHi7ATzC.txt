Into the rhythm of the drum
Dancing in the woods
And look arround the magical Faeries
Old green dwarves and red mushrooms

Try to believe and understand,
There's nothing you can do, believe: it's true
A river of wine refresh your eyes,
Calling us to rock our souls

Into the rhythm of the drum
Dancing in the woods
And look arround the magical Faeries
Old green dwarves and red mushrooms

Believe: it's true! Believe: it's true!
Old green dwarves and red mushrooms

Even you still laughing at me
You think that I'm the Foll
The fool is you!
So I can tell: I leave my words,
There's nothing you can do,
Believe: it's true!
