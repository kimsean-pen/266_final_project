Here she comes ... Don't say anything

At first you smile, then turn away
I've been thinking of what I should say
All last night I stayed up dreaming,
I'm still dreaming
I look at you, I'm just a guy
I know my place but still I'll try
You must be tired of people asking,
But I'm still asking
Please... Oh, please let me down easy
Please, just let me down easy

Don't you hear my heart is calling
You don't know how hard I've fallen for you

Another day, you're passing by
Today's the day I'm gonna try
You don't know how much I'm hoping, how I'm hoping
Please... Oh, please let me down easy
Please just let me down easy

Can't you hear my heart is calling
You don't know how far I've fallen for you

If you told me to follow you know I'd fly to you,
Here I go, I may fall but I will try
So please, let me down easy
Please, just let me down easy
Please, just let me down easy

If you want me to follow, you know I'll fly
