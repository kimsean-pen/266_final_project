falling
help me, i'm falling
helplessly falling
falling for you
and mountains
there may be mountains
the highest mountain
won't keep me from you, oh yeah
For you i'd swim across an ocean wide
just to be with you i'd even dare to fly
it's the miracle that happens every time
i fall for you, oh yeah
and forever and forever without end
i just keep...
Falling
needing and wanting
the only one thing
that i want is you, oh yeah
For you i'd swim across an ocean wide
just to be with you i'd even dare to fly
it's the miracle that happens every time
i fall for you, oh yeah
and forever and forever without end
i fall for you
For you i'd swim across an ocean wide
just to be with you i'd even dare to fly
it's the miracle that happens every time
i fall for you, oh yeah
and forever and forever without end
i fall for you, oh yeah
and forever, forever without end
i fall for you
I fall for you
