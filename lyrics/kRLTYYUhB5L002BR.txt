Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl
"Love and hate" tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

Death or glory
Becomes just another story
Death or glory
Becomes just another story

And every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock and roll
Grabs the mic to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church

Death or glory
Becomes just another story
Death or glory
Becomes just another story

Oh, ah ah ah, ow, ow
Oh, ah ah ah, ow, ow
Oh, ah ah ah, ow, ow

Fear in the gun-sights, they say lie low
You say ok, don't wanna play the show
Now all you're thinking: "Was it death or glory now?"
Playing the blues for pennies sure looks better now

Death or glory
Just another story
Death or glory
Just another story

From every dingy basement, on every dingy street
Every dragging handclap over every dragging beat
It's just the beat of time, the beat that must go on
If you've been trying for years, we 'lready heard your song

Death or glory
Becomes just another story
Death or glory
Just another story

Gonna march a long way
Fight a long time
Got to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas

We're gonna fight you, brother
We're gonna fight till you lose
We're gonna raise trouble
We're gonna raise hell
We're gonna fight you, brother
Raise hell

Death or glory
Becomes just another story
Death or glory
Becomes just another story

Death or glory
Just another story
Death or glory
Becomes just another story
