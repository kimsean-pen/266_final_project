I've been there before, I never want to go back.
I try to forget, what it feels like to be unattached.
Always falling apart, barely hanging on to much.
Windows boarded up, left in the dark.
No where to be found, hideaway.
Left cold to the touch, don't find me.
I wanted it dark. I never let the light in.
Covered myself, hid from everything.
Well I was stuck, I never want to repeat.
I watch the ground, slowly give out beneath me.
Nobody care, find me nowhere.
