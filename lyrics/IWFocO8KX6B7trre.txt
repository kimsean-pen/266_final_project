Close your eyes and you will see micro flashing neon lights
Open your eyes and you will see it still looks like the same thing
Lie and wait for sleep and listen to your heart beat too fast for sleep

Close your eyes and you will see the sound-a-sleep
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go down, to go to sleep
Your frame of reference is my swimming pool
My, my swimming pool still looks like the China Sea

Pool to sea and finally the sound-a-sleep
Feel the muscles in your face twitch relax
Remembering everything that went down and will go down
I want to go down to sleep
Insomnia, no sleep, disease, pennies, parking, feed me please
Lie and wait for sleep and listen to your heart beat too fast for sleep
