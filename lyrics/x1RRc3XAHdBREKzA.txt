I'm up in the early morning,
Things are left unsaid
Lost friends are seeping into my head
I'm up in the early morning, miscommunicated
I don't want to be the one who cares too much
So now I wait. I wait.
For our reunion
I wait. I wait.
For our reunion
I'm so afraid of you
I feel sick in your presence
I'm so afraid of you
I don't remember how it got this bad

I wish that I was clever and owned my mind,
I'd change the world, I'd fly away,
I'd leave you behind
But I am here so put me out my misery
I want the answers to my questions
That I know are killing me, killing me
I'm so afraid of you it's quite the tragedy
I don't remember how it goes this bad
I know it's killing me, killing me

I'm so afraid of you,
I feel sick in your presence,
I'm so afraid of you,
I don't remember how it got this bad

You let me down
You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
And I'm afraid
I'm afraid!

You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
You let me down, You let me down
You let me down, I came undone
And I'm afraid
I'm afraid!
