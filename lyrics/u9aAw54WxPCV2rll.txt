In the land of my dreams
You're sweeter than ever before
In the land of my dreams
You love me so much more
I am over here so I'll stay, you'll never stay
If they could only be real (if they could only be real)
Instead of just in my head

In the land of this wonderful dream (wonderful dream)
I imagine you all so close
Telling all of the girls who love you to
You love me the most (love me the most)
And when you walk by, I start to laugh of dream and glow
Cause when I wanna be with you
I close my eyes and all way I go, go, go (the way I go)

In the land of my dreams
Where it's give and take
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your, give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
