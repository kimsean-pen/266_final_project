Do it, do it now
(Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it now)
Say it, say it now
(Say it, say it, say it
Say it, say it now) (x4)

Instead of carving
Up the wall
Why don't you open up
We talk
I am ready
I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving
Up the wall
Why don't you open up
We talk
We are ready
we are ready for the floor

I can't hear your voice
Do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance
You might take this dance
I can't hear your voice
Do I have a choice?
You sink in Bellow
i'm using my voice
You're my number one Guy

Instead of carving
Up the wall
Why don't you open up
We talk
I am ready
I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving
Up the wall
Why don't you open up
We talk
We are ready
we are ready for the floor

I can't hear your voice
Do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance
You might take this dance
I can't hear your voice
Do I have a choice?
You sink in Bellow
i'm using my voice
You're my number one Guy
