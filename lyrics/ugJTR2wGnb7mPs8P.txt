That was the message left outside
She only left it there to hide
I can't equate this all tonight
A frozen wasted heart has died

What has he done, lost the right one
For the feeling, oh the reeling
What has he done, lost the right one
For the feeling, oh the reeling

Because I was born into it
I have never lost my fluid
Some have passed and some have risen
I am wrapped in gold gift ribbons

Because I was born into it
I have never lost my fluid
Some have passed and some have risen
I am wrapped in gold gift ribbons

Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown

Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown

Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown

Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown
Love me like a clown

Days in go round the black city
Looking for love black city
Days don't go right black city
It's all around black city

Days in go round the black city
Looking for love black city
Days don't go right black city
It's all around black city

It's a funny situation, I do fall away
I do fall away, I do fall away
Talk is complication, you get carried away
You get carried away, I get carried away

Moving conversation
Throw your other hand
Throw your other hand
Throw your other hand

Too much communication, I'm another man
I'm another man
I'm your other man
No complications ahead
So, let's get out of bed now
Sky turns from pink into red
Let's make some gold out of lead now

So, kiss me forever
Love me on and on
You're making it better
Dancing on the lawn

No, that's what the demons said when they fled
No, and I can promise you, the demons are dead
No, that's what the demons said when they fled
No, and I can promise you, the demons are dead

So behave, young man, there is so much more to live for
Behave, young man, there is so much more to live for
Behave, young man, there is so much more to live for
Behave, young man, there is so much more to live for

So, kiss me forever
Love me on and on
You're making it better
Dancing on the lawn

So, kiss me forever
Love me all night long
This is together
I feel like a god

No, that's what the demons said when they fled
No, and I can promise you, the demons are dead
No, that's what the demons said when they fled
No, and I can promise you, the demons are dead

No
No
No, and I can promise you, the demons are dead
