There's a town where it's carved into the earth
Some are always singing "Ladadadada"
To keep from being heard
Well, I was born there
Right around this spot
Where the only thing you know is "Ladadadada"
Whether you like the song or not

You can find me in town
Any street
Wandering towards
The sound of your voice

You can find me on the street
Any town
Looking for you
Singing to myself

So if you're lonely
Just a face among the crowd
Well, the only thing you need is "Ladadadada"
You know I'll come around

You can find me in town
Any street
Wandering towards
The sound of your voice

You can find me on the street
Any town
Looking for you

Do you need a friend
Oh, do you need a friend?
Oh, do you need a friend?

Do you need a friend?

Ladadada
Ladadadada
Ladadadadada
Ladadadada
Whether you like the song or not
