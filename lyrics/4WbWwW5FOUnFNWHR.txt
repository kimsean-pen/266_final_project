Watching
Waiting
Distance
Decaying
Growing
Fading
I've been
Praying
Sleeping
Waking
Dreaming
Wasting
Giving
Taking
Quaking
Shaking

Please don't go

Be here right now

Think I'm gonna break right now
I just need a break right now
Every other day right now
I need you to stay right now
Feel it in my brain right now
Everyday l wake right now
Everything you said right now
Running through my head right now (Let me go)
Think I'm gonna break right now (Let me go)
I just need a break right now (Let me breathe)
Everything you said right now (Let me go)
I need you to stay right now (Let me breathe)
Feel it in my brain right now (Let me go)
Everyday l wake right now (Let me go)

Everything you said right now
Running through my head right now

Let me go
Let me go
Let me breathe
Let me go
