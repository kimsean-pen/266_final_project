Someone is smiling, someone cries
Whatever it is, it? s alright
Someone is born and someone dies
Something is holding the light

It's standing in the light now
Standing in the light now
Standing here right now for you

Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

It? s a beautiful day, the sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It? s a beautiful day and everyone says
The world's turning around for you

There is no need to be afraid
There is no need to deny
That everything is on its way
Life's going on in your mind

It's standing in the light now
Standing in the light now
Standing here right now for you

Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

It? s a beautiful day, the sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It? s a beautiful day and everyone says
The world's turning around for you

It's standing in the light now
Standing in the light now
Standing here right now for you

Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

It? s a beautiful day, the sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It? s a beautiful day and everyone says
The world's turning around for you
