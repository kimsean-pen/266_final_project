You say I'm always getting mad
I'm always such a drag
But I'm not like that
I know that I'm too hard to find
And I don't make time
And you're just like that

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
You just make me mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

I know that I still hear you 'round
I'll bring you down
And I'm just like that
You say that I'm too hard to find
And I don't make time
And you're just like that

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
You just make me mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

I know it's hard
I know it's hard and lonely
I know it's hard
I know it's hard and lonely

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
You just make me mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound

Hold me back
I don't wanna be a drag
You just make me mad
Turn me around
I don't wanna make a sound
