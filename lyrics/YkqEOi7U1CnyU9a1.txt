So hot
Out the box
Can we pick up the pace?
Turn it up,
Heat it up
I need to be entertained
Push the limit
Are you with it?
Baby, don't be afraid
I'm a hurt 'ya real good, baby

Let's go
It's my show
Baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz
That I'm gonna display
I told ya
I'm a hold ya down until you're amazed
Give it to ya 'til your screaming my name

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
Well I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

It's alright
You'll be fine
Baby, I'm in control
Take the pain
Take the pleasure
I'm the master of both
Close your eyes
Not your mind
Let me into your soul
I'm a work ya 'til your totally blown

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
Well I'm about to turn up the heat
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh oh, mm
Entertainment
Oh oh, oh entertainment
I'm here for your entertainment

Ooh
Do you like what you see?
Woah
Let me entertain ya 'till you scream

Oh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
Cause it's about to get rough for you
I'm here for your entertainment

Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet (bet ya thought)
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
Well I'm about to turn up the heat (turn up the heat)
I'm here for your entertainment
