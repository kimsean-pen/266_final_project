Symphony
She's only known as symphony
Melody, yeah
Crept, crept into the soul of me
Symphony, yeah
She's sort of like a song, she moves along
In perfect rhyme, oh la la
Right now feel perfect time, baby
You and me to slip away, slip away
Let our song begin to play
Yeah baby

Make me the one darling
Only one who know the bliss
Of knowing when to kiss
All the love of symphony, symphony

Like violins, music begins
It starts to swell, then I can tell
That pretty soon
We going to be in tune
Our hearts will be in perfect harmony

Symphony
Got my heart hit like a tender beat, boom, Boom
When you want me, send for me
Cha, cha
And I'll come and love you tenderly

Hey oh, I'll do the things girl
Oh making you feel that my love is for real for You
Symphony, symphony, oh
Do the thing makes you feel
That I love you darling
