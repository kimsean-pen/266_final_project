I wish I was good enought to hold my own hand
I am lost, I am found
Wish I could balance myself out
I'm a sunset with no one around to look at me
Somebody look at me
My age is going to waste
My love is starting to decay
People never stay why do people never stay?

And I wonder what it's like to have a different state of mind
Yeah, I wonder what it's ike having a different state of mind to mine
People are like ornaments in shops I can't afford
So when I observe them in their whim, all the beauty and the sin
I keep my hands in, to myself, I don't touch
I don't love, I don't trust, I don't get around too much
(I don't love, I don't trust, I don't get around too much)

I wish I could hold a steady gaze and conversation
I am many, I am one
I wish I could recognise a face when I'm in one
Always loading like a shotgun
Look at me, somebody look at me
My soul is going to waste
My heart is starting to decay
People never stay, why do people never stay?

And I wonder what it's like to have a different state of mind
Yeah, I wonder what it's like having a different state of mind to mine
People are like ornaments in shops I can't afford
So when I observe them in their whim, all the beauty and the sin
I keep my hands in, to myself, I don't touch
I don't love, I don't trust, I don't get around too much

Wish I was lighter, wish I could save myself
I'm a kaleidoscope, of animal urge, human hope
Oscillating, a solid gradient
I'm patiently waiting for a stranger to break these walls
