I've thought about it every day now
Taking you for granted, it's going to change now
I can't believe I left you up waiting
Will you forgive me although I've forsaken
All of you?
All of you?
All of you?

Here's to you, dear
Let's do what you want to
Put my mind downstairs, let's go
For a ride
Look into the mirror while I drink your nectar
A couple days later it's never felt better
All of you
All of you
All of you
