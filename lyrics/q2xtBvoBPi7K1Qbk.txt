One, Two, One, Two, Three
I wanna be (naked)
(Naked)

I got a, I got a five star dinner for ya
I drove a, I drove a, a brand new 'cedes for ya
Red rover, red rover, I bring them kisses over
The vibes are getting insane
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to be real classy for ya
No lying, no lying, I got real feelings for ya
This clothing, this clothing is turning into torture
Got one thing left on my brain

I wanna be naked with you
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be

Natural, natural, there's nothing dirty 'bout it
Masterful, masterful, keep putting pressure on it
True loving, true loving, I think I finally founded
The vibes are getting insane, hey
I haven't been so alive, since the past life
I swear to God, you were mine in a past life

I wanna be naked with you
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be naked with you

I haven't been so alive, since the past life
I wanna be
I swear to God, you were mine in a past life
I wanna be
I wanna be naked with you
Naked with you

I wanna be naked with you (naked)
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you (naked)
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you (naked)
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you (naked)
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be
I wanna be (naked)
I wanna be naked with you
