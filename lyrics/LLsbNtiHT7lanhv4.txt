Pinpoint the moves
New set of rules
She said, "I love you not"
I broke the flowerpot
I saw the news
One thing to do
I drive to our old spot
And ask for one last shot

Turn up the, turn up the dial
I'm feeling wild
It's been a long night
I need a valium
Turn up the, turn up the dial
I'm feeling wild
It's been a long night
Oh, I need a

Bar light
See me pulling up feeling alright
See me going far when I'm alright
See me going left when I go right
Oh friend of mine
Bar light
See me drink it up, feeling alright
Tired of the fights and the long nights
I'm about to get in my own vibe all night, oh

Turn the light on
Turn the light on
Turn the light on

Pay coin for brews
No stressing you
I drown the ugly thoughts
Beneath the whisky drops
I saw your crew
Nothing to prove
I'm not the one that's lost
They call for one last shot

Turn up the, turn up the dial
I'm feeling wild
It's been a long night
I need a valium
Turn up the, turn up the dial
I'm feeling wild
It's been a long night
Oh, I need a

Bar light
See me pulling up feeling alright
See me going far when I'm alright
See me going left when I go right
Oh friend of mine
Bar light
See me drink it up, feeling alright
Tired of the fights and the long nights
I'm about to get in my own vibe all night, oh

Turn the light on
Turn the light on
Turn the light on
Turn the light on
Turn the light on
Turn the light on

Your point of view, you text it
Send one back, you left it read-less
Borderline obsessive
Messing with my head like this
I told you that when I left Texas
I'd do things the way I said them
Why can't I have any lessons
That don't end like this?

So it's bar light
See me pulling up feeling alright
See me going far when I'm alright
See me going left when I go right
Oh friend of mine
Bar light
See me drink it up, feeling alright
Tired of the fights and the long nights
I'm about to get in my own vibe all night, oh

Bar light
See me pulling up feeling alright
See me going far when I'm alright
See me going left when I go right
Oh friend of mine
Bar light
See me drink it up, feeling alright
Tired of the fights and the long nights
I'm about to get in my own vibe all night, oh
