You must have heard
That voice loud and plain
Through all the thunder I surrounded you in
And I once had cause

And I once had strength
But I have been selfish
To say the least
I owned up to it

Though leaving is a curious way
For you to love me
So my life and my whole waiting guilt
I enclose late with my dues to you

Love leaves its abusers
Love leaves its abusers
Love leaves its abusers
Love leaves its abusers
Love.
