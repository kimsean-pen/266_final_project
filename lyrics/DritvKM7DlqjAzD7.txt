If we are one big happy family
No one would have to beg to eat
If we live in a world of dignity
No man would have to live on the street

If I tell you you're a part of me
There's no need for disbelief
Here is my hand to let you know
That what we dream we all can hold
Apart we are weak together we're strong

Oh, people we are writing this song
We're all living these words together forever
There's no reason, we can't live and be one
Build the world that we want together
For as long as you stand here by me, we'll live on

Think of all the possibilities that the eyes of a child can see
Think of all the opportunities that float right by you and me
Take my hand and we will know
All that we dream we our own
Apart we are weak together we're strong

Oh, people we are writing this song
We're all living these words together forever
There's no reason, we can't live and be one
Build the world that we want together
For as long as you stand here by me, we'll live on

Oh, people we are writing this song
We're all living these words together forever
There's no reason oh no, we can't live and be one
Yes I want to think, think, think

Oh, people, people, people, I said, you said
Think of all the possibilities that the eyes of a child can see
Think of all the opportunities that float right by you and me
There's a room for us all
Oh, it's a big world we can live together
