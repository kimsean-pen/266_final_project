Long drive, tongue tied, its weird being home.
Lets get breakfast, I'll pack you a bowl.
Text threats, old girlfriends, it barely hurts
But ghost eyes on old friends is making it worse.

Brave the handshake, drag through the small talk
It takes guts to be so fake, oh well whatever
I'm getting good at losing contact, I can tell by your face
Borrowed my best thoughts, stole all my good luck
Now I'm in a better place, or am I?
Lets just get breakfast, make it all go away.
