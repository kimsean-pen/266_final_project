Dont ever say you're lonely
Just lay your problems on me
And i'll be waiting there for you
The stars can be so blinding
When you get tired of fighting

You know the one you can look to
When the vision you have gets blurry
You dont have to worry
I'll be your eyes

It's the least I can do, cause when I fell
You pulled me through
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you

I know it's been a long night
But now im here it's alright
I've done my walking in your shoes

We'll take each step together
Til you come back to center
You know that I know the real you

And when the vision you have gets blurry
You dont have to worry
I'll be your eyes

That's the least I can do, cause when I fell
You pulled me through
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you

Like you've been running for hours
And can't catch your breath
The demons are screaming
So loud in your head
You're tired you're broken
You're cut and you're bruised
But nothing's too heavy just hold on, I'll carry you
I'll carry you
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
So you know that
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
I'll carry you
