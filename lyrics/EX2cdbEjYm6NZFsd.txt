Even as your darkness comes to life
I'll see you in the early morning light
Even as our hearts, they ebb and flow
Never did I dance with you so slow
Slow

So even as the darkness comes to light
I'll stand out in the dawn right by your side
Even though I can't pretend to know
Never have I danced with you so slow

And even though you can't help letting go
Like swallowing the tears before they show
And although I'll never ever know
Baby I will dance with you so slow
Oh yeah

All the things we had, we gave away
Dancing to our pulses as they fade
Slower, hand in hand
But can't you feel the same things I can?

Lined upside down
This has now happened as you fell
Raise your voice til I can't hear no sound
Til it's close enough to touch

All the things we had, we gave away
Dancing to our pulses as they fade
Slower, hand in hand
But can't you feel the same things I can?

All the things we had, we gave away
Dancing to our pulses as they fade
Closer to the end
But can't you feel the same things I can?
Can't you feel the same things I can?
