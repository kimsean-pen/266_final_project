Ohhh...
Ohhh...

It's starting to rain again.
Everything's gone now.
Even the sun.
It's starting to rain again.
Don't go away.
What have I done?
Hmmm...
I've been high and I've been low.
I've been wealthy and I've been poor.
I don't know much.
But one thing I know, this ain't no fun.
Hmmm...

Sometimes I wish that I can stand here and fade away.
(Sometimes)
Ohh...
So that no one could see the tears running down my face.
(Sometimes)
Oh, invisibility would be great.

I painted a picture with her in his arms.
Hmmm...
It's starting to rain again.
It's all in my mind.
He's done me no harm.
Hmmm...
I've been up and I've been down.
Through all my drama, he's still around.
I can't believe that even now I put us through the storm.
Ohhh...

Sometimes I wish that I can stand here and fade away.
(Sometimes)
Ohhh...
So that no one could see the tears running down my face.
(Sometimes)
Oh, invisibility would be great.

Couldn't look at myself in the mirror.
Asking myself "How dumb could you be?"
Maybe everything would be much clearer if no one could see me.
Hmmm...
Ohhh...
Oh, invisibility would be great.
Ohhh...

Sometimes I wish that I can stand here and fade away.
(Sometimes)
Ohhh...
So that no one could see the tears running down my face.
(Sometimes)
Hey, hey.
Sometimes I wish that I can stand here and fade away.
(Sometimes)
Ohhh...
So that no one could see the tears running down my face.
(Sometimes)
Invisibility would be great.
