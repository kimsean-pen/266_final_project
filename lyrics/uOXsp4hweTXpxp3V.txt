I woke up in new york city
From my sleep behind the wheel
Caught a train to poughkeepsie
And time stood still

She wrote me a letter from san diego
To qualify her luck
These flights connect through arizona
But I think I'll stay stuck

So here I am
Here I am
Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car

I met a girl who kept tattoos for homes
That she had loved
If I were her I'd paint my body
Until all my skin was gone

She wrote me a letter as we passed through rockford
She said she won't forget
Maybe I do maybe I don't
But I know I haven't yet

So here I am
Here I am
Well I woke up in a car
I traced a way to fall
So I could see the mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car

And maybe I could live forever
If that ever I had known
That you'd be waiting there whenever I'm alone

But here I am
Well I woke up in a car
I traced a way to fall
So I could see the mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys

Well I woke up in a car
I traced a way to fall
So I could see the mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
