Deep cuts in the dark
Emptiness is sharp
Why am I still here?

Happened from the start
Scars across my heart
I have no more fear

There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
From the pain that you have deep inside
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
This world is a game
Will you survive?

Spirits bring the ghosts
They know me the most
But are they still here?

Searching for the art
Always fall apart
I have no more tears

There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
From the pain that you have deep inside
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
This world is a game
Will you survive?

The world is turning
Keeps on burning
Beware of the things in your head
