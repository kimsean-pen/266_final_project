Trouble comes upon us all
Leaves little to the imagination
Send me back
Heart attack
Doesn't take long to remember
A funny howl
We wait somehow
In that place between now or never
Looking on
I might be wrong
In my head, I feel safe for the never

Where are you gonna go from this
Got nothing to show for it
Don't even try
Where no one knows ya'

In the valley of the shadow
Where no other people dare to go
But it's nice down here
The colours are so clear
Where no one knows your name
Where no one knows your name
Where no one knows your name

Where are you gonna go from this
Got nothing for it
Don't even try
Where no one knows your name

Where you gonna go from this
Got nothing to show for it
But don't even try
Where no one knows ya'
