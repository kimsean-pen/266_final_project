Ooh, ooh, ooh

I slip softly through
All my dreams my dear they are of
You (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I slip softly through
All my dreams my dear they are of
You (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Even if your heart stops
I'll be there to hold you up
Even as the world turns
I'll be there to watch the fire burn
Burn us both alive

I slip softly through
All I've waited for my dear is
You (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I slip softly through
Settling, my dear, till I found
You (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Even if your heart stops
I'll be there to hold you up
Even as the world turns
I'll be there to watch the fire burn
Burn us both alive

Time can over-complicate
But darling I refuse to wait
There's no way of planning
For the fall
All your paths will fade away
Questions read by years in pain
I can be the answer to it all

Even if your heart stops
I'll be there to hold you up
Even as the world turns
I'll be there to watch the fire burn
Burn us both alive

It'll burn
Burn us both alive
It'll burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn us both alive
