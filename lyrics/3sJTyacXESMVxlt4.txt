Everything has a beginning
Everything comes to an end
Take it or leave it
You better believe it
Be my lover, be my friend
Try to deny
What you're feeling
And you know
That your heart
Will say no
Love will last longer
Growing stronger
And stronger
If you stay
And don't let go

Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Heaven and earth
Keep colliding
But we love on a world
Of it's own
Oh, there you can fake it
Just make it or break it
Only you can find the one

Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Oh, survive
Heroes

Can live on their own
But heroes
Never die alone

Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
Oh, taking the fight
Is the life of a hero
Staying alive
This is a story of love
And compassion
Only heroes can tell
Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive

Oh, out on the line
Like a star, like a hero
Love will survive
