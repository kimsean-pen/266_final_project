I would have given you all of my heart
but there's someone who's torn it apart
and he's takin' just all that I had
but if you wanna try to love again
baby I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest baby I know
the first cut is the deepest
but when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
when it comes to loving me he's worst

I still want you by my side
just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
and I'm sure gonna give you a try
but if you wanna try to love again try
baby I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest baby I know
the first cut is the deepest
but when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
but when it comes to loving me he's worst

I still want you by my side
just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
but I'm sure gonna give you a try
'cause if you wanna try to love again
baby I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest baby I know
the first cut is the deepest
when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
when it comes to loving me he's worst

The first cut is the deepest baby I know
the first cut is the deepest try to love again
