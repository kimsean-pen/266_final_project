Last night you slept, you slept in fits
You smashed your windows bit by bit
You cried out - a bad dream
Horror pictures - what a scene!
Which way will things go tonight
Toss and turn or sleep tight
You can't win you wonder why
That sleep is one thing you can't buy You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep Downed that pill hours ago
And time is passing oh so slow
Watch the clock - you're waiting
It's five o'clock and the world is waking That's the way things went tonight
Tossed and turned though you were tight
Exhaustion brings on desperation
Well there's still some consolation You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
You can't walk in your sleep
If you can't sleep
