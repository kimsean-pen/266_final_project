You look so different
You look like somebody else
It hurts so much
Knowing that I couldn't help
Remove the part of me
Inside my own living hell
I look so different
I look so different

Inside my own living hell
Inside my own living hell
It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
Inside my own living hell
I can't recognize myself
I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself

You look so different
You look like somebody else
It hurts so much
And knowing that I couldn't help
Remove the part of me
Inside my own living hell
I look so different
I look so different
Inside my own living hell
It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself
Inside my own living hell

It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself
I can't recognize myself
