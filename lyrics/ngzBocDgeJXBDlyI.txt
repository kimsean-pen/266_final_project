I've been sizin' you up and stuff
Watchin' you live life large
Big enough for the both of us
To big up the love
Got the measure of the man in you
It's more than the sum of the boys it's true
What they say
You gotta big up the love

I was checkin' nice things you do
Standing in the Starbucks queue
You buy coffee for a stranger
Who's down on their luck
Random acts of kindness flow
Compassion from a hand
I'd like to hold
It does it for me
And I can't get enough

Oh
Don't confuse me when I say
Oh
Please don't take this the wrong way
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small
'Cause

Size matters
(Size matters)
But not how you think
I'm talkin' 'bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant
The more flowers will grow
So
Big up the love
Till it overflows

Most brooks too shallow to swim in
Only interested in one thing
It's all so meaningless
'Cause puddles dry up
A view of the world so small it limits
The size of the dream
And you achieving it
A new panorama
With your arms around me
I see my life
How it should be

You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small
'Cause

Size matters
(Size matters)
But not how you think
I'm talkin' 'bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant
The more flowers will grow
So
Big up the love
Till it overflows
Big up the love
Big up the love
Till it overflows

Big it up
Big it up
Big it up
Big it up
When size matters
Big it up
Big it up
Big up the love
Big it up
Big it up

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small

When size matters
Size matters
But not how you think
No no no
I'm talkin' 'bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant
The more flowers will grow
So
Big up the love
Big up the love
Till it overflows
Big up the love
Big up the love
Till it overflows

Big it up
Big it up
Big it up
Big it up

It's the little things you do
That show me how big you are
So
Big up the love
Till it overflows
