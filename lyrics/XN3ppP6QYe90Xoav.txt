Never said you'd promise anything
Never told to trust you blindly
Never thought you'd hurt me either

Never had a chance
Now ain't that so
Never should've wept
When you let go
Never thought
You'd push me away

Sad as it may be
I'm glad it's over finally
Speaks volumes of me
When letting go is never easy

So I'll seek you out
Just to find myself
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
I'll hear you out
'Till I hear myself
Hear myself in you

Never knew if we were really true
Never thought I'd ever get to you
Never thought I'd end up like this

Never was I stronger than I'm now
Never felt this much a fool somehow
Never had much thought for myself

Sad as it may be
I'm glad it's over finally
It speaks volumes of me
When letting go is never easy

So I'll seek you out
Just to find myself
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
I'll hear you out
'Till I hear myself
Hear myself in you

I'll seek you out
Just to find myself
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
I'll hear you out
'Till I hear myself
I hear myself in you

I'll seek you out
Just to find myself
And I'll worry 'bout consequences later
I'll hear you out
'Till I hear myself
Hear myself in you

Never knew if we were really true
Never thought I'd ever get to you
Never thought I'd end up like this

Never said you'd promise anything
Never told to trust you blindly
Never thought you'd hurt me either
