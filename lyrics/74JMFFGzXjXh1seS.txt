I stand accused, just like you
For being born without a silver spoon
Stood at the top of the hill over my town
I was found

I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home on my bed too long
Got my things and now I'm gone
How's the world gonna take me?

Finding myself used to be hard
But now I see the light
If love is a drug
Then I don't need it
I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home on my bed too long
Now it's time to hear my song
How you're gonna take it?

I've been on the shelf too long
Played the words without the song
If ever I had a way to go
Tell me now I'll take it

I've been on the shelf too long
I've been on the shelf too long
I've been on the shelf too long

Come and I'm gone - Come on, come on, come on outside
Come and I'm gone - We've got a lot of living to do
I come and I'm gone - There's a door in my mind that's open wide, come inside
I come and I'm gone - come inside
I come and I'm gone - come inside
I come and I'm gone - come inside
I come and I'm gone - come inside

Jesus never saved me
He'll never save you too, and you know, know right now!
I've got a little sticker on the back of my boot - this is music
This is music - finding myself used to be hard, hard, harder than it's ever been
This is music - And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes
This is music - If love is the drug then it ain't for me
This is music - Well music is my life and loved by me
This is music - I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing
This is music - Down down down we go until I reach the bottom of my soul

This is music
