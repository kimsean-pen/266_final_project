Is there something I don? t know?
Are there secrets you won? t show?
Even after all this time,
You cheat on me, pretend we? re fine
You know I can? t stand you anymore

Every single moment I was there for you
All you ever did was be untrue.

Oops, you? re gone
Just play your games with someone else
I? m done
With you and your lies
You? re so wrong
To make me cry
This is the last goodbye

Oops, you? re gone
Just play your games with someone else
I? m done
With you and your lies
You? re so wrong
To make me cry
This is the last goodbye

I was young and so naive

Boy you led me to believe
We would stand the test of time,
You said you? d be forever mine
Just give me your key before you leave

Every single moment I was there for you
All you ever did was be untrue.

Oops, you? re gone
Just play your games with someone else
I? m done
With you and your lies
You? re so wrong
To make me cry
This is the last goodbye

Oops, you? re gone
Just play your games with someone else
I? m done
With you and your lies
You? re so wrong
To make me cry
This is the last goodbye
