I can feel it deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night
I got to move it
This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright

Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son

No good fighting
World, we're out of captains
Everyone just wants a better life
They tried to kill us
Love to say they feel us
But they won't take my pride

Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son
