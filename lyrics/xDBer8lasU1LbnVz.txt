This is for the times I don't want to forget
To anyone who has a bitter regret
For the ones who ever call me a fake
I bit my tongue for your sake
Keep me strong for holding on
Keep us together after we're gone
I know our struggle is distance and pace
We learnt that in the choice we made
My home, made by the people surrounding me
Our place, our everything

I know, there's people in the places I've been
Who I know, I'll never find again
I know, there's people in the places I've been
Who I know, I'll never find again

I'll never find again
I'll never find again
I'll never find again
I'll never find again

Until the end of me, our dying day
Our place of rest in a silent grave
The life I lead the greed I've seen
The pain alive in the honesty

I know, there's people in the places I've been
Who I know, I'll never find again
I know, there's people in the places I've been
Who I know, I'll never find again

This is for the times I'll never forget
For the memories we pour down our necks
For the ones who take our name after us
For the pain we call love
Our homes are broken by bottles and bones
And those who don't have strength to go on
Our homes are broken by bottles and bones
And those who don't have strength to go on

We are five amongst the rest
Lay the six across our chest
The seven hills we keep within
Under our skin from start to end

We are five amongst the rest
Lay the six across our chest
The seven hills we keep within
Under our skin from start to end
