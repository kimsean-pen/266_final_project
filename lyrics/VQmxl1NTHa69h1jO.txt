I believe in miracles
'Cause it's a miracle I'm here
Guess you could call me spiritual
'Cause physical is fear

And it's safe to say the storms gone away
And I'm dancing on the morning after
Yes I'd love to stay, but my home is the other way
And I miss the love and laughter

Something like flying
Hard to describe it
My God, I'm breathing underwater
Something like freedom, freedom
My God, I'm breathing underwater

Every moon and every star
Knows who you are, you know
So ever if it gets too dark
You never are alone

And it's safe to say we surrendered a day
To pay back all the love you borrowed
And hope that I had survived yesterday
And today is jealous of tomorrow

Something like flying
Hard to describe it
My God, I'm breathing underwater
Something like freedom, freedom
My God, I'm breathing underwater

Something like flying
Hard to describe it
My God, I'm breathing underwater
Something like freedom, freedom
My God, I'm breathing underwater
Something like flying

Hard to describe it
My God, I'm breathing underwater
Something like freedom, freedom
My God, I'm breathing underwater
