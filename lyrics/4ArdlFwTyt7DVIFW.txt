When your hands have been tied
From front, back and from side to side
It's hard to see the shape of things to come
And the past becomes undone
No stars aligned to lead the blind
When your future is already declined

Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to
Burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and
Waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

If that is the life you choose
No circumstance can excuse
Why you run when you've passed
A dead end sign at long last
The days are numbered you swear
So you can start the countdown for all I care
Keep on telling yourself
There's nothing left to do
Your story's weak and so are you

Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to
Burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and
Waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to
Burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and
Waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away
