With fists raised high in tightened knots
the room explodes and now this blood is on your hands
and there's no time for a second chance
to paint my face with blood and tears and cover up
An open book that no one reads
A misspelled word that no one knows

You stole the rain
and then you turned around and tore my life in two
Just like the picture
that once hung on the wall in the room that we used to share

So fold me up, and put me back in the place
where you used to keep your heart
You think its getting smaller
Its been that way for quite some time now

Cadence beats down on the tar
it sounds the same as your fists raining down
We've got to leave before the sun sets
(If you wanted to change the way I look at you...)
Or maybe we don't have time, time to waste
It won't be long, it wont be long you know before your gone
(It won't be long before your gone)
Into the night
You won't have time
(if you wanted to change the way I look at you...)
To paint my face with cover up
