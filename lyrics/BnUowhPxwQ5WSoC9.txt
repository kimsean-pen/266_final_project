I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?
I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?

He was gifted like olympic man in ninety man
[?], chariots, I throw away the talisman
[?] talented
Me I was the counter, she was all about the camera
Snap, snap, snap
Now it's rap, rap, rap
Now it's trips overseas
Now it's make it out the trap
Everything you promise I'll confident and pack
Like your bag when you packaging your plastic in the back
See where we first met, love isn't like slow-sex
Love is turn friends so that Ludacris and new set
We was gonna make another drug, skip the best to first
All that damn blow, you need a new nose
And don't you just

Hate it when I call (See)
Hate it when you don't leave (Leave)
Love it when I bring (Weed)
Love it when I tell (Dream)
The fuck is going on?
All these time drugs and you ain't really in my songs

I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?
I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?

She was assisted, my apendix spoke tongues
Speaking with an accent like I really wanna fuck
Skipping out that that study hall and pussy on my mental
The grass ain't really green, I'm blowing trees and no parental
To be from the stoops no one left then I scoot
My actions are alluring to the women that I choose
I'm black like the moon I hope you glisten over sky
You're the junkies that you serving, only happy when you lie
Or the product isn't working over some instruementals
So the belly of the beast was never juicy so I fly
I talked a lot of game until the cat caught my tongue
Something in my medicine was brutal, so be gone

Hate it when I call (See)
Hate it when you don't leave (Leave)
Love it when I bring (Weed)
Love it when I tell (Dream)
The fuck is going on?
All these damn drugs in all day long

I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?
I got all the drugs
I got all the weed
I got all the blow
Baby, what you need?
