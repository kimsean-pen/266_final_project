Feel my pulse pick up with every building that's built
Haven't we all felt a little in between before?

What remains?
Every corner, a new name

Rolled a three-sided die high above the phone line
She says, "Don't be so cynical. This might all be a miracle"

All I want is to see you comfortable
In your own skin
In your own way

You come up for air and they're gone
A letter nailed to the door
And you've learned to live with that
It's how you learned to live

What remains?
Every corner, a new name
What remains?
Yeah, you'd burn it down, too
