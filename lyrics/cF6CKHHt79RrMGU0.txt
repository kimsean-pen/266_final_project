Want you gone for good
Ever since you ran me off the road
Lost my confidence, a little bit
When my car spinned out control
See the glass fall into my lap
Body layin' in the grass
Hit an oak tree then my head hit the dash
You stop me in my tracks
Oh, well

You and me
We're both a little different
Straight C's and we've both been spending
Mom's car was the only one driven around this small city
Yeah, yeah
And when my dad I wasn't living with
Always upset screamin' at me
That's what happened when you look at him
You wiped my tears off when we first met
Damn

I know there's something that we both shared
That no one around here does
No one really cares as much as we do
And now that school's out
Nothing ruled out
In a field, but it's getting late now
But we both layed down, stayed out
That's what we did all summer, lover

Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
You make me so happy
Now

And time don't fly, it accelerate
Suicide to decide on my better days
Mom gave me thirty days for me to get out
Went to my friend's house, fell asleep on his couch
Think the world might end, see the sky turn red
Neighbor house on fire, she was pulled out dead
I remember goin' over there to help her move in
Hadn't seen her since, maybe I shoulda stopped by
Lot of fireworks with your V-cars
Window by the bed, while we free fall, see stars
I'll just smoke in the basement
And we were both wishin' we taped it
You never know who could make you this happy
Awkward silence, then the two people laughing
It happens
They're so lucky to have it
Said I'm lucky to have it (you)

[?] from what he's coming from
Watch you move, fast [?]
No doubt, I'm fallin' now

Want you gone for good
Ever since you ran me off the road
Lost my confidence, little bit
When my car spinned out control
See the glass fall to my lap
Body layin' in the grass
Hit an oak tree then my head hit the dash
You stopped me in my tracks
Oh, well

Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well
You make me so happy
Now
