I'm pretty deep, sinking in a shallow end
Scotch and sun, given a lesson learned
Stupid phone, friends since in the afternoon
I'm pretty deep, sinking in a shallow end
Scotch and sun, given a lesson learned
Stupid phone, friends since in the afternoon
Riding bikes through the docs from the avenue
Smoking some, gonna get a little bit
Sunshine bursts, how's your cute cousin yet?
Still too young, what time's it anyways
Black tops sweat, our eighteen hour holiday

Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
Let the night fall!
Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
Let the night fall!

You're on top now we're all piled in
My backup cars driven by someone we
Kind of know, we'll all look at this one is
Picture of us, look at this picture of us
Yeah there's so much love, there's something I'm not seeing
I'm not sure what, I'm not sure we would go on

Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Yeah we'll be smoking some, gonna get a little bit
Sunshine bursts, how's your cute cousin yet?
Still too young, what time's it anyways
Black tops sweat, our 18 hour holiday

Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
Let the night fall!
Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
Let the night fall!
Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
Let the night fall!
Yeah, we step it up when the sun goes down
Let the night fall, let the night fall
No matter what, we're not stopping now
