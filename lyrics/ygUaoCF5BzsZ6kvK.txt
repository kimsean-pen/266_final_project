Don't do as I have done
Win where I have lost
Have where I have none

Don't let your demons drive
They'll just steer you wrong
You wont get out alive

Cause you can't un-live the pain
You cant rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place, in the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes

From living fast and dying young
I hope the best has yet to come in the time that remains for you
Don't get me wrong
The mistakes I've made along the way

Made me who I am today
The time is gonna come
You will wake up and realize just how fast your life goes by

Cause you can't un-live the pain
You cant rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place, in the time that remains

So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best has yet to come in the time that remains for you
'Cause you can't un-live the pain

You cant rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place, in the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best has yet to come in the time that remains for you
The time that remains for you
For you
The time that remains
The time that remains
