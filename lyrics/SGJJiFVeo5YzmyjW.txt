Lily, my one and only -- I can hardly wait 'til I see her.
Silly, I know I'm silly cause I'm hanging in this tree,
In the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me.

And thru her window shade, I watch her shadow move.
I wonder if she...

Lily, my one and only -- love is in my heart and in your eyes.
Will she or won't she want him, no one knows for sure,
But an officer is knocking at my door.

And thru her window shade, I watch her shadow move.
I wonder if she could only see me?

And when I'm with her, I feel fine.
If I could kiss her, I wouldn't mind the time it took to find my Lily,
My one and only -- I can hardly wait till I see her.
Oh, Lily, I know you love me 'cause as they're dragging me away,
I swear I saw her raise her hand and wave goodbye.
