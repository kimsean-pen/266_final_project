What started as a whisper
Slowly turned into a scream
Searching for an answer
Where the question is unseen

I don't know where you came from
And I don't know where you've gone
Old friends become old strangers
Between the darkness and the dawn

Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the place within?
To live my life without you

I still hear you sayin'
"All of life is chance
And is sweetest
It is sweetest when at a glance"

But I live
I live a hundred, hundred lifetimes in a day
But I die a little
In every breath that I take

Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the place within?
To live my life without you

I listen to a whisper
Slowly drift away
Silence is the loudest
Parting word you never say

I put, I put your world
Into my veins
And now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains

Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the place within?
To live my life without you

Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the place within?
Amen, omen, will I see your face again?

Amen, omen, can I find the strength within?
Amen, omen, can I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the place within?

Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen, can I find the strength within?
Amen, omen, will I see your face again?
Amen, omen
