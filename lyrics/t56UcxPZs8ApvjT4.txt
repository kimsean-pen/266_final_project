Oh, joys arise, the sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you out here

And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space, out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Those are the shadows far away

The falling of the whole empire, it's here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sinks

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Will it spin? Will it soar?
My little dream working the machine

Soothe like a wave
And crash far
Closing in on the moon
And who we are

Little memories
Your little feet working the machine
Will it spin? Will it soar?
My little dream working the machine

Soothe like a wave
And crash far
Closing in on the moon
And who we are
