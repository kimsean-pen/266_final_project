If i was bold
and did what i wanted
would there be
enough left of me
or fall to my death
if i was brave
and did let go
would i insist
if i was gallant
would i stand up
to your tyranny

If i was daring
lived my life living
would i live up to your standing
If i was daring
lived my life living
would i live up to your standing
