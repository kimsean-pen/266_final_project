Where are you, my long lost love?
It feels like yesterday has parted
I held you closest to my thrusting heart
Now the withdrawal seems to be starting

You're not like anyone I've known
With you, I flourish into greatness
Extend my arms into immense delight
Making my future vast and weightless

Quite an undertaking of fair promises, I stopped hearing you crow
Quite an understatement when harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

I should have kept you safe
Shielded from a Trojan war

Where are you, my partisan?
The last I saw of you was sinking
Into a giant hole of nothingness
As my desire started shrinking

Or if I choose to take you back
If I stand up for my believing (if you can steal me while I laugh)
Can we make up for all the joy we lack? (it was the motion you were breaking)
Can we start giving and receiving? (what is the purpose of me giving?)

Quite an undertaking of fair promises, I stopped hearing you crow
Quite an understatement when harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

Where are you, my long lost love?
It feels like yesterday has parted
