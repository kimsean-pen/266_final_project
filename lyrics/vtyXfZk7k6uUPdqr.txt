I'm not a betting man
If i was i'd have my money on the mule
From my lips to your ringing ears
Cut the screen and open wide
As you bask in the sun
You never complain
No

You just pass the plate around
I'm not a betting man
If i was i'd have my money on the mule

Bad taste
Panting like a dog
Fucked before the getting's real good

From my lips
To your ringing ears
Better buy it a drink
And pass the plate around
Im not a betting man
If I was I'd have my money on the mule
