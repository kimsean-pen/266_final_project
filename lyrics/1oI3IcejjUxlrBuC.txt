Lately, I've been tryna fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through, I gotta stick with you, my baby

Baby tell me, maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just too close to the heart
And I won't stand it, if we're broken apart

Do you hear me?
Baby ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got ya back now

When the chips are down
And it seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I'm by your side, there ain't no if, buts or maybe's
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby

We've been cutting it close with the backwards and forwards
It's rocking the boat, we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever

And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing, so give us a chance

Do you hear me?
Baby ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got ya back now

When the chips are down
And it seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I'm by your side, there ain't no if, buts or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby

Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that, I just can't hear that (no)

And know wherever you wanna take me I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me, just tell me you hear me

Do you hear me?
Baby ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got ya back now
When the chips are down
And it seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I'm by your side, there ain't no if, buts or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby
