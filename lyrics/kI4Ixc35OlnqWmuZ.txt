Rushing in and out, and in and out of my mind (I'm out of my mind)*
We live and obey with some kind of hate.
Dreading the time to come when we've got no time at all.
I want to take the time to stop and think
About doing this, and what it might mean to be.
When I close my eyes, there's nothing but darkness revealed.
It's right there in front of me.
Looking forward for a taste of things to come.
I can't see familiar faces on anyone.
Life is trying to pass me by,
But not this time. I am not afraid.
You're not getting older; you're just getting old.
And your finish wears thin as your stories get told.
Yet you've somehow impressed her; she's already sold.
The one page in your book that's still shining in gold says,
"Wishing for the years to flash by
Has left me blind.
I'm waiting for the few fleeting moments
Where the world makes sense to me."
About doing this, and what it might mean to be.
When I close my eyes, there's nothing but darkness revealed.
It's right there in front of me.
Looking forward for a taste of things to come.
I can't see familiar faces on anyone.
Life is trying to pass me by,
But not this time. I am not afraid.
I am not afraid.
My search continues for a taste of things to come.
I can't see familiar faces on anyone.
Life is trying its best to pass by,
But not this time. I am not afraid.
(I am not afraid.)
["Time is a funny thing.
You spend the first part of your life wanting it to just speed up,
And the rest of your life wishing it would slow down.
Chrono is about taking a step back,
And making the most of the time you can control; right now."]
