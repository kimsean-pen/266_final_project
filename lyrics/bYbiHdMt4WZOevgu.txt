You were faster than me,
You were better than me,
I was too careful and weak,
It had to be you,
And I pushed myself,
Beyond the resolve,
Just so I could try,
To make you relive it,
But you were faster than me,
You were better than me,
I was too careful and weak,
It had to be you.

Take me home, in my dream you said that you loved me.

I am your perfect.

Of course I'm a child,
Only we have the capacity,
To stand in single file,
And follow you,
Of course I'm a child,
Only we have the capacity,
To stand in single file,
Regardless of the truth.

Take me home, in my dream you said that you loved me.

I am your perfect.
