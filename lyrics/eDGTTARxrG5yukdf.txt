FATES
Why the struggle, why the strain?
Why make trouble? Why make scenes?
Why go against the grain?
Why swim upstream?
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't no use
You're bound
You're bound
You're bound to lose
What's done
What's done
What's done is done
That's the way the river runs
So why get wet? Why break a sweat?
Why waste your precious breath?
Why beat your handsome brow?
Nothing changes
Nothing changes
Nothing changes anyhow
