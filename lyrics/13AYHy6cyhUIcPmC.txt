I love you so I'll try to get ya
I miss me, I miss you
But the dancefloor's right here
So make it in this room to be a fly
Disguising the truth behind, I'll try
Girl we can bell, dancing so well

Girl let's try,
Heaven's on the other side
Girl let's fight
Cause heaven's on the other side

I know we don't be alone when baby and sweetheart area lone
My angel let's both, just fly
Away so tired, that fire don't try
Just stay, girl we can bell dancing so well

Girl let's try
Heaven's on the other side
Girl let's fight
Cause heaven's on the other side

Girl let's try
Heaven's on the other side
Girl let's fight
Cause Heaven's on the other side
