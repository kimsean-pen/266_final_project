This is who I am and this is what I like
GC, Sum and Blink and MxPx rocking my room
If you're looking for me I'll be at the show
I can never find a better place to go
Until the day I die I promise I won't change
So you better give up

I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
I just wanna have fun
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
So you better give up
'Cause I'm not gonna change
I don't wanna grow up

I'd like to stay up and spend hours on the phone
Hanging out with all my friends and never being at home
I'm impolite and I make fun of everyone
I'm immature but I will stay this way forever
Until the day I die I promise I won't change
So you better give up

I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
I just wanna have fun
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
So you better give up
'Cause I'm not gonna change
I don't wanna grow up

I don't wanna be told to grow up (grow up, grow up)
I don't wanna be told to grow up (grow up, grow up)
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change

I just wanna have fun
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
So you better give up
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change

I just wanna have fun
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
So you better give up
No, I don't wanna change
So you better give up
'Cause I'm not gonna change
I don't wanna grow up
