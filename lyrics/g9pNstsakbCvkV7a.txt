If you flip the rug then you'll reveal an ugly scene
But the strength of 10, 000 will never weaken me
Witches like a razor blade you carve me half and half
Oh I'd better wait to kill the time

Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now when you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing, you're a dancer
The Devil takes care of his own

Do you dare to speak his name? There's evil at the room
Crueler plan: it's on your mind; go on and give the dice a roll
Never did believe in saying fortunes are foretold
Easy come and easy they will go

Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now when you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing, you're a dancer
Didn't you read about it?
Ooh!
The Devil takes care of his own

Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now when you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing, you're a dancer
Didn't you read it in the detail
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now when you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing, you're a dancer
The Devil takes care of his own
