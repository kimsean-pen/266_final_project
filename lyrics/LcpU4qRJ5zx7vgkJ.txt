Four hundred years,
and it's the same, the same philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years - look, how long
And, the people, they still can't see.

Why do they fight against
the poor youth of today?
And, without these youths,
they would be gone, all gone astray

Come on, let's make a move,
I can see time, time has come
And, if the fools don't see,
I can't save the youth, the youth is gonna be strong.

So, won't you come with me?
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live,
live a good good life and be free.

(Look how long)
four hundred years - way too long!
and people, my people, can't see.

Said, it's four hundred long years
give me patience - same philosophy.

It's been four hundred years, way so long!
How long? four hundred long long years.
