Ambling
Paused at the brink of a precipice
A moral stride inside
Seized up
Careless soil and its trammels had little left to contain me
Wandering these infinite heights unchained me
I survey the distance deep in my mind
Arousing madness
Horizons redefined the sweep of the sky rather than prospects below
To see beyond sight as I'm eager to know
I'd never taste of death but once no moral stride inside begun
The opening edge on the boundless depth wandering
