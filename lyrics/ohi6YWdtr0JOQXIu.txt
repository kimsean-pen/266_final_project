I'll wait until you have to go
I'll make it so you never ever know
How much I have messed it up

We run around like we don't care
It's gonna leave its marks somewhere
Do you want to show me something new?
(You go now, reached my top anyway)
(You go now, reached my top anyway)

Just tell me what I have to do
To keep myself apart from you
All your colors start to burn
I know I wanted far too much
Then I thought that wouldn't be enough
All this talk is closing you

Take shelter (ahh)
Take the pressure (ahh)
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
Then get used

Take shelter (ahh)
Take the pressure (ahh)
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
Then get used

I don't really wanna stop myself
Nobody's gonna tell me I need help
Are you coming over soon?
I need you at the darkest time
You hold me, and I have to shut my eyes
I'm shy, cannot be what you like
(You go down, reached my top anyway)
(You go down, reached my top anyway)

Just tell me what I have to do (to do)
To keep myself apart from you
All your colors start to burn

And take shelter (ahh)
Take the pressure (ahh)
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
Then get used

Take shelter (ahh)
Take the pressure (ahh)
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
Then get used

I don't really need this pressure to go
If you wanna find love
If you wanna find something more
I'll be the one to run for you

I don't really need this pressure to go
If you wanna find love
If you wanna fins something more
I'll be the one to run for you

Take shelter
Take the pressure
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
Then get used

Take shelter (shelter, ahh)
Take the pressure (ahh)
Do what you want tonight, it's alright
If you want to get used
