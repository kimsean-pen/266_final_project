Let's go down in our basement
It's where we like time wasted
Hide from all the things that we're hating
It's got a trap door and everything
And it's got a little sofa
We sleep down there though it's colder
And it's a Friday night but the music got shut
So we stay down here with the old stuff

Small things make big shadows
Skyscrapers in the walls follow us down
Every mistake we made, we build ourselves a town
In the basement
In the basement
In the basement
Yeah, in the basement

We drink our tea in the basement
We smoke 'til three in the basement
We live our dreams in the basement
We're finally in the basement

Small things make big shadows
Skyscrapers in the walls follow us down
Every mistake we made, we build ourselves a town
In the basement
In the basement
In the basement
In the basement

Small things, big shadows
Small things, big shadows
Small things, big shadows
Small things make big shadows
Oh
In the basement
In the basement
Small things make big shadows
