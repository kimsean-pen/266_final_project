La, ah, ah, ah
La, la, la, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, la, la, ah, ah, ah

Never, I never met a girl like you in my life
I never, no, no, yeah, I never met a girl like you in my life
The way that you hold me in the night
The way that you make things go right
Whenever you're in my arms
Girl, you're filling me with all your charms

Suavecito, mi niña
Suavecito, mi niña (The feeling that I have inside)
Suavecito, mi linda
Suavecito

The feeling, the feeling that I have inside for you
'Cause ever since the day I met you
I knew that you were my dream come true
But I think I found that day
Gonna make you mine in every way

Suavecito, mi niña (Baby, baby, baby now)
Suavecito, mi niña (That we've got to find it out)
Suavecito, mi linda (I just can't believe it's true)
Suavecito ('Cause you know that, girl, I love you)

I need you
Love you...
You...
You...

All I want is you
If I can't have you, I don't know what to do

La, la, la, ah, ah, ah
La, la, la, ah, ah, ah
La, ah, ah, ah
La, la, la, ah, ah, ah

Never, I never met a girl like you in my life
I never, no, no, yeah, I never met a girl like you in my life
'Cause I know I'll always be
Together just you and me
From here on, you're gonna see
You'll be mine until eternity

Suavecito, mi niña (Baby, baby, baby now)
Suavecito, mi niña (That we've got to find it out)
Suavecito, mi linda (I just can't believe it's true)
Suavecito ('Cause you know that, girl, I love you)
Suavecito, mi niña
Suavecito, mi linda
Suavecito, baby
Suavecito, mi linda
Suavecito
Suavecito (la, la, la, la)
Suavecito
Suavecito, mi linda
