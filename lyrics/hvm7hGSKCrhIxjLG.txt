One... Two... One... Two... Three... Four

Know a man
His face seemed pulled and tense
Like he's riding on a motorbike
In the strongest winds
So I approach with tact
Suggest that he should relax
But he's always moving much too fast

On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been takin' too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes
There he goes

He's yet to come back
But I've seen his picture
We go way back
I wonder 'bout his insides
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken... where, I don't know
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes

And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned
It seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
For he still smiles
And he's still strong
Nothing's changed but the surrounding bullshit
That has grown

And now he's home and we're laughin
Like we always did, my same old, same old friend
Until a quarter to ten
He seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next
Before his first step
He's off again
