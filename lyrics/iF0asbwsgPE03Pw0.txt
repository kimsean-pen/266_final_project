we are the stars which sing
we sing with our light;
we are the birds of fire,
we fly over the sky.
our light is a voice;
we make a road for the spirits to pass over

{algonquian indian}

We are like the wind, drawn lumious swims,
we make a road for the spirits to pass over,
to the spirits of past over...

Outò, ba mwen son ou, e,
Outò, ba mwen son ou, e,
Tanbouyè, o ba mwen son ou,
Solèy lève.
Outò, give me your sound,
Outò, give me your sound,
Drummer, give me your sound,
The sun rises.
