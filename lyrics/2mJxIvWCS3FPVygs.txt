Loving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy
You letting me go
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, though I know I can't forget about you
I'm gonna try to show how much
You're turning me around, destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore

You must realize
You took your love and left me
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy about you

Gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy about you

Gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
To love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

It's gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

It's gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

It's gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

It's gonna take a miracle
It's gonna take a miracle
