You take a sound, any sound
Record it, and then change its nature
By multiplicity of operations
Record it at different speeds
Replay it backwards
You add it to itself over and over again
You adjust filters, echoes, acoustic qualities
You combine segments of magnetic tape
By these means and many others,
You can create sounds should no one has ever heard before
