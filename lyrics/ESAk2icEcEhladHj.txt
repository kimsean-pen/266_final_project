I've wandered around with nothing more than time on my hands
I was lost in the night with no sight of you
And at times it was so blue and lonely
Heading for the light
Been close to the edge, hanging by my fingernails
I've rolled and I've tumbled through the roses and the thorns
And I couldn't see the sign that warned me
Heading for the light
Oh, I didn't see that big black cloud hanging over me
And when the rain came down, I was nearly drowned
I didn't know the mess I was in
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change
And I get the strangest feeling
As I'm heading for the light

Oh, my hands were tied, jokers and fools on either side
But still I kept on till the worst had gone
Now I see the hole I was in
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway
I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change
And I get the strangest feeling
As I'm heading for the light
I see the sun ahead, I ain't never looking back
All the dreams are coming true as I think of you
Now there's nothing in the way to stop me
Heading for the light
Now there's nothing in the way to stop me
Heading for the light

Heading for the light

Heading for the light
