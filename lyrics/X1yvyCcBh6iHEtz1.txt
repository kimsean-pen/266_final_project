I'm good for inspiration, aren't I
You will find
Close the door and I'll go anywhere
You take me to
From this bed on to so much more
Care for you I will

Can I have a picture of you tonight
Keep it with me always in my mind

Touch me cause I can't move
I can barely breathe
Speechless, breathless
I can't tell you
If I'm here or not
Running both legs tied together
Arms in the air
Care for you I will

Can I have a picture of you tonight
Keep it with me always in my mind

Care for you I will
Care for you ...
