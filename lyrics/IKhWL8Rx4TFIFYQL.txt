I'm too high, I'm too high
But I'm not afraid
Not to try, not to try
To keep you with me

There is just, just one way
For us to be two
I can count just one way

To save me and you
To save me and you

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else

Got no creed, I've got no creed
To back up my faults
Only be, I can only be
What's been set for me

Know you're mine, I know you're mine
I can't let you be free
Don't believe, I don't believe

That new is better
That new is better

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else

Can't let you go, can't let you go, can't let you go
Can't let you go, can't let you go, can't let you go
Can't let you go, can't let you go, can't let you go
Can't let you go, can't let you go, can't let you go

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm a slave to my old self
I'd rather be crazy
Than share you with somebody else
