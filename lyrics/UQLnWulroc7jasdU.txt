Tell me how the circle ends
Theres no beginning
Everything that came before
Will come round again
And I look in the mirror
My fathers eyes look back at me

He gave me a road to choose
He gave me freedom
And I pray Im strong enough
To walk in his shoes
And I hope that I become
Half the man he'd want me to be

Cos I feel you guiding me
Showin me the way when Im misdirected
I know your not here but I feel connected

Chorus
Cos everything that I am
Comes from a better man
And all that Ive said and done
Cant rewrite my history
Right there for all to see
Im just my fathers son
Taught me to walk, now I run
Now I run

Sometimes when I lose myself
In my weakness
I can feel the touch of his
Unmistakable hands
And theyre pushing me forward
Back into the circle again

And I hope my son sees in me
The kind of man that he was to me

Chorus

And everything that I am
comes from a better man
And all that Ive said and Ive done
Cant rewrite my history
Right there for all to see
Im just my fathers son
Taught me to walk, now I run
I run
