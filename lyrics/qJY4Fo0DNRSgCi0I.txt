When you lie
Kiss your baby bye bye bye
If you're true
The whole wide world will laugh with you
When we see
Nothing's wrong with you and me
The time will tell
It might even bring a wedding bell
If you think that I'm a loser
Well you suck
'Cause you know
I ain't nothin'
but a user of your love
I can't get enough

Girl, it's true

The whole wide world is smilin' with you

Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up

Sometimes I know
Sometimes I'm on the go
But I'm comin' back
So don't give me no flack, yeah
It's all you

And it's me too

It"s your world
You's the girl, you's the girl
Happier than shit
Things that might go click with me
Click with you
Is that love? is that love? oh

Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up

Watch the little daisies grow, little daisies grow
Now just push th' little daisies and make em come up
Watch them grow, watch them grow
As I push the little daisies and make 'em come up
Make 'em come up
Make 'em come up
Make 'em come up, say

Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
Push th' little daisies and make em come up
