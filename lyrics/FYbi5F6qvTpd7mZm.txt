The worlds on fire but we're all smiling
Though it's all our fault
But life is short so we resort to laughing through it all
It's the battle within the good and the sin
With both sides standing strong
It's the permanent scars

How broken we are
It's the things that hurt us all
But isn't it beautiful
The way we fall apart
It's magical and tragic all the ways we break our hearts
So unpredictable

We're comfortably miserable
We think we're invincible
Completely unbreakable
Maybe we are
Isn't it beautiful
The way we all fall apart
You're a liar but I'm a coward so I can't throw a stone
We're so imperfect but so worth it because we're not alone
It's the wars that we wage, the lives that we take
For better or for worse
It's the lion we cage, the love and the rage

That keeps us wanting more
But isn't it beautiful
The way we fall apart
It's magical, and tragical
The ways be break our hearts
So unpredictable, we're comfortably miserable

We think we're invincible
Completely unbreakable
And maybe we are
But isn't it beautiful...
The way we fall apart
The world is dark but all it takes

Is your love to spark
And set my heart on fire once again
But isn't it beautful...
The way we fall apart...
Isn't it beautiful...
Oh, isn't it wonderful the way we fall apart (isn't it beautiful!)
It's magical, and tragical
The ways we break our hearts
So unpredictable
We're comfortably miserable
We think we're invincible
Completely unbreakable
And maybe we are
But isn't it beautiful...
The way we fall apart...
