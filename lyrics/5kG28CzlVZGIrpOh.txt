Who'd take my hand
Who'd take my hand
I wanna show you
Something that you never seen

Why don't you come
Look at me so
He breaks my hand
So many times

Never felt, never felt
Never felt, love
Never felt, never felt
That love could hurt so much
That love could hurt so much

I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love

Still hold her close
Her close

Wake up now, wake up now, wake up now
Wake up now, wake up now

Who'd take my hand
Who'd take my hand
I wanna show you
Something that you never seen

Never felt, never felt
Never felt, love
Never felt, never felt
That love could hurt so much
That love could hurt so much

I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love

I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
I can't believe that I'm seeing this love
