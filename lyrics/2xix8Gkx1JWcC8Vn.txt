go ahead and stand up straight
straight against the wall
why did I go for you?
pick you up when you fall
was I too drunk to say what i said to you?
was I too blind to go and see straight through you?

ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost

you flew out on a plane
then crashed into the ocean
and then you haunted me
don't have a clue what's in motion
so every now and then it feels so soothing
when you float on a bit and move right though me

ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost

yeah
one, two, three, four

get up, save face
find your way back to the grave
or then go find your way back home

get up, save face
find your way back to the grave
you'll never find your way back home
you're a ghost

get up, save face
find your way back to the grave (you're a ghost)
or then go find your way back home (you're a ghost)

get up, save face
find your way back to the grave (you're a ghost)
you'll never find your way back home (you're a ghost)
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
you're a ghost
