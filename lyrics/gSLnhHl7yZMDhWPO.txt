Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n- acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n- acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Messin' with a dawg like me, D-to-the-M-to-the-X
Last I heard, y'all - was havin sex, with the same sex
I show no love

Empty out, load mo'
How you gonna explain fucking a man?
Even if we squashed the beef, I ain't touching ya hand
I don't mess with chumps, for those who been to jail
That's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps

I don't deal with brothers that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree

Man, I give y'all cowards the business for messing with me, is you crazy?!

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n- acting up?!? Where the wolves at?

You better bust that if you go'n pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n- acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Once a song, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street passed midnight, look for 'em in the morgue

Don't play with these cats cuz I ain't got nothing to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love em, please pray for these cats
Cuz I know they all hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin no patience turn into more patients

More trips to ICU cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (right here) See them n- (right where?!?)
Get 'em boy (right there), that's how we do (aiight then)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs

Yo, where we at baby? (creepin' through the fog)
From then till now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them cats
And hit every block on the job

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n-acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that n- in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them n- acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

It's all good, it's all good
Dog in the house
I am the hood, I am the streets
It's all good
Dog is the word
It's all good (Take it how you wanna)

It's all good
Dog is the word (Take it how you want mother)
It's all good (I'm in the hood all day)
I am the streets
I think I'm like the only dawg
That can go to the block and
Run straight home and pray
And be good, good, yeah
Ask the D.Y.O projects when the last time they see dawg
Not too long ago baby
D.Y.O, Kato (Where the hood at)
