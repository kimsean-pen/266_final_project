Try to keep the options near
Of why we call out what we hear
(I won't change)
The lasting song across the track
(Here and now)
The resting never coming back
(I won't change, here and now)

If anybody wants to know
Our love is getting low
Lighting the cracks in the road

You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me

(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me

It's time I let my mind desire
I never meant to cause you harm
Just to try to keep the options near
Of why you call out what you hear

You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me

(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(I won't change)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me
(Here and now)
You carry me you carry me you carry me you carry me

If anybody wants to know
Our love is getting low
Lighting the cracks in the road

You carry me!
