Pull you out
With my fingertips
Take you just
Between my lips
Light you up
You start to blow
Smoking hot
I can't say no
Sweet Cigarette
Sweet Cigarette
Sweet Cigarette
Sweet Cigarette
I suck you in
I blow you out
To my burning love
I am devote
The rush of Nicotine
My liquid Velveteen
I'm always in the mood
For a long slim and smooth
Sweet cigarette
Sweet cigarette
Sweet cigarette
Sweet cigarette

Just one taffe
Is never enough
Bring you to my lips
Watch the slowing clips
Suck it in
And blow it out
Watch it burn
And stop it out
