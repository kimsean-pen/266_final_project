California sun (x3

Swallow the last regrets I had
Decided to take the good with the bad
Watch your eyes like the horizon
Got lost in your, California sun

Swallow the last regrets I had
Decided to take the good with the bad
With eyes like the horizon
I got lost in your, California sun

California sun

Swallow the last
Swallow the last, California sun

Let's stay young, forever now
I wait your, mistakes will never count
Day haunts like a horizon
I've enjoy the California sun

California sun
Swallow the last

Swallow the last regrets I had
Decided to take the good with the bad
With eyes like the horizon
I got lost in your, California sun

California sun

Swallow the last regrets I had
Decided to take the good with the bad
With eyes like the horizon
I got lost in your, California sun
