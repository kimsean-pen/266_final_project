Spinning the wheel
Spinning the wheel
Spinning the wheel
Spinning the wheel

Five o'clock in the mornin', you ain't home
I can't help thinkin' that's strange, yeah, yeah
Baby, I just want you to know
I won't go through it again, yeah, yeah

Those clouds are closin' in

(Baby love)
And I will not accept this as a part of my life
(Save me love)
I will not live in fear of what may be, ahh
(Baby love)
And the lessons I have learned
I would rather be alone than watch you
Spinnin' that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you gettin' what you want from me?
(Ain't you gettin' what you want from me?)
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be?
(Baby that's what we used to be?)
You've got a thing about danger, baby

I guess the hungry just can't see
One of these days you're gonna bring some home to me

Six o'clock in the mornin', you ain't fun

I can't help thinkin' that's strange, yeah, yeah
It seems that everybody takes their chances these days
Oh yeah, we're standin' in the rain

(Baby love)
And I will not accept this as a part of my life
(Save me love)
I will not live in fear of what may be, ahh
(Baby love)
And the lessons I have learned
I would rather be alone than watch you
Spinnin', spinnin' that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you gettin' what you want from me?
(Baby, don't you love that trash)
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be?
(You know you've always chasin' as)

Like it's school, a lot of fashion, baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
(Just can't see)
One of these days you're gonna bring some home to me

(Baby love)
How can you love me?
when you are playin' with my life?
(Save me love)
You say give me time and I'll do better, I swear
(Baby love)
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me?
(And I don't wanna go back there)
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be?
(I don't wanna go back there)
You've got a thing about danger baby

Iguess the hungry just can't see
(Never going back to that, back to that, baby)
One of these days you're gonna bring some home to me
To me
To me
