There was a time when I was happy in my life
There was a time when I thought I'd live forever
There was a time when I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother it was nice
Oh Mother why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears.
Yes Father, you know I'm not so free
Nobody else could ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do. No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand.
I was just a kid

Oh mother why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father you know I'm not so free

I got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for, care for, care for, care for, care for.

My mother died
When I was five
And all I did was sit and cry.
I cried and cried.
And cried all day.
Until the neighbors
Went away
They couldn't take my loneliness.
I couldn't take their phoniness.

My father had to go to work.
I used to think he was a jerk.
I didn't know his heart was broken. And not another word was spoken.
And he became a shadow of the father I was dreaming of.
I made a father I would never need another place
Turned my heart into a cage a victim of a kind of rage

I got to save my baby.
Because he makes me cry.
I've got to make him happy.
I've got to teach him how to fly.
I've got to take him higher.
Way up like a bird in the sky.
I've got to calm him down now.
I got to save his life

I got to give it up.
I got to give it up.

I've got to give it up.
Find somebody to love.
Find someone that I can care for.
I got to give it up.
Find somebody to love.
Find someone that I can care for.

I got to give it up.
I got to give it up.
I got to give it up.
I got to give it up.
I've to let it go.
I've to give it up.
I've to let it go.

Oh mother Oh Father
I've got to give it up!
Oh mother oh father.
I've got to give it up.

End
