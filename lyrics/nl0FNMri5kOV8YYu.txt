When opening the gates of hell still
Isn't enough, what else will it take?
Will we not stop until all is destroyed?
Is losing everything the only way this will change?
And I ask myself is this the final warning?

And when it all opens up and starts devouring us
I hope we see the truth, that it was me and you
And when it all falls apart I hope we see who we are
We can't hide in the wake of this so you better beware

You may have your reasons but that doesn't make them right
The state of humanity faces a truth with no cure in sight
One hand out stretched desperately reaching to pull us from death
And the other gripping the trigger, a bullet aimed right at it's head
And still I ask myself is this the final warning?

And when it all opens up and starts devouring us
I hope we see the truth, that it was me and you
And when it all falls apart I hope we see who we are
We can't hide in wake this so you better beware

This is the last and final warning. It's fucking tearing us down
This is the last and final warning. I hope you hear us now: Cave Canem
