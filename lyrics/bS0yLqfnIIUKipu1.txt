One holy ghost for a homemade girl in a green T-shirt
That read, I quote: "What price damnation now?"
In the school of thought, in the halls of state with a leap of faith,
The loose translation must have lost her.

It must have caused her to go back to the civilization,
Caught between here and the real one just to say what you'd begun to say once.

We have been enrolled in the wrong schools all throug the pride of fall,
The falling price of education now.
There have been no clues in the last few takes in the steps retraced.
The education must have caused her.

It must have caused her to go back to the civilization,
Caught between here and the real one just to say what you'd begun to say once.

The education must have cost her.
The loose translation must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah.
The loose translation must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah.
It must have lost her, it must have lost her, yeah.
