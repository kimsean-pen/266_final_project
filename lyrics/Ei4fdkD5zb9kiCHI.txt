In pain, in heart and soul.
I feel so high, I feel so old.
Remain in flesh controlled.
Is there anything for me?

I've been living in this maze too long.
And I'm sorry, I'm ready to go.

Would you follow my trail through the ice and the flames?
Would you enter the gates to the lands where we've stayed?
You'll realize. You'll realize.

That I'm not the same I've been.
I've been learning through my sins, I've been living life thin.
I've been tasting the pain.
I've always felt that I'm always outside of me.

I'm drained both in blood and bones.
I hear them call. I've seen my fall.
And I haven't even come that far.
Is there anything for me?

I'm reaching out for you, Sun, my star.
Am I really ready to go?

Now.

Would you follow my trail through the ice and the flames?
Would you enter the gates to the lands where we've stayed?
You'll realize. You'll realize.

That I'm not the same I've been.
I've been learning through my sins, I've been living life thin.
I've been tasting the pain.
I've always felt that I'm always outside of me.

The fable starts with you, son.
You're only alive, my friend.
Our fable starts with no lines.
You're about to reign.

Born from the finest stardust.
Your fire, the greatest of them all.
I'll light the path in front of you and it all.

I see now my father, I am one with the sun.
And I feel the light has come to show me home.
The insecurities in life that I've known is fleeing out now.

Nothing will ever come close to what I've known. What I've felt in me.
Nothing will ever be the same again since I'm through with you.
Nothing will ever bring us down
once we've begun our march through time
