I can't wait to be with you
No i just can't sit still
Are we there yet?
takes me back
I remember
such a magical place
It was all you

Closing in
I hope that you make it
Closing in
I hope that you find your way

Frame by frame
red speed ahead
A city dissolving
the thread of your love in the headlights
Is it safe now?
Will your arms be open?
Coz i'll just have to kiss you
try and stop me

Closing in
I hope that you make it
Closing in
I hope that you find your way
Closing in
It's all that I want in the whole world
Closing in
Please be there, please be there

what are you like?
where did you get to?
No word no nothing
You didn't hold me for any longer
Did you walk for the fear of love?
Or don't you believe enough
I'll cover both of us
You can leave that to me

Closing in
I hope that you make it
Closing in
I hope that you find your way
Closing in
Coz you're all that I want in the whole world now
Closing in
Closing in
