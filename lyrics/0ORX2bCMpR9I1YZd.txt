Gone
Gone

On two legs but my feet never touched the ground
I got my head in the soil, leave no prints to be found
The nature's strength, the wonder who I am (Gone)
A weakening force, all echoes from my past
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)

Gone
Ta ta ta ta do bo, pa pa pa pa pa choo
Ta ta ta ta do bo, pa pa pa pa pa choo

Gone
And the battle goes on (Shala)
And the love that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)
Will be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)
And the songs that you sung (Shala)
And the words that you meant (Shala, Shala, Shala)
Will be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)
Sh!
