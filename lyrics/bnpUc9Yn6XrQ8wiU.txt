Time to face the people, take a gamble with your pride
Time for living, so take today off, take your turn to hide
It's out of my hands, out of my hands tonight
Time to smash the mirror, turn the tempo upside down
It's out of my hands, out of my hands tonight

Turn your eyes to me, sing it like you talk so loud
Playing to the gallery when you know it's time to face the crowd

Sold communication, words don't matter, it's in the eyes
It's only living, don't lose yourself now in your disguise
It's out of your hands, out of your hands tonight

Turn your eyes to me, sing it like you talk so loud
Playing to the gallery when you know it's time to face the crowd
Face the crowd, face the crowd, face the crowd
Turn your eyes to me, let me see how real you are
You'll never understand, I'll stand up for every scar
Turn your eyes to me, sing it like you talk so loud
Playing to the gallery when you know it's time to face the crowd
Time to face the crowd, time to face the crowd
Time to face the crowd, time to face the crowd
