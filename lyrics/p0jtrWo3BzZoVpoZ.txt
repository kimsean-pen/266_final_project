She's an Extraordinary Girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away

He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain

She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days she feels like dying

She gets so sick of crying
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days she feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Somedays he feels like dying

Somedays it's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding
She gets so sick of crying
She's an Extraordinary Girl
an Extraordinary Girl
an Extraordinary Girl
an Extraordinary Girl
