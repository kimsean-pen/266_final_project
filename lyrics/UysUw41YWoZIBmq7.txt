I'm blue and lonesome as a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome yeah as a man can be
I don't have a head by myself
My love has gone away from me

Baby, please
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come on home to me
Yes, my heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me

I go catch my troubles
Down in the deep blue see
I go catch my troubles yeah
Down in the deep blue see

Where the whales and the fishes
Have no fuss over me
