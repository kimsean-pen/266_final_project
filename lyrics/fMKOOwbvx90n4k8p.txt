I got too many reasons to leave
You say there's one thing that will never be
Can't catch your vibe if it's not equal to me
Now I got 0 emotions, 0 emotions for you

I see he takes you for granted
How could my love get so thin
Clean sheets are making me nervous
Dirty thoughts touching my skin

So what can I do?
It's broken beyond repair
Are you feeling it too?
The statement is in the air
So what can I do?
I want to be close to you
But been riding it through
Found what I had to do

I got too many reasons to leave
You say there's one thing that will never be
Can't catch your vibe if it's not equal to me
Now I got 0 emotions, 0 emotions for you
0 emotions for you
Now I got 0 emotions, 0 emotions for you

It's like you want the advantage
You think I'm playing along
I hope you get what I'm saying
My words are hard to let go

So what can I do?
It's broken beyond repair
Are you feeling it too?
The statement is in the air
So what can I do?
I want to be close to you
But been riding it through
Found what I had to do

I got too many reasons to leave
You say there's one thing that will never be
Can't catch your vibe if it's not equal to me
Now I got 0 emotions, 0 emotions for you

Since I've been playing with you
I never won
Now I'm rolling paper
You think I'll stick around
I had to break it to you
And now it's done
You're acting like a ten but got 0 emotions for you

I got too many reasons to leave
You say there's one thing that will never be
Can't catch your vibe if it's not equal to me
Now I got 0 emotions, 0 emotions for you
0 emotions for you
0 emotions for you
0 emotions for you
