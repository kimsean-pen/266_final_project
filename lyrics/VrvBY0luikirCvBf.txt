Fishing bird
Coming out from the tide
Through the top of the ocean
Fish in the water
Dive beneath the waves
Dive beneath the ocean
How long can you hold your breath
Flash of silver moving away
Down in the darkness
A shot in the dark

Feel it move when the the blows? up to the sky
Empty gutted
In the evening breeze
When you go back home to nothing
Up into the sky
How long can you hold yourself
Before the wind can pick up? in the dark
Up into the sky
How long can you hold yourself
Before the wind can pick up? in the dark
