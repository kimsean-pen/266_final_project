I was born a lucky one
I wasn't having any fun
I've turned around to try to run
But you were already gone

And by the time that I found you
There was nothing that I could do
Became a fighting kangaroo
But it was never your fault

Of all these broken promises
That found me in the end
You're the one that I pretend
Was enough

And is it true you knew I'd miss you
Back when we were little kids
Before we had the sense to give
You know you weren't very wrong

Of all these broken promises
That found me in the end
You're the one that I pretend
You're the one that I pretend
You're the one that I pretend
Was enough
