Jump all you can
And you got out your right foot
The sooner you get out
In your hide away
I might be left dead
Side of the road
Serves a place and time

I plan on never waking up
I plan on never waking up

Jump all you can
And you got out your right foot
The sooner you get out
In your hide away
I might be left dead
Get out the way
Serves a place and time

I plan on never waking up
I plan on never waking up
I plan on never waking up
I plan on never waking up
