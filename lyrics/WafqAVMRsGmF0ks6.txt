Their voices search for me through the darkness
Yet I feel desire's cold grip upon my heart no more

My solitude
My shield
My armour

My solitude
My shield
My armour
Tested with full force

I have seen the face of death
And I, I choose not to accept its form
I have seen the face of death
An army of demons summoned forth
Upon this endless night they swam
The fire in their eyes
Like new Suns shine through the abyss

I taste the fear
I see the weakness in their eyes
They cannot hide as I devour all

As the mountains crack and the oceans boil, a fury-tempered heart is forged
Within the flames, this current of corruption will cease

As the mountains crack and the oceans boil, a fury-tempered heart is forged
Within the flames, this current of corruption will cease

I taste the fear
I see the weakness in their eyes
They cannot hide as I devour all

An army of demons summoned forth
Upon this endless night they swarm
The fire in their eyes
Like new Suns shine trough the abyss

I have seen
I have seen the face of death
I have seen the face of death
And I choose not to accept its form

My solitude
My shield
My armour

My solitude
My shield
My armour
Tested with full force

Their voices search for me through the darkness
Yet I feel desire's cold grip upon my heart no more
