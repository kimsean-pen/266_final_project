If all your old posters of co-worker friends
Could know how it feels by now,
Would they act like they don't have a clue?
You steer with your shoulders and line your eyes with both of your arms
You send out for questions on notecards
When I say the answer's no, no, I don't remember the time collecting interest
And no, I don't remember anyone I haven't seen for years.
I don't remember being anywhere but here.
When you come to me with offers I'll easily refuse
Could never hold me to tryin'
But hey, don't you think it's the least you could do?
Maybe it's better that you are how you are
And it's something like you that has me falling apart
While I'm pressed into you in the back of your car
With your keys digging into your side.
Reminds you of the time collecting interest.
And no, I don't remember anyone I haven't seen for years.
I don't remember being anywhere but here.
