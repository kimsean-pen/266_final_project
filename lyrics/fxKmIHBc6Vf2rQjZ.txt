I should've known, the day we met
The way you turned and waved at me I never will forget
Two years later who'd have guessed
That we would make it this far just to put it all to rest

And if it's alright I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that it's time that we moved on
And if it takes all night I'll wait here till the
Daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
Its alright we were wrong

If you're crazy then I'm insane
Two people with the same condition
It never goes away
It's not our problem anymore
But let's just call it even when I'm walking out that door
And oh it won't be easy cause it was hard from the start

And if it's alright I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that its time that we moved on
And if it takes all night I'll wait here till the
Daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
Its alright we were wrong

We must have met for some reason it's in the sky something from up high
(We) must have lived for some reason it wasn't a lie it just wasn't right
It just wasn't right

And if it's alright I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that its time that we moved on
And if it takes all night I'll wait here till the
Daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
And if it's alright I'll stay until it's late until
You tell me that its time that we moved on
And if it takes all night I'll wait here till the
Daylight so that I can see that we just don't belong
It's alright we were wrong
It's alright we were wrong
It's alright we were wrong
Ohhh It's alright we were wrong
I should've known
Day we met
