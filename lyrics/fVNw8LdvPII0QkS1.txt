Many years ago, he looked out through a glassless window
All that he could see was Babylon
Beautiful green fields and dreams and learn to measure the stars
But there was a worry in his heart

He said, "How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about living
How could it come to this?
Yeah, I really want to know about this"

Is it like today? Ah, ah
Then there came a day, moved out across the Mediterranean
Came to western isles and the Greek young men
And with their silver beards they laughed at the unknown of the universe
They could sit and guess God's name

But they said, "How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this"

Is it like today? Ah, ah
Then there followed days of kings, empires and revolution
Blood just looks the same when you open the veins
But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone
But the furrowed brow has never left his face

He said, "How could it come to this?
We've living in a landslide
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this"

Is it like today? Ah, ah
Then there came a day, man packed up flew off from the planet
He went to the moon, to the moon

Now he's out in space, hey, fixing all the problems
He comes face to face with God

He says, "How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about my creation
How did it comes to this?
You're really killing me, you know"
It isn't just today? Ah, ah
Is it like today? Ah, ah
Is it like today? Ah, bang
Ooh, aah, ooh
Many years ago, he looked out through a glassless window
Didn't understand, watch what he saw
