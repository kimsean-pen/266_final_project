One two three four

Mother, sister comfort me
Feel so wet and cold
And downtown's lights look like a fire
As I'm headed out in the snow

You know I've gone to live one thousand lives
And to die one thousand deaths
But lately baby, got me scared
Ain't got too much left

I watch the tide flying
Like a sparrow
I watch the lights dying
Off like dominoes
Uh-hoh

And the church bells were ringing
And the church bells they cried
And the church bells sang inside my heart
The night before she died

And Jesus came to me
He put a song into my ears
He said let it fall right out your mouth
For the whole wide world to hear
And so I opened wide and out came a tide
And I let them know what to follow
And I cried Mother, Sister won't you comfort me
Downtown's locked up for the night
And I don't have a key

Mother, sister comfort me
Feel so wet and cold
And downtown's lights look like a fire
As I'm headed out towards the show

You know I've gone to live one thousand lives
And to die one thousand deaths
But lately baby, got me scared
Ain't got too much left

But the ones that I had spent with you
Were the best that I ever had
