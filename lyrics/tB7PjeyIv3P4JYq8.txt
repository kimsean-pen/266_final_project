It's running through your veins
Like the window harbor
Taking me, ooh aah.
I just need a little rest
Before this gets harder,
Harder.

Isn't funny how it goes?
You opened ended close
Forcin' you
To enter as you go
Take the wind
The wind up harbor.
Take it in
Before this gets harder.
After all,
You're the one that I call
Home n stuff
When the waves don't spill now
Wash it all
All the way, all the way now
Ooh oh ooh oh

It's running through your veins

Taking me
Ooh, ah
I just need a little rest
Before this gets harder,
Harder.
Before this gets harder.

After all,
You're the one that I call
Home n stuff
When the waves don't spill now
Wash it all
All the way, all the way now
Ooh oh ooh oh
