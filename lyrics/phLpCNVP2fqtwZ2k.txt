Now there is no end
The wheel will turn, my friend

I'm in flames 'cause I have touched the light - it pulls me so
We shall be one
Forevermore!
It's all I want, it's all I need
Everything is fixed
There's no chance, there's no choice

It's calling me Saidin
So precious and sweet
My mind keeps fading away

It's scratching deeper
My sole reliever
How can I find you now?

Passing through the flames, I
See how terror will rise
It soon will be over, O father of lies
Like foul winds at twilight
It's coming over me
What was and what will be? what is? I don't know

Driving me insane, just feel the heat
Madness creeps in, I'll tear it down

There's no end, wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
Turn the wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep on spinning

Light - it binds me
Light - it blinds me
Light - it finds me
Light denies me now

I creep along so desperate and tired
Let me ask you why I am what I am
Prophecies I am the chosen
Ta'veren, the flame will grow and
Feel the heat, I'll keep on breathing
After all there's no tomorrow

Wheel of time
Save my soul, find a way
And if I fail, will it all be over?
Oh wheel of time

The vision, so fleeting and vague
Once again I will bring down the mountain
One last glimpse, it is costantly slipping away

The young man said: "I will never give up"
The inner war, I can hold against it
My mind, my mind
My mind's in darkness

The young man says: "I will never give in"
The prophecies, behold it's true
I conquer the flame to release the insane, I'm crying
I cannot erase
I'm the dragon reborn
And in madness I soon shall prevail

Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall live
The heron sets my path and name me true
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall die
My memory's gone, but twice I pay the price

Wheel of time
Save my soul, find a way
May it be as the Ta'veren's chosen
Oh, wheel of time

Turn the wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
There's no end, wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep on spinning

Shine on
Embrace and deny me
Turn on, wheel of time
Shine on
You've burnt me, now guide me
Weave on, wheel of time
