If we could see ourselves
The mirror would reflect insanity
Instead we camouflage
The flaws that lie within
Condone the suffering
We witness as we mingle casually
We need to right ourselves
Or else we will derail

Aiming too high
You are bound to fail

Patience is a vital virtue
That you'll never have

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'Cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: unite is the only way

A raging tragedy
Ignored will have its justice, finally
Distress and poverty
Is everyone's disease
We'll come to realise
For all we've done there is a price to pay
Yet hope is never lost
There always is a way

Trumping the game
Is no easy way

Enterprise and discipline
Will pay off in the end

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'Cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: unite is the only way

If we ever could look into fate's mirror
We would never have ended up here
We're distracted by every sin committed
It should always be ever so clear

If we ever could look into fate's mirror
We would never have ended up here
We're distracted by every sin committed
It should always be ever so clear

If we ever could look into fate's mirror
We would never have ended up here
We're distracted by every sin committed
It should always be ever so clear

We are caught up
In our failure
Now our union
Is our savior
It's the only way

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'Cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: unite is the only way
