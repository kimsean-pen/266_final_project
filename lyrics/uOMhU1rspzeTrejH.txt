They will try to make you stay
Steal the beats away from you
Soak your actions in self doubt
If you don't live the way they like
They'll make you feel jealousy
Only one way to raise a family
I squeeze your brain 'til you forget
Why is it you're so upset

Stick out the leg, step right and take
I'm trying to change the way your parents did it
The evil that lies, don't look at the lies
Of the [?]

So don't try to change, don't try to change
The way we made you
Don't try to change, don't try to change
Although we hurt you and we break you down

They will try to [?] you
No matter, no matter what it takes
Just because I have you
It doesn't mean they'll give me their consent

So don't try to change, don't try to change
The way we made you
Don't try to change, don't try to change
Once you try to, no
Don't try to change, don't try to change
Although we hurt you
We will hurt you and then we'll break you down

Evil's on the other side
I will never let you down
Evil's on the other side
I will never let you down
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
