I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you, alone!
Boop-boop-a-doop!

I wanna be kissed by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be kissed by you, alone!

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than, to feel the desire
To make you my own!
Boop-boop-a-doop, boop-boop-a-booh!

I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you, alone

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than, to feel the desire
To make you my own

Bup-bum, butle-doodle-dum-bum!
I wanna be loved by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Ba-deedly-deedly-deedly-dum!
Boop-boop-a-doop!
