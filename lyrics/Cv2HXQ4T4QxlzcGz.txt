Two birds on the window
Sunday morning limbo
I'm dancing in a bigger room

I got so accustomed
Sweeter words and discussion
My temper's cooling to blue, yeah

No no no, no no, no no, no no
I put my trust in
To all this loving
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no, no no

No don't you, no don't you do me wrong now, yeah
I'm finally fine now, yeah, yeah
I'm taking my sweet time, oh, oh
So don't you do me wrong, do me wrong

'Cause I'm taking my
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)

I've been meditating
I stopped medicating
I'm taking advice from the moon
I'm lost in melody, harmony, new family
They wrap me up in a cocoon

No no no, no no no, no no, no no
I put my trust in
To all this loving
No no no, no no, no no, no no, no no

No don't you, no don't you do me wrong now, yeah
I'm finally fine now
I'm taking my sweet time, oh, oh
So don't you do me wrong, do me wrong, no, no

'Cause I'm taking my
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet time, yeah)
(Sweet)
