We got one more bottle of Jack, what the fuck we gonna do with it?
Let's get fucked up
And if you got a little problem with that, what the fuck you gonna do 'bout it?
You'll get fucked up
We got one more bottle of Jack, what the fuck we gonna do with it?
Let's get fucked up
So if you got a little problem, there's one easy way we can stop it
It starts with my dick in your mouth

I feel like a million bucks
But truth is, I'm about a bill away from broke as fuck
But I got a little weed, so I'mma roll it up
'Cause Funny's got a funny feeling, it can change his luck
Yeah, coming up, throwing up, West Coast banging
Mary Jane, light it up, no complaining
Six shooter spraying, that's what I'm saying
No more shots, taking bottles to the brain, man

So watch the city light the sky
'Cause there's something about tonight
Yeah, there's something about tonight
It's got me feeling alright
So watch the city light the sky
And even if you close your eyes
You'll never feel so alive because...

We got one more bottle of Jack, what the fuck we gonna do with it?

So if you got a little problem, there's one easy way we can stop it
It starts with my dick in your mouth

One cracker, two cracker, three cracker, four
Not enough crackers, bitch, I need two more
Still not enough for me to feed these hoes
Too drunk to open the DeLorean doors
So I take a little nap on the bathroom floor
Last 'shroom cap, man, I'll need some more
Lap dance, looking at me like she's bored
Too many drinks that I can't afford
Watch me run outside that door
So let's mix the maker, meet the marker
I'm in the mood for a little bit darker
Got some paper and a lighter
Time to set it all on fucking fire

So watch the city light the sky
'Cause there's something about tonight
Yeah, there's something about tonight
It's got me feeling alright
So watch the city light the sky
And even if you close your eyes
You'll never feel so alive because...
