That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
She's got the hottest trike in town
That girl she holds her head up so high
I think I wanna be her best friend, yeah

Rebel girl, Rebel girl

In her hips, there's revolutions
When she walks, the revolution's coming
In her kiss, I taste the revolution
