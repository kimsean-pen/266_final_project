The night thickened into black earth
The ground sparked under my feet
I didn't know the stars had tumbled down
And that earth had turned into sky

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

I felt ascending but I really sunk
Everything had turned upside down
As I was traveling to the mountain peak
I had dug into the grave of our home

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

I aim follow the bear star
I shun advice of my brothers
And now study the signs of the heavens
I've silenced the words of my sisters

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain die

Did I sacrifice a brother?
The fires on the mountain die
Did I silenced the words of a sister?
The fires on the mountain die
