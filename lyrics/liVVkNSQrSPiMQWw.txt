Your hands are broken, but you
Wouldn't cry out so we tore your heart apart
Should I thought of you with sadness
Such a small, small price to pay

You should have known better
Or I have never known wrong
You should (?)
Had no choice, no choice

I'll answer
You told me,
"It's never enough to stay still."

I thought you'd be proud of me
Should I spell it out, spell it out? No
You'll never be good enough
So I'm getting out, getting out
