Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void

It is shining
It is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being

It is being
That love is all, that love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
But listen to the colour of your dream

It is not living
It is not living
All play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning

Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
