I don't wanna keep your secrets
I don't wanna tell you lies
Red lights flicker in the rearview
Is it me that's on your mind?

Cause we can't go on
No we can't get right
And we can't deny
Cause we can't go on
No we can't get right
And we can't deny

In your eyes
I'm lost in the chemical high
Don't let me drown
Right down to you're perfect design
Hopeless love in your eyes
Hopeless love in your eyes
Right down to you're perfect design
Hopeless love in your eyes

I don't wanna fix this feeling
Will we make it out alive?
Staring in a broken mirror
Can you read between the lines?

Cause we can't go on
No we can't get right
And we can't deny
Cause we can't go on
No we can't get right
And we can't deny

In your eyes
I'm lost in the chemical high
Don't let me drown
Right down to you're perfect design
Hopeless love in your eyes
Hopeless love in your eyes
Right down to you're perfect design
Hopeless love in your eyes

Your eyes

Hopeless love in your eyes
Hopeless love in your eyes
Right down to you're perfect design
Hopeless love in your eyes
