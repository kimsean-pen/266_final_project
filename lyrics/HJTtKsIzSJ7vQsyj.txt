on and on the blood begins to spill
i'll forever hate you
on and on my blood begins to chill
i'll forever hate you

on and on the blood begins to spill
i'll forever hate you
on and on my blood begins to chill
i'll forever hate you

waiting, breathing, seething
for this time
waiting, breathing, killing
all my time

fortunes escape me
torture me for my crimes
peek through those pretty eyes
every time they cut me down to size

place your blame
'cause all is lost in this silly game

all for you, and nothing for me
all for you, and nothing's for free
'cause i'm lost again, broken instead
lost in my head, everything you said to me
killed me
i'm not free, i'm suffering

fortunes escape me
torture me for my crimes
peek through those pretty eyes
every time they cut me down to size

place your blame
'cause all is lost in this silly game

all for me, and nothing for you
all for me, there's nothing left of you
'cause it's killing time, i've lost my mind
i've gone insane, i've got no brain

i'm losing touch, 'cause everyone lies to me
'cause nothing's for free
