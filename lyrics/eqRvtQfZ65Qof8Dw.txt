Can't believe what you say
You say it week after week
No one asked you for your opinion
I am so fucking bored of banging my head against the wall

Just hand me the scissors
I'll cut off my ears
Can't you hear yourself?
Maybe you did the same

Force fed your views

And your words don't mean much to me
The shower of shit that comes from your mouth

And the words that I speak
Just don't get a chance to leave my mouth
Before you cut me out
Your personality comes crashing down on me
I need to try and block that sink hole in your face

Just hand me the hammer
And I'll nail your mouth shut
Silence is golden

Force fed your views

And your words don't mean much to me
The shower of shit that comes from your mouth
And your voice is just white noise
I'm tuning you out, I've had enough of you

I'll nail your mouth shut

Just hand me the scissors
I'll cut off my ears
Just hand me the scissors
I'll cut off my ears

And your words don't mean much to me
The shower of shit that comes from your mouth

I've heard your views force fed it
