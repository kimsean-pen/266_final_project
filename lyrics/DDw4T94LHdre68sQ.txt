I want you wearing white
I want you in a frame
Nothing but a t-shirt
Dancing in the rain

Cause I'm just a simple dude
With an ordinary mind
I want you in your body
Hold it next to mine

Cause everything you do is a new sensation
My eyes, your eyes
Pulling me in closer
My hands, your hands
I been feeling lonely
Your touch, my touch
I feel the rush
And I been waiting for it
Waiting

Not that you could tell
Not that you would guess
By the way I'm talking
By the way I dress
I'm just a simple dude
With a complicated soul
I want you in your body
Tell me and I'll roll

Cause everything you do is a new sensation
My eyes, your eyes
Pulling me in closer
My hands, your hands
I been feeling lonely
Your touch, my touch
I feel the rush
And I been waiting for it

My skin, your skin
I can feel it coming
Hips pressed, undressed
And my heart is running
Day in, day out
I'm all about it
And I been waiting for it

As the days go by
Pulled across the sky
Just your average guy

My eyes, your eyes
Pulling me in closer
My lips, your lips
I been feeling lonely
Your touch, my touch
I feel the rush

My skin, your skin
I can feel it coming
Hips pressed, undressed
And my heart is running
Day in, day out
I'm all about it
And I been waiting for it
I been waiting for it
I been waiting for it
I been waiting
