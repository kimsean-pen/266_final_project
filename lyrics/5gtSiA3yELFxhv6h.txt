Remember the first time we got high
We felt like the rabid lions roar
We were elastic and then we were healed
Healed in the blinking of an eye

And then when the dawn cracked over us
The day wouldn't hit us hard at all
We could ride the morning into night again
We knew the days were there to waste

But these days
That light hit so heavy
And those days
Feel like another life

This isn't like the first time anymore
And I've been chasing that too long
Digging for the lost memories
Of a youth written in fire
You always said it's not too late for me
I sure am listening to you now
believe in me so I can trust myself
'Cause there's a first time for that too

Remember the first time that we kissed
It felt like a planet forming
But we were just novices at this
It felt like an ancient wisdom
There was lightning then and those
Songs were all proved true
No wonder I still think so much about you

But these days
My heart feels too heavy
And those days
Are someone else's life

This isn't like the first time anymore
And I've been chasing that too long
Digging for the lost memories
Of a youth written in fire
You always said it's not too late for me
I sure am listening to you now
Leaving me so I can trust myself
'Cause there's a first time for that too
