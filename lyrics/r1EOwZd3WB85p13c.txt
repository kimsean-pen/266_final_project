Who wrote those lines on the wall
Let's retrace where they scrawled ancient characters
It's 2: 00 and your sister's slip, it falls
And the afternoon crawls across the room and tackles her

I don't think that you would sink
that ship that's only passing through
'Cause I don't believe that you might be a murderess
But I saw inside each small, dark eye as it was turning blue
All the strength inside to do just
what the captain says and hang the rest

And moved by the rhyme in the psalm
We agreed that it was wrong and to believe in it
Ooh, swooned the wall all night long
But a lie's a lie, no matter what guy's breath's in it

I don't know that I would go that far down some dark avenue
With a whispering crew of shadows all protecting it
But I saw inside each small white lie as it was turning true
The ability to do all things expected of it

I don't think that you would sink
that ship that's only passing through
'Cause I don't believe that you might be a piratess
Did you hide inside each small white lie, before you turned it true
The ability to do all things the captain says?

Oh murderess in the wilderness, with your victims all around you
Their combined love forms a pool your knife's reflected in
And now I'm ready, too,
with my throat to you. On this mountain. By this moon.
And what I want the most to do is prove that I'm not like them
