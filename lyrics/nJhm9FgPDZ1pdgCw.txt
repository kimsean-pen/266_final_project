Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna to let you know what the fuck that I've been through

Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes, 3 jobs took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say, but don't know shit ‘bout where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub just to make it past where I am from…

No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
(Sixteen in the middle of Miami)

I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work, work, work, work
Workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice
Gotta get it how I live
I've been work, work, work, work
Workin' on my shit

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that pac shit
My passion was ironic and my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind basically raped me
Ran through the bull shit like a Matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at ‘em and even the score
So, I went harder, studied the Carters ‘til a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording at 4 in the morn'n
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant Art Ignorant
Your ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate be inconsiderate but the industry took my innocence
Too late now I'm in this bitch

You don't know the half
This shit get real…
Valley Girls giving blow jobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head Over Heels

No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
No money, no family, sixteen in the middle of Miami
(Sixteen in the middle of Miami)

I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work, work, work, work
Workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice
Gotta get it how I live
I've been work, work, work, work
Workin' on my shit

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy, but cheers to Peezy
For the weeks we lived out of duffle, bags is all we had
Do anything, for my Mum I love you
One day I'll pay you back, for the sacrifice that you managed to muscle
16 you sent me through customs so…
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn First at the light that's in front me
‘Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need, ‘cause it's all that I ever had

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
