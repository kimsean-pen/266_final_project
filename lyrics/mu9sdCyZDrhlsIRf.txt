It's like I'm living in a wasteland
of words I'm trying to say
but they don't come out right
Like I could be your friend
if you had anything to offer me tonight

I want a heart unbreakable
so I can feel it all

It's like I'm living in a wasteland
of words I'm trying to say
but they don't come out right
Like I could be your friend
if you had anything to offer me tonight
But I am just a fool
Cause I could be in love if I really tried
Holding onto something I can't see
so you can comfort me tonight

I can feel disaster
falling on me after
the sun comes up
you say goodnight
But I keep crawling over you for now
cause everything I feel is a waste of time
Holding onto something I can't see
won't comfort me tonight

I want a heart unbreakable
So I can feel it all.
