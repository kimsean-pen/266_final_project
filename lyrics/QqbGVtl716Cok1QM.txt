Too old to crucify
But too young for suicide
Oh, I'm glad I found you
I am just glad I found you
I'll wrap myself around you
I'll wrap myself around you

After all the shit that you've been through
All that I got is time for you
I am just glad you found me
I am just glad you found me
Just wrap yourself around me
Just wrap yourself around me

Kiss the feet
Of the reason my heart beats
If a kiss could kill, maybe this one will
But a kiss can't kill but maybe this one will

Well that's alright
Well that's alright

We all know
Either up here or too slow
I just can't get thinking down
I just can't get my feelings sewn

Well that's alright
Well that's alright

Well that's alright
Just swept off my song for you
Well that's alright
Just swept off my song for you
It's alright
Just swept off my song for you
Just swept off my song for you
And it's alright
Just swept off my song for you
