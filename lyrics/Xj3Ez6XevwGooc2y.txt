You come in cold
You're covered in blood
They're all so happy you've arrived
The doctor cuts your cord
He hands you to your mom
She sets you free into this life
And where do you go
With no destination, no map to guide you
Wouldn't you know
That it doesn't matter, we all end up the same

These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem
You come in this world
And you go out just the same
Today could be the best day of your life

And money talks in this world
That's what idiots will say
But you'll find out
That this world is just an idiots parade
Before you go
You've got some questions, and you want answers
But now you're old, cold, covered in blood
Right back to where you started from

These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem
You come in this world
And you go out just the same
Today could be the worst day of your life

But these are the chronicles of life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem
You come in this world
And you go out just the same
Today could be the best day of
Today could be the worst day of
Today could be the last day of your life
It's your life
Your life
