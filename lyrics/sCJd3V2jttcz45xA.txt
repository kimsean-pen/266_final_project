Cut open my heart
Right at the scar
Listen up
Gonna do what I'm told
Go where I'm told
And listen up
Take a shot in the rain
One for the pain
Listen up
I tried all the way

Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

Gonna soften the blow
soften the blow
Give it up
I saw the surprise
The look in your eyes
It gave it up
Gonna be who I am
Be who I am
Give it up
I tried all the way

Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
