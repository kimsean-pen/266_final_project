You will know when they go 'cause they'll never light up the silence
And your heart just sighed
You won't know when it's time 'cause the days don't warn you that way
And your heart just dies
Somebody longs for you
Maybe they're wrong for you
Somebody waits for you
Maybe too long for you
Look around, look inside, look under the stones in the river
See a life turned clean
Skim a stone, throw a bone, watch it float downstream and dissolving
Dye the water green
Somebody longs for you
Maybe they're wrong for you
Somebody waits for you
Maybe too long for you
