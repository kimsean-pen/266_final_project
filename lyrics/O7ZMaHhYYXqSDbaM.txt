I wish I could be
Your first love the way you are mine
Wish you didn't remember this feeling
But knew it the way I know it (yeah)
Wish you were impaled
And injured with love the way I am
You would cry when you saw my tears
The way I cry when I see yours
I can't control me

'Cause baby, how you own me like you own the world
And if you show me then I'll be your girl
And I'll kill them if they try to hurt you
You dethrone me, boy what a nerve

You call me pretty
Whoa-oh
Boy, you call me pretty
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Got my hands dirty, now
Only love can hurt me
Yeah

I wish I could be
Your first love the way you are mine
Wish you didn't remember this feeling
But knew it the way I know it (yeah)
I wish you were impaled
And injured with love the way I am
You would cry when you saw my tears
Like I cry when I see yours
But you can only lose yourself once, hmm

'Cause baby, how you own me like you own the world
And if you show me then I'll be your girl
And I'll kill them if they try to hurt you
You dethrone me, boy what a nerve

You call me pretty
Whoa-oh
Boy, you call me pretty
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
Got my hands dirty, now
Only love can hurt me
Yeah

Yeah, you own me like you own the world
And if you show me then I'll be your girl
And I'll kill them if they try to hurt you
You dethrone me, boy what a nerve

You call me pretty
Whoa-oh
Boy, you call me pretty
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
Got my hands dirty, now
Only love can hurt me
Yeah
