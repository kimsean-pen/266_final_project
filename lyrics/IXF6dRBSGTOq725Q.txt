Thought you had the right moves, girl, but you can't feel the beat
(Oh, tell me honey)
Ooh, don't you feel it at all?
If you wanted my heart, girl, mama should have made a key
('Cause baby girl)
You know I keep it on lock
Love's no walk in the park, girl, so, uh, why'd ya bring a leash?
(Oh, tell me honey)
Ooh, no, I won't be your dog
Boy, I thought you was sweet, girl, but you're just sugar-free

Oh tell me, baby
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
Tell me, baby
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
Tell me, honey
Who are you, but my gummy bear?

Oh, I got love for you no

Staring up at the ceiling 'cause I just couldn't sleep
(Oh, tell me honey)
Ooh, was I dreaming too long?
If you wanna play house, girl, well, uh, who ya wanna be?

'Cause baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
'Cause baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
'Cause baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?

(?) a thing of the past
You want my future but my presence won't last
I'm not your puppet though you're pulling my string
Got so much loving, but I'm missing one thing

Oh, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more
No, I got love for you no more

Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
(Love for you no more)
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
(Love for you no more)
Baby, tell me
Who are you, but my gummy bear?
