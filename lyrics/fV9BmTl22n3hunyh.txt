Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la

Emily
And her love to be
Carved in a heart
On a berry tree
But it's only, only a little farewell love spell
Time to design a woman

Touch me
Oh wake me
Emily you ornament the earth
For me

Emily
You're the natural snow
The unstudied sea
You're a cameo
And I swear, I swear you were born
A weaver's lover born for the loom's desire

Move me
Oh sway me
Emily you ornament the earth
For me, for me

Emmie your mama's been a-callin' you
Ooh
Who stole
Mama's heart
And cuddled
In her garden?
Darlin' Emmie

La, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la

You're my friend
And I loved you
Emily
