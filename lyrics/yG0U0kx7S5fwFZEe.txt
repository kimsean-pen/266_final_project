Everybody put your hands up
Come on
Yeah, oooh
Dig this

There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Some folks like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not reppin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step

The only thing that turns me on (I can't hear ya' 'cmon)
Is when I hear a soulful song
We like soul with a capital S (Y'all say)
Soul with a capital S (What kind of music tell me)
Sweet soul music, that's the best (I think they ready baby)
Soul...

Well now, the music makes you happy
And it can make you sad
Said it will turn your worst day to the best you ever had
For entertainment values if I had to choose
You and me might disagree 'cause I like the rythm and blues
Now I'm not dissing disco, I'm not saying punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal said it's gots to have that funk

The only thing that turns me on (Come on now)
Is when I hear a soulful song
If you like soul with a capital S
You'll say, soul with a capital S (What kinda music is it)
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S (Let the horns play)

Well some people might tell you to get with the times
Said it doesn't really matter if your poem rhymes
What I'm here to tell you, whatever comes along
There's something here for everyone
There ain't no right or wrong, y'all
If some rock makes you lazy, a tasco leaves you flat
If fusion drives you crazy, it's that funk is where it's at
The only thing that turns me on, is when I hear a soulful song

Soul with a capital S (Everybody say)
Soul with a capital S (Come on, come on, come on)
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S (Put your hands up so I can see 'em)

I like that soul with a capital S (Don't you know that we dig)
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S, with a capital S

With a capital S, with a capital S (That's what I like)
With a capital S (I work in the best genre)

You can make more noise than that, come on

I like that Soul
(With a capital S)
Don't you know what we need soul y'all
(With a capital S)
I'm talking about some good old funky, funky soul
(With a capital S)
That get down to get down, dirty soul
(With a capital S)
Is what I like
(With a capital S)
Sweet soul music
(With a capital S)
Woken music
(With a capital S)
I want music
(With a capital S)
Oh I got the best genre

Hey Mimi, let's take San Francisco to Oakland, California
They done found the stroke, they found the Oakland stroke
They done found the stroke, they found the Oakland stroke

Soul
(With a capital S)
Don't you know what we need soul y'all
(With a capital S)
I'm talking about some good old funky, funky soul
(With a capital S)
That get down to get down, dirty soul
(With a capital S)
Is what I like
(With a capital S)
Sweet soul music
(With a capital S)
Woken music
(With a capital S)
I want music
(With a capital S)
Oh I got the best genre

Thank you
