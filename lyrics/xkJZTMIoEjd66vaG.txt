I know something is very wrong
The post returns for prodigal songs
With blackout harks with flowered muse
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

I know something is very wrong
The post returns for prodigal songs
The blackout harks with flowered muse
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
