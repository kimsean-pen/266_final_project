You who were born with the sun above your shoulders
You turn me on, you turn me on, you have to know
You who were born where the sun she keeps her distance
You turn me on, you turn me on, but so does she

You who were born there where beauty is existence
You turn me on, you turn me, your body heals my soul
You who were born where you shiver and you shudder
You turn me on, the girl is gone, so come on let's go

All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
Save your poison for a lover who is on your side

One way is Rome and the other way is Mecca
On either side, on either side of our motorbike
One way is home and the other way is papa
On either side, on either side, and prepared to strike

When I get back I will
dream in Barnes and Noble's
Oh leave me here, oh leave me where angels fear to tread
When I get back I will bleed after my beating
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here, I'm scared to death

All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
save your poison for a lover who is on your side

All the pearls of China
Fade astride a Volta
Don't sew beelines to anybody's hide
Save your poison for a lover who is on your side
