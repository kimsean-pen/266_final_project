It's 7am on a brand new day
I'm gonna start it in the perfect way
Put the greatest record on

I kick the dog and kick the cat
Insult my mum insult my dad
Scream out loud and sing along

We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeros (zeros)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah

I'm down the pub the time is one
Hit the jukebox for my favourite song
Gonna turn it up too loud

Have a couple of games of pool
Argue with a drunken fool
Have a beer with the usual crowd

We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeros (zeros)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah

Its noise that makes the world go round
I can't survive without that sound
The sound torments me

Its 8 o'clock down the church hall
Enormous amplifiers 6 feet tall
Gonna turn them up full blast
The vicar waves his arms and looks absurd
The noise drowns out his godly words
And he can't get out too fast

We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (zeroes)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah

Noise Noise Noise
