I've been trying to not think about you lately
Trying to do myself some good
But I'm failing
Failing...
I've been looking for something else to distract me
Looking for someone who's looking for someone
Worth saving
Save me...
I feel the beat
Kicking in my chest
Close my eyes and wait
But it's not working yet
I hear the music but I can't dance
I should be moving but I'm stuck
And I need to fight this feeling
So I stay here on the floor
I'm not supposed to love you
Not supposed to love you anymore
I've been looking for you in all these places
Looking for you in all these faces
I push through
To get through
I've been trying to lose myself in the light
Trying to find myself in the night
Without you
Can't find you
I feel the beat
Kicking in my chest
Close my eyes and wait
But it's not working yet
I hear the music but I can't dance
I should be moving but I'm stuck
And I need to fight this feeling
So I stay here on the floor
I'm not supposed to love you
Not supposed to love you anymore
Don't wanna go home when the lights come up
Don't wanna go home
Don't wanna go home when the lights come up
Don't wanna go home
(Don't wanna go home...)
I hear the music but I can't dance
I should be moving but I'm stuck
And I need to fight this feeling
So I stay here on the floor
I'm not supposed to love you
Not supposed to love you anymore
