I lay on the floor
They asked me what I do tonight
It answers
Search for the moon

No, don't follow him
Swallow him, swallow em
Swallow it

I swear I will be good to you
I swear I will be good to you
I swear I will be
I will be

Time come hold me back
I'll dream of what I've dreamed of
And I dream of what I call love
