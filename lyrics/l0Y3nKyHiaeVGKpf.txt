my roots are strong and deep
i'm swaying in your breeze
my limbs stretch out to meet you
you've got me on my knees
i stand tall
my feet are on the ground
but compared to you i'm small
the things you need you just surround
you rocked around the earth
you circle it with air
you're trapped inside the core
with hot lava hair
i wish you could sprout
but you can't stick your neck out
i want you climbing on my limbs
but i'm just stumped by your whims
