Curl into a ball like you have more fun
Well that would make it faster
Why do you do it do you do it do you act like you?
Why do you do it do you act like you?

Don't fight
Go red and blue and black and white
And sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head", you said
Make you dead, make you hippa hippa hippa hippa

A palace of stones
Of your bananafishbones
I'd buy you a hundred years old
To celebrate our difference
Theorize and talk yourself
Until you're tired and old

Disappear everywhere and watch me
Pull my lips apart
Exploit inspire encourage
Be responsible for this
Ha ha

I don't think
I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me kiss me once
And then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away

Curl into a ball like you have more fun
Well that would make it faster
Why do you do it do you do it do you act like you?
Why do you do it do you act like you?

Don't fight
Go red and blue and black and white
And sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head", you said
Make you dead, make you hippa hippa hippa

I don't think
I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me kiss me once
And then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Tell me about the games you play
Oh turn off the lights
And tell me about the games you play
