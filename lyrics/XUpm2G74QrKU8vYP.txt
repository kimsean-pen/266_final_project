I was born the devil's sun
Yes my dad, he gave my name
No my mama keeps saying

Run to the desert
You will see all that you need to see
Run to the desert
You will be all that you need to be

I woke up to the shadow of a man standing over me
Here in the land of frozen hands
I came out here to kill you father like a Sergio Leoni picture
Gee I hope you understand
And as the red soaked the sand â€“ shhh

Run to the desert
You will see all that you need to see
Run to the desert
You will be all that you need to be...
