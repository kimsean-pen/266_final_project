put on your boots
and walk with me
over the freeway
and down to the sea
that's where we can always go
when we really wanna know

we sit by the window
and we watch the rain
each little drop has got a name
they're falling down
they're hitting the ground
they're washing all the people away

go on the roof and we'll see the sky
let the world pass us by
we can make it all turn grey
if we really want it that way

paint me a picture of the way you feel
close your eyes and make it real
sing me a song of the place you see
we can go there, just you and me

you don't have to smile if you don't want to
i don't have to smile if i don't want to
we don't have to smile if we don't want to
