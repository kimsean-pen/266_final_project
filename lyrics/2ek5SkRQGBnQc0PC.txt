You tried playing games with my soul and my mind, you lied to my face, broke my spine
You've stolen my innocence through all your shams, my heart pleads that you shall be damned
Obscuritatem, pestilentiam et malum te opto - miseria et dolor tecum
Run cause I'll trace you, I'll chase you, I will face you then I will erase you
Sweet revenge for all the things you've done to me
Run cause I'll bait you, give it straight to you, I will break you, devastate you
Sweet revenge for what you've done to me
You've shattered my plans, all my dreams have been slain, you sent all my hopes down the drain
You think that you've still got my heart on a string - sweet revenge is waiting in the wings
Obscuritatem, pestilentiam et malum te opto - miseria et dolor tecum
Run cause I'll trace you, I'll chase you, I will face you then I will erase you
Sweet revenge for all the things you've done to me
Run cause I'll bait you, give it straight to you, I will break you, devastate you
Sweet revenge for what you've done to me
Obscuritatem, pestilentiam et malum te opto - miseria et dolor tecum
Run cause I'll trace you, I'll chase you, I will face you then I will erase you
Sweet revenge for all the things you've done to me
Run cause I'll bait you, give it straight to you, I will break you, devastate you
Sweet revenge for what you've done to me
