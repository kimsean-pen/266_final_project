Have you seen her
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree

Ooh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way
Ooh, baby baby
Ah come on! Take a chance you're old enough to
Dance the night away
(Dance)

Whao, come on g-g-girl, dance the night away
(Ah)
A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go

She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than uh
Anything else she knows
Ooh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way
Ooh, baby baby
Well don't skip romance 'cause you're old enough to

Dance the night away

(Dance)
Whao, come on g-g-girl, dance the night away
(Ah)
Oh yeah
Dance the night away
(Oh baby)
Dance, dance, dance the night away
(Ah come on baby)
Dance the night away
(Ho yeah)
Dance, dance, dance the night away
(Uh, come on baby, baby)
Dance the night away
(Ooo yeah)
Dance, dance, dance the night away
