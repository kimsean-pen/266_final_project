If I am silent
Then I am not real
If I speak up then
No one will hear
If I wear a mask there's
Somewhere to hide

Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

If I raise my voice
Will someone get hurt?
And if I can't feel
Then I won't get touched
If no truth is spoken
Then no lies can hide

Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

Silence is golden
Nobody gets in
Safe in my own skin
So nobody wins

Did you hear me speak
Do you understand
Did you hear my voice
Will you hold my hand
Do you understand me

Won't someone listen?
Nobody gets in
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple

Silence is golden
I have been broken
Something was stolen
Safe in my own skin

Safe in my own skin
Won't someone listen?
My body's a temple
But nothing is simple

My body's a temple
But nothing is simple
Something was stolen
I have been broken

I have been broken
Silence is golden
I have been broken
Safe in my own skin
