I'll never graduate
In rock and roll to the debate team
I'll never graduate
Imperfect souls to mock educating

I'll never put that right
Put right that course
I'll never get that high
Get that high horse
I'll never put that right
Put right that course

I'll never get that

I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high

I'll never graduate
Can't count the years that I'll have been waiting
I'll never graduate
I got a slur that don't need translating
I'll never put that right
I'll never get that... high

High
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high

Watch me burn
Out of turn
Watch me burn
Out of turn
Watch me burn

Watch me burn

I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high
I'll never get that high

I'll never get that high
