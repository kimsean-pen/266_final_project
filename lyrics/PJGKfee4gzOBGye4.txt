When I wake up in the morning get close to you
Yeah
I was sucked to the river but the river was hung dry

High up in the clouds the stars raise their glass to you
Yeah
Visions of light stream down from the afterlife

Hum at night that feels so right
It heals my eyes
It leads a cavalcade

Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move

Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move

Stay up all night so dark I get warm with you
Yeah
Drunks in the street making video game noise

Dust in the city blew into my eyes I get high with you
Yeah
Claws digging deeper and deeper into the earth

Hum at night that feels so right
It heals my eyes and leads a cavalcade

Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move

Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
