I don't need you to love me, I can't be broken twice
just tell me I'm beautiful as we lay down, that will suffice
don't look so guilty as though you've done me wrong
I'm not your victim to be pitied,
I'm not yours at all
for long

Oh with your hands you cheapened me
And I'll never let another weaken me
Ahh Ahhh

But you kissed me too softly and then I felt used
And you told me I was your call to arms your muse
Don't act so bewitched as though you tried to stay true
Did I taunt you with my voice, was it my hair that maddened you?

Such excuses are heard only in songs
From a time before you and I
There is no great romance here, no
Just a lust you tried to glorify

Go back to her running, that's my advice
You won't find me running after
I can't be broken twice
Leave and go back to her running, take my advice
Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

I'll never let you hurt me I'll never let you in
A fool was I to indulge in some sordid dealings
I won't let this bruise me the choice is my own
Not to let another use me and learn to be alone

Oh with your hands you cheapened me
And I'll never let another weaken me

Go back to her running, that's my advice
You won't find me running after
I can't be broken twice
Leave and go back to her running, take my advice
Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice
