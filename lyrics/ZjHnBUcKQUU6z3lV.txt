I tried to tell you what I can do
But you won't believe what you cannot see
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well

Thanks to all the times it was said
"You can't, you can't, you can't"
Well I did, I do, I do
I did, I did, I do

And cheers to all of them who said,
"There's a million pearls just like you"
Now where'd they disappear to?
Now where'd they disappear to?

I wanted to go high
I wanted you to recognize
Something you saw worth keeping
Oh well, oh well, oh well

If I show you my disgrace,
Will you still display distaste?
If I bare to you, will it mean anything to you at all?
When I offer up my mouth, how you spit me out
How I learned to be proud
On an ocean floor, I'm found
As just one of the million other...

A million, a million, a million pearls
A million, a million, a million pearls
A million, a million, a million pearls
