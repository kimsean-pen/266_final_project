Something special in my garden
Something special in my garden
I've been travelling all over this world
I've been travelling all over this world

I never seen a black rose in the other garden
Something special in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses blooming in my garden

I've got to keep it carefully
I've got to water it

I've been travelling all over this world
So you see
Something special in my garden
So you see
Something special in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses blooming in my garden
Black, black roses blooming in my garden
Black, black roses blooming in my garden
