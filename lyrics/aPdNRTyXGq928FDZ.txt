I've got a pocket full of holes
Head in the clouds the king of fools
You've got a ribbon of rainbows
The sun in your eyes burning through

Could be I'm happy and sad
Could be I'm losing my head over you

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby
To want a guy like me,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, crazy

So if I'm dreaming don't wake me tonight
If this is all wrong I don't want it right
'Cause you're the one sure thing
When I get lost in the game once again

Hey, I'm a lucky guy
Without a reason and I don't understand

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby
To want a guy like me,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, crazy

Well, there must be some kind of mistake
To give your heart away,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, crazy

I've got a pocket full of holes
Head in the clouds the king of fools
You've got a ribbon of rainbows
The sun in your eyes burning through

Could be I'm happy and sad
Could be I'm losing my head over you

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby
To want a guy like me,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, crazy

Well, there must be some kind of mistake
To give your heart away,
Well you've gotta be out of your mind, cra-zy

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby
To want a guy like me,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, crazy

Well, there must be some kind of mistake
To fall in love with me,
Yeah you've gotta be out of your mind, you're crazy

Well you've gotta be crazy baby
To want a guy like me,
Yeah you've gotta be crazy, baby
