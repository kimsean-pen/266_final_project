Ahh, Ahh

What a day
See you in the way
What a life
But you look at me that way

What a day
What a life
What a waste
What a lie

You still shot me, makes me wonder
Streetlights when I was younger
I heard you keep on running
I heard you keep on coming but
Here comes the rain and thunder
Here comes, it pulls you under

Ahh, Ahh
Ahh, Ahh
Ehh, Ehh,
Oh, Oh
