I'm a shot caller
I don't get caught up
I always have the upper hand

I'm a born winner
Even when I'm in love
I never give it all to my man
You came in and snuck up on me
I'm facing my first defeat...

I said I would never be
A silly fool but
Look what you've done to me
Said I would never lose
But you came in and changed the rules

You win,
I love it
I don't care anymore
'Cause who's keeping score
You win
I love it
And my heart is the prize
It's yours every time
You win

Ah ha ha ha la la la la
It's yours every time, you win
Ah ha ha ha la la la la
It's yours every time

You're my front runner
NÂº1 stunna
Know you got me under your spell
My champion lover
I'll never find another
Cupid's arrow pierced through my shell

I'm wavin' my white flag in surrender
Giving you all I have

I said I would never be
A silly fool but
Look what you've done to me
Said I would never lose
But you came in and changed the rules

You win,
I love it
I don't care anymore
'Cause who's keeping score
You win
I love it
And my heart is the prize
It's yours every time
You win

Ah ha ha ha la la la la
It's yours every time, you win
Ah ha ha ha la la la la
It's yours every time

Turned me upside down
Turned me inside out
Spin my world around
Take my breathe away
Love's a losing game
What do I do now?

You win,
I love it
I don't care anymore
'Cause who's keeping score
You win
I love it
And my heart is the prize
It's yours every time
You win

Ah ha ha ha la la la la
It's yours every time, you win
Ah ha ha ha la la la la
I lose every time, you win
