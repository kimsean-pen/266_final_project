Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like the song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Mother, should I build the wall?
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Is it just a waste of time?

Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true.
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you.
Mamma's gonna keep you right here under her wing,
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing.
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm.
Oooh babe
Oooh babe

Ooh babe, of course Mamma's gonna help build the wall.

Mother, do think she's good enough... for me?
Mother, do think she's dangerous... to me?

Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through.
Mamma's gonna wait up till you get in.
Mamma will always find out where you've been.

Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Oooh babe
Oooh babe
Ooh babe, you'll always be a baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high...?
