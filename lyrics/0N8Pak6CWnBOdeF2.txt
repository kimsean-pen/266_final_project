I'm crowded in the street
Feel like i'm floating on the air
Closer as we speak

I spent the morning here
I know you're somewhere over there
Closer everywhere

I hear your voice inside my head
Can't remember what you said
Oh no

In the city that you know
Can't you let take it slow

Read all the magazines
I haven't shared for weeks
Closer as we speak

They told the refugee
You know that nothing can be free
Closer everywhere

I hear your voice inside my head
Can't remember what you said
Oh no

In the city that you know
Can't you let take it slow
