You're the only one that I've got
But I can't get lost in you
I can't get lost in you

It can be someone I know
To make it up to you
Make it up to you

Whoo-ooo mooo-ooves (Who moves)
Whoo-ooo mooo-ooves

You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you

You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you

You don't wanna look ahead
When it's staring back at you
Staring back at you

Whoo-ooo mooo-ooves (Who moves)
Whoo-ooo mooo-ooves
Baby I'm about to lose
Whoo-ooo mooo-ooves
But I can't decipher you
Whooo mooves (Who moves)

You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you

You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you

It's evident that you never were fully person
In a composition
Holding in what you really want
Left no evidence that you were listening
It's evident that you never were fully person

In a composition
Holding in what you really want
Left no evidence that you were listening

You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you
You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you
You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you
You're undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you
