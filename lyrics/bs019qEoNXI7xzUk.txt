I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh give me time (2x)
Oh just like they said

I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing (2x)

I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh give me time (2x)
Oh just like they said

I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing (2x)
