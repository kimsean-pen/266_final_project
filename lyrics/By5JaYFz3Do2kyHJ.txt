(oh)

So you think about leavin her
And givin it all up for another girl
Who is on your mind

You're tired and wanna change
You're just another step from causing pain
You wanna give up cause it's on your mind

Please stop this crazy madness,
There's so much more to say
Please start to see what's happenin,
You're throwing it all away
You're just completely blind
Please stop, please change your mind

(oh) You got
(oh) What you
(oh) Needed
You want more
You take (oh)
To see it (oh)
You need it
You want more
She is (oh)
Cheated (oh)
Defeated (oh)
You want more
You got (oh)
What you (oh)
Needed (oh oh oh)

You're never ever satisfied
Lookin for something that'll make you high
You're sad cause it's on your mind

I'm tired of hearing you
Say that you gotta get something new again
Cause it's on your mind

Please stop this crazy madness,
There's so much more to say
Please start to see what's happenin,
You're throwing it all away
You're just completely blind
Please stop, please change your mind

(oh) You got
