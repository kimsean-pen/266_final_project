Don't breathe, there's no oxygen here
Only ammonia to suffocate fear
And the pastures are flooded
And all the soil is sour
And the trees are brittle
And so are the flowers
All dried up just an empty shell
Away on the wind being blown to hell
What happened, it was all going so well

Sweet golden rose, don't ever rust
Be ever so delicate, when lending your trust
And don't come apart at the seams
Sweat the nightmares, live in the dreams
Be anything you believe
Be anything you believe

We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland

Don't leave, there's nothing out there to see
Everything is murdered, there's no mystery
And history's eyes, they have seen it all
It's a Modern Ruin and we are responsible
It's bleak and we are pale
We are the savages of a future fail
No sun, no stars, just endless nights
Repeat prescriptions of drunken fights
What happened to us, under these neon lights

Sweet golden rose, don't ever lust
Be ever so delicate, when lending your trust
And don't come apart at the seams
Sweat the nightmares, live in the dreams
Be anything you believe
Be anything you believe

We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland

We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland
We don't belong in a wasteland

Sweet golden rose, don't ever lust
Be ever so delicate, when lending your trust
And don't come apart at the seams
Sweat the nightmares, live in the dreams
Be anything you believe
Be anything you believe

We don't belong in a wasteland
You don't belong in a wasteland
You don't belong in a wasteland
