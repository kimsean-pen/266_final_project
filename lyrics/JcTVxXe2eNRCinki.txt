You know why I don't want see you
Remember when we went to the bay
You had your car so we thought we'd go
Since it was such a nice day

I remember walking with you to the rocks
Not knowing what you had in mind
I closed my eyes to make a wish
But opened them up to find

You'd slipped away and I wondered where
Thinking you'd return, I thought I would stay
But after a while you hadn't returned
Then it didn't seem such a nice day

I remember sitting there on the rocks
Not knowing you had gone away
I was sitting there on my own
Wiping the tears away

Go away
I wish you would go away
I want you to go away
I wish you would go

You've come to ask me how I am
But I don't want to see you today
You said it was fun but I cannot smile
I just wish that you would go away

I still remember sitting there on the rocks
Not knowing you had gone away
I was sitting there on my own
Wiping the tears away

Go away
I wish you would go away
I want you to go away
I wish you would go away
