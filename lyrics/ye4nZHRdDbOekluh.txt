I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains and
And the walking of the cranes
When you, do come out
And you whisper up to me
In your life of tragedy

But I cannot grow
Till you eat the last of me
Oh, when will I be free?

And you
A parasite
Just find another host
Just another fool to roast, 'cause

You!
My tapeworm tells me what to do

You!
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!

I cannot deny
All the evil traits
And the filling of the crates
When you (you), do come out (out)
And you slither up to me
In your pimpin majesty

But I cannot grow
Till you eat the last of me
Oh, when will I be free?

And you (you)
A parasite (site)
Just find another host
Just another stool to post, 'cause

You!
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You!
My tapeworm tells where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of me...

I'm sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying man

Sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying MAN! (OH!!)

You!
My tapeworm tells me what to do

You!
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey!
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass,
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!.
