Love with my will
Love just what I can
Blood, it's all there is
In times of trial and loneliness
Too dark for finding my ground
And trees shiver and sway
If you ever seen something go down
To keep in mind all of your days
Lord you know where I been
And you know why I came
Look, I'm all done in
Pray don't send me back again
Tell her I wanted to say goodbye
Before the light was dead and gone
Tell her I didn't want to lie
Left here well enough alone
Lord you know where I been
And only you know why I came
Blood, it's all there is
Pray don't send me back again
If I stayed away too long
Many times I lost my way
If you ever been skeleton low
If you ever heard somebody say
Baby, baby
Don't you know about love
