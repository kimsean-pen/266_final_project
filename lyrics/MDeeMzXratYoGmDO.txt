I'm working on a reduction plan.
It's something i just don't understand.
Puzzled by the math of it, adding and subtracting me.
I know exactly what i'm trying to do
But explanation makes me a fool.
Not afraid to be absurd; i'm just not sure what it's worth.
Examination will make it clear
These problems will only reappear.
Making science out of it, it's just lacking evidence.
Puzzled by the math of it, adding and subtracting me.
