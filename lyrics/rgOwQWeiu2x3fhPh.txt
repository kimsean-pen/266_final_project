Mmm, I like you
When I see you on my screen
We should be talking
I wonder how you speak
And when you're dancing
I bet you dance with two left feet
Like me, like me
And oh you're on your own out there
Wondering if someone could care
And I am on my own out here, too
Like you
So if you're lonely
Unload it all on me

And if you tell me
I'm sworn to secrecy
If you're lonely come and hold me I wanna be lonely with you
I know you're lonely
Come over, let me see
You're not the only one suffering silently
If you're lonely come and hold me I wanna be
lonely with you (I wanna be lonely with you)
I know you're somewhere
Somewhere you don't wanna be
Waiting for someone
Who'd understand you like me I like what you're wearing
With your hair in a mess
You're in bed and you couldn't care less
I see you on your own out there
I'm telling you somebody cares
And I am on my own out here, too
Like you
So if you're lonely
Unload it all on me
And if you tell me
I'm sworn to secrecy
If you're lonely come and hold me I wanna be lonely with you
I know you're lonely
Come over, let me see
You're not the only one suffering silently
If you're lonely come and hold me
I wanna be lonely with you I wanna be lonely,
I wanna be lonely with you I wanna
be lonely,
I wanna be lonely with you (I wanna be lonely with you) I wanna
be lonely, I wanna be lonely with you (I wanna be lonely with you)
I see you on your own out there
I'm telling you somebody cares
And I am on my own out here, too
So if you're lonely
Unload it all on me
And if you tell me
I'm sworn to secrecy
If you're lonely come and hold me
I wanna be lonely with you
I know you're lonely
Come over, let me see
You're not the only one suffering silently
If you're lonely come and hold me I wanna be
lonely with you (I wanna be lonely with you)
