Let? s sail away, find our own country
We? ll build a house and get tired of palm trees
Let? s get away, let? s push our lives aside

I? ll sport a smile, take in some color
Under the stars, I? ll be your lover
With no distractions, I? m gonna treat you right

And it seems like things are only getting better
Well, it seems like we can never catch a break

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

Let? s go to bed, let? s stop debating
Look at the time, we? re always waiting
But we? re in love and that should be just fine

And it seems like things are only getting better
Well, it seems like we can never catch a break

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

And if you like and if you like, some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive, if we survive, get out alive
I? d like to say how beautiful I think you are

And if you like and if you like, some other time
I would like to introduce you to the finer things
If we survive, if we survive, get out alive
I? d like to say how beautiful I think you

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away
