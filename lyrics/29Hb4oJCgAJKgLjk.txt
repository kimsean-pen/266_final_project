My way in London, Americana
The persona, it's primadonna
Kick a motherfucker to the cizzurb
You think you crazy, I'm berserk

I'm off the chain, you gotta love it
I can't express enough, how bad I want it
Maybe one day, I wanna be there
Beyond the stars, like a zillionaire

I brought my clique up in here
Put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want
But we gon' take this everywhere

Don't pay them, no never mind
You're just a waste of time
Baby watching from the sideline

While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life

I see the lights, see the money
Super glamorous
Fresh off the runway
Wanna be infamous

Notorious as directed
According to us, whisky nights
Gettin' it in to tear blowing money fast
Get it again

Maybe one day I'll live there
Beyond the stars
Like a zillionaire
I brought my clique up in here
Now put your diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want
But we gon' take this everywhere

Don't pay them, no never mind
You're just a waste of time
Baby watching from the sideline

While I roc the li li la la li li life
While I roc the li li la la li li life
While I roc the li li la la li li life
While I roc the li li la la li li life
While I roc the life

Oh oh, we're gon' make this day last forever
Oh oh, I'll make this the night to remember
No surrender

Write my name on stars
So you can see it
Wherever you are
Please believe it
I'mma take it all
Ain't gonna stop
Until I fall fall fall fall

Write my name on stars
So you can see it
Wherever you are
Please believe it
I'ma take it all
Ain't gonna stop
Until I

Oh, I wanna roc the life
While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life li li la la li li life
While I roc the life
