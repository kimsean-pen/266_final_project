Walk little walk
Small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want

That street, two streets
I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings

Count high, low
Don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show

One shoe, two
Gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes
Yeah, yeah

I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things

(These are those times where we're gonna have a lot of fun)

I run, they run
Everybody run, run
And we're all just having fun

Sleigh ride, boat ride
Piggy back ride
I'm gonna show them all how I can ride

One, two, three
Close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door

Crayon on the walls
I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law
Yeah, yeah

I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things

Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
With me!
