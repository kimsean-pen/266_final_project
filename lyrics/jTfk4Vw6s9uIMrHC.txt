He's my man and his minds
made up in blue
All those friends he's been talking to
His kiddin' ways are coming to an end now
Your only kind is waiting for it's time
But I don't know
my minds made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to
The scars on his hands are glowing like his eyes now
As he grips on to another day
Ones with better times have gone by now
Better times are when you're in control
His second rate ravings don't thrill me
Even if they did some time before
Only his blue eyes still drill me
As I get to know my friend the floor
