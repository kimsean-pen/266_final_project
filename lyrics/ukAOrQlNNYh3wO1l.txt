Tonight, I'm not about to waste no time, for only one night
You don't have to fantasize
I'll be right beside
I can be the girl you like, the one in your dreams
I'll be the one you desire

I'm not saying you go crazy, chasing everybody down
I'm just playing 'cause I know that I'm the best loving around
I'm in heaven every time you lay your body next to me
You're in heaven, you keep coming back 'cause now you're in too deep

Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing as good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Now that you surrender
Nobody's gonna get you
A love as good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Now that you surrender
Nobody's gonna get you
A love as good as my loving, and my loving, and

Tonight, you don't need an alibi, it's all in your mind
You just need to close your eyes, I'll let you drive
So think about the other girls but you can't deny
It's what you got is the best love, in the whole wide world

Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing as good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Now that you surrender
Nobody's gonna get you
A love as good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Now that you surrender
Nobody's gonna get you
A love as good as my loving, and my loving, and

I'm not saying you go crazy, chasing everybody down
I'm just playing 'cause I know that I'm the best loving around
I'm in heaven everytime you lay your body next to me
You're in heaven, you keep coming back but now you're in too deep

Nothing brings the fire
And nothing gets you higher
Ain't nothing good as my loving, and my loving, and my loving
Now that you surrender
Nobody's gonna get you
A love as good as my loving, and my loving, and
