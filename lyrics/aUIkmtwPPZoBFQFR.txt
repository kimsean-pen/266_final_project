Lonely is the night
When you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light
And your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night
When there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right
Say the writin's on the wall

It's a high time to fight
When the walls are closin' in
Call it what you like
This time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Your spirit's sinkin' down
You find you're not the only
Stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind
You been stealin' shots from the side
Let your feelin's go for a ride

There's danger out tonight
The man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite
The boys are set to prowl
Lonely is the night
When you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight
Do you wanna take it all
Slowdown, showdown, waitin' on line
Showtime, no time changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down

Somebody's watchin' you baby
Not much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby
From makin' it two
One glimpse'll show you now baby
What the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby
It can happen to you

No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin' first on our minds
No more lazin' 'round the tv
You'll go crazy, come out with me

When you're lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night
Well you don't have to be lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night
