Would you wake up, from your hole, and let it go
Collecting furniture, from your soul, to let it all wash away
Slip up, the way you move your tongue, to words like you belong
The waters catching up, on us

Giving up
Everything belongs in its place
Moving on
Picking up and finding new space

Mirrored makeup, on your lips, you make it known
Lonely days gone, to find your home, cause everybody's lost his way
Say you've calmed it down
When people are around

Giving up
Everything belongs in its place
Moving on
Picking up and finding new space
Giving up

Everything belongs in its place
Moving on
Picking up and finding new space

(Port Culture)
Hang your feet down, on the bridge, nowhere to go
River rushed loud, from your soul, float on and go

Giving up
Everything belongs in its place
Moving on
Picking up and finding new space

Giving up
Everything belongs in its place
Moving on
Picking up and finding new space
