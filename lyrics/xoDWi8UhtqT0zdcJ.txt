I thought you knew,
I had to stay away from you
I thought you heard,
Yeah still you have the power
You can't be here
How long do you disappear
Don't wanna be the best one here
But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words, that pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one, and I won't say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Don't keep me with the kisses,
There's never any doubts when i need you
It's just that you can always make me feel like I am slipping in way too deep
And let the shadows hope to hide or break the dreaming, dreaming of us
And if I keeá¹— slipping in, just keep up with the talking
Know that I'm with you, I'm not about to go

But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one, and I won't say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away

But you give me the
But you give me up
But you give me the
But you give me up

But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one, and I won't say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one, and I won't say no
You give me a reason, so I never go
Sweet talk
Give me the sweet talk
