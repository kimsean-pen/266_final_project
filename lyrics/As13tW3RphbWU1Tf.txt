I wanna tell you about something
You don't talk to me anymore
Wanna share you my animal's desires
You don't talk to me anymore

I need to show you what I'm like
Or I've achieved or what I have understood
Then you might tell you're proud of me
But you don't talk to me anymore

I want to show you my words on paper
But you don't talk to me anymore
Just wanna say that I am sorry
But you don't talk to me anymore

I need to show you what I'm like
Or I've achieved or what I have understood
Then you might tell you're proud of me
But you don't talk to me anymore
But you don't talk to me anymore
But you don't talk to me anymore

Ahhhh

Ahhh

I wanna tell you about something
