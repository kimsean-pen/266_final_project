I've got this friend, I don't think you know him
He's not much for words, he's hidden his heart away
Oh, I've got this friend, a loveless romantic
All that he really wants is someone to want him back

Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, if the right one came along

I've got this friend, I don't think you know her
She sings a simple song that sounds a lot like his
I've got this friend holding onto her heart
Like it's a little secret, like it's all she's got to give

Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, if the right one came along

It'd be such a shame if they never meet
She sounds lovely, he sounds right out of a dream
If only, if only, if only

Oh, if the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, (I've got this friend)
If the right one came
If the right one came along
Oh, (I've got this friend)
If the right one came along
