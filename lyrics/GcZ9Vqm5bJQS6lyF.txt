Hello my name is Mr Reasonable
Always willing to lend an ear
I am amazed by all your senseless talking
And the silly notions I hear

You said nothing
Nothing can change your mind

Some fools believe there's gonna be a change
Still I do not believe anymore
They say a brand new world is coming our way
Yes, we've heard that story before

Facts and figures
There's no spirit at all

Our world is so real, is so terribly real
That I never dreamed it could be
It may fulfill the dreams of engineers
But it will not do for me
