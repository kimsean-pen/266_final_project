In a little cottage in the countryside
Lives a man named Harry
And he is losing his mind

Listen... Hear the Spider's Lullaby

It's really sad for Harry, He finds a spider scary
Even the smallest species will make him feel uneasy
Oh, they live in every corner
Oh, and here comes another

There's another spider on his wall... Gotta kill it!
Soon to be another creamy spot

As he woke up this morning, there was a spider crawling
He felt a big suprise before it caught his eyes
Oh, it was between his face
Oh, and his pillow case

There's another spider on his wall... Gotta kill it!
Soon to be another creamy spot

Here comes another one... Hahahahahahaha

He's got to find a doctor, a very special doctor
Someone who can cure his mind
Someone who knows Harry's kind

Listen... Hear the Spider's Lullaby

Those creepy crawly creatures
With all thier hairy features
Hoping to catch a fly
Singing it's deadly lullaby

Oh... Oh, NO...

There's another spider on his wall... Gotta kill it!
