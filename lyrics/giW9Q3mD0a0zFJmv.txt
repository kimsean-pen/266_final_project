I'm looking for a face to attack
it could be that im kissing your kneck
you will not know because im laid back
so watch yourself i'll come with a smack

I've hit you hard it's time for some bounce
i've left a scar there's blood in our dance
i rock the club straphobia stance
now fix yourself your heart's in my lungs

Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose
Sip on something sleepy why not get a little overdose

What can you find in parade
what can you find a rave
what can be drunk in a dream
what can be dreampt in a dream

It's all a tech it's all a tongue talk
i'll spell it out just pass me the chalk
if i could teach you soon would be taught
we're looking for something to report

What can you find in parade
what can you find a rave
what can be drunk in a dream
what can be dreampt in a dream
