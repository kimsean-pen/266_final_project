There's a sunspot in my eye
There's a guild of thieves that weighs me down
There's a darkness within our reach
And roots that reach beneath
And in this darkness shall we crawl?
Overwhelmed by the void

Conjuring darkness black like coal
Let the fire hatch out let the pain unfold
Our life passes like idle chatter
Life ebbs out like children stutter

There's a sunspot in my soul
A millstone round my heart and a Judas kiss
There's a darkness coming in
A golden troth for your emptiness
And we stray through infinite nothing
Haunted by our deadweight dreams

Conjuring darkness black like coal
Let the fever hatch out let the moth unfold
Our love passes like idle chatter
Life ebbs out like children stutter

Where there's a will there's a way
But there's no will and the path led astray
