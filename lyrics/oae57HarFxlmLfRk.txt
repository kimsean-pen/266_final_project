Pretending I am a worm
Has proved all too easy
Well I sense some problem with Eric
It's the kind of smoke that could make us invisible
To see the things and I haven't seen you lately (Okay!)
And the purple that I dove into (Aught!)
Was a version of my mind relaxing (Alright!)
And you know to smile to catch my door still [?]

So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
Things'll get better

But where's a kindred word like defined word play (I know!)
With the children that could make us a house (Uh-oh!) [?]
You sew my face into a permanent crush high (Love you!)
I play with something harsher behind the news stands [?]

So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
So do you, so do you, so do you,
Love me, love me, love me.
Things'll get there

Sun, it's nice in the breeze
Ghosts are out looking for pennies in the trees (I know!)
There are picnic days a-pushing me pushing me
It is over
