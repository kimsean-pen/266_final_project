This is your time
Your life's flashing before your eyes
And soon enough you will realize, this is goodbye
But what if I gave you a chance?
You just have to sell your soul

Look around
What do you see?
The choices you never had the guts to make?
I'm sorry you never could be the man that you wanted
But regret is wasted on me

I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you

This feeling's amazing, I know
But be careful, you know not what you wish for
Granted life again but now you've cheated death
There's no where to run when you run from yourself

But fear not for as long as you live you are mine
And even in death you will find
You've lived with regret for so long but now
Is your chance to change what has been wrong

I can feel air inside my lungs again
All because of you
I can rebuild my life and start again
All because of you

And I know that my destiny wasn't written in the stars
It was just a part of satellites and it's all because of you
And it's all because of you

Don't ever trust the devil, bitch!

I never wanted this
(It's time that you suffered the consequence)
I should have know my time was up
(I gave you your time, now your soul is mine)

I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead
All because of...
You!

All because of you!
I can't feel air inside my lungs, I'm dead!
All because of you!
I can't rebuild my life and start again
All because of you!
All because of you!
All because of...
