My dear, don't leave me now
Close at the edge of my end
All this time you have been my friend
Don't go, stay for a while

My dear, you're losing me now
This will be my last hour
Hear my voice, see my face
See how sick I am
How I long for your embrace

"there's no such thing as a natural death
nothing that happens to man is ever natural
since his presence calls the whole world into question
all men must die, but for every man his death is an accident
and even if he knows it in a sense to it an unjustable violation
whether you may agree with the words or not
but those are, the key-spring of the lord of the rings..."
