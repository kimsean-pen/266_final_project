I thought the future would be cooler

Crowdsourced cults, all lit up on LED:
Next thing you know, you're sipping on a battery
Infinitely scroll through a SWAT team on the sidewalk
Serving death by remote control and unrestricted sidearms

I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the future would be cooler
I thought the brave world would be newer
I thought the future would be cooler

Loving comes easy
(Nothing new)
But liking it ain't free.
(Underneath the sun)
We save our face in public
(I can't save you)
While we erase each other privately.
(You're already gone)

Got my broken heart—
I got it sold right back to me—
By an algorithmic social entity!

I thought the future would be cooler. I thought the brave world would be newer

Looking for the edge of our unrendered world. I don't know what we'll find; Oh, here comes tomorrow!

I thought the future would be cooler.
