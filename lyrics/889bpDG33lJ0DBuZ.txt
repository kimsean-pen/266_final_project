We use to walk
Use to walk like we were free
We, we use to laugh
Use to laugh because we never knew
Come with me

I'll show you
Everything you wanted
Come with me
I'll show you
Everything you wanted
We use to walk

Use to walk like we were free
We, we use to laugh
Use to laugh because we never knew

Come with me
I'll show you
Everything you wanted
Come with me
I'll show you
Everything you wanted

Lying on the ground
Closing eyes
Lying on the ground
Closing eyes
(If it's all you wanted)

Come with me
I'll show you
(it's all you need)
Everything you wanted
(It's all you wanted)
Come with me
I'll show you
(It's all you need)
Everything you wanted

Closing eyes
Closing eyes
