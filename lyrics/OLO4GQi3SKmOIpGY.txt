get out of bed
put on some clothes
and find your shoes
at least theres nothing more
ou could really lose, now is there?
drink a cup
had enough
the sky don't shine on me anymore
since i been staring here at this floor for too many days
lost my way
god on this train is runnin away
its carried me this far, but now i can't stay
now, ohhhh-ohhhh
pretty bad magic
pretty tragic
on a runaway train
and i'm not going insane
things just don't stay the same, and i must find a new way
make the best
of death
and love what's left
you're not just a timebomb
just cause you went off don't mean you're scattered everywhere
it's still there, in the palms of your hands
just give it one more chance
don't wait to understand
just find a new way
pretty bad magic
pretty tragic
on a runaway train
and i'm not going insane
things just don't stay the same, and i must find a new way
one more day
my soul can give
it'll work out for me
when i need the man makes the blind see
through me
see through me
see through me
