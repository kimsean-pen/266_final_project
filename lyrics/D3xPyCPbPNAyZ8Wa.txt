I fell in your arms tonight
I fell hard in your arms tonight
It was nice
I died in your arms tonite
I slipped through into the afterlife
It was nice
White light in your arms tonight
I lost sight in your arms tonight
It was nice

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kind of cute
That I (I) died (died) right inside your arms tonight
That I'm fine even after I have died
Because it was in your arms I died

I cry in the after life
I cry hard because I have died and you're alive
I try to escape afterlife
I try hard to get back inside your arms alive

And hey (hey), you (you)
Don't you think it's kind of cute
That I (I) tried (tried) to escape the afterlife
That I (I) tried (tried) to get back in your arms alive
That I died in your arms that night

I fell hard in your arms
I went and died in your arms that night

I fell in your arms tonight
Suicide in your arms

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kind of cute
That I (I) died (died) right inside your arms tonight
That I'm fine even after I have died
That I (I) tried (tried) to escape the afterlife
That I (I) tried (tried) to get back in your arms alive
That I died in your arms that night
I fell in your arms tonight
I died in your arms tonight
I died in your arms tonight
I fell in your arms tonight
