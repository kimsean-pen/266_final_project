Where are you now?
And I've been checking out
All the places that you might be at

Well this is my town
Word gets around
And I don't think you have a hideout

This life's a tune
We know the news
But you've been working with two left feet so

What are you waiting for?
Who knows anymore?
I think your best days have come and gone

I swear
I don't really wanna talk it out
This life is a battle ground
Who really wants to hear the sound that comes out of your mouth?

Every now and then
You show up again
Talking of how all is forgiven

Well mines a Jameson
And I'll be patient
Blocking out all that you're saying
All you've heard before
Cause I, I've gotta know

I swear
I don't really wanna talk it out
This life is a battle ground
Who really wants to hear the sound that comes

And I swear
I don't really wanna talk it out
This life is a battle ground
Who really wants to hear the sound that comes out of your mouth?

I swear
I don't really wanna talk it out
This life is a battle ground
Who really wants to hear the sound that comes

And I swear, swear, swear you don't own me
Swear, swear, swear you don't own me
