It wasn't the rain that washed away
Rinsed out the colors of your eyes
Putting the gun down on the bedside table
I must have realized

It wasn't the rain that made no difference
And I could have sworn it wasn't me
Yet I did it all so coldly almost slowly
Plain for all to see

Oh c'mon please now talk to me
Tell me, things I could find helpful
How can I stop now? Is there nothing I can do?
I have lost my way, I've been losing you

I can still hear our screams competing
You're hissing your s's like a snake
Now in the mirror stands half a man
I thought no one could break

It wasn't the rain that made no difference
Nervously drumming on run away
But I want the guilt to get me
Thoughts to wreck me, preying on my mind

So, please now talk to me
Tell me, things I could find helpful
How can I stop now? Is there nothing I can do?
I have lost my way, I've been losing you

Please now talk to me
Tell me, things I could find helpful
How can I stop now? Is there nothing I can do?

Please now talk to me
Tell me, tell me what to do helpful
How can I stop now? Is there nothing I can do?
I have lost my way, I've been losing you, you
I've been losing you, you I've been losing you

(That's right)

Gotta run away from you
