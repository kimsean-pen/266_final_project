It's where I keep my heart
Where I plant my roots
Where my soul comes from
Where I learned to sing the blues
Raised on the saving grace
How to live and love
My secret hiding place
When the world's too much

Let the new shine fade
Let the lights burn out
Let the time slip away
And bury me in that ground

When I'm all used up
And I'm old and grey
When the well runs dry
And my mind just ain't the same
Won't you set me free
Where the tall pines stand
Where I was born to be
Back in my homeland

The world may change
But this whole town's still the same
There's that old dirt road
Next to that run down bank
There sits a beat up truck
In my dad's backyard
I can still hear it run
And we used to drive it hard

Let the new shine fade
Let the lights burn out
Let the time slip away
And bury me in that ground

When I'm all used up
And I'm old and grey
When the well runs dry
And my mind just ain't the same
Won't you set me free
Where the tall pines stand
Where I was born to be
Back in my homeland

Homeland
Wild and free
In my homeland
Where I was born to be

Where I keep my heart
Where I plant my roots
Where my soul comes from
Where I run back to
Where I keep my heart
Where I plant my roots
Where my soul comes from
Where I run back to

When I'm all used up
And I'm old and grey
When the well runs dry
And my mind just ain't the same
Won't you set me free
Where the tall pines stand
Where I was born to be
Back in my homeland

Homeland
(Back in my, back in my homeland)
In my homeland
(Back in my, back in my homeland)
Where I was born to be
Back in my homeland
(Back in my homeland)
In my homeland
Where I was born to be
