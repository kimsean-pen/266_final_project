You already know this won't end with kisses
You already see you won't spare one another

But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there

It's easy on the ear but it's hard on you
You are no exception you won't end in the castle

But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time not getting there
But we'll have fine time
But we'll have fine time not getting there
