You might find out
Sometimes again
Things aren't quite, as they seem
And remembering the time
I thought when you were mine
But turning things out, I'm just your memory

I'll do what I want for you
Oh won't you tell me
I'll do what I want for you

And you know that we can make believe
The troubled past that we've carried through
The times we had in December
The love we had is gone
Now to me child, you're a memory

I'll do what I want for you
Oh won't you tell me
I'll do what I want for you
Somebody tell me please
I'll do what I want for you
I'll do what I want for you

When you wake up
And your mind is made up
All the things you leave are now left behind
Finding out the truth
How I belong to you
Now to me well
We're just a memory

I'll do what I want for you
Will someone tell me please
I'll do what I want for you
Won't you tell me child
I'll do what I want for you
Oh won't you tell me
I'll do what I want for you
