Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands
The symbol of enlightenment
The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free

Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain
There is something stronger than mortal flesh
That unites us as one

For those about to fight for metal;
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade;
We're blood brothers till the end

The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall

Let me hear your battlecry!
Raise your swords up high!

For those about to fight for metal;
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade;
We're blood brothers till the end

For those about to fight for metal;
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade;
We're blood brothers till the end
Blood brothers till the end.
