ooh, ooh, ooh oh
ooh, ooh, ooh oh

You're my desire
And this I've always known
You've been admired
And do you see me glow

Take me as I am, take me as I am
Don't wanna be left alone
Take me in your arms, take me in your hands
Love me like we used to know
And I see it
And i feel it now
That I want you
And I need you my
Desire
Desire
Oooh, my desire

We stick together
From a kiss I've met before
And blindly your lover
It's a curse I still adore

Take me as I am, take me as I am
Don't wanna be left alone
Take me in your arms, take me in your hands
And love me like we used to know
And I see it
And i feel it now
That I want you
And I need you my
Desire
Desire
Oooh, my desire

And I need you now
And i need you now
And I need you now
And I need you now
