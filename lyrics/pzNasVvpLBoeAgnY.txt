I felt a change
Within me
I never felt something
So deeply
I felt your heart

And life
It smiled at me
And the day you were gone
It's been hurting ever since

Oh I loved you baby
More than you'll ever know
And the pain that's inside of me
I never never let go
Forgive me forgive me
Forgive me for what I've done
And I won't blame it blame it
Blame it on anyone
For I carry you still
Years go by
I regret
Take what you can
Nothing
Can replace
I'm stuck in the dark
No lights
It won't save me
And the days you're not here
Life will never be the same

Oh I loved you baby
More than you'll ever know
And the pain that's inside of me
I never never let go
Forgive me forgive me
Forgiv me for what I've done
And I won't blame it blame it
Blame it on anyone
