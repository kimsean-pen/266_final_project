The moon is hanging low, over the central station
I watch the buses leave in silence, bound for foreign distant places
The Andes hold me close
A mothers only son
I feel weightless in the valley
Like I'm everywhere at once

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

We came here abandoned
An old brick faced apartment
Rusted swing set in the courtyard, like the one that I was born in
I'm guarded like I'm wounded, my first instinct's always "run"

I wanna turn the scene
I wanna call it off
I wanna lighten the dark
I wanna swallow the sun

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home

I was just mangy skin and bone
You took me into your home
Kept warm on a blanket from your worn out winter coat

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

I'm laying low
A stray dog in the street
You took me home
We're sister cities

We're sister cities
