The biggest lie you ever told
Your deepest fear 'bout growin' old
The longest night you ever spent
The angriest letter you never sent
The boy you swore you'd never leave
The one you kissed on new years eve
The sweetest dream you had last night
Your darkest hour, your hardest fight

I wanna know you
Like I know myself
I'm waitin' for you
There ain't no one else
Talk to me baby
Scream and shout
I wanna know you

Inside out

I wanna dig down deep

I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out

I wanna take my time
I wanna know your mind

You know there ain't no doubt

I wanna know you inside out
The saddest song you ever heard

The most you said with just one word
The loneliest prayer you ever prayed
The truest vow you ever made
What makes you laugh, what makes you cry?
What makes you mad, what gets you by?
Your highest hight, your lowest low
These things I wanna know
I wanna know you
Like I know myself yeah
I'm waitin' for you
There ain't no one else
Talk to me baby
Scream and shout
I wanna know you
Oh inside out
I wanna dig down deep
I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna take my time
I wanna know your mind
You know there ain't no doubt
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna know your soul
I wanna lose control
C'mon n' let it out
I wanna know you inside out
I wanna dig down deep
I wanna lose some sleep
I wanna scream and shout
I wanna know you inside out
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
I wanna know you inside out
Tell me everything baby
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Tell me everything, baby
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Yeah, I wanna know you inside out
Tell me everything
I wanna know you inside out
