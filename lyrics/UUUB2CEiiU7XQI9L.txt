Lov-in'
I can make it better
for you
all day and all night

Said lov-in'
I can make it better
for you

Wipe those tears from your eyes
Don't you worry
Girl I know just what you've been through
I understand
his love has been spread too thin
Too much to keep a woman like you

I just wanna say
Lov-in'
I can make it better
for you
all day and all night

Said Lov-in'
I can make it better
for you

I'm on the road to your heart
Girl I'm packin'
just what you need in your life
Don't need no short cuts to your love
All that's over
With me it's gonna be alright

I just wanna say
Lov-in'
I can make it better
for you
all day and all night

Said lov-in'
I can make it better for you (you)

Said all night
I can make it better
for you

Said all right (all right)
I can make it better
for you
