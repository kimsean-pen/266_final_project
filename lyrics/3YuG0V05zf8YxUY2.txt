Clouds roll by
Reeling is what they say ... or is it just my way
Wind blows by ...
Low light ... sidetracked ... low light
Can't see my tracks, your scent way back

Can I be here all alone? ... clear a path to my home
Blood runs dry
Books and jealousy tell me wrong
I will feel calm
Voice blows by
Low light ... car crash ... low light
Can't wear my mask, your first, my last

Voice blows by
Two birds is what they'll see ... getting lost upon their way
Wind blows by ...
Low light ... eye sight ... low light
I need the light, I'll find my way from wrong
What's real, the dream I see
