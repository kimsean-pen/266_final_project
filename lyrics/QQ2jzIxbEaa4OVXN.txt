Movies like zoos
Try another me and I will
Try another you
Or put my arms around you
Like I think you want me to
But tell me what you're thinking
I so often misconstrue

Treading water
Treading white wine
Seeing borders seeing straight lines
I get these feelings that I don't have much time
Always rushing always late (x2)

Movies like zoos

I talk to missionaries when they're standing at my door
They tell me what I should be reading I still can't see what for
We both stand there politely trying to change each other's core

When other angels float by
They seem likely to fall from the sky
What I want is difficult I must try
I see traces when you walk

Other voices when you talk
When you talk

When other angels float by
They seem likely to fall from the sky
What I want is difficult I must try
I see traces when you walk

Treading water
Treading white wine
Seeing borders seeing straight lines
I get these feelings that I don't have much time

Always rushing always late (x2)
always late (x2)
I'm always rushing
always late (x4)
I'm always rushing (x2)
always late
