I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's sventeen black and twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter
How far fron the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you

A good man's is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red

A long dead soldier looks out
From the frame
No one remembers his war
No one remembers his name

Go out to the meadow
Scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here,
And nothing will grow

A good man's is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is
And my favorite color is
And my favorite color is red
