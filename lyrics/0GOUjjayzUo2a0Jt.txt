Where have you been, Virginia?
There was a time when you stood by my side
Through dark and dire days

But now you're cold and you're cursing your words
And now you're throwing our love to the birds
Or is there somebody else that you're dreaming, of?

I used to think we could make it all the way
I used to carry our love in a fire-safe
But now it's gone! And I'm a ghost!

Baby, look, why ain't you calling me?
I'll give it up, and you could have all of me
I don't wanna go home!

Walking around the same lines
To get a taste of everlasting life like what we knew before

But now your mama don't want you with me
And I'm the apple that fell from the tree
You're turning into a stone but I still love you

Somebody show me if there's another way
I never saved any love for a rainy day
The radio, another sun-rise!

The radio, another sun!

Baby, look, why ain't you calling me?
I'll give it up, and you could have all of me
I don't wanna go home!

Climbing up, into your fire escape
The lights are off, but nothing that I can't wait
I don't wanna go home!

Why Virginia, please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia please I'm on my knees underwater
Virginia Please
