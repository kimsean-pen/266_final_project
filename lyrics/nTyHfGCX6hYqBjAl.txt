Immovable dance all night
I am the confuser now
Solid people, solid sound
I have time to love you now

Immovable dance all night
I am the confuser now
Solid people, solid sound
I have time to love you now

You're not the problem
I'm just waiting to get along
Your anatomy
I'm just craving to have it all

Immovable dance all night
I am the confuser now
Solid people, solid sound
I have time to love you now

Immovable dance all night
I am the confuser now
Solid people, solid sound
I have time to love you now

Immovable dance all night
I am the confuser now
Solid people, solid sound
I have time to love you now
