Quick before your nose begins to drip
Allow the heart to take another sip
Quick before my mind begins to slip
Deny the urge to make another grip
Love is not allowed to those who run
Nor is it the power of the one
But she cares and hopes away they save them for a rainy day until the world is swallowed by the sun
Quick before my mind begins to fade
Ask the moon to chase the day away
Quick before my eyes begin to faze
Allow your heart to chase the dark away
Love is not allowed to those who run
Nor is it the power of the one
But she cares and hopes away they save them for a rainy day
until the world is swallowed by the sun
Love is not allowed to those who run
Nor is it the power of the one
But she cares and hopes away they save them for a rainy day until the world is swallowed by the sun
