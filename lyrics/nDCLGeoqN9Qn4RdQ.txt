Where's your mama gone
(Where's your mama gone)
Little baby, Don?
(Little baby, Don?)

Far, far away
Far, far away-ay-ay-ay-ay

Last night I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh we, chirpy chirpy cheep cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh we, chirpy chirpy cheep cheep
Chirpy chirpy cheep cheep chirp

Where's your mama gone
