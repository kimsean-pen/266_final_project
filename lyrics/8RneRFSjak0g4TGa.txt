Siamese in today
Flustered finds me in the middle
Welding our veins to sway
With no regard to forthcoming trouble

With no regard to forthcoming trouble
With no regard to forthcoming trouble

Heights with no means to escape
Soaring coasts mixed with the rubble
Mind's eye forms fields of gray
No subtle fears, no grounds for trouble

With no regard to forthcoming trouble
With no regard to forthcoming trouble

A crane, a map, a sign for trouble
A fear, a door, a sense of gain
To film a crop, unorthodox flowers
A mind, too tall to fit unexplained

With no regard to forthcoming trouble
With no regard to forthcoming trouble
