Ooooh, ooh oh
Ooooh, ooh oh
Days we were young we took photographs of
Everything we could see
We knew we were impervious
No matter how we'd bleed
We never fought for breath
Priest and prophetess
We were nothing we would defy

Invincible skin it's how we all begin
Ooooh
Awake, awake, this is a dream state
Ooooh, ooh oh
Ooooh, ooh oh
Though we were wide wake, this is a dream state
Though we were wide wake, this is a dream state

Will we survive in this, our new wilderness?
We had nothing on our feet
We had to run from it, priest and prophetess
We were nothing we would deny

Invisible skin, where is the world within?
Invincible skin it's how we all begin
(Ooooh, ooh oh) Awake, awake, this is a dream state

Ooooh, ooh oh
Ooooh, ooh oh
This is a dream state
(Ooooh, ooh oh) Though we are wide awake

Out of the dark day into the brighter night
Out of the dark day into the brighter night
Out of the dark day into the brighter night
Out of the dark day into the brighter night
Out of the dark day into the brighter night

How do we feel?
How do we feel in that photograph of
How do we feel it again?
How do we feel?
How do we feel in that photograph of
How do we feel it again?

Days we were young we took photograph of
Everything we could be
