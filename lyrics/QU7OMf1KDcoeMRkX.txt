Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey

Voulez vous venir?

I was standin' at 7: 15
Waitin' for my baby's car
Just then, out stepped the driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far

I said, "I've got my mind made up
I don't want to leave here baby 'cause it's clear to me
That it's just too tough to find another lover like mine"

With the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no, with Mister Right, sing

Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey, hey
Do you like this car?

I just found him about a week ago
He's gonna call me on the phone and say
"I live in Paris, don't you want to go?
I know you must be all alone"

Well, it'll take more than a fancy trip
Or a chauffeured limousine 'cause I have never seen
No one who can give me lovin' like this
The other fellas don't compare

To the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no, with Mister Right, sing

Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey, rap

He's the only one to give me that lovin'
'Cause next to him there is no other one
He' very sexy, oh so sweet
And he knocks me off my feet, say it
Be fit
Ooh, yeah, let me sing it again

Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey, hey

I mean the right stuff
I got to have the right stuff, baby
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff

Say, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Right stuff
Right stuff
Said, I need it, baby
Right stuff, baby, ooh
Right stuff, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey, hey

I need the right stuff
I got to have the right stuff, baby
I don't want to miss out
Right stuff
Have you got the stuff?

Na, na, na, na
Hey, hey, hey
Right stuff
Said, I need it, baby
Right stuff
