Nothing I say's so important
That it can't be shortened
To fit on a badge
I wish that I could be God
Try to deliver a soundbite
But it is the catch

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean

Everybody applauds her
From the lord to the hordes
And the nation is swept
By a one-to-one conversation
In adult education
I would tell her except

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tounge tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Can't say you're unattractive
But I'm out of practice
In this sort of thing
It's not like I'm talking Italian
Or I wear a medallion
And a sovereign ring

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tounge tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face

Great things can be expressed
In fifteen words or less
And bring that to your heart
Words just don't do it justice
The world's inner crust
Is still drifting apart

I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
I can't say what I mean
Do you know
When you go
I get all tounge tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right

Do you know
When you go
I get all tounge tied
I'm the same
All the game
Oh and you were right
What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face
What a waste
What a face
