Tonight I watched the lights go out in your house
Wondering how I could get so deep
And you could still get sleep
In vain I blame my trembling on the cold air
But I can't hide that I've relied on you
Like yellow does on blue

And you're my
Good feeling
I'm kneeling
Inside a room she paints me blue
And you are
My reason
For breathing
Inside a room she paints me blue, again

Atlanta started raining on me
And teenage love was underground
Tonight I'll break the surface
Atlanta started raining on me
And no young girl was claiming me
Or naming me and destiny gets nervous

And you're my
Good feeling
I'm kneeling
Inside a room she paints me blue
And you are
My reason
For breathing
Inside a room she paints me blue, again

And you're my
Good feeling
I'm kneeling
Inside a room she paints me blue
And you are
My reason
For breathing
Inside a room she paints me blue, again

Atlanta started raining on me
On me
Atlanta started raining on me
On me
