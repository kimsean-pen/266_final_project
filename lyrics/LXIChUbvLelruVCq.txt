Feelin' like a millionaire
Could be going out
Could be going anywhere

We don't need those lights to see
Cameras flashing in there right where we wanna be
Don't want it all to stop
We're here and that's enough

Cause you know that there's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life
These streets are talking to me
Feels like living somebody else's life

Don't know the way to go and it doesn't matter
We could find what we need tonight
There's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life

Nothing here can bring me down
Cause the music is the heartbeat in this town
Don't worry when the morning comes
If you believe that we'd go on and on

Don't want it all to stop
We're here and that's enough

Cause you know that there's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life
These streets are talking to me
Feels like living somebody else's life

Don't know the way to go and it doesn't matter
We could find what we need tonight
There's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life

Turn the music up I don't see a red light
I can't get enough of the noise of the skylight
Find somebody else under these stars tonight
Open your eyes, open your eyes

There's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life
These streets are talking to me
Feels like living somebody else's life

Don't know the way to go and it doesn't matter
We could find what we need tonight
There's magic in this city
Feels like living somebody else's life
