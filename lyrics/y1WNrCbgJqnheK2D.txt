Wake up with this pain in my chest
Afraid you couldn't have guessed
I'm sinking faster when I'm with you
And I'm a hot mess cuz I can't pull through
You gave me everything you made me believe
But when I needed you you left I couldn't breathe
And now I'm stuck right here beneath there's no way I can escape your like a disease
I'm begging you please I'm on my knees
Come back to me
That's what I'm tired of hearing
Cuz all I hear is screaming baby
Why can't you see we aren't happy
It's killing me I'm just breaking I'm no longer healing
I'm sorry this is just how Im feeling .

When I'd wake up in the morning you just weren't there
Cuz you didn't care
Ypu went everywhere to get away from me
