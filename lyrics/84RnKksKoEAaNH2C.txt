...and here we go again
We've taken it to the end
With every waking moment
We face this silent torment

I'd sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you
Sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

Darkness...
Is all I want to see
I could never put in to words
What it is you mean to me

I'd sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you
Sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you

The candle's burning lower
At the window to my soul
The reaper's at my door now
He's come to take me home

I'd sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you
Sacrifice, sacrifice myself to you
Right here tonight
Because you know that I love you
I, I'd sacrifice
