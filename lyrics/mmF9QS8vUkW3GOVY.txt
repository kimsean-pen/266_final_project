I'm watching as the fire starts
I could be here all night
I never really wanted much
I Only ever asked for flight
And it could be you
It could be you

Rolling down the 101
I can feel eyes are bright
Watching as we come undone
Knowing that we'll be all right
And it could be you
It could be you

And I could be fire
And I could be rain
And I could be caught in everything that's inbetween

HEY!
I know we'll be okay
Despite the rolling waves
Amongst the numbered days
Cause even if we change
I know we'd never stray
Cause look how far we came
I know we'll be okay
I know we'll be okay

Knowing as the fire burns
Let it all catch alight
Growing as we take our turn
Knowing that we'll be all right
And it could be you (And I could be fire)
It could be you (And I could be rain)
And I could in everything that's in between

HEY!
I know we'll be okay
Despite the rolling waves
Amongst the numbered days
Cause even if we change
I know we'd never stray
Cause look how far we came
I know we'll be okay
I know we'll be okay

You know your words don't mean anything
It all hurts as much as a bee sting
And you know your words don't mean anything
don't mean anything
And I say...

HEY!
I know we'll be okay
Despite the rolling waves
Amongst the numbered days
Cause even if we change
I know we'd never stray
Cause look how far we came
I know we'll be okay
I know we'll be okay
