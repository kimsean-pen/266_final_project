I've lost my faith in humanity
As I spin around the sun
I'm left to wonder why
A race of intelligent creatures
Must fight for position of power
Now my soil is spoiled due to
what's become of your contention
Unnecessary, simple minded, arbitrary actions

So change your ways of hostility
And vanity and all the vices in between
Before I take it all away
The clock it's ticking pick it up, go!

All I'm trying to find
Is a way that I can show you
What you've done to me inside
You've poisoned the surface
Without any purpose
And I can bring the cold till your blood doesn't flow
Fire from my vents I can throw
Well you've done me a favor,
You saved me the labor
Now I can shed my skin
Now I can shed my skin
So I can start again

My my my, you've really done it this time
What kind of species would annihilate their only home
Oh you've dug yourself into a hole, a pit that never ends
You should know from the books that you've read
I've been through this a time or two,
The fossils were the clue I left to you
So maybe you'll take this advice and

Change your ways of hostility
And vanity and all the vices in between
Before I take it all away
Your time is quickly running out, and

All I'm trying to find
Is a way that I can show you
What you've done to me inside
You've poisoned the surface
Without any purpose
And I can bring the cold till your blood doesn't flow
Fire from my vents I can throw
Well you've done me a favor,
You saved me the labor
Now I can shed my skin

Now I can shed my skin
So I can start again

You've been with me from the beginning
(I fed you, I gave you life)
And without you I'll stop spinning
(I can't sustain my spin)

Why would you destroy what I provide?
I withhold a molten supply of ethical rehabilitation
And I reserve the right to exterminate you
When I feel the time is right
GENOCIDE!
Don't let me catch you fall out of line

All I'm trying to find
Is a way that I can show you
What you've done to me inside
You've poisoned the surface
Without any purpose
And I can bring the cold till your blood doesn't flow
Fire from my vents I can throw
Well you've done me a favor,
You saved me the labor
Now I can shed my skin
