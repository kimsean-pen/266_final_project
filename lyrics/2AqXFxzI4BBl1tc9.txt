'til the night's still cold unrest
'til the feast of blood and chaos
To the grave, as this plague won't wash away

If there's a price we had to pay
There's no controlling, there's no one else left to blame
If there is a vice with no constraints
Mankind corroding, there's no one else left to hate

My inner God, in utter chaos
A severed fraud, stripped away
My inner God, forgotten pathos

Cindery cross, is ripped away distained

'til the nights still cold unrest
'til the feast of blood and chaos
To the grave, as this plague won't wash away

If there's a price we had to pay
There's no consoling, the threat is just endless shame
If there is vice with no constraints
Mankind corroding, there's no one else left to hate

My inner God, in utter chaos
My inner God, stripped away
My inner God, in utter chaos
Cindery cross, ripped away distained

'til the nights still cold unrest
'til the feast of blood and chaos
To the grave, as this plague won't wash away

If there's a price we had to pay
There's no controlling, there's nothing else left to say
If there is vice with no constraints
Mankind corroding, there's no one else left to hate

Mankind corroding, there's no one else left to hate
