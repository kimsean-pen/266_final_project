When you care about the issues of the day
And check your facts on Wikipedia
You can get into an argument right away
If you're on social media
The world is changing everywhere
With a speed that couldn't be speedier
But you feel so ahead of the curve
When you're on social media

When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media

You're part of the conversation
You're there in every debate
From football to religion to contemporary art
You're ready to pontificate

While democracy is losing its way
And greed is getting greedier
Console yourself with a selfie or two
And post them on social media

When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media

My likes are in the thousands
My tweets are being retweeted
My family pics or holiday snaps
With total love are greeted

It's so nice when people like you
You're feeling #blessed
You're part of the conversation
It's like you've passed the test

When you're on social media
When you're on social media

And sometimes you can fuel the debate
By biting the hand that feeds ya
Expressing pure anonymous hate
When you're on social media

When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media
When you're on social media

I feel so empowered!
