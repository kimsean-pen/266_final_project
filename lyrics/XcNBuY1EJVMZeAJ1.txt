If you poke
My glass eye
I'll be the ghost
In your smile
I'll be the black tooth
In your Hollywood grin
I'm a mosquito
On your lips saying grace

You know you
Want it bad
Driven by lust
And whatever's left of motor skills
I can't make out
... Saying
But I love the way
You keep repeating it

If you poke
My glass eye
I'll be the ghost
In your smile
I'll be the ghost
In your smile
