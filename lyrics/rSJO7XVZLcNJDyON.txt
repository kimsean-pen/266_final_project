I am addicted
And You are mine
The night is moist and tender
Let us go on
And commit a crime
Give into me
Surrender

I am addicted
And you collapse
The night is old and lonely
This is the very final touch
For you my heart beats only alone
For you my heart beats only alone
For you my heart beats only

I am addicted
And you are not
The night is cold and lonely
This is the very final touch
For you my heart beats only

I am addicted
And you want more
as we grow old in silence
we got some sick and wanton years
of tenderness and violence
Of tenderness and violence more
Of tenderness and violence

I am addicted
I am addicted

I am addicted
You are mine
The night is moist and tender
Let us go on and commit a crime
Give into me
Surrender

I am addicted
And you are lost
The night is cold and lonely
This is the very final touch
For you my heart beats only alone
For you my heart beats only alone
For you my heart beats only alone
For you my heart beats only alone
