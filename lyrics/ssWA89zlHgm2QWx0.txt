Dear Father
I am hardly breathing
Oh sweet father
What is this I'm feeling?
Is this now or never?
Maybe it's forever
Or are we gonna fall, fall apart?

I hear you calling from a thousand miles
My heart stops beating when I look in your eyes
Nothing will ever be the same
Who knows who is to blame
And it feels like

I'm breathing underwater
I'm walking through the fire
It fills me up inside with light
I'm so alive
This love is taking over
Don't let me go

I'm not giving up, not running
You keep me warm inside
In you I can confide, while our hearts collide

Father, sweet father
Oh I die
I think about you every time
Nothing will ever be the same
Who knows who is to blame?

I'm breathing underwater
I'm walking through the fire
It fills me up inside with light
So alive!
This love is taking over (When love is taking over)
Don't let me go (When love is taking over)
(You built me up so I can face the night)
I'm walking through the fire
(You raise me up so I can make it right)
It fills me up inside with light (Fill me with light)
I'm so alive (Feel so alive)
This love is taking over
Don't let me go
