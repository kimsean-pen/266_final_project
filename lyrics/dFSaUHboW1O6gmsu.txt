Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel all the danger
I wanna scream, it makes me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on now, give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

Let down your defenses
Use no common sense,
if you look you will see that this world is a beautiful,
accident, turbulent, succulent, oppulent, permanent no way!
I wanna taste it, don't wanna waste it away

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby

Is it enough? Is it enough?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
Oh oh oh, I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
