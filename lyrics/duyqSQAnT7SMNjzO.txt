I see pictures in my head
A world where the suffering's dead
And they confine or adjust the arrest
Anybody, for the color of their body

Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want
Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them

Drop a hairdryer into my bath
Shocks like that make me laugh
It's fun to laugh when you're sad
Be happy, come on let me be happy

Why do you wanna go turn back time?
Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind
Why do you wanna go turn back time?
Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind
Why do you wanna go turn back time?
Come and take a ride in my psychotic mind
Why do you wanna go turn back time?
Why do you wanna go turn back time?

Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want
Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them
Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want
Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them

My mum thinks I'm on heroin
And my dad just thinks I'm gone
But they don't know fucking anything
Say "Youth is wasted on the young"

My mum thinks I'm on heroin
And my dad just thinks I'm gone
But they don't know fucking anything
Say "Youth is wasted on the young"

Wasted on the young
Wasted on the young
Wasted on the young
Wasted on the young

Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want (what they want)
Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them (control them)
Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want (what they want)
Psychotic kids, we've got to keep control of them (control them)
We've got to keep control of them
We've got to keep control of them

Psychotic kids, they don't know what they want
