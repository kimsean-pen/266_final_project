Now the past is untrue, and this breath is a lie
And the sun is an emptiness, that burns through the sky
And this ground it will slide down, down into the sea
And when this body dies, no man will ever breath one word
Of ignorance, for me
So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume

Now the earth bleeds cold water, in my open hands
But their bodies bleed poison, and they swallow the sand
And we'll walk to the river, where we will die of a thirst
And my fate, it's no question: every fool he is broken
Beneath the same holy curse
So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to burn, to sand
