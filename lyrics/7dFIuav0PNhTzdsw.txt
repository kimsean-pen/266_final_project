There's two kinds, of people in this world
The outlaws, and the lawmen that prevail
The bounty hunter's job is on the wrong side of the law
Intentions, of the truth and nothing more

Burn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three
Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin

He rides through history

The jury, in his mind the choices weigh
The trials, if you're guilty you're his prey
No judgment otherwise can change the lust

That's in his eyes
The sentence, will be carried out in stride

Burn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the town

Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun

He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three

Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin

He rides through history
No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay, the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
The money, it's the price you have to pay
When he calls, drop your eyes and look away
The man has taken life to balance scales
Of wrong and right
Existence, each day a moral fight
Burn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three
Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay, the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
All the gold
No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay, the highest fee
No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay, the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
All the gunslinger gonna... Yeah
