Goodbye to sleep
I think this staying up
Is exactly what I need
Well, take apart your bed
Take apart the counting, and the flock it has bred
Goodbye to love
Well it's a ride that will push you up
Right against the wall
(Does everybody really need to know everyone?)
Take apart your head (right against the wall)
(Do you really think you're really a part of it?
And is your army really one of some thousands?
And will you declare war on the loony bin?)
Chew it up and swallow it
You burn bright but you're running
I fell asleep in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling
I'll never get anything right
Goodbye you liar
Well you sipped from the cup but you don't own up to anything
Then you think you will inspire
Take apart your friends
(and I wish I could inspire)
Take apart your demons, in the attic to the left.
(When I arrive will God be waiting and pacing around his throne?
Will he feel a little Old Testament?
And will he celebrate with fire and brimstone
Yeah, I admit, I am afraid of the reckoning)
(Goodbye my love)
You burn bright but you run out
(You wait right here, they'll come and pick you up)
Let's sleep in the alkaline
(I've been on pause, I'm shaking off the rust)
I can't shake this little feeling
(I've lost my charge, I've been degaussed)
I'll never say anything right
I'm on my own, I'll never say anything right
(I've been degaussed)
I'm on my own, I'll never say anything right
(I've been degaussed)
I'm on my own, I'll never say anything right
(I've been degaussed)
I'm on my own, I'll never say anything right
(I've been degaussed)
Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
Say I don't mind you under my skin
I'll let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
When we were made we were set apart
But life is a test and I get bad marks
Now some saint got the job of writing down my sins
The storm is coming, the storm is coming in
You burn bright but you run out
I fell asleep in the alkaline
I can't shake this little feeling
I never did anything right
I'm on my own, I never did anything right
(I've been degaussed)
I'm on my own, I never did anything right
(I've been degaussed)
Take me, take me back to your bed
I love you so much that it hurts my head
I don't mind you under my skin
I'll let the bad parts in, the bad parts in
Well you're my favorite bird and when you sing
I really do wish you'd wear my ring
No matter what they say, I am still the king
Now the storm is coming
The storm is coming in
