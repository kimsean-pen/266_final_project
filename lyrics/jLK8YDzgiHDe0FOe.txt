Tell me off in a letter
Completely ignore me
Gettin' high off of saying
Why you don't adore me?
Baby, please

I'm well versed
In how I might be cursed
I don't need it articulated

Stand in line wastin'
All of your time just to hate me
Every dime gone to ways
You can find that might bait me
And drag me down

Sight set proudly
Bring me to the ground see
You love to be somebody's enemy

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
Machine gun, yeah

Locked and loaded
You're practically floating away now
In your fortress you feel like
You're more or less safe now
But let me say

I don't mean harm, oh
But, baby, you'd be charming
If you'd come undone, get back where you started from

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
Machine gun

Never mind how you've rationed your time
And the battle is underway
Maybe times are gonna change
Don't just hide in the silence behind
What you've really been trying to say

What a skill, baby
Aiming to kill me
With words you don't mean

Maybe nobody loved you when you were young
Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes
Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
Will you try it once, give up the machine gun?
Machine gun, yeah
