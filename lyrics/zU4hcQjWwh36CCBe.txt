Hideous on the edge of a precipice
The cavity filled up with forgetfullness
Beyond there's no retribution only war
Her society overtly...
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideologies
Left to all our creativity we must find
The real significance that wouldn't be mystified
The sense or non-sense that will emerge on a precipice
Is only the impact of the creative activity
