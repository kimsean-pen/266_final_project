Cold kisses, near misses with you
I'm trying hard to make your dreams come true
Precious relic with a jagged edge
No need for secrets, no need to pretend

Stay another season,
It's lonely when you go
I thought I spoke your language
But you don't speak it anymore

Is there a reason
This feeling has to end?
Sometimes I think it's all too much
And then there's you
Then there's you

Your constellation, celestial sphere
Another night, I needed you here
Broken promise, no fault in our stars
We're not from Venus, We're not from Mars

Stay another season,
It's lonely when you go
I thought I spoke your language
But you don't speak it anymore

Is there a reason
This feeling has to end?
Sometimes I think it's all too much
And then there's you

Stay another season,
It's lonely when you go
I thought I spoke your language
But you don't speak it anymore

Is there a reason
This feeling has to end?
Sometimes I think it's all too much
And then there's you
Then there's you

And then there's you
Then there's you
