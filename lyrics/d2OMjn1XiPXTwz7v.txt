This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day

When you walk by, the sun shine

It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow mellow, mellow, mellow day
I, I cant deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky

And everything on you intoxicates

It's a mystery,
I dont know why
I let you get in my do not disturb sign

But I guess your mouth emotion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
And you kiss me
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away,
Far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste,

Go to waste
Don't ever change your flavour cause I love the taste,
Love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavour is so original

And it all started when she said
Hey
Hey
Hey

Hey,
Smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum

You really got me when you said
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey,
Popping that Strawberry Bubblegum

This goes out to you,
This goes out to you
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting all professional, but it works out

You shouldn't wanna work herr anyway
And baby I, I,
Girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me best the recipe for a good time

And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way
Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away,
Far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste,

Go to waste
Don't ever change your flavour, cause I love the taste,
Love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
And baby please don't change nothing

Because your flavor is so original
And it all started when she said
Hey
Hey
Hey

Hey,
Smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey

Popping that Strawberry Bubblegum

Any flavor you want
Now, my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers
"You're so sweet"

Down under the door,
