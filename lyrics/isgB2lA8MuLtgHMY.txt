(You need more, you need more, you need more)
(You need more, you need more, you need more)
Boy, it's tough
Getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine
And a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck
And you don't know how
Ohhh

(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive)
A super car to get far
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful but it helps
(Don't have to buy)
A house in Beverly Hills
(Don't have to have)
Your Daddy paying the bills
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful but it helps

(You need more)
Than a big blank cheque
To be a lover or a Gulfstream jet
To fly you door to door
To somewhere chic on another shore

You need more, you need more, you need more, you need more, you need more, you need more - you need love!

You need love!

You need love!

Too much of anything
Is never enough
Too much of everything
Is never enough

Boy, it's tough
Getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine
And a boy needs a girl

It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck
And you don't know how
Ohhh

(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive)
A super car to get far
(Don't have to wear)
A smile much colder than ice
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful but it's nice

(You need more)
Than the Gerhard Richter hanging on your wall
A chauffeur-driven limousine on call
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball

(You need more, you need more, you need more)
(You need more, you need more, you need more)
You need love

I believe
That we can achieve
The love that we need
I believe
Call me naive
That love is for free
Ohhh

(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive)
A super car to get far
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful but it helps
Beautiful but it helps
Beautiful but it helps
