Come on!

Somebody give me some light
Not pointed into dark
Somebody show me the end
Not trying to push the start
I'm trying to figure out
A better way, a better answer
But I keep finding all the problems
I've been looking after
You can wander through the world
With nothing but a smile
I'll take a turn for worse
And use it to instill denial

Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Chivalry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there

Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Chivalry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there

Maybe I should look away
Before I really miss
Maybe I should pick the time
Before I pick the place
I bet you all the things
That you emulate, you penalize
But I don't wanna go
Until you learn to finalize

Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Chivalry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry, will take you there

Don't get close
You don't know me
And you'll never know
Chivalry, will get you somewhere
Rivalry

You ascertain the plot
My vision's overshot
I have the best confection
I was gone for all the lessons
Who coined these words I use
Stay out and be abused
I didn't want to be
The undeniable source of everything

Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away

Waiting, watching all the conflicts
Constrict, just to fit in, squeeze it
I cannot resist, claws and fist
Remember, remember
You take the rivalries
And never made much sense
I have the worst possession
What I want is so insensitive
Stay out and be abused
Cause this is so confused
I only want to be
Left alone, now run away

Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away
Don't get close
You'd better stay away

Yeah!
Yeah!
