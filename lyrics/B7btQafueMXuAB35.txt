On this precious evening, quiet and still
Pale stars shine upon a bed of dark red flowers
It suits them like it suits us
It's where I start believing in a world for me
An atmosphere still enveloped by young love
And all that it moves by
It's there you'll find me, stretched out in the fields
Hope you don't mind me, staying where I please
To see this beauty
It ain't real till it's sure
Let me feel the thrill of it
Each time again
Each time again

By a kind deceiving I am shown only what is pure
How can it endure, how can it last some more
In this perfect circle, I've come to know the face of my defeat
It's always worth repeating
Somehow it is worth it
It's there you'll find me, stretched out in the fields
Hope you don't mind me, staying where I please
To see this beauty
It ain't real till it's sure
Let me feel the thrill of it
Each time again

How, how can it endure
How can I just make it last some more
To seal this beauty
It ain't real till it's sure
Let me feel the thrill of it
Each time again
