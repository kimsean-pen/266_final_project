Slow down my chest can't keep up
With the rate that you're moving
Now we're moving

Deeper and deeper
Now we're falling
Faster and faster
There's nothing left

Please wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet

You can't seem to hide
What's inside.
You can't seem to hide
What's inside.

Deeper and deeper
Now we're falling
Faster and faster
There's nothing left

Please wake me
Because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet

Let's shake things up.
Let's shake things up.

Please wake me
because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so...

Please wake me
because this surely can't be happening
But the touch is so real
The touch is so real
You're eyes speak so clearly
I heard every word you said
You're words are so deadly
But I'm not dead yet
