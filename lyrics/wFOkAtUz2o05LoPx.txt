Well and I can and I die
I can, I die

Well and I'm freezing
I'm freezing

Well it's a sly curse
A sly curse

Well and I'm spiralling
I'm spiralling

In my broken hearted game
I've got all my fives
I've got all my ones to choose from
My cave, waiting for you
Waiting for you

I'm ravage like a dog and beat
I'm gone, gone
In Carthusian Red I get cut along
I am, I'm undone
I am undone

Where go, where now
Can't stand
If I can, can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling

In my cruel life God poisoned
I was born, born
Not a girl and not a jewel
I am, I am some son
I am some bum

Where go, where now
Can't stand
If I can, can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling
Spiralling [x4]
