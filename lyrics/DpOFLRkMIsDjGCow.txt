I know you think that I'm responsible
I know you heard from other people I was doing things and
I know you better than the thing you told
I know it's not your fault but it's a shame still all the same

Everything that's coming out your mouth, I can't take
I can't stop you running through my head
It just makes me want to go away
Drop out of everything (I'll do it)
Let you keep eating my heart out with your silver...

I knew you'd do it like this all alone
I thought that I was sure I knew the game that we were playing
Cause I've been doing this since I was young
But I don't think that we were ever playing in the same way

Everything that's coming out your mouth, I can't take
I can't stop you running through my head
It just makes me want to go away
Drop out of everything (I'll do it)
Let you keep eating my heart out with your silver spoon

Everyone's waiting
They all want to see a show
Everyone's talking
About it but they don't know

Everything that's coming out your mouth, I can't take
I can't stop you running through my head
It just makes me want to go away
Drop out of everything (I'll do it)
Let you keep eating my heart out with your silver spoon
