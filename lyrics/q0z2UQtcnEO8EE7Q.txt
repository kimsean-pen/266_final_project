My daddy was the family bassman
My mama was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears, in my ears

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number? I wonder how your engines feel
Scoot down the road, what's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel

Shine a light

My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mama's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve, I did not serve

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number? I wonder how your engines feel
Scoot down the road, what's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel

My daddy got a big promotion
My mama got a raise in pay
There's no one home, we're all alone
Oh, come to my room and play, yes, we can play

I'm not talking about your pigtails
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number? I wonder how your engines-
Scoot down the road, what's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
