How comforting it feels to breathe with hands around my neck
Sleepwalk your way around my arteries if you're restless
Dig through me (Dig through me)
Swim beneath my skin
In the precipitation I've graciously gathered

I won't let you drown inside me
I won't let you drown inside me

Useless blood will fade
Like a dark cloud that has purged itself of rain
Humanity will bathe in our transparency
Positioned over trenches, we allow our wounds to drain
Searching for a virgin conduit in vain

How comforting it feels to breathe with your knees upon my chest
When consciousness disguises itself as paralysis
Dig through me (Dig through me)
Swim beneath my skin
In the precipitation I've graciously gathered

I won't let you drown inside me
I won't let you drown inside me

Positioned over trenches
So we can purge ourselves of rain
Falling from our wounds through empty arteries

You are the blood that my heart bleeds
You are the blood that my heart bleeds

Positioned over trenches
So we can purge ourselves of rain
Falling from our wounds
You are the blood my heart bleeds
