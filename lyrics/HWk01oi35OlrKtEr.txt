Universe surrounds, when you're ready
It waits for us to, to leave this earth
Come on, they're calling your name out

I don't know, I could stay
Or leave right away
'Cause the comet can take us
All the way through

Goodbye, say Heaven
Know no one, I? ll be waving
Goodbye, say Heaven
Know no one, I? ll be waving, goodbye

Reason to see, everything looks the same
I don? t know if the change made was great
'Cause the craving remains the same

Goodbye, say Heaven
Know no one, I? ll be waving
Goodbye, say Heaven
Know no one

I? ll be waving
(Goodbye)
I? ll be waving
I? ll be waving

(Goodbye)
I? ll be waving
I? ll be waving

(Goodbye)
I? ll be waving
I? ll be waving
I? ll be waving, goodbye
