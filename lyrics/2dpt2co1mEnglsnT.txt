I get high all the time
I get drunk on my mind and call you at five in the morning
And I say what I like
And I don't like playing nice, I might pick a fight without warning
But it gets boring

I try to keep it cool
And turn it down for you
But I'm never gonna change
And that's why I be sayin', boy

You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
And I know I don't fit in, but I want, but I want you anyway
Only you, only me, and that's all that I need
Only you, only me, only you
Boy, you're too good for me but I want, but I want you anyway

I don't pick up the phone
Take an hour or longer to write somethin' back when you text me
Tell you, "leave me alone"
Need some time on my own, but soon as you gone, come and get me
Oh, baby, come and get me, ah

I try to keep it cool, yeah
And turn it down for you
But I'm never gonna change
And that's why I be sayin', boy

You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
And I know I don't fit in, but I want, but I want you anyway
Only you, only me, and that's all that I need
Only you, only me, only you
Boy, you're too good for me but I want, but I want you anyway

You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...

You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
And I know I don't fit in, but I want, but I want you anyway
Only you, only me, and that's all that I need
Only you, only me, only you
Boy, you're too good for me but I want, but I want you anyway
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I...
You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
