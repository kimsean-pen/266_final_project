A radical patience
You conjure in me
And I so tirelessly
Give myself up to you

Desiered, watered, displayed
Wept, tearful, feeling played
Desiered, watered, displayed
Lack, lusted in your gaze

In Inverted words we speak
She is the sum and she
You'll take your time to see
While we make history

Desiered, watered, displayed
Wept, tearful, feeling played
Desiered, watered, displayed
Lack, lusted in your gaze

Inside herself (inside herself)
She swims (she swims)
An ocean (an ocean)

Beneath the Cosmos
She ebbs and she knows
Beneath the cosmos
She kno-kno-knows
Beneath the Cosmos
She ebbs and she knows
Beneath the cosmos
-Ad lib-

Running out of patience
So sick of waiting
Done suffocating
I don't need your saving

Desiered, watered, displayed
Wept, tearful, feeling played
Desiered, watered, displayed
Lack, lusted in your gaze

In Inverted ways we speak
She is the sum and she
You'll take your time to see
Why we make history

Desiered, watered, displayed
Wept, tearful, feeling played
Desiered, watered, displayed
Lack, lusted in your gaze

Inside herself (inside herself)
She swims (she swims)
An ocean (an ocean)
If only she knew her tounge lay golden

Beneath the cosmos
She ebbs and she knows
Beneath the cosmos
She kno-kno-knows
Beneath the cosmos
She ebbs and she knows
Beneath the cosmos
She kno-kno-knows

Beneath the cosmos
She ebbs and she knows
Beneath the cosmos
She kno-kno-know-knows
Beneath the cosmos
She kno-kno-knows
Beneath the cosmos
Uh-huh-uh-uh-uh
