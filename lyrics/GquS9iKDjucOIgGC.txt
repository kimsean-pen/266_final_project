For my poor heart's sake
I guess it's time to take the strong way out
Like a stone in my shoe
And now there's someone who wants to slow me down
When that sun stops shining
It's time to walk away from the cloud
Give me one good reason
To keep on loving you
I know I wasted all my feelings
When I gave them all to you
But taking back the hand of control
Feels good for the soul, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say you want all of me
Then you try to split my world in two
Say you give me everything
And then you bring me nothing more than blue
When the sun stops shining
As you set your sight on the moon
Give me one good reason
To keep on loving you
I know I wasted all my feelings
When I gave them all to you
But taking back the hand of control
Feels good for the soul, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give me one good reason
To keep on loving you
I know I wasted all my feelings
When I gave them all to you
Give me one good reason
To keep on loving you
'Cause taking back the hand of control
Feels good for the soul, yeah, yeah, yeah
