What will become of us?
Tall trees blow there in the bone white snow
Nothing but night for songs
Old miles still sucking the warm milk of summer

Love in this breath so long
Thrown against stone, we're hard to get happy
What will become of us?
All water knows leaving, hearts bleed their changing

Lightning's alive 'cause it disappears
Feel every tear as it falls away
Falls away, falls away

No one looks wrong in rain
Hope builds a house, too much prayer to tear down
Cloud comes our way, so white
Over the hill must be light miles of promise

What will become of us?
