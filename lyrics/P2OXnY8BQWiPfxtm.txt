She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon
She watches for my moods and never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around

She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside
And when I'm all alone I feel I don't wanna hide

Today she brought me in and told me where she'd been
She put my mind at rest and put the sweetness in
I'll ask her for some time to go and look around
She puts the sweetness in with a sound

She knows just what to say to make a sunny day
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way

Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own
And nobody to hold, I just can't see the way
I'm so glad it's today
And you're here, you're here

She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon
She watches for all my moods and never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around

She knows just what to say to make a sunny day
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way
Oh, how I need her so, I know she'll never never go
She'll never leave me, believe me
She'll never go
