In the silence of a high street
In the wisper in the night
From the darkness of the empty hours
To the early morning light
From the hustle down on the Main Street
With all it's lights so bright
To the trucker on the highway
Pressing through the night

Chorus:
I can hear your heartbeat
I can hear your heartbeat
Girl the sound of you is so sweet to me

And I am sailing on your wind song
I can feel the summer breeze
You've got me walking on my tiptoes
You've got me standing on my knees

From the milss way down in Pittsburgh
To the cluns of gay Paris
No matter where I roam girl
You can always get to me

Chorus:
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
The sound of you is so sweet to me

And we got freezing Coca-Cola
And we got anything you want
And I'm moving on that back beat
Girl but it's you that sings the song

Because I can hear you heartbeat
Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl the sound of you is so sweet to me

I can hear you heartbeat
Yeah, I can hear your heartbeat
Girl the sound of you is so sweet to me

(Repeat to the end)
