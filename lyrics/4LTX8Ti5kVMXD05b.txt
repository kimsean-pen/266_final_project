They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye watching you
And on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true

Bu-but don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just gotta turn to be heard

I hear the crocodiles ticking around the world
I hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking around the world

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Got one eye on the road and one on
I can hear them climbing the stairs
I got my left side by you on
And my left hides under the chairs

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you
