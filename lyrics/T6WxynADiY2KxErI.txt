The winters breathe evenly.
Flickering moments engage our senses.
Slowly trembling advantage.
They won't take notice.

Dragging feet. Will time notice me?
We turn our backs on ourselves.
Nothing in sight.

I see a flame erupt in the distance.
The charted course towards my direction.
A wealth of moving light, they now seek my disguise.
Legs soon crack as they stand above/below.

Where do you drift from, sir?
This land is for those who have lost.
Our humanity has passed its curse.
We roam with all that's left.

I come from a movable past.
A distant future is in my grasp.
You all will survive this fate.
Trust the man you gaze.

Take me with your flame.
Show the brighter way.
Take in all. Sit with our teachings.

Above. Below.
Take in all.
Above. Below.
Sit with our teachings...

Dream tonight to push us forward.

Black ash improves me. Dark skies are hollow.

Above. Below.
Take in all.
Above. Below.
Sit with our teachings...

Dream tonight to push us forward.

Black ash improves me.
Can't look past the damage to this life.
Dark skies are hollow.
Can't look past the damage to this life.

Welcome to our journey. Please walk with me.
I'll put your mind at ease
Our breath, disrupts their flames.
We walk through their walls.
Life exists apart from this.
This lone world drifts on and on.

In the distant light modern man awaits.
Dripping jaw accept our twisted travel.
Screaming grins howl loud from high...
a gritty focus gripped.

We turn our backs on ourselves.
Nothing in sights.
We turn our backs on ourselves.
They won't take notice.
