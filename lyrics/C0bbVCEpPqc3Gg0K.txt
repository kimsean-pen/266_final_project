escape the rain falling down
escape the sun, it comes and goes
escape the rain, that comes and goes
when it stops, no one knows
crazy to believe
patterns emerge from this stuff
wasted words, wasted words
scraping past highways
always too crowded to see
whether you'll come with me and trade away all that
scraping past
rain falls
