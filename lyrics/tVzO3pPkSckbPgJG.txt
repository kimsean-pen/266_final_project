Faith lies in the ways of sin
I chased the charmed, but I don't want them anymore

And in their eyes, I was alive, a fool's disguise
Take me away from you

Shame my tongue, fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep, I was happier than I'd ever been

When you decide that your life is a prize
Renew and revive, it's all right, honey
It's all right, yeah...

Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel OK?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away...

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you
Yeah, I love you, it's true...

Life's a bummer, when you're a hummer
Life's a drag...

Ask yourself a question, anyone but me
I ain't free
Ask yourself a question, anyone but me
I ain't free

Do you feel... love is real?
