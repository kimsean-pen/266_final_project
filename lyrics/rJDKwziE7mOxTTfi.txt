Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
The other side
Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
It's too late to tell you what I'm about
But god, I'm proud

A giant in the sky
A light flooded horizon
A silent peaceful cry
And the sun that is rising
Warms me up
Warms me up
Wears me out

Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
The other side
Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
It's too late to tell you what I'm about
But god, I'm proud

A different kind of quiet
A different kind of warning
You've said your last goodbyes
And left your daughters mourning
Breathing in
Breathing now
Breathing out

Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
The other side
Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
It's too late to tell you what I'm about
But god, I'm proud
But god, I'm proud

Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
The other side
Will you wait?
I'm on the other side
It's too late to tell you what I'm about
But god, I'm proud
But god, I'm proud
