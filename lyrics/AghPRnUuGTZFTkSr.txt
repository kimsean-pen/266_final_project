Blue eyed baby cries in a cradle.
Mama said to papa, "Look at them eyes".

Over the ocean in a great ship.
The captain said to the bin boy, Look at that water".

In high places in the Rockies
I said to Carl, "Look at that valley".

o yes o yes o yes

The gardener is gracious. His son is so kind.
The lips are his that i kiss
on the wheel of time.
