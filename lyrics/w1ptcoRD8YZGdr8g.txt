I don't care what you've said
And I mean it
I don't care what you've shared
'Cause I've seen it

Who's to judge if you're wrong?
This is a bad time
Just as long as you break his heart
And not mine

Tell him you're a liar
Tell him I'm a saint
Say it's much too early
Or just too late

Tell him that you're weak
Beg him to be strong
Say you're very sorry
But you were wrong

Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?

It's a fatal mistake
And you know it
That you're dying to make
You'll pay for it

It's already too late
Go on admit it
Tell him it's a problem
Tell him it's too hard

Say you phoned your best friend
And Scotland Yard
Swear that there'll be murder
Tell him that I'm ill
Say you know it's blackmail
But that I'll kill

Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
That I need to love you

Do I have to? Oh don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?

I know what you've said about me
I heard, but do I have to plead?

Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?

Do I have to? Don't say
Do I need to love you?
Do I have to? Don't say
That I need to love you

(Do I have to)

(Do I have to)
(Don't say)
(Do I have to)
