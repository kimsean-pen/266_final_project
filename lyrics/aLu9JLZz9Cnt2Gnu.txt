Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
everybody here is sleeping tight
ain't nobody gonna find us here
we'll dissapear
there's a dancer in the arms of love
and he's dancing on the sky above
and the truth is that we'll never know where love will flow
aim high, shoot low (gotta aim high shoot low baby)

ain't no headlights on the road tonight
ain't nobody here to make you cry
cause we couldn't seem to find a way
for love to stay
if you had an other night to give
I would have an other night to live
but you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye((last goodbye)

Is it cloudy where you are tonight
all the neon lights shining bright
are you looking for a place to stay to get away
and my days are horses down the hill
running fast with no time to kill
and the truth is that we'll never know where love will flow
aim high, shoot low (gotta aim high shoot low baby)

ain't no headlights on the road tonight
ain't nobody here to make you cry
cause we couldn't seem to find a way
for love to stay
if you had an other night to give
I would have an other night to live
but you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

If I could do it over, i do it all again (over again)
and if i got one more chance, i wouldn't change a thing
aim high shoot low (aim high shoot low)

ain't no headlights on the road tonight
ain't nobody here to make you cry
cause we couldn't seem to find a way
for love to stay
if you had an other night to give
I would have an other night to live
but you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

ain't no headlights on the road tonight
ain't nobody here to make you cry
cause we couldn't seem to find a way
for love to stay
if you had an other night to give
I would have an other night to live
but you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye
