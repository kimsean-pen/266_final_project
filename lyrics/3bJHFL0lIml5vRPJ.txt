Prepare for nuclear attack
Dropped from Enola, a city erased
Threat of the future displayed
A power unheard of a power unseen
Flash out of nowhere, the sky is burning
At 8:16 a.m. Tokyo control realized something was wrong
Reports of explosions, destruction and pain
Air raid from hell city gone in a blaze

August in black, B-29's turning back

(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Warned but did not heed
(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Extermination
(Strike back)
Chose not to believe
(Another nuclear attack)

From the southeast came the second attack
Threat of tomorrow unveiled
11:02 a.m. on the 9th of august
Over the valley, like ball lightning

The bomb detonates and the land turns to waste
Barren for decades to come
The factories burning, the steelworks destoyed
Surrender your war else you'll perish in flames

Second attack, B-29's turning back

(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Warned but did not heed
(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Extermination
(Strike back)
Chose not to believe
(Another nuclear attack)

August in black, B-29's coming back

Another, another, another (nuclear attack)
Warned but did not heed
(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Extermination
(Strike back)
Chose not to believe
(Another nuclear attack)

Warned but did not heed
(Prepare for nuclear attack)
Extermination
(Strike back)
Chose not to believe
(Another nuclear attack)
(A nuclear attack)
