Got to face your fear,
Lying on the floor.
Step into nothing,
What the hell am I here for?
So come on and play,
Stab me in my heart.

So long this time was wasted ripping me apart.
We are the hurt inside your head.
Lost in the void of what is dead.
Constantly twisting things I said.

Happiness is boring, need pain instead.

It's starting over!
Starting over!
Can't stand it's over!
God is gonna take me out!

My time is over!

This time is over!
Why is this over?
God is gonna take me out!

Crawling on the floor,
All around this space.
Talking to myself,

What is this thing I've got to face?
Walking through a door,
Has it been a waste?
Going on and on thinking I could find my place.

We are the hurt inside your head.
Lost in the void of what is dead.
Constantly twisting things I said.
Happiness is boring, need pain instead.

It's starting over!

Starting over!
Can't stand it's over!
God is gonna take me out!

My time is over!
This time is over!
Why is this over?
God is gonna take me out!
God is gonna take me out!

God is gonna take me out!

You can't see.
I'm torn away from you,

And everything that's close to me.
I cannot face the truth,
It's nothing that I believe.
Just run away from me,
And thank me when you're free from me.
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!
Come take me!

We are the hurt inside your head.
Lost in the void of what is dead.
Constantly twisting things I said.
Happiness is boring, need pain instead.
We are the hurt inside your head.
Lost in the void of what is dead.
Constantly twisting things I said.
Happiness is boring, need pain instead.
