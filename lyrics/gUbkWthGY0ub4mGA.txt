You're gonna have to get older
Boy, it's gonna get a lot colder
Try to change, just stay sane
Take a chance to be free
Boy, giving in is so easy

I don't want to live to see
If it ends happily

I want to forget that it's a dream
I want to forget that it's a dream
When she lets go of everything in my mind
And shows me all the things I could find
When she lets go of every single sound
I can feel the wat she spins me around
I can't be found

Home, sweet home
You're gonna find just what you're looking for
Home, you're gonna make it through the open door
Take the whip to yourself
'Cause you've headed down a two-way street
Home, before you trip from your own feet

I don't want to live to see
If it ends happily

I want to forget that it's a dream
I want to forget that it's a dream
When she lets go of everything in my mind
And shows me all the things I could find
When she lets go of every single sound
I can feel the wat she spins me around
I can't be found
