i'll watch you fade away
wont think of you as gone
forever in a dream, you'll never be alone.
i'll watch you fade away
wont think of you as gone
forever falls away and now your lost in memory
stay ugly
stay ugly
stay ugly for me
stay ugly
stay ugly
stay for me

keep your soul
burn all hate
take, plead.
and cry with the saints
laugh with the sinners and rest in peace.
greed greed is how vermin breeds.

I'll watch you breathe the day
through sadness live on
together in a nightmare, we're always alone.
I'll watch you breathe the day
through sadness live on
together stays forever and believes in sympathy
stay ugly
stay ugly
stay ugly for me
stay ugly
stay ugly
stay ugly for me

i'll watch you fade away
wont think of you as gone
forever in a dream, you'll never be alone.
i'll watch you fade away
wont think of you as gone
forever falls away and now your lost in memory
stay ugly

keep your soul
burn all hate
take, plead.
and cry with the saints
laugh with the sinners and rest in peace.
greed greed is how vermin breeds.

stay ugly
stay ugly for me
stay ugly
stay ugly
stay ugly for me
