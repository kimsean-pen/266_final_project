After all of the world we see
I got my answers from a machine
You could just put on the line
So I got some peace of mind
I can't keep on tryin' at night
Got no more strength to keep up the fight
Hanging out to hear the ring
All I get is a machine (Toop, toop)

After all of the world we see (Shoot, shoot)
I got my answers from a machine (Toop, toop)
You could just put on the line (Shoot, shoot)
So I got some peace of mind (Toop, toop)

Shoot, shoot
