Hope you're feeling better now
Hope you got my letter, how?
Is my stormy weather now
gonna change?

Can I be like everyone?
Pretending that there's nothing wrong?
Remember when we walked upon
clouds that never rain?

And I need it more than love
And I love it more than life
And I want those stars above to shine this night

Baby, ever wondered why?
I could make you laugh and cry?
Eclipsing all your summer skies
some things never change

And I need it more than love
And I love it more than life
And I want those stars above to shine this night

You want it?
You got it
There's nothing chained down
You need it?
I'll steal it
Just put your name down
I'll put my name down

Hope you're feeling better now
Hope you got my letter how
Is my stormy weather now
Is my stormy weather now

Can I be like everyone?
Pretending that there's nothing wrong?
Remember when we walked upon
Remember when we walked upon
Remember when we walked upon
Remember when we walked upon
Clouds that never rain
Every cloud must drain

And I need it more than love
And I love it more than life
And I want those stars above to shine this night

You want it?
You've got it
There's nothing chained down
You need it?
I'll steal it
Just put your name down
I'll put my name down
You want it?
You've got it
Now I know it's to you I'm bound
You need it?
Godspeed it
Just put your name down
I'll put my name down

How's my stormy weather now?
How's the stormy weather now?
How's the stormy weather now?
How's my stormy weather now?
How's the stormy weather now?
How's my stormy weather now?

How's my stormy weather?
