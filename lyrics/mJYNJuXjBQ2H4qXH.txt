Half of me is inclined to say I wish I forgot
And can't remember a thing
I disappear from the edge of the pool
And turn my lonely eyes to you

Remember it hits me now like a shot
Right out of the blue
Look what happened yesterday
It's sharp as a blade and clear as the moon

I'll leave it all over again

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
Travels backwards in your mouth
Let me get it out

Let the woman on the screen
Let the tragedy begin
And her majesty'll call
An emergency

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
Travels backwards in your mouth
Let me get it out

Let the woman on the screen
Let the tragedy begin
And her majesty'll call
An emergency

As I look from the mountain side up above
To the end of the sky
I always felt what you said, take me down
With the force of gravity

I'd like to think what is broken down
Is only differently arranged
But you're not that kind of woman
And I'm not that kinda man

So I'll leave it all over again
Over and over again, whoa

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
Travels backwards in your mouth
Let me get it out

Let the woman on the screen
Let the tragedy begin
And her majesty'll call
An emergency

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
Travels backwards in your mouth
Let me get it out

Let the woman on the screen
Let the tragedy begin
And her majesty'll call
An emergency

I could never believe in the summary
Of the symbol of you and me
Let's make the most of our time
From here to eternity

So I'll leave it all over again
Over and over again
So I'll leave it all over again
Over and over again, whoa

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
Travels backwards in your mouth
Let me get it out

Let the woman on the screen
Let the tragedy begin
And her majesty'll call
An emergency

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out

I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
I'm disconnected from the source
That won't take it out, out
