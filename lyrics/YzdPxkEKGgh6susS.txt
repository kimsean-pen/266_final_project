I laughed so much that I cried.
I danced so much till I was tired.
I drank some red wine,
And now I'm walking on the sky.
I had the time of my life.

And you know I,
I'm feelin' alright.
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing.

And you know I,
I'm feelin' alright.
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing.

When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
I'm chill.

I sang so loud that I smiled.
I made it worth my while.
I drank some white wine,
Now I'm walking on the sky.
I had the time of my life.

And you know I,
I'm feelin' alright.
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing.

And you know I,
I'm feelin' alright.
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing.

When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
I'm chill.

Everyday, every day, chillin' witchu.

Everyday, every day, chillin' witchu.

Chillin' witchu.
And you know I,
I'm feelin' alright.
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing.

When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
When I'm witchu, I'm chillin'.
I'm chill.
