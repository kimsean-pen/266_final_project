Is it real?
We're always the same
We're almost undone now
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Waiting to call
Of what would you say?
And can you come over?
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You're telling me something real

What we do
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
For you to stay with me

Trading thoughts
Crossing the rumor
I saw you surrounded
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Feeling small
Without an escape
I almost let you down
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You're telling me something real

What we do
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
For you to stay with me

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
And telling me something real

What we do
It doesn't matter now
When I was caught in the rain
You made me feel
You made me feel
Made me feel

I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground
I was caught in the rain, caught in the rain
