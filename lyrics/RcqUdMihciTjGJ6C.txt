On and on and on I search for words to tell you how I feel
And, girl, I've spent so long in your head
There's a place for you and me
I'd rather be, I'd rather be on paradise's shore
And let's not forget it

It's crazy, you got me so caught in your love
You're like a wave pushin' and pullin' (Pullin')
Can't you see you got me so lost in your love?
I feel so young, when you're ready
Come on over here and kiss me

I believe you're the one for me
Let's take it back seat at 2 AM
We'll make all our dreams, you'll see
I believe you're better with me
If we both give it everything then we're meant to be, baby

I believe we'll shine a light in the darkness (I believe, I believe)
Spark this one for you and me (Oh, no)
One, two, three,
I believe (I believe, I believe) you're the one for me
This is some kind of touch and I can't get enough

On and on and on the moon and stars seem so far away
Apart, it feels so wrong in my head
But it's all illusions, I ain't losin'
We here to prove that heat is risin' faster up
And that's where the heart is

It's crazy, you got me so caught in your love
You're like a wave pushin' and pullin' (Pullin')
Can't you see you got me so lost in your love?
I feel so young, when you're ready
Come on over here and kiss me

I believe you're the one for me
Let's take it back seat at 2 AM
We'll make all our dreams, you'll see
I believe you're better with me
If we both give it everything then we're meant to be, baby

I believe we'll shine a light in the darkness (I believe, I believe)
Spark this one for you and me (Oh, no)
One, two, three,
I believe (I believe, I believe) you're the one for me
This is some kind of touch and I can't get enough

Baby, I know enough to know it's hard to take it slow
You know enough to know that I won't let you go
Baby, I know enough to know it's hard to take it slow
You know enough to know that I won't let you, I won't let you go

I believe you're the one for me
Let's take it back seat at 2 AM
We'll make all our dreams, you'll see
I believe you're better with me
If we both give it everything then we're meant to be, baby

I believe we'll shine a light in the darkness (I believe, I believe)
Spark this one for you and me (Oh, no)
One, two, three,
I believe (I believe, I believe) you're the one for me
This is some kind of touch and I can't get enough
