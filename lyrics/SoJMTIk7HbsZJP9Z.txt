Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
Can you feel it?
How do you sleep when you live with your lies
Out of your mouth, up from your mind
That kind of thinking starts a chain reaction

You are my timebomb ticking away
You need to release what you're feeling inside
Let out the beast that you're trying to hide
Step right up and be a part of the action
Go, get your game face on because it's time to play
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
Can you feel it?
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life

If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life

Can you feel it?
How do you live without playing the game
Sit on the side and expect to keep sane
Step right up and be a part of the action
Come get a piece of it before it's too late
Take a look around, you can't deny what you see
We're living in a violent society

Well, my brother let me show you a better way
Get your game face on because it's time to play
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
Can you feel it?
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life

Can you feel it?
Tell me what am I supposed to be

Another goddamn drone
Tell me what am I supposed to be
Should I leave it on the inside
Tell me what am I supposed to be
Another goddamn drone
Tell me what am I supposed to be
Shouldn't I get ready to play

You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
Can you feel it?
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence, it's significant to the life
Can you feel it?
