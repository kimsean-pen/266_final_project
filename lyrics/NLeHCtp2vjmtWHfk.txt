V1- This feeling's strange
This isn't my body, at least
Not anymore, or maybe
I'm not sure

I've lost as much hair as I've
Lost sleep, and I know that
One day we'll all fall way too deep

CH- It's not enough. It's not
Enough. You were all I had,
Now you're not here so I
Must do this on my own

It's not enough. It's not
Enough. I still have
Your blood
Running through the arms
That cannot reach you now

V2- My head is a lake
Where I'm floating face down
I stay floating face down

CH- It's not enough. It's not
Enough. You were all I had,
Now you're not here so I
Must do this on my own

It's not enough. It's not
Enough. I still have
Your blood
Running through the arms
That cannot reach you now

Bridge- I'm drowning in
The pools between my ears
Some days the trees and cars
Just don't seem real

Without you
Is there really a me?

CH- It's not enough. It's not
Enough. You were all I ever had

It's not enough. It's not
Enough. You were all I had,
Now you're not here so I
Must do this on my own

It's not enough. It's not
Enough. I still have
Your blood
Running through the arms
That cannot reach you now
