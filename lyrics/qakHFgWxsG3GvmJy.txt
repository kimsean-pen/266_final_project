A distant light gets brighter
Moving into somewhere new
A feeling burning deep inside
Fighting to get through

And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the eye and the fear
We were always waiting
Now there's nothing to wait for

Not here since you came
Feels like heaven
And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the trust and the fear

A distant light gets brighter...

And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the eye and the fear
And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the trust and the fear

Feels like heaven...

And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the eye and the fear
And then it hits me a certain atmosphere
I've found everything, the eye and the fear
