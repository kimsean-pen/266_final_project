I have seen many shores
I hug the land but nothing more
Because I haven't met you
I have wined and I have dined
With everybody bogus music mogul
No sign of you
I have brushed and I have rubbed
Pressing palm exuding charm
But never in arms

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some place that I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place that I dunno

I have been brave
Deep in every shaven cave
And were you
Another film on replay
This time, Hell with Guillaume Canet
For English me

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some place that I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place that I dunno

Home, is it just a word?
Or is it something you carry within you?
I'm happy just to be here
If I ever find home
If I ever find home
If I ever find home

If I get there, would you meet me?
Wrap your legs around my face just to greet me
If I ever get there, would you meet me?
Wrap my legs around your face just to greet me
If I ever get there, do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
How many times I've saved myself
