So many days we've spent together
Trying to get ahead with our dreams
Now we have come to the goal forgotten
Hurting within left us torn

The road is open
We find out way through ties where broken
So the means to the end
Was the peace that was meant
To be ours since it all began

We fight to win

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I'm looking up around the bend
We're so much stronger than before
Our fraying edges on the mend

Life as we know would be so different
Had our paths continued the same
Seizing the day with all that's offered
The good and the bad
The clear and the haze

The road is open
We find out way through ties where broken
So the means to the end
Was the peace that was meant
To be ours since it all began

We fight to win

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I'm looking up around the bend
We're so much stronger than before
Our fraying edges on the mend

To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I won't give up, we'll fight to win
We're so much stronger than before
Our fraying edges on the mend

Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go

So hard to face what we've done wrong
We shared a life that can't be
We cannot hide from destiny
So hard to face what had gone wrong
We've got to make this work
And give it our all

Give our all and won't let go
Waiting so long for the answer
Give our all and won't let go
Waiting so long to accept our fate

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I'm looking up around the bend
We're so much stronger than before
Our fraying edges on the mend

(I won't give up this fight
The sacrifices made
We gave our all
And won't let it go to die in vain)

(I'll sing this song again
We're stronger than before
We have the chance of lifetime
We'll never close this door)
