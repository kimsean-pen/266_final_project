22 and confused
On what to do and how to set it up
Kind of drunk, sort of high
She's a broken Miss America
Never learned how to love
Cause the answers are stuck behind closed doors
You can call it a night
When the lights in the club don't shine no more
Ooohhh
When the lights in the club don't shine no more
Ooohh
When the lights in the club don't shine no more

She wrote on the bathroom wall in her favorite shade of lipstick
LIFE

LIFE LIFE LIFE
She just tryna figure out
LIFE LIFE
We're just tryna figure out

Only dreams 'bout the lights
So he's having trouble getting up
He's convinced only Kanye knows how to make it in America
Never learned how to love
Cause the answers are stuck in all of the lights (all of the lights)
When the lights in the studio don't shine no more
When the lights in the studio don't shine no more
When the lights in the studio don't shine no more
