We got the same friends
We're gonna have to see each other eventually
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
(how we're gonna deal with that, how we're gonna deal with that)
My CD's are at your place
And you know I'm gonna have to pick 'em up
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
(how we're gonna deal with that, how we're gonna deal with that)

Even though it was mutual, it still kills inside
'Cause for so long, how I've been defined

It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)
Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making up
And if this is a dream I wonder,
Could someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)

I still have your old shirt
You know the one I said I'd thrown away?
I put it on when I went to bed last night
(I went to bed last night, I went to bed last night)
Baby, is this where our story ends
When I turn out the light
Fantasy and reality fight

It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)
Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making up
And if this is a dream I wonder,
Could someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)

Someone wake me up

Even though it's over now, it still kills inside
'Cause for so long you have been my life

(Someone wake me up, someone wake me up)

It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)
Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making up
And if this is a dream I wonder,
Could someone wake me up?
(Someone wake me up)

Oh, baby you were my first time
I will always keep you inside

(Someone wake me up, someone wake me up)
Someone wake me up
(Someone wake me up, someone wake me up)
Someone wake me up
