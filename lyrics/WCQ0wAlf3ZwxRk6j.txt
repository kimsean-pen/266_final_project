There's a place that I've found
As far as I can see
This place lies within
The depths of my dreams
In a garden surrounded
By fire and trees
Through the smoke a silhouette, I can barely see
There's a man with an axe
Standing in the rain

Looked me straight in my eye
This is what he had to say

"Never fall asleep"
"You won't wake up"
"Destroy the guillotine"
"Before he does"

I walk with shadows
("You have to find a better way")
I walk with shadows
("The questions I will never say")
Hiding from the gallows
("They keep me safe and sound")
So I walk in shadows
("The ways of burning down this house")

End transmission
The satellites are down
I need an earthquake
To shake this pity
Off the ground

"Just don't trust these liars at the door"
(You have to find a better way)
"Kill the ones that have these answers for"
(The questions I will never say)

"Never fall asleep"
"You won't wake up"
"Destroy the guillotine"
"Before he does"

I walk with shadows
("You have to find a better way")
I walk with shadows
("The questions I will never say")
Hiding from the gallows
("They keep me safe and sound")
So I walk in shadows
("The ways of burning down this house")

End transmission
The satellites are down

I need an earthquake

To shake this pity
Off the ground

All the vibrant colors I see
And the shades that fill the grey

Pain
The pain
Pain
The pain
Pain
The pain
The pain
Pain...
Pain
The pain
Pain
The pain
Pain
The pain
The pain
Pain
Hiding from the gallows
("You have to find a better way")
I walk with shadows
("The questions I will never say")
Hiding from the gallows
("They keep me safe and sound")
So I walk in shadows
("The ways of burning down this house")
