I'm so tired of waking up tired
Well, it's trite to say I've tried to change
Why can't my legs act on the same wavelength
With hands that relate?

And everyone is so goddamn concerned with diction
I'm a dictionary
And everything is nothing without context
It's not a contest
Maybe it's a good thing
Maybe everything's as important as it seems
Lately I've been losing more friends than I've been making
