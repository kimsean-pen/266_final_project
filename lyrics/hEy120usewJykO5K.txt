Hello I'm Lonely, I sweep up the place
I go in early and I come home late
And one thing I never forget is a face

You keep me around
You keep me around

Hello I'm Sad, I know I get in the way
You sit and you wonder how long I'm gonna stay
While I show you the rainbow in all shades of grey

You keep me around (I bring you down)
You keep me around (I bring you down)

Hello I'm Faith and I might be blind
But I'm the one's gonna keep towin' the line
And you land on your feet almost every time

You keep me around (I won't let you down)
You keep me around (I won't let you down)

Sad and Lonely, they go and come
You think you don't need 'em but you gotta have some
Try askin' the Dark where the Light comes from

Hello I'm Faith and I might be blind
But I'm the one's gonna keep towin' the line
And you land on your feet almost every time

You keep me around (I won't let you down)
You keep me around (I won't let you down)
