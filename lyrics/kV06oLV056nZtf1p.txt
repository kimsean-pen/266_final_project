Kind of close
Hey
Do you know what I can do to you?
But who knows? Hey
I might just be good to you
I've been ruling the world
But I got a little spare time
I'm a stingy girl
Are you sure you wanna be mine?
Are you sure you wanna be mine?
Because I've heard I can be a bad girl
But in the best way
In the best of ways
One night with me and you won't be sleeping for days
So are you gonna get hooked or not?
Or not?
Make the choice while you can
While you can
Make sure its the right one cuz ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' back
Ain't no runnin' back
So if you can't handle this, it's fine
I've had so many cowards wanting my bad
But only so much at a time
God forbid I love myself
That's no good for them
They want a girl who won't run
But if you need a new habit
Who's beatiful tragic
Well then, I believe I'm the one
Because I've heard I can be a bad girl
But in the best way
In the best of ways
One night with me and you won't be sleeping for days
So are you gonna get hooked or not?
Or not?
Make the choice while you can
While you can
Make sure its the right one cuz ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' back
Ain't no runnin' back
Are you sure you wanna be mine?
Are you sure you wanna be mine?
I can be a bad girl
But in the best of ways
One night with me and you won't be sleeping for days
So are you gonna get hooked or not?
Or not?
Make the choice while you can
While you can
Make sure its the right one cuz ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' back
Because I've heard I can be a bad girl
Ain't no runnin' back
Ain't no runnin'
Because I've heard I can be a bad girl
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' back
Ain't no runnin'
runnin'
