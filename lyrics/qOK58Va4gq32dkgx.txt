Sun is rising
Black is turning blue
Look out, buddy, Noah's coming
Jesus, man, what did you do?

Psychic terrorists
In the upper room
Left foot, right foot
That's the ticket
You'll be back on top real soon

Whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsize
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death

What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

You compositions
A start of every song
Find you waking in the morning
Always there to grieve the dawn

Trouble sleeping
My alarm goes off
So you wanna hangout at the gallows?
Those guys get an early start

Oh, whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsize
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death

What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

Oh, oh what's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?
