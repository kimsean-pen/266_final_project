Right now
Well it's finally time to face my fears
Gonna get the hell out of here
And create a fresher atmosphere
But the consequence is clear

There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefined
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide

Like you!
Perserverance is a useless tool
Just a patron on a ship of fools
Feigning interest in the cast and crew
While you've broken every single rule

There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefined
Now it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide

Shadows entertain the unwashed masses
Scolars explain their numb reactions
I don't even know if i can ever find truth
But I'm sure it wont come from following you
There's a furnace set on high
And a yearning undefined
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide
