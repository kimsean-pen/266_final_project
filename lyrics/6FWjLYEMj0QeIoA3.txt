I've got a lot of love
And I've got a lot of ways to show it
You should know by now that I'm broken
And I need your help
I wrote a hundred songs
To make sense of the meaningless
I'll un-write them all if you help me clear up this mess

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts, will stay in place
Listen to me when I say
"Darling you're my everything"
I didn't mean to hesitate
Please stay with me
With me...

I've got a lot of rage
And I'm struggling in the twist to control it
When I wake in the morning
I've forgotten what it is to cope
I scratch at my eyes
And it renders me vision-less
Even in the dark
What I want isn't what I need

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts, will stay in place
Listen to me when I say
"Darling you're my everything"
I didn't mean to hesitate
Please stay with me
With me...

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts, will stay in place
Listen to me when I say
"Darling you're my everything"
I didn't mean to hesitate
Please stay with me
With me...
