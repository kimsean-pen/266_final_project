crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
on the 101 at 1: 01 on the run from the deamons in the soul
inside the monster you've become
and i should've trusted judgements somethings up and
jumped from? cuz you gave me all these reasons to believe in love was love
this dont feel right no more, no sleepless nights no more
i don't need strife no more, i don't need life no more
Baby i know it's late
but i got one more thing to say
crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
on the 101 because the one that was the one
one that came but lost my love so i was gone before the sun
and i swore that i was safe from all the damage to be done
heavy my eyes, total tons
met early demise hit and runs
flying through these red lights and all i see is headlights
and you gave me those red lights, those almost kinda dead lights
im driving into my fate
ill make loving you my last mistake
crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
crash with me, crash with me
crash with me, fall asleep
