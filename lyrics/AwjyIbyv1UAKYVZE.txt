Look at you feeling all good.
You can't resist.
You have to be all up in it.
Don't it feel great?
Talking shit.
I let it go.

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My heart's gonna break from the fall.
Holding on to petty things.
Feeling all the hate it brings.
Why don't you just leave me alone?

What a puss.
Think you're so tough.
I take this shit.
All I had was love in me.
It was so good.
But that wasn't enough.
You ripped that away.

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My heart's gonna break from the fall.
Holding on to petty things.
Feeling all the hate it brings.
Why don't you just leave me alone?

All the disrespect!
All the hypocrite!
All the bullshit, you took from me!
You're such a piece of shit!
Nothing but a heretic!
Sucking the life out of me!
Fucker you're gone without me!

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My heart's gonna break from the fall.
Holding on to petty things.
Feeling all the hate it brings.
Why don't you just leave me alone?

Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me the fuck alone!
