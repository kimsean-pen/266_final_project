Oh great defender, listen to me
This isn't where I'm supposed to be
Prison guard, don't keep me
I did no harm, I carry boulders
Under my arms, ooh
Prison guard, don't keep me

I'm on my knees, I wasn't honest
But I'm not guilty
Prison guard, don't keep me
It's only the half of it you see
The other half, they're surrounding me
Forever lost in your frozen seize
Defile you, file you
So won't you please go on unlock it
Or throw me the key

Prison guard
Prison guard
Prison guard, release me

Keep it to, keep it to yourself
Keep it to, keep it to yourself
