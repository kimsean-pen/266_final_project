Sold are the eyes I have
And cold is the wait for nothing
And dark
I write my name in a long line
How is it possible for you to try

It's coming true
I've changed my name but I will pass it on to you

Journey
No present thoughts
Coming day
Darkest wave

It's coming true
I've changed my name but I will pass it on to you
Our thoughts entwined
You speak
And I hear other words behind

I wave from the edge of the pier
And fade into the dreams of sleepers
Marked
I have had this stain for a long time
We called on the bird long before
