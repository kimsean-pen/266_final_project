Always seeing miracles
Something we might never see again
I'm holding on, letting go
I know it might be hard to understand
You told me it was nothin'
But maybe there's just nothin' to say
Always seeing miracles
Only if you look at it that way
'Cause nothing's gonna last forever
Oh No, nothin's gonna last forever
These might be the golden years
Right where we belong
These might be the golden years
We are forever young, these might be the
Gold—gold—golden,
the gold—gold—golden
The gold—gold—golden years,
these might be the
Gold—gold—golden,
the gold—gold—golden
The gold—gold—golden years
These might be theGolden years
Always seeing miracles
Something we might never see again
Broke free from these shadows
Open up the door and let it in
And why we keep on searchin'
When all we ever need is today
Always seeing miracles
Only if we look at it that way
Cause nothing's gonna last forever
Oh, oh
No, nothin's gonna last forever
These might be the golden years
Right where we belong
These might be the golden years
We're all forever young, these might be the
These might be the
These might be the
Gold—gold—golden, the gold—gold—golden
The gold—gold—golden years,
These might be the
Gold—gold—golden, the gold—gold—golden
The gold—gold—golden years,
These might be the
Gold—gold—golden, the gold—gold—golden
Gold—gold—golden years,
These might be the gold—gold—golden, the gold—gold—golden
Gold—gold—golden years,
These might be the golden years
Right where we belong,
These might be the golden years
We are forever young
