The creative urge
The urge to destroy
The black flag of the chaos star

Flown to quake our lusts
The inner energy locked in the primal source
Leaks into the mind
Features combined to divide

Tangled elements and the fortune

Powering the cruel universe
Death drives the vicious circle!
Perfection was just the beginning
The code bound to collapse or something that never did exist!
The human path brought the shame!
A tragic figure

The defunct species
Eonian discord!

The defect that gives birth to divinity
Worship derived from silence
The powers that be arise
The voiceless serfdom
The incarnation of impossible dreams!
Minds fed from the one and only source
Anti-attitude is a calculated effect!
So... who pulls the strings?
The noesis is hidden deep inside us... ALL!!!
The creative urge... the urge to destroy
The black flag of the chaos star
Flown to quake our lusts
The inner energy locked in the primal source
Leaks into the mind
Features combined to divide
Tangled elements and the fortune
Powering the cruel universe
Death drives the vicious... circle!
