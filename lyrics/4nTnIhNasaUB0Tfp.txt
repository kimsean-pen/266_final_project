You've reached your limit
You're in it
Straight up to your head
Hiding behind those eyes
They're telling lies instead
Hopeless, hope that no one notices you're down
You're down, no

Darling, you can cry a little longer
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Darling, you don't have to hide what you feel inside
We all bend and break sometimes
We all bend and break sometimes

You had your bad days, a bad break
Your glass half full of mistakes
The world is weighing down on you
But you just wait to be okay
Most nights those pills don't work
And most nights you lose your worth
All our scars are not the same
But we all bend and break sometimes

Darling, you can cry a little longer
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Darling, you don't have to hide what you feel inside
We all bend and break sometimes
We all bend and break sometimes

Falling's never easy
Break where no one can see
So you can hide behind I'm Fine
Always told to be strong
Never been but that's wrong
That's a lie

We all bend and break sometimes
We all bend and break sometimes
