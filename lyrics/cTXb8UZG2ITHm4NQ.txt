Find yourself some time
Leave the past behind
Future is a lonely ride
So tell yourself you gotta try

Choices that were made
Well I think now
You better rearrange
Give yourself some peace of mind
Cuz the sun will shine and the shadows don't mind

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away and waste away

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away. just waste away...

You've been running for days
And I hope you find your way.
Creatures of mistakes
Rewind the time, make it ok
But we can't do that.
No we can't do that,
You can't do that,
We can't do that

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away and waste away

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away... just waste away...

Oh hello old friend
It's time again you come around

Oh hello old friend
It's time again you come around

Soak in the rays
From the grave.
The shadows don't mind
On this Wednesday Night Melody

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away and waste away

Come on boy dry your eyes
It's good to feel just a little alive
Drag a needle on the groove today
And waste away... just waste away...
