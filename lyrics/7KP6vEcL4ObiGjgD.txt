Lead astray
By a turn in the wheel
And now I'm afraid
By how you made me feel

How bad to dream
More of things untrue
Ashes of you
Still haunt me this way
Still haunt me this way

Stained by your sun
With your eyes open wide
You once let me inside
Now the time passes me by

How bad to dream
More of things untrue
Ashes of you
Still haunt me this way
Still haunt me this way
This way now
Still to this day
Still to this day

In my own tomb
Where I like to keep you
All tangled into
My own very vision of loss

How bad to dream
More of you today
I'll throw your ashes away
Right now
Right this day
I'll let them blow away
Away

Now I'm on my own
Now I'm all alone
My heart longs for
Where the grass is green
The meadow I destroy
So that I am free
