Pass by, don't dare to stop
Pass by, don't dare to stop

Got a suitcase in my hand
Filled with stuff most precious to me
Sidewalk brings my feet wherever they're headed
There is no directions given
Just some trust in human mind
To rely on and to hold on to

Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
Won't even count the days
One thing I sure know, I won't move so fast
My mind in complete haze

I pass by, don't dare to stop
When there's someone I see
There's no one here but me
I'm fooled by something inside my head
If I lay down now, I might seem kinda dead
Just keep on wasting time

Scary thoughts and frightening sounds
In my mind still I try avoid it
Heading through this hope not one-way alley
I can't really sense my surroundings
Seems to be all dark around
Nothing there, to lighten up my way

Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
Won't even count the days
One thing I sure know I won't move so fast
My mind is complete haze

I pass by, don't dare to stop
When there's someone I see
There's no one here but me
I'm fooled by something inside my head
If I lay down now, I might seem kinda dead
Just keep on wasting time

Pass by, don't dare to stop

I walk slow in secret
Listening to the sound of steps
Imagination, it seems to go all crazy
I've got all the time I need
Wanna dream fulfill my wishes
Like this future already now been entered

I pass by, don't dare to stop
When there's someone I see
There's no one here but me
I'm fooled by something inside my head
If I lay down now, I might seem kinda dead
Just keep on wasting time

I pass by, don't dare to stop
When there's someone I see
There's no one here but me
I'm fooled by something inside my head
If I lay down now, I might seem kinda dead
Just keep on wasting time

Pass by, don't dare to stop
I'm fooled by something inside my head
Pass by, don't dare to stop
I'm fooled by something inside my head
