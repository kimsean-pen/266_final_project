I had the whole world in my hands
But I gave it away
I had the whole world in my hands
But I gave it away, gave it away

I'm a half-wit boy
Crackin' a smile and wearin' it all on my sleeve
So cool, so poised
It's true I'm just around to see

Where this thing goes I'll never know
But all I know is packing bags is a remedy
Is a remedy

This time I'll be nervous
'Cause I can't see your hands
In front of me, in front of me

Tonight let's forget all pretense
Of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be

I'm on my way to the top of the world
And I've got a feelin' I'll give it away
I'm on my way to the top of the world
And I've got a feelin' I'll give it away

She's a maverick
She's so smooth
If things go according to plan
I'll have her finished by 5 AM

There's no changin' plans
There's no second chance
I've already got both feet through the door
And I can taste the air, I can taste the air

This time I'll be nervous
'Cause I can't see your hands
In front of me in, front of me

Tonight let's forget all pretense
Of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be

Make a sound, it's safe for you
To choke in here alone

Whatever I say goes
Whatever I say goes
Whatever I say goes
Whatever I say goes

You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
