I travel a dusty old road
And carry on in ultimate terror
The torture will grow while infinity's lost
The lunatic fears the unknown

Into the fire
Curse me unknown
Into the fire
Everything is gone

Did I miss the point or fail to see
That I am lost 'cause I'm chosen

Crush another tower, grind the universe
I'll tear it into pieces, mourn forevermore

And here I cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
I cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down into the void

My locked up asylum
Don't turn your back on your prodigal son
When terror is raging
Still my hate will grow

Here on my own I've built a pyre oh, fire
Here on my own I've wasted life, so weak

A dark sword
A black soul
My soulmate gets near
Deceiver
Deceiver

I'm banned from the island
Refuse me, deny me, I'm pale and I'm weak
Now I don't belong here anymore

Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
I cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down into the void

The trouble of many I've seen
It's coming to an end, here's my last stand
The torture at last will be gone with the past
Infinity, where will I go?

Into the fire
Curse me in war
Into the fire
Everything is gone

It's your blood I desire
The last soul I require
Right after all the damage will be done

And here I cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
"Feeding my void, feeding my void
Here at the edge, I claim your soul"
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down into the void
