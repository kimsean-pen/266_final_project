Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice
The monument of a deceiving spirit
Of myriads of deceiving spirits born of our godly father
Thou that acknowledgest the son, do not deny the father
Rather, stand up with the twenty four elders and say
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!
Accept the truth revealed in Emmanuel
And listen: one Lord, one faith, one baptism
All that He decides is holy, all that He says is law
Do not worship Him by kneeling before Him if in thine heart
Is no true joy at the sight of Ariel covered by the ashes of devastation.
Do not worship Him unless your soul glitters of the purity of sin
And of unearthly virtues.
It shall truly contain the vision of the fallen tabernacle of David,
That which brought forth our Elisha that ignites in flames so pure.
Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice
Let no human knowledge impeach Divine Truths
Nor any mists of incredulity prevent your mind
From touching Divine Mysteries, hear the voice:
Before Abraham was I am
Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice
Drink from the grail He sanctified when
The frail saviour failed to raise up
The destroyed temple in three days
And open your purged mind
To Divine Oracles:
May the tributes of faith be rendered to Faith.
Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice
I shall descend in humiliation before Thee
And ascend before men only if thy will ordains me
In the midst of my carnal temple shall forevermore
Sound these tremendous words
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!
