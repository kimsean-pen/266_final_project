Brace, shifting again
I shouldn't know but I do
Stab, a hand in the dark
Seeds the killing field

Bad, say it again
But only if it's mine
Stand, closer to harm
My sole believer

Never to repeat
Even if it's mine
Never to remember

Improper pleasures
Imperfect strangers
I shouldn't even know
I shouldn't know
I shouldn't know
Improper pleasures

Never to repeat
Even if it's mine
Never to remember

Improper pleasures
Imperfect strangers
I shouldn't even know
I shouldn't know
I shouldn't know
Improper pleasures

I'll be gone long before the devil can say "mine"
