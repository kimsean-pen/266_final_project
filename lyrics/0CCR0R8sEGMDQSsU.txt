Happy birthday Buddha
Happy hunting, happy hiding
Happy new year
I hope you get yourself together
I hope your absence is made clear

Happy birthday Buddha

I first learned
There was a value
In a little subterfuge

From some old
Peeping Tom or another
Woman's refuge

Came in contact with a Svengali
He was housebound and unwell
Choked on a whale bone in a Cantonese restaurant
His nervous system
Had broken down
Buddha, Buddha, Buddha oh
Buddha, Buddha, Buddha oh
Buddha, Buddha, Buddha oh
Happy birthday Buddha

Happy birthday Buddha
Happy hunting, happy hiding
Happy New Year

I hope you get yourself together
I hope your absence is made clear

Happy birthday Buddha
Happy birthday
