I can't find the answers
I'm a wanderer into the night
Can't find my own direction
Wasted all my strength over these fights

Yeah, I crawled till I was bleeding
And ruined my heart from the inside
I have fought against my demons
They consumed my dreams as years went by

Take me closer to the daylight
Can't you hear this is my battle cry

'Cause I know that I've been taken down
Now I'm a fire about to blow
And from these smoking ashes on the ground
I'm gonna rise and wear my crown
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get my crown

I can't stand so royal
On my throne I'm sitting paralyzed
Sinking into paranoia
But this won't decay before my eyes

Take me closer to this last fight
Can't you hear this is my battle cry

'Cause I know that I've been taken down
Now I'm a fire about to blow
And from these smoking ashes on the ground
I'm gonna rise and wear my crown
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get my crown

Take me closer to the daylight
Can't you hear this is my battle cry

'Cause I've been living on the edge yeah
And I know what it's like to break down
But now that I have braved the storms I,
I'm coming back to get my crown

'Cause I know that I've been taken down
Now I'm a fire about to blow
And from these smoking ashes on the ground
I'm gonna rise and wear my crown
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get it now
I'll go and get my crown

'Cause I know that I've been taken down
(Taken down)
Now I'm a fire about to blow
And from these smoking ashes on the ground
(On the ground)
I'm gonna rise and wear my crown
