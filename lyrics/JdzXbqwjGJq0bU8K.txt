If only for tonight
Yeah, I could dig myself a grave
But even six feet down I know
I'll be found feeling this way

If only I could find
Just a reason to believe
That there's nothing that's up your sleeve
Even though you're wearing that tank top

Love me or leave me but just not behind
We don't need money the way we spend time
'Cause if it's real tonight
You and I could really do something

You go fast, I go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
If it's me and you tonight
(If it's me and you tonight)

You go fast, I go slow
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Are ready now? I'm ready now
(Ooh, I'm ready now)

If only I were bright
(If I were bright)
Then I could let go of my brain
But I turn and get it all in your
Sweet injection into my vein, yeah

(Ooh)
That's the stuff
(The stuff you give to me)
I say that you're the drug
Twelve steps wouldn't be enough
To kick, you're just that rough

Making me crazy, I just can't define
There's not a closet for you in my mind
But you puzzle me tonight
Let's play with your bits and pieces

You go fast, I go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
If it's me and you tonight
(If it's me and you tonight)

You go fast, I go slow, put her in drive
And the car just goes
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Are ready now? I'm ready now

(Baby)
Ooh, I'm gonna take my time
(I need you, baby)
If you stay with me once again, once again
It's a heart attack, heart attack

'Cause I want you so bad
(Ooh, I want you too)
Well, I hope
(This love)
Will last
(Forever)

You go fast, I go slow
(I go slow)

You go fast, I go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
If it's me and you tonight
(If it's me and you tonight)

You go fast, I go slow, light my fuse
And your body explodes
It's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Are ready now? I'm ready now
(Ooh, I'm ready now)

Ooh, are you ready now?
Ooh, are you ready now?
(Baby)
Ooh, are you ready now?
