Lady, take a ride on a Zeke 64
Jerry wants to be a rocket
That's a popular misconception
Says we haven't seen anything yet

Laying down the lifeless corpse of
President 35
The lady crying by his side is
The most beautiful woman alive

Saturn 5
You really were the greatest sight
Stretching out on a summer's day
Houston is calling me back to her

An eagle lands and the planet
Full of people raises its hands
All hail the men who will walk up in heaven today

All the things you ever represented to me
Take me once more, take me to heaven again
