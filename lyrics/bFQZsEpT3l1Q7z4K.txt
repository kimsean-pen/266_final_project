So stupid and pretty self-assured
I'm hanging around but it's not me that she's looking for
Hard to express to blessed and born
Hard to express to press that born

And the days go hard
It will take some time
To figure out
It gets better, it better
It gets better, it better
Leave me alone all by myself
But this much is true
I'll always be lost without you

Open wide and insecure
I fall asleep dreaming of something fall as pure
It is so majestic stops my breathing
I fall asleep staring at the ceiling

And the days go hard
It will take some time
To figure out
It gets better, it better
It gets better, it better

Leave me alone all by myself
But this much is true
I'll always be lost without you

And the days go hard
It will take some time
To figure out
It gets better, it better
It gets better, it better
