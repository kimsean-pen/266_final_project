It's been about a month and twenty days
And we're going round and round just playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away

Let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you

Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin like a diva sayin you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya fiesty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in-you order a Mohito at the bar
You re-apply lippy cos it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favourite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mmmm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home I want to ride it

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you

Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging fists against the door
Yelling yo it's over I can't take it any more
Then I walk away and act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't tryna get all caught up in her mess for real
But she came on out and backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard but I'll make you forget it all

Baby let me feel you
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
