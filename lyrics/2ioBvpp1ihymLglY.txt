Oh love of mine is this your design?
Can we not just take our time?
Turn the lights on but leave the lights low
A second chance to take it slow

Either way I want to go

Sing the same as Solomon
It's not mathematics when two means one
Turn the lights on but leave them real low
A second chance to take it slow

Either way I want to go

I'm so low

Either way I want to go
