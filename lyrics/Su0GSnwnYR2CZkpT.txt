You're falling down like heavy stone
Through the muddy waters that you know
Dropped in another day
Never saying what you ought to say
Oh and now your lies are coming
Anyway, let'em know, let them how you don't want to love'em
You're dragging on like wintertime
Rolling through the rubble on your mind
Back in your knowing place
With a weapon you don't want to waste but hey
Now you're on the ground and running
Anyway, let'em know, let them how you don't want to love'em
Anyway, let'em know, let them how you don't want to love'em
Oh. No you're not whole when you're so unaligned
Can't you see we all know you got free
So can you tell it honestly?
Anyway, let'em know, let them how you don't want to love'em
Anyway, let'em know, let them how you don't want to love'em
