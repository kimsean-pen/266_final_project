I missed your call again
It really made me feel like shit
You say there's reasons for believing this is worth the risk
You keep complaining that I'm never checking up on you
Like squares to circles I am certain we can't make it through

I want to breathe
You want to bleed
I want to love you

And I wish I could be everything you're needing
I wish I could find all the things you're seeking
I wish I could say what you need to hear but
I'll never be, never see, everything you're needing

Your future's brighter than the light you cast on all you do
Have you thought of me the same way that I've thought of you?
I want to say that I will stay and not be all alone
I'm scared I'll muddy all your colours if you get too close

I want to breathe
You want to bleed
I want to love you

And I wish I could be everything you're needing
I wish I could find all the things you're seeking
I wish I could say what you need to hear but
I'll never be, never see, everything you're needing
Everything you're needing

Is this what you needed?
What you needed?
Is this what you needed?

And I wish I could be everything you're needing
I wish I could find all the things you're seeking
I wish I could say what you need to hear but
I'll never be, never see, everything you're needing
I wish I could be everything you're needing
I wish I could find all the things you're seeking
I wish I could say what you need to hear but
I'll never be, never see, everything you're needing
Everything you're needing

Is this what you needed?
