It's orchestrated by another hand
Believe inferior dreams that I am
Orchestrated, I don't understand
Believe increasing in me that I am

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe, sing
Forever after

Without frustration, with no master plan
With nothing left of the dream that began

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe, sing
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after maybe, sing
Forever after

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Frailty, frailty
Say, you love me till I get back

Forever after
Forever after maybe, sing
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after maybe, sing
Forever after

If only we could see and live this dream
If only we could still believe the dream
