She held her face while she cried
And she told herself, girl you'll be just fine
She doesn't know just where she belongs
But for now she's got to run
She kept her dreams inside
For so long, for so long
There's nowhere left to hide
She's held on for so long and

She picks up all the scattered pieces of her life
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
She finds that all she needs is in her heart
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
And all the world is hers tonight
Marisol, it'll all be alright

With nothing but her pocket change
She makes her move, she heads to the train
She's staring at her shoes and
Fighting off negative thoughts in her brain
Counting to ten inside she discovers another
Way to put it out of her mind and recover, recover

She picks up all the scattered pieces of her life
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
She finds that all she needs is in her heart
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
And all the world is hers tonight
Marisol, it'll all be alright

Marisol got away, got away
Marisol got it her way, her way
And she's searching through
The faces of the crowded street
She's doesn't know a single soul
But she feels so free
And her spirit and her courage are all she needs
And she flies, and she flies, oh oh oh and

She picks up all the scattered pieces of her life
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
She finds that all she needs is in her heart
She lifts up Marisol, Marisol, Marisol take flight
And all the world is hers tonight
Marisol, it'll all be alright
