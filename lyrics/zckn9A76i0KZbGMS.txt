You say that time can't heal
The broken heart you stole
I don't know what's real?!
You are what I can't be
You are what I can't be

You say that time can't heal
The broken heart you stole
I don't know what's real?!
You are what I can't feel
You are what I can't feel
Oooh
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh oh oh
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more

Say that time can't heal
The broken heart you stole
I don't know what's real

You are what I can't feel
Oooh
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh oh oh
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh oh oh
Something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh oh oh
Something in my heart
Still you're in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh oh oh

(Oh, something in my heart
Something in my heart
Makes me miss you more
Oh, something in my heart
Still you're in my heart
Makes me miss you more)
