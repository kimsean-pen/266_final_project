I was seeking the dark
And all I saw was paper paper
All these people chasing cars
And their eyes were filled with lots of hatred
And they kept asking me the same
"Where you from? What's your name?"
Cause you're not wearing a new dress
And your face looks like a mess
"Why you acting all stupid"?

So I said I'm just gonna pray
Your love for money made you this way
Hello, hello, Darkness
Blood on all your carpets
Bullet through your brain

I was running through the streets
And all I saw was paper paper
They kept looking at me
With their ego big as skyscrapers
But I just couldn't care no less
Knew their lives were all a mess
Saying; "Money buys you time"
Granting you eternal life
But who wants to live forever

So I said I'm just gonna pray
Your love for money made you this way
Hello, hello, Darkness
Blood on all your carpets
Bullet through your brain
So I said I'm just gonna pray
Your love for money made you this way
Hello, hello, Darkness
Blood on all your carpets
Bullet through your brain
Hello, hello, Darkness
Blood on all your carpets
Bullet through your brain
