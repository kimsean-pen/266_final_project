In the house of my master
Behind the gate there is a bed of snakes where evil lays
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that
Someday will imprison me

Oh, mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth
I finally understand
The way

I've been beaten with his words
And whipped with his lies
He will not break me down
No matter how hard he tries
Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside me
Rages on and on and on

Mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth
I finally understand
The way

Out of the ashes of my youth
I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth
I finally understand

Out of the ashes of my youth
I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth
I finally understand
The way
