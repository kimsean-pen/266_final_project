I would bet my life like I bet my heart
that you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
you're driving my heart crazy

I can't hold out
I can't hold back now like I've done before
Darling, look at me

I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see I'd do anything you want me to
I tell myself I'm in too deep then I fall a little farther
every time you look at me

How do you do that, babe, make me feel like I'm
the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this

first time in your arms I knew
the way you held me I knew that this could be
what I've been waiting to find
Darling, look at me I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see I'd do anything you want me to
I tell myself I'm getting in too deep
then I fall a little farther everytime you look at me
everytime you look at me
