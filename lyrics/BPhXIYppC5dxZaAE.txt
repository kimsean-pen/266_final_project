I thought I knew
I didn't know I could tell you
I could've told you
I adore you
I adore you
I should've told you

You said farewell, but
I didn't know I could hold you
I could've warned you
I adore you
I adore you
I'd wish I told you

Back in the summer
back in the water
you touched my hair
you said you liked it
I know you liked it
I know it well
I know you well

and in the cool bar
while we were dancing
you grabbed my waist
I know you liked it
you said you liked it
and ih, well
I know you well

here we go
through it
take a good hard look at it
oh, to be a part of it
one day you will see
my love
you belong to me

I adore you
I adore you
