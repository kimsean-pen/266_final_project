Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion

In your dreams you hear a name
Was it yours? Is it reclaimed?

Autumn comes to claim the old
You forget the past painted by you

And you sink,
You can't breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade

And you lose
All you've gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain

Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Time, out of place.
Oceans of grey

All of your joy,
All of your pain
Emotions drained.
Oceans of Grey.

Dogs on the run,
foam on their mouths
The scavengers approaching as they run from the netherworld
Savages, erosive, massive are the jaws of oblivion

Solid earth is now dissolved.
Water fills your empty world.

And you sink,
You can't breathe
I an ocean of grey
memories fade

And you lose
All you've gained
All your triumphs in vain
black thoughts remain

Bury your name,
Forget your face.
Oceans of grey
