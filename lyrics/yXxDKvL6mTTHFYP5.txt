Elise
Just stop, and breathe, open you eyes and see
A cold blooded monster born from pure jealousy
The wants, and needs, of a sick savage beast
an unquenchable thirst for this romantic scene
to play the lead the star of your love story!

House lights are fading
you keep me waiting
House lights are fading
I'm waiting here, I'm waiting for the show.

Maybe I'll wait to see
the possibilities that are awaiting
maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel I'm running down
stuck on repeat
like an eternity of a never ending sleep
infinite dreams, so goes the cycle, I'm hopeful

This can't be
a crushing pain that's in my chest
I must protest these feelings
this is all an atrocity
and everyone can tell right from the start
there's bound to be a broken heart
I'll break their heart!

You cast the parts, it's plain to see.
I'm just an extra as he takes the lead
The curtains rise to reveal act one
the first scene starts the tragedy to come
and everyone can tell right from the start
there's bound to be a broken heart!
I'll break their heart...
and everyone can tell right from the start
there's bound to be a broken heart
I'll break their heart!!!

Maybe I'll wait to see
the possibilities that are awaiting
maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel I'm running down
stuck on repeat
like an eternity of a never ending sleep
infinite dreams, so goes the cycle, I'm hopeful

Post dramatic, psychopathic rush

This must be a dream
will I awaken from this nightmare that has taken a hold of me
my sanity has eluded me
it makes me wanna scream...
It makes me wanna scream!
