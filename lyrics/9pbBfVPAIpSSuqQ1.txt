Running through the black night I'm sure I had a green light
Crawling over the thought that I would die
Then from the x-ray, back to the rat race
I want to win this, and know that I'm alive
All these streets look different, like I'm born again
There in the dark, down in the valley, under the motel neon sign
Room 105, the back of the alley, you're wearing my coat while sleeping

And it feels like I've come home

It's hard for the dreams when the city's never sleeping
But we're gonna make it, though we don't know how
I pay a high price for the joy of the free ride
'Cause I got you, and now that's all that counts
There in the dark, down in the valley, under the motel neon sign
Room 105, at the back of the alley, you're wearing my coat while sleeping

And it feels like I've come home, oh
Yeah it feels like I've come home, oh

This I know
Right from the start, like it's the first time
It finally feels like coming home

There in the dark, down in the valley, under the motel neon sign
Room 105, at the back of the alley, you're wearing my coat while sleeping

And it feels like I've come home, oh
Yeah it feels like I've come home, oh

This I know
Right from the start, like it's the first time
It finally feels like
It feels like I've come home
