Beverly Hills, century city
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people look the same
Don't they know they're so damn lame?

There she goes
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots

I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Maybe I'll have to move from...

Beverly Hills, century city
Everything's so nice and pretty
And all the people, they look the same
But don't they know they're so damn lame?

Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots
Fiorucci too

Beverly Hills, century city!
