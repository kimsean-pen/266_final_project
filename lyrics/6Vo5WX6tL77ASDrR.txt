Start today, now show us how you feel.
Make your way, it's time to choose.
Have my say, I know, I know what I see.
Have my say, they think you'll lose

For all this to mean so much to me.
For all this, you make a move
Pass you by, it's all in this life you have
Pass you by, goodbye to you.

1234 Move
If you don't stop there, you'll make it through.
Stop dreaming, start something
When it's in your hands to start anew

It's ok to use your ability.
You must know, it's hard to choose.
Time will tell, it's hard 'cus the way you feel
means you always seem to lose.

Seize the day, the one that you left behind
It seems so strange that you don't you move
Frozen still in front of your own lights
Win or lose, its time to choose
1234 Move
If you don't stop there, you'll make it through.
Stop dreaming, start something
When it's in your hands to start anew
