See The White Light
The Light Within
Be Your Own Disciple
Fan The Sparks Of Will
For All Of Us Waiting
Your Kingdom Will Come
...Alright

Rays Of Power Shining
Rays Of Magic Fall
On The Golden Voice
That Speaks Within Us All
For All Of Us Waiting
Your Kingdom Will Come

Kingdom Come

Now Feel The White Light
The Light Within
Yea It Burns A Fire
That Drives A Man To Win
For All Of Us Waiting
Your Kingdom Will Come

Kingdom Come

Words Of Power
Calling To Us All
Holding Us Together
While Other Kingdoms Fall
No Longer Waiting
Our Kingdom Has Come

Kingdom Come

Kingdom Coming
Another Kingdom Falls
The Rightful Are Waiting
But All Are Not Rightful
Wait And Receive...
The Weight Of The Fall
Kingdom Come
