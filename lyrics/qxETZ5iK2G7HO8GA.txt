You never miss your wealth, till your well went dry
Seem like only yesterday, you were here smiling
Now you gone away, but I know you in a better place
No traces of you, what can I do?
Alone and confused

How long, till I see your face
How long, till I see your face
How long, till I see your face
How long,
It's just not fair, wish you were here
Spend all my days, wasting away
Whoa, wish you were here

So I'm living life without you
And yes it's hard to go
Cause your memory means so much to me
And I need to stay strong
...I want to give, it's a shame to know
You're not coming back
I'll wait a hundred years, I'll cry a million tears
Till you're back, till you're back, come back now

How long, till I see your face
How long, till I see your face
How long, till I see your face
How long,
It's just not fair, wish you were here
Spend all my days, wasting away
Whoa, wish you were here

I'll find the strength to pick my head up
Time heals all wounds, gotta get right back up
Miss you again, over again
Love will come die
Walking the road, I see your ...
I know you're here, right by my side
Wish you were here, over again

It's just not fair, wish you were here
Spend all my days, wasting away
Whoa, wish you were here
Whoa, wish you were here
Whoa, wish you were here.
