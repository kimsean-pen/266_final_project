Light-years and shadows
You'll never see the end of day
Distant horizon
Far beyond the past you cannot save

Whispers, no silence
Echoing the sounds from far away
Sequenced pariahs
Following the footsteps to your grave

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me, now I'm paralyzed
Beyond, the distance is out of reach
There's no more I can take

Sail across

Light-years
You'll never see the end of day
Distant
It's far beyond, you cannot save

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me, now I'm paralyzed
Beyond, the distance is out of reach

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me, now I'm paralyzed
Beyond, the distance is out of reach
