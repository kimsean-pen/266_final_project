I rememver the day when
I first lyed my eyes on you
(Nananana yeah)
And the way you took me away at night
Like a beatuful afternoon
(Nananana)
Now I wonder what went wrong
So many things I can't undo
Babe
I wanna' go back in
your arms
And unsay the things I said to you
(Said to you, you)
You wanna' know why
I wanna' be in love again
I was thinkin about you babe
We'll be riding with the best crew
We'll be riding with the best crew

We could
Smoke weed in the afternoon
Get high like we used to do
We'll be riding with the best crew
Never feel the way that
Keep dreamin' til the last car
We'll be riding with the best crew
I remember the day when
I first lyed my eyes on you
(Nananana yeah)
And the way you took me away
Where the memeries are hard to lose
Now I wonder what went wrong
So many things I can't undo
Babe
I wanna' go back in
your arms
And unsay the things I said to you
You wanna' know why
I wanna' be in love again
I was thinkin about you babe
We'll be riding with the best crew
We riding with the best crew

I wanna' be in love again
So just do what you gotta' do babe
We'll be riding with the best crew
We riding with the best crew

I wonder what went wrong
Wrong

Now I wonder, now I wonder what went wrong
Now I wonder, now I wonder

You wanna' know why
I wanna' be in love again
I was thinkin about you babe
We'll be riding with the best crew
We riding with the best crew

I wanna' be in love again
So just do what you gotta' do babe
We'll be riding with the best crew
