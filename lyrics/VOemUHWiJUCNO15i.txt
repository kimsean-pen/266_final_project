Should have told you by now,
but I can't find the words,
oh no
If I could show you somehow,
but I don't have the nerve,
oh yeah

You don't see me looking at you,
how can love be so blind
Somehow you don't notice me,
sooner or later there will come a time, baby

If you need somebody,
the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody,
the way that I want you

Oh yeah,
the way that I want you

If I could hold you tonight,
it would last me forever
But the time's never right,
when will we be together,
oh no

If I could make you understand, what you're doing to me
Maybe there will come a time, when sooner or later I will make you see, baby

If you need somebody,
the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody,
the way that I want you

Ooh, if I could tell you now,
the way you make me feel
Ooh, if I could show you somehow,
don't you know my lovin' is oh so real

If you need somebody,
the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody,
the way that I want you

(If you need somebody) I need you, I want you, I gotta tell you
The way that I need you
And if you wanted somebody,
the way that I want you...
