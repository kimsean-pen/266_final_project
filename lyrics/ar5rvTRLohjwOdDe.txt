Days of the conflicts you've been in
Traces of conscience you don't want to hear
You hear it now
You listen, you hear a sound
You missed it
Taken by conscience or taken by guilt
You live in the problems you decided to build
You hear it now
You listen and hear a sound that can't be still
The blame was found
You got it - you got it
Rode when she was new
You used for glue
Yeah
Dazed for time you were into
Praise from the crowd that you wanted to fool
You call them now, they're waiting
To hear a sound that can't be still
The blame was found, you got it - you got it
Rode when she was new but wasn't told when she was through
Yeah...
Listen now, the sound that cant be still
The blame was found
You got it - you got it
Rode when she was new but wasn't told when she was through
(the blame was found)
Rode when she was new (the blame was found) but wasn't told when she was through
(the blame was found)
Rode when she was new (the blame was found) but wasn't told when she was through
Yeah
