Gunter glieben glauten globen

Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
And all the girls say I'm pretty fly or a white guy

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know it's kind of hard, just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabe's, ah
So (Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing

Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
And all the girls say I'm pretty fly (For a white guy)

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruising in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabe's, ah
(Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing

Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a '13', but they drew a '31'
Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the dopest trip

Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Give it to me baby! (Uh huh, uh huh!)
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabe's, ah
The world loves wannabe's
So let's get some more wannabe's, ah
(Hey! Hey!) do that brand new thing
