How long
How long have you been away
Oh how long
I can't find the words to say
I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Say you still love me
My love
Will I ever make you see
That somehow
You are still apart of me
Maybe we can compromise
Cause our love just can't be disguised
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Say you still love me
I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Oh my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me
Say you still love me
