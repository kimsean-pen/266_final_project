In this place, in this place I feel like dying
You have to try harder, otherwise you'll fall
They can smell your weaknesses
In this place, in this place I feel like dying
You have to try much harder, otherwise you'll fall for good

This may sound like a prayer but it's not
This is a written sentence from a man who doesn't know much but he cares
These lines are taken from a book, from an unwritten one
Can you follow your own shadow

'Cause no one else
'Cause no one else
'Cause no one else controls

I'll make the promise
I'll make the promise to never put anyone before you
You'll never need anyone else to be there for you
Make a promise that you have only one simple rule
And you are ready to follow me

This may sound like a prayer but it's not
This is a written sentence from a man who doesn't know much but he cares
These lines are taken from a book, from an unwritten one
Can you follow your own shadow

'Cause no one else
'Cause no one else
'Cause no one else controls
To believe and to love to be loved
'Cause no one else controls
