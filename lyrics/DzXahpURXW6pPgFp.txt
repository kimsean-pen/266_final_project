I want to feel you restless
I want to wake up from it
I want to see you stare at ceilings
Until you fall back to sleep

I want to feel you restless
I want to wake up from it
I want to see you stare at ceilings
Until you fall back to sleep
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
It's a little stuffy in here

I want to wring my hands in open elevators
A shaky finger I am pushing the door open button
I want to feel the urge to press against my neighbors
While I keep you in my mind
I keep you in my mind
All of the time here
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
One is moving one is standing
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
In the waiting room
Wonder where we'll land
Will we fall straight into routine
Or we'll be strangers for a week
Stir-crazy, lazy until I leave again
Then I jump out of my skin
Until you tell me where I am
Living Room, NY

Living Room, NY
I'll give an arm just to hear you in the dark
Saying Living Room, NY

So I'll fold the world to be there tonight
Because I want to fall asleep on your time
I want to fall asleep where you lie
I want to fall asleep with you shifting by my side
I want to fall asleep where you lie
I want to fall asleep with you, I
With you, I
With you, I
I miss you, I
