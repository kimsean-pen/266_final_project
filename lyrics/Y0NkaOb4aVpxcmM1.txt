Learnin' to love, loving to learn

A Handicap at my home turn,
Key horse on the hiway,
Laid off in the length,
The listed race was a longshot.

Dooblep...

Part weed on the pace board,
A Penalty for the point spread,
Went post-time on the scratch sheet,
The rougher was a ringer and a return.

Dooblep...

Still takes on the short round,
A spot play in the strech turn,
It was a sure thing for the tipsters,
With true eyes on the weigh-in.

Instrumental.

A cup hold bet on the dead heap,
A bug boy ran the bull ring,
There's dead tracks on the derby,
With a new forcast on the dime.

Dooblep...

Learnin' on the four lap,
Dirty boy show's a sure win,
There's a brick of fives in the five-O,
I made a blind bet in a black tie.

Learnin' to love, lovin' to learn.
