Finally
We have seen some things
Some awfully nice
Some dreadfully bad

But we will sing
Wash the blood off our knees
'Cause our love breaks
Through rough seas, our ship will sail it

I don't understand
How this world will work
'Cause time will tell us nothing
I'll take a chance on something

(Fill them up
Fill them
This time take you)

Down river
Down river
Down river
Down...

(Walk these stairs
Put the pieces back together)

Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Now go...

Finally
We have seen some things
But bells in your hallways
Don't move you in the right place

So we will sing
Cast our hopes out to sea
Though our hearts break
Through violent winds, our ship will sail it

I don't understand
How this world will work
'Cause time will tell us nothing
I'll take a chance on something

(Build them up
Build them
This time take you)

Down river
Down river
Down river
Down...

(Walk these stairs
Put the pieces back together)

Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Now go...
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Now go...
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop
Now go...
