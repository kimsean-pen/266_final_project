And it rains here
Everyday since I came
And the linen covers rocks
And the green finds everything
Chimacum rain

In the soar of leaves
And needle tufts and form
In the grasses and the reeds
And the spilling over stones
Chimacum rain

I'm spacing out
I'm seeing silence between leaves
I'm seeing down
I'm seeing silence that are his

He belongs here, can't have him
He belongs here, can't know him
He belongs here

It kinda gets inside you
The silences I mean
They kinda wrap around you
And loosen everything
Chimacum rain
