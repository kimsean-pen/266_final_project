A little bit of something on a bad-ass day
Can help me please my mind
'Cos a big bit of nothing don't take blues away
It's just like killing time

I just wanna rock your celebrity
A little bit of jammin' live on Saturday night
That's my ecstasy

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

Come on baby, come on baby
Come on baby be my superstar

Gotta go and get me some V.I.P
To road is long and high
We're running through a red
I'm playin' with fire, I won't get out alive

Trash your room and smash a big TV
Feeling kinda flashy, do you wanna play God
Let's play celebrity

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

When your light shines on
So bright it burns my eyes
I need commercial waves
My soul is gonna fly

A little bit of you, just lick me up
You really blew my mind
'Cos baby, you make me shine

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

Ooh baby, I want your hot action
Ooh baby, I love who you are
Ooh baby, I want some reaction
Come on shine on, be my superstar

Come on baby, come on baby
Come on baby be my superstar

Come on baby, come on baby
Ooh come on baby be my superstar
