Donnie:
Tick, tick, tock, tock
Tick, tick, tock, tock
Tick, tick, tock, tock
Jordan: Wake up wake up
Donnie: This is weighin' on me,
Jordan: Wake up wake up
Donnie: This is weighin' on my soul
Jordan:
I knew you must've had a long day
'Cause at 6 o'clock I heard you say
There was something that was on your mind
But you ain't told me and it's almost 9
Donnie:
Now we're starting the clock
And I thought we could talk
But you ain't given in (Jordan: Yea, girl)
Will this ever end?
Girl it's almost 10
Gotta know if you're mad at me
Before Grey's Anatomy
'Cause we could drag this out all night

Chorus:

Until it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha wanna do?
Do you wanna fight?
Wanna say goodnight?
If you tell me you want it
This could be over
'Cause it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha wanna do?
Do you wanna fight?
Wanna say goodnight?
If you tell me you want it
This could be over
Jordan:
The lights are out
Don't wanna wake you so I'm creepin' in
I know you hurt
'Cause baby you're not sleeping in
My favorite pair of boxers
That you make look so hot girl
Your play sleeping
I know you're not
Donnie:
And now it's 12 o'clock
And I thought I should talk
But you're not listenin'
Here we go again
You know I like when
Jordan:
You got your back to me
But not when you're mad at me
Please look at me and say goodnight
Chorus:
It's almost 2 in the morning (Jordan: It's 2 in the morning)
Girl, whatcha wanna do?
Do you wanna fight?
Wanna say goodnight? (Jordan: Oh)
If you tell me you want it
This could be over
'Cause it's 2 in the morning (Jordan: Wake up wake up)
Girl, whatcha wanna do? (Jordan: No, no)
Do you wanna fight?(Jordan: I don't wanna fight, girl)
Wanna say goodnight? (Jordan: K)
If you tell me you want it (Jordan: This could be over)
This could be over (Jordan: This could be over)
Jordan: Oh oh oh
Donnie: I wanna come over (I wanna come over)
Jordan: Oh oh oh
Donnie: Baby turn over (baby turn over)
Jordan: Yea
Joe:
Girl I've laying up all night
Just waiting for your kiss goodnight
Even if you're mad at me
You know we shouldn't go to bed angry
Chorus:

Now it's 2 in the morning (Joe: It's 2 in the morning)
Girl, whatcha wanna do?
Do you wanna fight? (Joe: I don't wanna fight)
Wanna say goodnight? (Joe: Do you wanna fight girl?)
If you tell me you want it
This could be over (Jordan: Say that it's over)
'Cause it's 2 in the morning (Jordan: Wake up, wake up)
Girl, whatcha wanna do?
Do you wanna fight? (Jordan: No, no)
Wanna say goodnight? (Jordan: K)
If you tell me you want it
This could be over
Joe: We can work it out
Jordan: Wake up, wake up
Joe: We can work it out
Jordan: Get up get up
Joe: We can work it out
I wanna come over
Joe: We can work it out
Jordan: Wake up, wake up
Joe: We can work it out
Jordan: Get up get up
Joe: We can work it out
