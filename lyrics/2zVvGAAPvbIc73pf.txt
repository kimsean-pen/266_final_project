Here I go
Going down, going down
My mind is a blank
My head is spinning around and around
As I go deeper in the funnel of love

It's such a crazy crazy feeling
I get weak in the knees
My poor old head is a reellin' around
As I go deep into the funnel of love

I tried and I tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
Ya just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's bound to get ya someday
