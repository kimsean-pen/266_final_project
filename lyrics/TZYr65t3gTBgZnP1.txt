We're living in this world of haze and it needs to change
I haven't felt anything for days, who's to blame for this malaise?
I need people that feel the same, I need to know this is not okay
I'm going far away and I might never come back
I've been drinking death until I had nothing left
Is this my best?
I just want to see the light inside my chest
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
We're living in this world of grey
We're drifting away from the lives were meant to lead
No one's got anything to say
Tell yourself that it's okay that there's not a better way
You don't want to leave this life but you know that you can't stay
And lately I feel the need to grow
Because I've tired of feeling alone
The mother told me all I need I already own
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
I don't want to live in misery
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
Show me how to see the light inside of me
Show me how to see the love that I need, that we need
