Don't it feel so much better when you see how much you've grown
Why are you writing a letter?
Why are you taking it on your own?
Why are you taking it
Why are you making it so hard?
So hard
So hard
Why'd you think you're so special?
Why'd you not think about what you said?
Wired comp of precious
Why'd you act like you didn't today?
You were born faking it and
What makes you making it so hard
So hard
So hard
So hard
