It's gonna be a long, long journey
It's gonna be an uphill climb
It's gonna be a tough fight
It's gonna be some lonely nights
But I'm ready to carry on

I'm so glad the worst is over
('Cause it almost took me down)
I can start living now
I feel like I can do anything, yeah
And finally I'm not afraid to breathe

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof

So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me
I'm the living proof, oh yes, I am

Thinking 'bout life's been painful, yes, it was
Took a lot to learn how to smile
So now I am gonna talk to my people
About the storm, about the storm

Oh, so glad the worst is over
('Cause it almost took me down)
I can start flying now
My best days are right in front of me
And I'm almost there 'cause now I'm free

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof

So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me
I'm the living proof

I know where I'm going
'Cause I know where I've been
I'm gonna feel strong, that's showin'
I'm gonna be strong, keep growin'
That's the way that I will

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof
So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me, yeah, yeah
I'm the living proof
Nothing about my life has been easy, no
But nothin's gonna keep me down, no, down
'Cause I know a lot more today
Than I knew yesterday, now
So I'm ready to carry on, oh Lordy, mmm, mmm
