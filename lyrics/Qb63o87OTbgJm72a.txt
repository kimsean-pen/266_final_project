One day when i got hungry
I sold the wooden house
I had to visit Uncle Ghandi
who lives in Calcutta town

Uncle Ghandi he is rich
he is a taxi driver man
and I know that he will help me
as much as he can

A taxi driver man is what
Iwant to be
but there are no customers
who want to ride with me
I dont know why
could be that I am almost blind
but every street in Calcutta I can find

Chorus:

Calcutta,
I am an taxi driver in
Calcutta,
I drive my little taxi in
Calcutta,
taxi, taxi, taxi, in
Calcutta
I am an taxi driver man

I like to drive the taxi
I like it very much
even though I have no licence
I always find the clutch
I can drive it off my head
I can drive it off my feet
and I have no problems
getting taxi on the street

Chorus

Solo:

Calle Calle cutta cutta cutta
EH OH

Chorus
