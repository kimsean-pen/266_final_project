You say we're the chosen ones
And claim its our only chance
You take with you my son
But you where have you gone?
The flag you shipped him home
In
Is fading

Now say something I don't know
And spare me the honor play
Said and done
Short of some
Somebody else's son
Fills in

I'm ready
I'm ready for the end
You know why
I'm ready
Well it never goes away
It turns out

The mill counts a minute pass
The sill where the widows wait
Its where it all begun
His fort command his gun
Oh god what have I done
For him?

I'm ready
I'm ready for the end
You know why
I'm ready
Well it never goes away
It turns out

I'm ready
I'm ready for the end
You know why
I'm ready
Well it never goes away
It turns out

Quem na rua se perde
Encontra o que pede
Acerta o que mede
E conta até errar
Que o erro é onde a sorte está
Não queira ver

Quem na rua se perde
Encontra o que pede
Acerta o que mede
E conta até errar
Que o erro é onde a sorte está
Não queira ver
