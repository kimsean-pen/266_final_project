Ponytail dragging
We up in this bitch, what's crackin'?
Minimal, braggin'
'Cause you can damn well see we ain't lacking

Lights, camera, ready for that action
Lights, camara, ready for that action

Tags, snatching, designer on designer it's a habit

'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Don't you see it?
'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Can you see me?
'Cause, baby, it's a look
Caviar, collard greens, I keep it real hood in my Prada jeans
My rings, high beams, cut through dark like lightning
I'm like a slow jam on the right beat
I'm like a slow jam on the right beat

Brownsville, Bev Hills, I be everywhere in this cashmere
Cus baby its a look
It's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Don't you see it?
'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Can you see me?
'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Don't you see it?
'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Can you see me?
'Cause, baby, it's a look

My house is catty cornered
Can't say that I ain't warn her
Egyptian cotton, thread count popping, flats in California
Face look like I got work
I'm booked for the year, you hurt
I'm in the scripture getting richer, crib look like a church

I'm a look, I'm a look, it's a look, it's a look
Don't you see it?
'Cause, baby, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look, it's a look
Can you see me?
'Cause, baby, it's a look
