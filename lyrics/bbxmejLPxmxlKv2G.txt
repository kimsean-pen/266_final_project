You and me in a playhouse
Living in a veil
We never need to go without
Memories bring no joy or peace
We are alone and all we need

Tuning out of their poison
Every waking day
Intolerance to overcome
Fortunes won by the boys with their guns
We are alone, nowhere to run

Bernadette, you are my liberty
I celebrate the day
That you changed my history
Of life and death
We'll always lead you into love and regret
But you have answers and I have the key
For the door to Bernadette

Winding down our emotions
Family and friends becoming ghosts to dream of
And pass on time we raise
Every face, every name
We are alone, no one to blame

Bernadette, you are my liberty
I celebrate the day
That you changed my history
Of life and death
We'll always lead you into love and regret
But you have answers and I have the key
To Bernadette
