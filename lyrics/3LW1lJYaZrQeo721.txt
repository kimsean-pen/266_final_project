Road trip and I lost my crown
To get away from this crazy town
He never seemed to look my way
My lover stays with his poker face You know how they say I only have eyes for you
Well you better be looking back at me babe
Said you better be looking back at me babe
You know how they say I only have eyes for you
Well you better be looking back at me babe
Said you better be looking back at me babe
A couple shows right up the street
By the shops where we used to meet
Smell your cologne when I walk away
It's like you're with me, I can hear you say
Boy, my love for you will never die
Even if I don't look you in the eye
Please stay, never die, never die
You know how they say I only have eyes for you
Well you better be looking back at me babe
Said you better be looking back at me babe
You know how they say I only have eyes for you
Well you better be looking back at me babe
Said you better be looking back at me babe
And now I'm crying
Cause you been trying
I said I'm crying, yeah
You know how they say I only have eyes for you
Well you better be looking back at me babe
Said you better be looking back at me babe
