If you shut out the sun, the day will never come
if you turn on your side,
this night won't come undone

Now you say you need a friend,
but we can't live again

Monday morning comes too fast,
you stumble down the diamond path
and every step will be your last
The sunken eyes you just can't see
remind me how you'll never leave
and every breath could be your last

Now you stand in the rain saying
"Nothing has changed at all"
Save the lines in your eyes
That remind me of summer's fall

Oh no. You say you need a friend.
But we can't live again
