You ain't even tryin'
But everything stops when you walk in a room
Tell me how you do it
You make me wanna fall just lookin' at you

The sound of your voice and the touch of your skin
Sendin' chills up my spine
The taste of your lips and the spell of your kiss
I can't deny

There's something 'bout you, you
And all the little things that you do, do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it babes

Just something 'bout you

Something 'bout you, you
Got me feeling something brand new
Ooo, I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind
It's more than just your body, baby
There's just something 'bout you

Caught up in the moment
Lost in the way that you're lookin' at me
You don't even know it
If you could only see what you're doin' to me

The sound of your voice and the touch of your skin
Sending chills up my spine
The taste of your lips and the spell of your kiss
I can't deny

There's something 'bout you, you
And all the little things that you do, do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it babes
There's just something 'bout you

Something 'bout you, you
Got me feeling something brand new
Ooo, I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind
It's more than just your body, baby
There's just something 'bout you

Maybe it's the way that you touch me
Maybe it's the way that you look tonight
Something that I can't understand
But I know I can't live without, live without

There's something 'bout you, you
And all the little things that you do, do
Girl I can't explain it
No matter how hard I try to put my finger on it babes
Just something 'bout you

Something 'bout you, you
Got me feeling something brand new
Ooo, I think I'm going crazy
It's more than just your mind
It's more than just your body, baby
There's just something 'bout you
Ooou
Just something 'bout you, babe
Ooou
