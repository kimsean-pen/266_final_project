You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
You know I'm happy up here

World
What you got for me?
Just bring it on!
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it...
What you got for me?
Just bring it on!
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it!
You know I really like it

I know I'll always be here
Whatever you do

Whatever you say
Nothing can push
the feeling away.
It's here in my heart and

It's here in my head
I feel like I'm part
of a book I read
And every page

and every paper
seem to be part of
human nature
Sending me back down memory lane
My favored record is playing again
You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
