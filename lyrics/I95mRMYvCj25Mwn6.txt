Only holding on
is this what you want?
is this what you want?
dreams are falling apart as were only holding on
ambition gets old
when our hearts lie to us
our hearts break our trust as were only holding on

we gave our everything
we gave our everything
we gave our everything
all for unwanted dreams
we gave our everything

lights dim down
were the stars tonight
their voices bring
slight wind to the sky
their voices sing along
feel their souls lift with ours as they share the night
but you sing a different song
you sing a different song

only holding on
is this what you want?
is this what you want?
dreams are falling apart as were only holding on
to a broken piece
we try to fit as one
our hearts break our trust as were only holding on

we gave our everything
we gave our everything
we gave our everything
all for unwanted dreams
we gave our everything

cant you see my grip is weakening,
erasing every line
and taking down the frames
id look back but im too far away
a ghost to the faces i miss

have a little faith
ill come back home
dont forget my name
when im alone
a ghost to the faces i miss
im a ghost to the faces i miss
