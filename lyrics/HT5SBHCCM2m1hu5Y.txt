Sunny day
In all its' glory
Hot as a 4th of July
The wind came in
And grace my face
And it led me to your eyes

Something told me
I'll be seeing you again
But for some reason ill still cry
Now years have gone by
Still by your side
But there's something on my mind

Oh seems like
It don't matter if I'm speaking the truth
For hiding something to protect the lie
And at the end of the day
You still have something to say
Can't get the blues off your mind

I
I don't know
I don't know how
I dint know how to love you
No I-I-I-I-I
I don't know baby
I don't know how
Said I don't how to love you

When the morning
I reach for your embrace
'Cause I know that you need mine
And I want you to know
It can stay this way
Till the end of out lives

Oh-oh-oh
They've been many, many times
When my words get getting tangled up on the floor
Oh yeah
When that feeling of you
That you trusted me
That our love will always be here to give you
More and more and more

My my my
I don't know
I don't know who
Said I don't how to love you

Oh I, I, I, I
I don't know
I don't know how
Said I don't know how to love you

Oh-Oh-Oh
I don't know
I don't know how
Don't know how yo love you

Oh I
I don't know
I don't know how
No I don't know how to love you
