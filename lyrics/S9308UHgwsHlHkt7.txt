I'll wait for you;
run wild and aspire
Thrive
burn young fire
When you say "fight back" our love won't tire
Unweathered and untethered light

I promise you and I will see it through
You lay dreaming
No time to sleep as I begin to weep
Life is fleeting
I tighten fast inside your tourniquet
Stop the bleeding
Your tenderness, your softened skin
All I needed

Your love is my tourniquet
Learn to rise, contain the pressure
This was supposed to be no miracle
Bow down because I'm under pressure once again

I promise you, I promise you
Take my strength
I honour you with everything
Take my strength
I promise you and I will see it through
Am I dreaming?
The endless light you shine on me
All I needed
