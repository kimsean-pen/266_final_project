Win the big prize and die the next day
No one will say where it all goes
Spend life savings on a brand new car
Watch it crumpled being towed
Terrified of the man in charge
As he changes everything
You finally drop down to one knee
And realize you've lost the ring

I bet you didn't see that one coming, right between the eyes
I bet you didn't see that one coming, unwelcome surprise
I bet you didn't see that one coming

The courage comes and you can take the ride
First time in the air
And as you meet the earth face to face
You realize life isn't fair
Carry life 'til it's ready to bloom
Born without a heart
Ready to race and ready to go
No one to say it's time to start

I bet you didn't see that one coming, right between the eyes
I bet you didn't see that one coming, unwelcome surprise
I bet you didn't see that one coming

No warning, no breath, no beat
No future, no help, no end I see
No point, no thing to gain
You can't win by cheating the game

Pulled over when you're already late
Ending shackled, face on the ground
My favorite band plays my favorite bar
But only when I'm out of town
Hit the lottery and hit 10 mil
Split in 12 million ways
I get a break and finally die
But someone else is in my grave

I bet you didn't see that one coming, right between the eyes
I bet you didn't see that one coming, unwelcome surprise
I bet you didn't see that one coming

No warning, no breath, no beat
No future, no help, no end I see
No point, no thing to gain
You can't win by cheating the game
