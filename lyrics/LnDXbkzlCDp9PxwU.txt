His throne is unthreatened.
No man dare to challenge.
Emperor in stone, ruler in disguise.
Take on life form, pass through the fields.

Let kingdom come.
Eternal order done.

Here they collect.
The oath of servants.
By the mountain side.
Follow the pack.

Caveman trapped inside.
Trees and beings come to life.
Emperor in fire, ruler in disguise.
Take on life form, caught in the fields.

Come alive you sovereign.
Gather the herd and lead the way.
