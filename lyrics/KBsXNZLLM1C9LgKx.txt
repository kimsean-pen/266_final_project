Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, yeah

We who are about to bang them drums (Bang)
Beatin' on a dead body ridin' shotgun
Talkin' that shit, bitch bite your tongue
See that ship over your city, better run, run
Your war is like a board game where it come from
Already bored, claiming your gang
"Pyong!" go the gun, boy he on some other shit
Check your solar system bitch
Don't let a motherfucker catch you sleepin' at the wrong sun (Wrong sun)
Son the haters, send 'em into orbit
Higher than these motherfuckers claiming it's they purpose
Turned and asked your partner why he started acting nervous (Brrat!)
Keep talking, that's lip service
Rats decided it was time to hit the surface
Cats sleepin' on it, write 'em off like cursive
Drown a fuckin' hater, his experience immersive
Now that he can feel it, call the doctors and the nurses up

Whatcha gon' do about it? Ain't nothin' new about it
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe)
Air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see)
Air 'em out (No)
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders

Try to play it killer soft like silk (Salt)
Old frail gas gotta play for the milk
Lies high off these lows when they step up in the party
Where they got up in they o's like some fuckin' Oankali
Whips and chains, [?] game like it was in bulk
Back when a mack could slang
With his partners tryna make his fuckin' name in the traps
All the way from [?] to the Kefahuchi tract
Snatch a hoochie with a smile, tap her from the back
If somebody try to stop you, tell that dick to back back
Back back, back back, stack racks, invisible
Five deep, strap hangin' out a black dirigible
Playin' shit is critical, masses massive
Masked mass murderer, mastiff
Barking at the moon that done been walked on, hit the kill switch
Your ass done movin' backwards when they choke you with that real trick

Whatcha gon' do about it? Ain't nothin' new about it
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe)
Air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see)
Air 'em out (No)
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders

Come up off your smooth talk, playa this raspy
You stuck on Morse code, playa this ASCII
Your birthright make you scared to get nasty
The keyword is Kemmer, that's what your ass need
Anybody buggin' get it in the mandible, shit
Got a problem, better hit 'em on they ansible
Ain't nobody flyin' just because they fly here
You could trip sets, real playas trip lightyears
Tightrope time, twinkle toes and what?
Is you ridin' or not? Everybody's hands up
Who they want? (Who they want?)
Game over (Game over)
Ol' leech callin' anyone who ain't sober
Old leakin' ass man in the corner
Talkin' that shit to the sky is a warnin'
You might wanna pay attention what he sayin'
Cause the Ekumen ain't everything and these killas ain't playin', ho!

Whatcha gon' do about it? Ain't nothin' new about it
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe)
Air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see)
Air 'em out (No)
Shoulda made the noose a little tighter
Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some motherfuckin' riders
