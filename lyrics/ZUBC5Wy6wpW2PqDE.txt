My body is sanctuary

My blood is pure

(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)

You want me bad

I think you're cool

But I'm not sure

(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)

Follow me

Don't be such a holy fool

Follow me

I need something more from you

It's not about sex or champaigne

You holy fool (Do doo do Do doo Do doo)

If you want me

Meet me at Electric Chapel

If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In the electric chapel
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)
Pray for your sins
Right under the
Glass disco ball
(Do doo do Do doo Do doo)
Follow me
Don't be such a holy fool
Follow me
I need something sacred from you
Together we'll both find a way
To make a pure
Love work in dirty way
If you want me
Meet me at the Electric Chapel
If you want me
Meet me at the Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In the electric chapel
Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh
(Meet me, meet me)
(Meet me, meet me)
(Meet me, meet me)
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
If you want me
Meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby in a safe place
Come on meet me
In the electric chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
(Meet me, meet me)
(Meet me, meet me)
