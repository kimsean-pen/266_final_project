Always forget who I am
Can't say I try and understand
And when I try it out with you
Now I'm okay if you are too

We can only try to stay alive
What are you to do at twenty-five?

And when they ask all the time
Say I'm doing just fine
Close your eyes and tell me how you feel
Can you feel the truth and is it real?

We can only try to stay alive
What are you to do at twenty-five?
