I generally don't like to talk about
The idiosyncrasies of an obvious fool
It's clear to me he's not worth your energy
Let's break it down
He's just not very nice to you

I find myself floating away
Outside of space and time
I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude
But I think I'm losing my mind

Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about the boy

Alright. Okay. I must admit
I've talked off my share of ears
On the subject at hand
Sound like a pathetic parrot repeating
Polly wanna cracker til it eats
So many crackers that it's dead

I like to see you happy
And I much enjoy your brain
The way you think is so unique
But he's taking all the real estate

Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about that boy
Stop talking about the boy

You have to make a choice
Don't be an accidental voice
We have to speak with grace
We will become the words we say
Hey. We will become the words we say
Hey. We will become the words we say

Stop talking about that

Stop talking about that boy, boy, boy
Talking about that boy, boy, boy
Stop talking about that boy, boy, boy
Stop talking about
