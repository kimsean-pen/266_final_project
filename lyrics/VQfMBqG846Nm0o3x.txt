Burning fire
In your eye
Melt away overnight
Carve your life
Sharpened knife
Like a thrill
In a fight
It's the moment to blow our minds
Faith is blind

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Your victory will live forever
Keep fighting for the riot inside

Believe and carry on
Jump on the bandwagon
History goes on
Believe and carry on

Bird of night
Broken chains
There's no time to deny
Past is gone
The future's bright
Throw away
Yesterday
Create your brand new name
There's no shame
So light the flame

You know you're gonna win or you'll learn
Your victory will live forever
Keep fighting for the riot inside

Believe and carry on
Jump on the bandwagon
History goes on
Believe and carry on
If you believe then you can reach
Anything you want

ميراث ميراث نورك ساطع وغالي

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Your victory will live forever
Keep fighting for the riot inside

Believe and carry on (you'll win or you'll learn)
Jump on the bandwagon (the candle will be burnt)
History goes on (you'll win or you'll learn)
Believe and carry on
