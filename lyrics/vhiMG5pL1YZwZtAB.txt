We were too wasted to close the window
Friends and family lookin? into my only hiding place
The rhythm of a stranger's skin

Infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognize me

He holds a certain gesture
When we're lovin' to ask each other
Do you want it? Do you want me?
I want it, it is you, you are where I want to be

Who is he?
(Ooh)
Why would I
(Do)

Hitch a ride?
(The)
I can drive
(Twist)

Who is she?
(Ooh)
Why would I
(Do)

Hitch a ride
(Ooh)
When I can drive?
(The twist)

Somebody put me back in school, I forget everything
I used to know how to leave the boy behind
Without having to watch him go, oh

Infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognize me

He holds a certain gesture
When we're lovin' to ask each other
Do you want it? Do you want me?
I want it, it is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he?
(Ooh)
(Circumstantial)
Why would I
(Do)

Hitch a ride?
(The)
I can drive
(Twist)

Who is he?
(Ooh)
(Circumstantial)
Why would I
(Do)

Hitch a ride
(Ooh)
When I can drive?
(The twist)

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
Do the twist
(Do)

Circumstantial
(The)
Do the twist
(Twist)

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
Do the twist
(Do)

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
(The twist)
Always

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
Do the twist
(Do)

Circumstantial
(The)
Do the twist
(Twist)

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
Do the twist
(Do)

Circumstantial
(Ooh)
(The twist)
Always
