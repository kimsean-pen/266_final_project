She sends me blue valentines
All the way from Philadelphia
To mark the anniversary
Of someone that I used to be
And it feels just like a warrant
Is out for my arrest
Baby, you got me checkin'
In my rearview mirror
That's why I'm always on the run
That's why I changed my name
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
To send me blue valentines
Like half-forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe
As I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory
Baby, it's the thistle in the kiss
It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck
It's the tatooed broken promise
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm going to see you every time I turn my back
She sends me blue valentines
Though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love
Must have a eulogy
Why do I save all of this madness
Here in the nightstand drawer
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Baby, I know
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
With this blind and broken heart
Sleeps beneath my lapel
Instead, these blue valentines
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt
Or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a lot of whiskey
To make these nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And I'm going to die a little more on each St. Valentines day
Don't you remember, I promised I would write you
These blue valentines
Blue valentines
Blue valentines
