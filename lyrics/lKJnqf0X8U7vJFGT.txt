It was the worst thing that I'd ever done
It was a head shot
You know, you gave me the gun

Oh please, just hide me now
I won't tell a soul
It was the worst part
What we did to this little girl
Oh please, don't leave me now
Baby please, don't go away

Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
Emily come home

It was the last time I saw her alive
Sometimes you do things you need to do to survive
Oh please, don't leave me now
I'll miss you so much
Oh please, don't go away
I'm needing your touch, but please don't leave me now
Baby, please don't go away

Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
Emily, come home, come home, come home, come home

Now Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
And Emily, come home
Now Emily come home
Now Emily come home
Now Emily come home

"I'd like to hear that, see if the tempo is good, ya know? Yeah, I wanna listen to it."
