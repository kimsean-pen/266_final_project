Send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Where should I go?

There's so much I wish that I had
Another roof perhaps and then it wouldn't feel so bad

I said send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Where should I go?

Straight in the other room
There's a bright light
Maybe across the sea
But that don't feel quite right

I said, now, send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me
Now, where should I go?

There's so much I wish I had done
Been better at some things and then I'd feel I won, I said I'll go

Send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me
Where should I go?

There's so much I wish that I had
Another roof perhaps and then it wouldn't feel so bad

I said, now, send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me
Now, where should I go?

Send me
Where should I go?
I said, send me, send me, send me
Where should I go?
Where should I go?
Where should I go?
