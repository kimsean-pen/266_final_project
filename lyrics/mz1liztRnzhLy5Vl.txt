Last night, I dreamt the old, sea foam green paint
In the room my brother and I once shared
Was swallowing up the walls again
A forest of latex reclaiming acres of land

You were there too
Swimming in your father's army jacket and sprawled across my floor
Like an arm of the sea separating the rest of the world from you and me

When I woke, the first thing I checked were the walls
Still dressed like new in a brown sugar coat

And you were still beside me
Your face was warm and flushed with sleep

I am trying so hard not to take this all for granted

So you do not stir, I lay back down quietly
Hands nestled or anchored just behind the small of your back
