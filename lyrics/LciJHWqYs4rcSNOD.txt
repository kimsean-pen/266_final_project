All dressed up
In a white straitjacket
Shut your mouth
No, you can't have it

Paper airplanes
Open window
Here today
And gone tomorrow

I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape

I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you ok
'Cuz I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright

All messed up
And slightly twisted
Am I sick or am I gifted

Paper airplanes
Open window
Here today
And gone tomorrow

I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape

I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you ok
'Cuz I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright

Woh
I don't care if you apologize
I can't lie
Woh
I can't lie

I like to stare at the sun
And think about what I've done
I lie awake in my great escape

I like crossing the line
And slowly losing my mind
Are you ok
'Cuz I feel fine
Maybe it's me
I'm just crazy
Maybe I like that I'm not alright
Maybe I like that I'm not alright
