It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Oh, let me get it back, let me get it back, let me get it back
Baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has

It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back, carry me back
Baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Oh, it seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Makin' vows that just couldn't work right
Yeah, open your arms, open your arms, open your arms
Baby, let my love come running in, yeah

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
