what'd you say
when I said we'll be here through tomorrow
in my heart and in my head
fear of failure
fear of reprimand
two big problems
I've never had
I never doubted what I had inside... what I have inside
values here in my heart
and we'll be here through tomorrow
every day's a brand new start
fear of failure
fear of reprimand
two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what ya had inside... what you have inside
fear of failure
fear of reprimand
two big problems I've never had
I never doubted what we had inside... what we have inside
