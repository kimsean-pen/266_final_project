I've taken for granted the reach of my voice
Host to the outbreak, opaque blades of noise
Chaos evolves myself
A part of me must die to make the space for growing light
The past devolves with time
Don't let it define
Why run from what remains behind?
Unclasp my hands
Let go of dead weight, outgrown
Constricting me around my throat
My words, my last?
Who knows when death will crawl through my window?
Before I go, you should know

Fire is where life is made
Burn within, hear the pain
Blacken my eyes, char my name
Throw the ash in my face
Hear my words
It constellates inside my brain
Wear the scars, claim the shame
Now the fire, weakened flame
There's new growth after the blaze

My skin bled and dried the wounds
My eyes watched it mend
My teeth gnash these words of suffering
So my mind may transcend
Are your ears burning in likeness?
In crisis we all unite
Redesign my bias mind
Born to bind the worst of times
Crowing a voice within me
As loud as the darkness I believe

Dark matter will ossify
Corroding my reason
Coalesce in my soul
I ossify, I blacken my eyes

Axis of ice, frost of my spite
I create the mold
Orbit with heat, I increase the cold
To keep my world under my feet
I cannot defend what's growing within
Set fire to my skin
Embers escape, all that remains
The crux of what I am

Noose in my voice, weapon of choice
To suffuse my sable void
Dark matter, no light emits
I'm starved of life, full of regrets

We've taken for granted the reach of our voice
Hosts to the outbreak, opaque blades of noise
Chaos evolves the world
Part of it must die to make the space for growing light
The past devolves with time
Don't let it define
Why run from what remains behind?
Unclasp my hands
Let go of dead weight, outgrown
Constricting us around our throat
My words, my last?
Who knows
