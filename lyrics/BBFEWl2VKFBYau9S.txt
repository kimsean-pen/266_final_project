The end of summer at your house,
It was past your curfew so I had to sneak you out.
The grass was wet beneath my toes,
I waited there to catch you underneath your window.

We won't sleep tonight

Street lights shone out on the curb,
You jumped into my arms and we hoped that no one had heard.
We took that over the creek,
And talked about the future as the water kissed our feet.

The hours flew by like the wind.
Next thing I knew, I had to walk you home again.

We won't sleep tonight
