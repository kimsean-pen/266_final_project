In this world there's much confusion
And I've taste the city life and it's not for me
Now I do dream of distant places
Where I don't know now but it's destiny

If it's the rich life I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want destiny
(Destiny)
It's the place for me
Yeah, yeah

Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be me
C'mon let me feel free

Now I'm a man that's for all seasons
And what the city offers me ain't naturally
(Naturally)
Now I look to greet the stars but there's no stars to see
I'm gonna search this world until I find my destiny

If it's the rich life I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want destiny
(Destiny)
It's the place for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be me
C'mon let me feel free
Let me be me

I wanna get far from here
Or should I up and fly away so fancy free, yeah
Nobody can change my mind
The words of destiny are calling me wild time

I want destiny
(Destiny)
It's the place for me
Yeah

Ah, destiny
(Destiny)
You and me
Should we fly away
So fancy free

Ah, destiny
(Destiny)
You and me
So fancy free

Destiny
Ah, destiny
