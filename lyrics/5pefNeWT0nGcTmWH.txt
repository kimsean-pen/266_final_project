Call for me darkness
We can hold on hope
We'll sleep alone
One last embrace at the gates of disorder
Don't follow me down
I promise I'll find you soon

It's time to say goodnight, God bless you
For all the stories that you gave
For the lessons you told
And all the words that you hold
Of giants descending
The destroyer of worlds

Drift apart, open water
Midnight is my only friend

Give me hope
Give me fuel so I can start a fire
I hope we will be again
Wrap it up and sail us away
Until the waves break
Until this ship rolls in
We will rise again
The destroyer of worlds
