We can't change this place the way it changes us.
The parking lot where we lay is more than home now.
Breathe in deep.
Please, breathe in deep.
The light bleeds through the window pane, into our eyelids.
Our bodies drown in Sheetz.
Anchored, exhausted.
Count the stains one by one, up on the ceiling.
The echoes race around the room, they sing together: "We are all the same"
