I'm on fire flying fast flying high
I should have stayed, you'd have left me
I gone too fast we're goin to crash
It's suicide if you let me.

It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go
It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go

It's coming off it will shock you so hard
It's a nervous desire
It's getting late
I'm goin to feint
Something in my head
It's so quiet

It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go
It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go

Whenever you feel, like I feel
Somethings gone wrong
Well I wont be here to clean up this mess.

You better change your ways
You better change today

My head's so strong you don't know what I'm on
Don't even care so much to fight ya
I'm built for power in every hour
I guess you win if I let ya.

It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go
It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go

You're talking crap with your trash can mouth
With every word comes a judder
What's going on why don't you hold that song
Speak straight don't stutter stutter stutter

It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go
It's gotta hold up so what got a shot
Come on and go

Whenever you feel, like I feel
Somethings gone wrong
Well I wont be here to clean up this mess.

You better change your ways
You better change today

Whenever you feel, like I feel
Something has gone wrong
Well I wont be here to clean up this mess.

You better change your ways
You better change today.
