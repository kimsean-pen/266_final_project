Fellas I wonder would you mind if I talked to ya for a minute
You know, sometimes we have a tendencies, or should I say we forget
What a woman needs every now and then
That is, if you wanna keep your thing together
Listen to me now

Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better every day
Then you got to stay on your P's and Q's
If you don't, the woman you can easily lose

Oh I, oh I had a love and I lost her
And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
Oh, a woman gotta have it, I believe
She's gotta know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it, every time boy
She wants to know that she's not walkin' on shaky grounds
Oh, yeah

Well, think it over, think it over my brother
Don't take for granted the smile on her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the girl might never say another word
But you gotta make sure that her voice is heard

Oh I, had a love, a true love and I lost it
I'm suffering all this pain that that love caused me
Oh now a woman gotta have it, you got to give it to her
She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it
She wanna know that she's not walkin' on shaky grounds
Yeah, oh oh

So if you got a love, and you wanna keep her
You got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it and how she wants it, oh yeah
Every doggone time she feels she needs it
What I'm tryin' to say, a woman gotta have it
Hey, hey, hey, a woman gotta have it
