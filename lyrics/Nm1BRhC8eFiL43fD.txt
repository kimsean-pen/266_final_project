For once I thought I was doing it right
Threw everything I had aside
But all this time you say I could've tried
How?! When my heart's pressing against the walls
I set the tone so you'd keep coming home
But you're not around, you're not around
I gave it all when you asked me for more
But the you turned it down
And now you're not around, you're not around
I should've left at the sound of this hitting the ground
I couldn't leave, I never thought I was so naive
I'm sure you know where I'm willing to go with this
Don't push it further, just try to remember
I set the tone so you'd keep coming home
But you're not around, you're not around
I gave it all when you asked me for more
But the you turned it down
And now you're not around,
No, you're not around
I set the tone so you'd keep coming home
But you're not around, you're not around
I gave it all when you asked me for more
But the you turned it down
And now you're not around
I set the tone so you'd keep coming home
But you're not around, you're not around
I gave it all when you asked me for more
But the you turned it down
And now you're not around,
And now you're not around
