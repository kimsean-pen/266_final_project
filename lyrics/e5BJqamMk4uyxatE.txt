speak nothing but lies
steal, borrow and beg
stale copycat lives
still living off dregs
a small counterfeit mind
sees nothing in depth
a sham second hand mime
thats mirrors image has fled. its fled
as you follow foot steps
you're the pain in my neck
forever follow foot steps
you're the pain in my neck
you're the pain in my neck
imitate as an art
you're just secondhand smoke
and keep following
they'll follow footsteps
and they'll never depart
as themselves they can't cope
and keep following
they'll follow footsteps
give up both of their arms
something not of their own
and keep following
they'll follow footsteps
suffered pains in my heart
suffered pains in my throat
you're the pain in my.
you're the pain in my neck
speak nothing but lies in all days in all nights
and never borrow just beg just beg
keep up the copycat lives in all ways in all types
remember living off dregs the dregs
think up your counterfeit mind and keep both of your eyes
peeled up for nothing in depth in depth
your mirrors image has died with the second hand mime
cus you followed its steps its steps
you're the pain in my neck
you're the pain in my neck
forever following steps, ever following steps
my neck
my neck
you're the pain in my neck, my neck
you're the pain in my neck
