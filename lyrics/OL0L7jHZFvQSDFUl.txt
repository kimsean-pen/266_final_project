First time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it on the back of my tongue and then swallowed it
Second time, things are getting easier
Blow me down, this wind's getting breezier
Third time lucky, maybe feeling fuzzy
Oh my god, we're getting hippy dippy
Five, six, seven, man I'm in heaven
And I'm growing my beard before it gets sheared

You're on my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind
On my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind

First time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it right up and that was the end of it
Second time, things are getting easier
Hairs on the back of my neck are getting stickier
Third time lucky, perversely body
Doctor I'm ill, please pass me the brandy
Five, six seven, I heard George Foreman say:
"Stone horses loose, fast women frighten"

You're on my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind
On my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind

I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself

(Oh yeah, cos)
You're on my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind
On my mind every day and every night
And you'll never go away cos I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind...
