It's a take-out weekend
It's a fake-out smile and pretend
If nobody sees you cry
You can say it was raining outside

And all that you want is a few days down
All that you need, a little time to drown
It's to be expected with all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is a few days down
Oh, a few days down, oh

It's a short vacation to a foreign nation
Oh, nothing familiar here
Just you and your lonesome heart complaining

And all that you want is a few days down
All that you need, a little time to drown
It's to be expected with all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is a few days down
Oh, a few days down

I'm looking out ten stories high
And like a blanket lifted the quiet night
The city finally waking up, the morning light

And all that you want is a few days down
All that you need, a little time to drown
It's to be expected with all the weight you carry 'round
All that you want is a few days down
Oh, a few days down, oh, few days down
Oh, a few days down
