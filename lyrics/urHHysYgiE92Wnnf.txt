You move on again
See you and I have to flee again
You always make it alright
Is that the way it is?
Let's get along again
You know your move around the bend

Why is that the way it is?
The morning only showed

I wanna show you my past lives
I wanna be the guy you write
I want you to see things clearly
I wanna make it alright

Don't you be so reasoned
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?

Don't you be so reasoned
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?
