Shy nameless whisper
Ghost veiled of fading shade
Your gentle presence
I feel on me your hand

Revealing sorrow
The pain of times now gone
Innocence bleeding
A never answered call

Feel me, tell me
Take my hand and fly
In the shadows
Where your hopes are lying
Where your stolen beauty
Forever cries

The cry of heaven
The tears of angels
A tragic destiny unfolds

Breathe in my essence
Of raining stardust
I'll heal your wounds
Beloved pure soul
In cold dreams

Grey storming oceans
Winds blowing all their rage
Clack clouds arising
And then just fear and hate

Dear little sister
They took your joyful smile
Lady of winter
Grant her a ray of light

Feel me, tell me
Take my hand and fly
In the shadows
Where your hopes are lying
Where your stolen beauty
Forever cries

The cry of heaven
The tears of angels
A tragic destiny unfolds

Breathe in my essence
Of raining stardust
I'll heal your wounds
Beloved pure soul
In cold dreams

In cold dreams I'm lost
In cold dreams I'm lost
In cold dreams I'm lost
I'm lost...
I'm lost...
