In our sleep, there's more to this night.
Now will she beg for your mercy?
Slowly but sure, I'm hoping what comes in the absense of love.
At night, she'll kick and she'll fight, should they fail in his sight
At night, I'll worry from all, the end of us all.

Please!
Mom!
They're coming for me!

Please!
Mom!
Run, lock your door, they're coming for me!

The clock reads 21: 13.
All work will stop,
And the ground will relieve.

Please!
Mom!
They're coming for me!

Please!
Mom!
Run, lock your door, they're coming for...

When I fall asleep,
Your face is all I see...
Dear momma I love.
I fall asleep,
Your face is all I dream...
Dear momma I love.

Ohhhhhhh...
In your frame you'll be this well.
In the face you miss the most,
You'll see them soon... stop.
I bid you fair warning,
Stay up 'til you...
When the memories occur,
Of a life you haven't lived.
Stay still, you will.
I've got a secret to hide,
And I've got a secret to hide...

In the words,
Of father to son.
Thy Kingdom Come.

Whoa whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.

Please mom, they're coming for me.
Please mom, run lock your door, they're coming for...

When I fall asleep,
Your face is all I see...
Dear momma I love.
I fall asleep,
Your face is all I dream...
Dear momma I love.

Whoa whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.
When I fall asleep.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa.
When I fall asleep...

Those days we lost our dignity,
The eager dare to stand.
The right home through victory,
On the innocent they tread.

But I robot will never die.
I robot will never die.
But I robot will never die.
But I robot will never die...
