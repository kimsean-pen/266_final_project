Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you'll do it right

Now every day we touch the same old talk with words that go
You love your friends but you don't ever see them any more

Hang tight, kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
But I can't figure out the do's and don't's

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you'll do it right

Oh, you know how it is
When the sky is crashing down again
So there you are
If you really want to go to the days when just...

We walk the park in silence 'cause we picked up on the rain
And maybe this is me, but your friends all seem to go so very slow

Hang tight, kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
I can't be certain but I think you know

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you'll do it right

Oh, I know you do
'Cause I sure know it too
