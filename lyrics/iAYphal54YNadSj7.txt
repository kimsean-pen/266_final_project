You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)

I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Baby, you're home

Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're living for tonight

You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back

This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know (I know, I know)
I know, I know (I know, I know)
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home

Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're living for tonight

You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back

You give me a reason (huh)
You give me a feeling (huh)
And all of the things you've given to me
You give 'em to me baby

You give me a reason
To feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer
To all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You got my heart, I don't want it back
