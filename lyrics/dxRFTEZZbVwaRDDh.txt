You can't hide from the devil
I'm tired of the hypocrites preaching
How I should be living my life
My heart flows like a river
All I want to do is take away hate
So I can see love in their eyes

Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you

Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you

We can all roar like a lion
Stand tall when we lose it all
'Cause you know that's the only way to survive
When you feel the flames are rising higher
Don't fear the lion when it comes from deep inside

Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new
Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you

Fire, fire, burn that with fire
Bring back the new, you
Fire, fire, burn that with fire
Bring back the new, you

(Get rid of the old and bring back the new)
(Get rid of the old and bring back the new)
(Get rid of the old and bring back the new, you)
Bring it back
(Get rid of the old and bring back the new) ah
(Get rid of the old and bring back the new) ah
(Get rid of the old and bring back the new) ah (you)

Fire, fire, fire
Bring back the new, you
Fire, fire, fire
Bring back the new, you
Fire, fire, fire
Bring back the new, you
Fire, fire, fire
Bring back the new, you
