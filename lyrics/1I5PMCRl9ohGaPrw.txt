It was a show stopping moment
The minute that you caught my attention
Really something to see, yeah
With every movement, every motion, every word
In the conversation
It meant so much to me, yeah
I decided to move on, move on,
To find me something I could lean on
Something I could look forward too
Don't get caught up in the past

Get lost, you're dancing to the beat of a different drum
Because, you could never feel that I was coming bored off
The past, won't do it now, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oho

You came along and just for time to call in for desperate measures
Is this desperate enough, yeah, yeah, yeah
You was tumbling for words to impress
You were charming and glamour
When I was down on my love, yeah, yeah, yeah
I decided to move on, move on
To find me something I could lean on
Something I could look forward too
Don't get caught up in the past

Get lost, you're dancing to the beat of a different drum
Because, you could never feel that I was coming bored off
Get lost, you're dancing to the beat of a different drum
Because, you could never feel that I was coming bored off
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oho
