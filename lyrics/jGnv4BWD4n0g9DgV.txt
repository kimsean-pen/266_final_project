As we're born to ride alone
Never to return
Cry unfair if you want
So we grow in the ways we were,
...To the way we are
Fallout.

You're on your own
You're all, you're always home
And we fall now.

As we live to right the wrongs
Never to return, then the truth hits you hard.
So we've grown from the ways we were, to the ways we are
Fallout.

You're on your own
You're all, you're always home
And we fall now.

If you could say, anything you wanted...
What would you say?

I'd tell you all:
We are young, at the end of this cycle.
And there may be no rest even when we are done.

That's when you're feeling empowered
You'll trade your fear in for power
If we knew what came tomorrow
There'd be no time for the sorrow.

Throttle!

As we're born to ride alone, never to return
Cry unfair if you want

So you've grown in the ways we were
...To the way we are
Fallout.

You're on your own
You're all, you're always home
And we fall now.

If you could say anything you wanted... what would you say?
