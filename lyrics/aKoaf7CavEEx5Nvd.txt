Shake it up

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly

I got lost

In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart

And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
Suppose I never, ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet

And so sah-ah-ah-ah-oft
Suppose I never, ever saw you
Suppose we never, ever called
Suppose I kept on singin' love songs
Just to break
My own fall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Break my fall

Break my fall
All my friends say
That of course
It's gonna get be'er
Gonna get be'er
Be'er, be'er, be'er, be'er

Better, better, better, ohhh...
I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost

In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart
I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
And it breaks my ha, ah, ah, ah, art
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
And it breaks my heart
Breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
