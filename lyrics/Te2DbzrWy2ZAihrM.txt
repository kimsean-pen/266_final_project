Hold my head
We'll trampoline
Finally through the roof
On to somewhere near
And far in time

Velouria
Her covering
Travelling career
She can really move
Oh velveteen

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore you
My Velouria
Even I'll adore you
My Velouria

Say to me
Where have you been
Finally through the roof
And how does lemur skin
Reflect the sea?

We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the tides of the summer
Every summer
Every summer
Every
My Velouria
My Velouria

Forever green
I know she's here
In California
I can see the tears
Of shastasheen

My Velouria, my Velouria
Even I'll adore you
My Velouria
