Turning of a darkened mind
Flaring of the shining light we hide inside
Surge along the tide of the rising storm
Unchain your soul and let yourself fall
In splendour and grace
Decide and embrace your path
From darkness to fame

Can you fly and conquer the twilight?
Chasing the skyline!
Your soul is longing for grandeur
...This is your blight

Oh, the iron still glows
Now strike! ...and prosper

Shed your skin, scarred and worn
See within and find yourself reborn
Sacrifice all you loved
Leave and rise as a paragon
Conquer the pantheon
Harness your fate and ride
Into the endless skies ...forever

Can you fly and conquer the twilight?
Chasing the skyline!
Your soul is longing for triumph and grandeur
...The fire wanes

Enter the twilight...
Or reach for the skyline...

Chasing the skyline
Blazing horizon
Never too late
For us to choose
All bets are off and we will lose
Never too soon
To drop the weight of your remorse
And watch the sky
Because this is life

Can you fly and conquer the twilight?
Chasing the skyline!
Your soul is longing for grandeur
Chasing the skyline!
Your soul is longing for triumph and grandeur...
