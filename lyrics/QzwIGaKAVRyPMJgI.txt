Shall we be grateful?
Shall we be true?
These were the questions
That I gave to you

I feel empowered
With you by my side
Still I feel questions
Burning down inside

I want you
Everybody run til the break of dawn
Everybody run til the early morn
Everybody wanna move and get it on
I want you
Everybody go for an easy start
Everybody wanna go and fall apart
I want you, will you help me now?

Now faster and stronger
We move through the night
We don't look back now, oh no
Move into the light

We should be grateful
We should be true
This is the moment
That we break on through

I want you
Everybody run til the break of dawn
Everybody run til the early morn
Everybody wanna move and get it on
I want you
Everybody go for an easy start
Everybody wanna go and fall apart
I want you, will you help me now?
Help me now...
Help me now...

(Everybody run to the break of dawn
Everybody run to the early morn
Everybody wanna move and get it on)

I want you
Everybody run til the break of dawn
Everybody run til the early morn
Everybody wanna move and get it on
I want you
Everybody go for an easy start
Everybody wanna go and fall apart
I want you, will you help me now?

Oh, oh, whoa-oh

I want you
Everybody go for an easy start
Oh, oh
I want you, will you help me now?
