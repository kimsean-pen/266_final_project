I couldn't give you a warning
But I felt it all over me
I hope you come where I'm going
And babe, my hands are free

Falling so hard
Swimming through stars
And maybe that's alright

I'm feeling you
Every single way
I'm feeling you
Ain't no other way

There was a time I remember
Breathing air like this
But that was when I was younger
Didn't know what I had, I'd miss

I'm feeling you
Every single way
I'm feeling you
Ain't no other way

I won't let you go
I mean it, believe it, ohh
I won't let you go
Believe it, I mean it, ohh
I won't let you go
I mean it, believe it, ohh

I'm feeling you, you
I'm feeling you, you
I'm feeling you

I won't let you go
Ain't no other way
I won't let you go
Every single way

I won't let you go
Ain't no other way
I won't let you go
Every single way
