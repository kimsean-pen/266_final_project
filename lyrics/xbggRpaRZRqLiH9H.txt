The question is wouldn't mama be proud?
There's a silver lining in the corporate cloud
And the pretty post that you're taking as
As an NCO of the great pretender
I should sure think so

Wouldn't mama be proud?

"can i take your order?"
Asks the heavenly host
Ticket to the jetstream
Blowing coast to coast

The long stemmed glasses, a movie
And a pleasant dream in mid air
You gotta tell me quickly
Cos we're almost there

Wouldn't mama be proud?

If you look out your window
And the sky's gone black
Well kid you're on the right track

If i send you postcards
From the side of the road
Photographs of moving
Parts about to explode

If i call to keep it together
Like you say i can do
To transmit a moment
From me to you

Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Like you say i can do
To transmit a moment
From me to you
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
