I never really wanted you

I never really wanted to (but)
I never should have followed you, or your ways
You would always catch me in your gaze

I never really asked for this
I just took my chances (yeah)
I never tried to run away or escape
Cause i got no where else to be anyways (anyways)
I never tell you 'cause you won't believe it's true,
But it's hard to fake it baby when I'm lying next to you
Now i feel wasted and i don't know what to do
Laying naked in the tub waiting for you

I never really thought of you
I never really thought that you could
Livin' in the deepest parts of my head
What's the point of beating hearts
If we're dead, dead, dead
You're inside my brain
All the things you said, said, said,
I look into your mind-
but all I see is red, red, red, (red, red, red)

I never tell you cuz you won't believe it's true
But it's hard to fake it baby
When I'm laying next to you
Now i feel wasted and i don't know what to do,
Laying naked making one last call for you

And how long would it be
Til' you let go of everything you made with me
I never tell you cuz you won't believe its true
But it's hard to fake it baby-
When I'm laying next to you
Now i feel wasted and i don't know what to do
I close my eyes the water's turning red for you
