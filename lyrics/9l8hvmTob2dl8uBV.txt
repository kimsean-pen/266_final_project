Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Never had a mothafuckin' weed card
I'm down to flatline a nigga, never been soft
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
I was thirteen with my mothafuckin' heat, y'all
Nigga caught cases tryna take your fuckin' screen off
I could put your fuckin' life on the recall, uh, yeah
Lookin' for the bitches with the ass
Got an ice chain cause a nigga gettin' cash
Three different pagers blowin' up because I'm crackin'
Tryna turn a dollar to a million, ho, what's happenin'?
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dunk this in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Hoover with my mothafuckin' locs, steel
Figg side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird, hit a kil', I ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy

Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
We love, we go
We rise, we go
Our pride, we show

Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Tryna get this mothafuckin' weed off
Gang injunctions tell me where we can't go
Shoot me in my back because my afro
Heard I got a stripe on my record then it's true
Cops effin' at my record, never told 'em what I knew
I was in my nigga car garage, yeah, I'm tryna shoot
I was out here sellin' dope at 14, what it do?
I was out here fuckin' hoes at 14, what it do?
I was ditchin' class, fifth grade, yeah, I'm Groovy Q
Ain't no biggy when the small nigga rob, gimme loot
Pop a nigga on his mom's porch, kill his brother too
Nigga lost his first fade nine years after school
Nigga tryna get the Js, blue Chucks sick as flu
Runnin' from the crash unit like my name was State Farm
On my nigga's handlebars tryna get our groove on, yeah

Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
