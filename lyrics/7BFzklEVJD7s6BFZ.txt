She always laughs when she's hurting
Makes a joke of a heart when is broken
Don't watch it get lost in the mix-up
I know she drinks to not think of
The home that she could have built with you

'Cause you're lost, lost
You're too young to be so lost, lost
Too old to care so much, much
Time forever changed us, us

You always leave parties early
Or when everyone's dancing and laughing
See how you always skip town
To just walk and not think of
You burnt down the home she built for you

'Cause you're lost, lost
You're too young to be so lost, lost
Too old to care so much, much
Time forever changed us, us

'Cause you're lost, lost
You're too young to be so lost, lost
Too old to care so much but
Time forever changed us, us
