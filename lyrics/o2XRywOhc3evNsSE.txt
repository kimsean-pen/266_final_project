The gates of Heaven must be open
I think I saw an angel just walk by
Hey, the gates of heaven must be open
I think I saw an angel just walk by

I heard a blind man screamin', say
Now there goes a sight for my sore eyes
There goes a sight for my sore eyes
Now there goes a sight for my sore eyes
What kind of woman is this?

You should be locked up, pretty girl
In my bedroom with me
Hey, you should be locked up, pretty girl
In my bedroom with me

So we can do the same thing that Adam
Did under that old apple tree
What he did under that apple tree
What he did under that apple tree

Well, well, well, well, well, well
Choke out
Here I come again

There's always some good lookin' girls
Hangin' 'round this famous place
Well, hey, there's always some good lookin' girls
Hangin' round this famous place, talkin' bout legends now

Aww, but this particular one
Looked like somethin' from outer space
She looked like somethin' from outer space

What kind of woman is this?
Hmm, what kind of woman is this?
What kind of woman is this?
Ooh, what kind of woman is this?

Look at that, she shakes all over when she walk
She made a blind man see
Made a dumb man talk
What kind of woman is this?
Hmm, shucks

Tell me, hey, what kind of woman is this, man?
Somebody gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta tell me, tell me
What kind of woman is this?
