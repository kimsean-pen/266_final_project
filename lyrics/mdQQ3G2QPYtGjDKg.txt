You can't save me any more than you can save yourself,
So stop fucking trying.
We are all human. And we will all be dust.

'The entire universe marches irreversibly towards its grave.
So not only is the life of each individual person doomed;
The entire human race is doomed.
The universe is plunging toward inevitable extinction
Death is written throughout its structure.
There is no escape. There is no hope.'

'My trust is placed in nothing now,
At my command the world must bow,
And as we've ended feast and strain,
The cup we'll to the bottom drain;
No dregs must there remain!'
