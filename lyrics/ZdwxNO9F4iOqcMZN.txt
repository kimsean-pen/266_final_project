Son of highest
You are falling
You are falling
Not floating from out of the sky
You deceive us
You betray us
You will not lift our hearts to eternity
But leave a hole with despair
We waited and waited
Our crosses born
And still you did not come
And how does it feel
As life passes by
We will not know until we pass
that you are a lie
Will we receive the mark
Of those who did not believe
The temptations that are burning us alive
But you tell us that there's sin in what we think
For forgiveness we'll believe your every word
but will you show us what our souls cry out to see
No... No... No...
Son of man, are you the son of God
No... No... No...
did you die to cleanse this world of sin
No... No... No...
Will you return from the dead to
save the world again
No... No... No...
Has the blood you shed turned the darkness into light... No
Son of highest You are falling
You are falling
not floating from out of the sky
We waited and waited
Our crosses born
And still you did not come
