Jesus, when you comin' back
Jesus never comin' back
Jesus won't take me back
Jesus never comin' home

Jesus seemed to steal my soul
He'll never let me go
Jesus gonna make me pay
Never should have run away

I wanna go home

Jesus when you goin' to come back?
Jesus when you goin' come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back
Jesus when you goin' to come back home?

The devil seems to climb inside
Walk in through my open eyes
Never shoulda ever shown
And He's all I've ever known

Jesus, when you comin' back?
He's never comin' back
Never take me back
We're never goin' home

I wanna go home

Jesus when you goin' to come back?
Jesus when you goin' come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back
Jesus when you goin' to come back home?

(guitar interlude)
Jesus, when you coming back
Jesus never coming back
Jesus won't take me back
Jesus never coming home

Jesus seemed to steal my soul
He'll never let me go
Jesus gonna make me pay
Never should have run away

I wanna go home

Jesus when you goin' to come back?
Jesus I dare you to come back>br> Jesus I beg you to come back
Jesus when you goin' to come back home?

(muted mumbling and laughter)
I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime

I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime

I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime

I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus
