We got high a thousand times in your brother's room
Talked about how we break free, guess it came too soon.
We grew up, drifted apart, now you're getting married
While I'm waiting for my life to start.

Are you ready to make that call?
It's gonna be a lifetime.
It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime.

The year your brother left home is mostly you and me
We spend our whole summer there on his balcony.
We were young, that was then
And I can't help the feeling that is never coming back again.

Are you ready to make that call?
It's gonna be a lifetime.
It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime.

Are you ready to make that call?
It's gonna be a lifetime.
It was only a few years ago, but it feels like a lifetime.

And we used to dream of what was beyond these walls
And we used to pray that one day we'll see them fall
And there'll be nothing, nothing but time
And there'll be nothing, nothing but time.
