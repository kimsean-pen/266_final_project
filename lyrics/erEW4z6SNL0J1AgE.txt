Sunday comes alone again
A perfect day for a quiet friend
And you, you will set it free

I see new morning around your face
Everybody says its another phase
And now, now its come to me

See the magic in your eyes
I see it come as no surprise
And you, you turn your eyes away
Yeah you, you turn it all away

I guess its true its never too late
Still I don't know what to do today
Oh why can't I set you free?
Will you do the same for me?

Sunday comes and Sunday goes
Sunday always seems to move so slow
To me and here she comes again

A perfect ending to a perfect day
A perfect ending what can I say?
To you lonely Sunday friend
With you Sunday never ends
