I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the wind
You're the kite

They were right when they said
We were breathing underwater
Out of place all the time
In a world that wasn't mine to take

I'll wait, is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the wind
You're the kite

They were right when they said
We should never meet our heroes
When they bow at their feet
In the end it wasn't me

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Lights of days
Will beat a path through the mirrored maze

I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet
I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Am I breathing underwater?
Am I breathing underwater?
