Lets change the subject to someone else
You know lately I've been subject to change
Normally I reel in the strange
Hang over, I'm older
You're one to talk the heart years o' clock
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army
To summon me!
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you (you)
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
And though I hate to rewind (before, before)
It's just a matter of time
Our past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for taking things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over, and over
Doing my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I'm holding
Still holding
Holding you in
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you (you)
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
And though I hate to rewind (before, before)
It's just a matter of time
Where the hell were you? (You?)
Where the hell were you? (You?)
Where the hell were you?
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
It's just a matter of time (before, before)
And though I hate to rewind (before, before)
It's just a matter of time
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time
Time
