God save us!
This new life has brought us this new knife
It's worthless and mindless to preach. I resist that!

God save us!
This new life has brought us this new knife
It's worthless and mindless to preach. I resist that!

I am what you despise
I am just a disgrace you will never embrace
The strength will rise
Everything that I do burns against you
These words are just a speck
In what you call my life's wreck
Mistakes forsake and every word will break

This is hard to believe, I am not what you see
All the pressure is breaking down on me
I will take what is mine and won't waste any time
Don't believe in what you want for me

God save us!
El control has brought us
El color de sangre y hambre, it's our turn
We will burn!

Liar! This life is mine
My intentions are real, this is my killing field
I will not shine
Our souls turn to rust, turn our bodies to dust
My life is just a trek
In what you call my last breath
Mistakes forsake, then every word will break

This is hard to believe, I am not what you see
All the pressure is breaking down on me
I will take what is mine and won't waste any time
Don't believe in what you want for me

This is hard to believe
All the pressure is breaking down on me
I will take what is mine
Don't believe in what you want for me

God save our souls, yeah

God save us!
This new life has brought us this new knife
Tu control, tu color, it's our turn, we will burn!

I am what you despise
How can I be oppressed and then confess?
The strength will rise
Everything that I do burns against you
These words are just a speck
In what you call my life's wreck
Mistakes forsake, then every word will... BREAK!

God save us!
This new life has brought us this new knife!
