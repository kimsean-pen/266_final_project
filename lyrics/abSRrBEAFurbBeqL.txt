Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
Baby we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of calling
When you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too... busy being yours
To fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
