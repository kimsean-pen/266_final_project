I love you till the day I die
So don't die today
Please don't die today
Everything but you is an ugly lie
That's not how you pray
That's not what you say

If I'm here when you're gone I'll fall apart
Stop your crying now
Stop your crying now
What's the point of life without my heart
You're not dying now
You'll survive somehow

Do you want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die ... together?

It's been the night since you've been gone
Please I have to go
Please, please let me go
What's the use of writing one more song?
'Cause it's what you know
'Cause it's what you know

It was you and me; that's what you said
And it's always true, aren't I here with you?
I may look alive but inside I'm dead
Well let's make it true
Let's make that true

Do you want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
You want to die together?
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
