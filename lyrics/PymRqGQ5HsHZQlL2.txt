Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?

And I saw you it's the hardest thing for me
I started shakin' wonderin' where could you be from
And it figures that the only thing I want is already taken
Cut him off let's get it done I know, I know

Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?

And I know you are the one I miss
I try to figure how I get out of this I know, I know

Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?

Well I know about the way you tried to tell me
It was sticky and settled in their tea
So I freaked out blank stared into my heart
Just like you killed me thinkin' they're still picking the key

Don't know how to break it to me
Don't know how to take it to me

Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?

And I know you are the one I miss
I try to figure how I get out of this I know, I know

Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?
