In this one of many possible worlds
All for the best something are test
It is what it is and whatever
Time is still the infinite jest

The arrow flies when you dream
The hours tick away
The cells take away

Watchmaker keep to his steeds?
The hours tick away
They tick away

The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
Like the fullness of time
A garden to nurture and protect

In horizon to set of the sun?
To the stars goes spinning
Spinning 'round the night
Oh it is what it is and forever
Each moment of memory of light
The arrow flies while you dream
The hours tick away
The cells tick away
The watchmaker has time up his sleve
The hours tick away
They tick away

The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
In the fullness of time
A garden to nurture and protect
(Its a measure of a life)
The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect
The way you live the gifts that you give
And the fullness of time is the only return I do expect

The future dissapears to memory
With only a moment between
Forever dwells in that moment
Hope is what remains to be seen
Forever dwells in that moment
Hope is what remains to be seen

In the wholeness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the wholeness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)

It's a measure of a life
