Oh, the night's coming again,
Memories of all your friends
All the time in the world,
Never take you away
When the night's coming again,
Are we gonna fade away

Oh, the night's coming again,
Memories of all your friends
All the time in the world,
Never take you away
When the night's coming again,
Are we gonna fade away

Oh, the night's coming again,
Memories of all your friends
All the time in the world,
Never take you away
When the night's coming again,
Are we gonna fade away

Oh, the night's coming again,
Memories of all your friends
All the time in the world,
Never take you away
When the night's coming again,
Are we gonna fade away
