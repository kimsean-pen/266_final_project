Let's get it done
Their heart are like stones
The morning lights when I walk home
Where we come from you pick your fight
And you pick your place, then you never arrive
We can paint the streets, 'til sky and highway meets
pluck leaves from trees
make fall come when we please
It takes a week to walk around the block
Please let the sun stay up
And when it hits the top you beg the clock to stop
Please let the sun stay up
I know there's more, it's never at my door
My heart belongs on the floor
I miss the coast like I miss my first kiss
It feels so close like it's right through the mist
It takes a week to walk around the block
Please let the sun stay up
And when it hits the top you beg the clock to stop
Please let the sun stay up
