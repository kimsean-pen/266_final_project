All hail, the jester has landed
Defile the country he sings
Charmed like a snake in a basket
Should be coiled up and ready to spring
We're raising our cross just to burn it
The clergy are selling their souls
Clearing a path
Ignoring the facts
Intoxicated by the throne

We'll be standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go

Will we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes
Cheering the missile parade
Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people
Together we circle the drain

We'll be standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go...

It's a game you've been playing
It's a fragile machine
It's a pied-piper song that has lulled you to sleep
It's a lie and you fell for it, hook line and sinker
A hand that you shook that then gave you the finger
A fraud and a fake
A cowardly king that lied to your face, but you still kiss the ring
This is the breakdown
This is the breakdown
THIS IS THE BREAKDOWN!

I'm standing here holding our ground come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
It's not much but this is home, and there's
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!
