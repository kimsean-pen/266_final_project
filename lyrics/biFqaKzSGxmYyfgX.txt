I got in a fight, I was indisposed
I was in despite all the wicked prose
But I'm only a man
And I do what I can

I got friends in high places, I get out for free
I got in a fight but they don't know me
Cause I'm only a man
And I do what I can

Sometimes people say that I'm a big time bomb
But I'm only a man
And I do what I can
