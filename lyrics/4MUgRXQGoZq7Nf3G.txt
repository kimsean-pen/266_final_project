I feel like I'm walking, slowly, to a storm
Because I wasn't even talking, just scalding, and lead on

How they gonna follow you towards it?
If you don't know where it is
Just turn around
It's all about what you're saying
You're not saying anything but
They follow, on follow for long, oh
Tomorrow it could all be gone

If they turn it around you'd say
You've had your day and it ends now
Calm yourself down, cooler
Next time around
This time round it's just doing it

How they gonna follow you towards it?
If you don't know where it is
Just turn around
It's all about what you're saying
You're not saying anything but
Leave the rest with me, only
Leave the rest with me, maybe permanently intrigued
And like a well-deserved, breather
This is just, this is only
Something to my lover, over, oh

They follow, on follow for long, oh
Tomorrow it could all be gone
They follow, follow closely
They follow, on follow for long, oh
Tomorrow it could all be gone, gone
