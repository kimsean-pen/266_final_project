Deep and slow but that's how it goes
If anyone asks, yeah I already know
'Cause I got this pain in my chest, everytime I swim
To consciousness
And I mispelt every word perfectly
Every mistake made was purposely
And my head is pounding to the beat of my heart
You are a broken heart tattoo
I'll have forever on my chest for a love that I have lost but never could forget
Say what you have to say
Try not to cry
This is just not what you wanted
At this point in your life
It's so hard to stay
When all you want to do is ride
I totally get you, I was a birdcage and you were meant to fly
You are a broken heart tattoo
I'll have forever on my chest for a love that I have lost but never will forget
Nothing matters the importance of nothing That's what you taught me while I was barely listening
Nothing matters the importance of nothing Nothing matters... Nothing matters.
End
