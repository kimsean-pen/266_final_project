I never felt so bad
In my entire life
But this time I did it to myself
What do you expect from me?
I did it
So what do you expect from me

Let go of my hand
Is it time to go?
I'm not ready to turn my back on you yet
I'm not going to let you down

Let you down

September came so quickly
I wasn't prepared
I didn't mean to miss your birthday
What do you expect from me?
I did it
So what do you expect from me

Why don't you

Let go of my hand
Is it time to go?
I'm not ready to turn my back on you yet
I'm not going to let you down

Bridges will fall from under us
But weak or strong
We'll (we'll) get through this
The end will open up (end will open up)
And try to pull us in
But we'll (we'll) get through this
Get through this

So why don't you

Let go of my hand
Is it time to go?
I'm not ready to turn my back on you yet
I'm not going to let you down

Let you down
