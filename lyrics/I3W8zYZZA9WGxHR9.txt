Love a girl in a whole another language
People look at us strange
Don't understand us.
They try to change it
Try to tell I don't change.
But talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why you wanna change it

Girl listen to me!
Girl you're just running from the truth
And I'm scared of losing you.
You are worth to much to lose
Baby if you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you

When I tell you "I would never leave you"
Do you hear what I say?
I don't understand when you say
You need time
But you've been calling all day.
Talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
I don't understand why you wanna change it

Girl listen to me!
Girl you're just running from the truth
And I'm scared of losing you.
You are worth to much to lose
Oh baby! If you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
(Do you hear what I say?)
That I'm just in love with you
(Can nobody change it?)
No other words to use
(I love you baby!)
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you

Ohhh...
Never knew what we have
They don't understand
We're just a waste of time
We know this is real.
I know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine.

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
(Let me say it again, Let me say it again)
I'm just in love with you
(Just in love, Just in love)
I'm Just In Love With You.
