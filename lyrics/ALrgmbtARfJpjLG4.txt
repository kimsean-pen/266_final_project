My friends they get me higher and higer
They're killing me with friendly fire
We meet beneath the cactus tree
The working on spikes just stink for me

My friends ain't got a worry mold
They meet outside the corner store
Nd walk the pavement, miss the cracks
I'd join them if I could relax

Live by tricks when you don't have a thing
Live like a hippie if you wanna be king
People say it's not worth the wait
Everybody loves somebody to hate

I'm not gonna go and rush this through my veins
Blow them up while looking at this again
Punk rock ain't in division
Said all the weak can get to prison
I wanna write about setting something free
All the changes drive us back to see
And this is all about starting out again
Same old, same old, never the same same

My friends one by one get a job
Meet boys and girls and get a dog
Throw parties, we sit on the ground
I'd rather be, just let me down
People say it's not worth the wait
Everybody loves somebody to hate

And you can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up

Could've been a lawyer, take while you can
Never been happy since time began
It's getting kinda heavy, I'm a body full of bagbones
Spread it in the fire, driven me in brackstones
You got the time, they all can wait
You wanna start talking, cuz it's not too late
Aquarium, staring em
Everybody loves somebody to hate

Break it, make it, you can make the break
Back and go, just make it great
Intake, don't fake, don't wanna let go
Make all the changes that you need to make
Stand back, give it up, ain't life a b--ch
No war making, you just do that
Guess, guess that's the fame you maintain
Time for you to rearrange

And you can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
