My ex used to tell me I'm flawless
When laying low with all the girls
Believed him when he said he was honest
Then blame myself when I got hurt
My ex used to tell me I'm selfish
But never did he put me first
Ignore me and he do it on purpose
Just to have the last word

But now you wanna love me
Who knows what you'll find
It won't be easy, but I'm down for the ride
Just remember
You're not my ex, no
I know I can be trouble
Lord knows that it's hard
It won't be simple and I'll give you my heart
Just remember
I'm not your ex

I'm fallin' for you, you're fallin' for me
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them
I'm fallin' for you, you're fallin' for me (baby)
I won't promise I won't walk away
I can promise it won't be the same

My ex used to tell me "No way we're friends"
Cut him off if you really care
I will go away a couple days, hundred girls at his place
Games night, truth or dare
My ex used to tell me "You're so chill"
Then steal my phone, so I couldn't leave, yeah
Had to climb on his mouth
'Cause he now put me down
Thank God, I set me free

Cause now you wanna love me,
Who knows what you'll find
It won't be easy, but I'm down for the ride
Just remember
You're not my ex
I know I can be trouble, Lord knows that it's hard
It won't be simple and I'll give you my heart
Just remember
I'm not your ex
Ye-ye-ye-yes

I'm fallin' for you, you're fallin' for me
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them
I'm fallin' for you, you're fallin' for me
I won't promise I won't walk away
I can promise it won't be the same

No, ooh, yeah
It won't be the same (yeah)
It won't be the same (no, no)
It won't be the same
I'm fallin' for you, you are fallin' for me (you are)
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them
Your ex
And I'm not your ex
You're not my ex
You're not my ex
