What'll it be, now Mr. Mole?
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat
Or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones

Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake-eyed, with a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you, child

Leopards laze each
On plush pillows
Slender capes
Of red & chrome
Paperback dreams
In their deep doze
Twitch their toes to Black Mambo

Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake-eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you, child

Wanna play cheat?
Now says the sloth
A domino
Flush to his nose

Tickle that cheek
And take your throne
Pump your veins
With gushing gold

Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting
To bring you down
Snake-eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you, child
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
