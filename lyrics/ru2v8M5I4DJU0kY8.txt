I'm flying, climbing, floating through time
See it all with my naked eye
The world's revolving like it's mine
Losing perspective, head in the clouds
But what goes up has to come down
For now my head keeps turning round

And I... here they come through the call
Spinnin out of control

(Chorus)
Like a satellite...
Like a satellite...
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down to earth
When I get too high
When I get too high
You're calling, You're calling, You're calling
Get back to earth

An illusion trick, thought I was yours
We only leave you wanting more
Wondering how you coped before

Touchdown, you're far too close to the sun
Your wings, they still can't come undone
Learn how to walk before you run

(Chorus)
Like a satellite...
Like a satellite...
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down to earth
When I get too high
When I get too high
You're calling, You're calling, You're calling
Get back to earth

Falling to pieces in the sky
Give up, I'm raining out the sky

Touchdown, you're far too close to the sun
Your wings, they still can't come undone
Learn how to walk before you run

When I came to life
When I came to life
You're calling, You're calling, You're calling
Get back to earth

To life
To life
I'm in flight
Like a satellite
To life
To life
I'm in flight
Like a satellite

(Chorus)
Like a satellite...
Like a satellite...
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling down to earth
When I get too high
When I get too high
You're calling, You're calling, You're calling
Get back to earth

Falling to pieces in the sky
Give up, I'm raining
