The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you

What a wicked game you played
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say

I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you

(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

Nobody loves no one
