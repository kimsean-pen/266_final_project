Ten cents a dance
It's the only price to pay
Why give 'em more
When it's only love for sale?
Adam and Eve
It's the oldest game in town
Just a one way street
To a faded magazine

Kiss and tell
Money talks
It never lies

Kiss and tell
Give and take
Eye for an eye

Fever
The heat of the night
Dreamer
Stealer of sighs

One public face
In a private limousine
Flash photograph
It's the only light you see
No secret life
There's no secret you can steel
Your lips are moving
But I will never know
What they mean

Kiss and tell
Money talks
And love... it burns

Kiss and tell
Give and take
We live and learn

Fever
The heat of the night
Dreamer
Stealer of sighs

Fever
The heat of the night
Dreamer
Stealer of sighs

Kiss and tell
We never lie
Kiss and tell
Eye for an eye
Kiss and tell
Blood on a nail
Kiss and tell
Kiss me again
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell
