She always had a pretty face
What a pretty face she's got
In awe, the years she spent awake
Would've left a trace, but not

She always had a pretty face
What a pretty face she's got
In awe, the years she spent awake
Would've left a trace, but not

She always had a pretty face
What a pretty face she's got
Apologies from place to place
Looks are never good enough

She always had a pretty face
Such a pretty face, but not
Emotion spills on empty days
Such a pretty face is lost, lost

Is it not intentional?
The beautiful lies we see are seasonal
Unbreakable neither of us will be
Let it be

She always had a pretty face
Such a pretty face
In awe, the years she spent awake
Took her pretty face
In awe, the years she spent awake
Would've left a trace, but not
Would've left a trace, but not
Would've left a trace, but not
