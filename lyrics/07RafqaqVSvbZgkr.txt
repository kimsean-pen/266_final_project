I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the Boulevard
Yet I couldn't face you

There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything, so baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize
Maybe, I don't need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead of the lonely one
You, me and a lie

Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, "Boy, if you want love"
"You'll have to go and find it with someone new"
"Do you know who you really are?"
"Are you sure it's really you?"

Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips
Because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead of the lonely one
You, me and a lie

Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night
You, me and a lie

Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night
End to the night
Left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer
We're crashing ships in the night
