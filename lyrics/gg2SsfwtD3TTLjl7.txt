Take both my feet.
Tie them.
Throw me over.
Will I still float?
Will my heart sink?
Why have I held on so long?
I still don't know.
And it's not like I have anyone to show
Or do I want to?

These arms this heart these eyes
Have seen almost everything.
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.

Take both my hands.
Tie them behind my back
To keep me from holding from holding from holding.
But that's so unlike myself.
And it's not like I have anyone to hold
Or do I want to?

These eyes this heart these arms
Have held almost anything
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.
Oooh...

Why do I need to love someone?
It's like I was born not out of legs
But I was born of arms.
And it's not like I have anyone to love.
Should I want to?

These eyes these arms this heart
Has loved almost everything
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.
Oooh...
