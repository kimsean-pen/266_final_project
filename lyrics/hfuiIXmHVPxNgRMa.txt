I cannot stand to see what I see
I can't stand this place I must be
I don't mean to imply that above all am I
but again...
kiss me goodnight my friend
just say goodnight my friend

take a look at yourself take a look at me
I believe you miss all there is to see
don't believe in the lies that you hear with your eyes again
kiss me goodnight my friend
just say goodnight my friend

racer of the chase for pleasure
actor of the child at play
lay down it's time for nappie baby
taking all your toys away

I cannot stand to feel this way I feel
I can't stand to face what I fear is real
I don't mnean to imply that you'd utterly lie
but again...
just say goodnight my friend
