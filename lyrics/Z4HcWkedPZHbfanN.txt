The sun is only shining like it always does,
But I never noticed it in the sky before.
And you don't need to worry, 'cause I need your love, my friend.
There's a strong kind of feeling when I know you're near
Nobody alive can take it away from me;
And I feel like I've known you for a thousand years
Bring it out into the light.

'Cause I think I'm gonna write it on the walls of the world,
So everyone will know today the love I hold for you.
I will write it on the walls of the world,
So that the sun won't fade away the words I say to you,
I love you

And I know I'm not a loser when I'm on my own,
I could be miles away in another land,
And it keeps me together when I'm far from home,
I won't keep it out of sight.

And I think I'm gonna write it on the walls of the world,
So everyone will know today the love I hold for you
I will write it on the walls of the world
So that the sun won't fade away the words I say to you,
I love you
