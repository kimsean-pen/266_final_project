He sees himself as the saviour of the world
His will is strong and he's feeling good
I've known him since the first taste of beer
I will meet him many times in a year
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
He thinks he is the most famous guy
He smiles and laughs and
He has a loud voice
He can be very nice
He can be full of anger
He'll behave very well
Right after misbehaving
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
Happy little, happy little, happy little boozer
