Rioting, the unbeatable high
Adrenalin shoots your nerves to the sky
Everyone knows this town is gonna blow
And it's all
Gonna blow right now

Now you can smash all the windows that you want
All you really need are some friends and a rock
Throwing a brick never felt so damn good
Smash more glass
Scream with a laugh
And wallow with the crowds, watch them kicking peoples' ass

But you get to the place
Where the real slave-drivers live
It's walled off by the riot squad aiming guns right at your head
So you turn right around
And play right into their hands
And set your own neighborhood
Burning to the ground instead

Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha

Riot, the unbeatable high
Riot, shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot, playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless, tonight it's a blast

Get your kicks in quick
They're callin' the National Guard
Now could be your only chance to torch a police car
Climb the roof, kick the siren in and jump and yelp for joy
Quickly, dive back in the crowd, slip away, now don't get caught

Let's loot the spiffy hi-fi store, grab as much as you can hold
Pray your full arms don't fall off, here comes the owner with a gun

Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha

Riot, the unbeatable high
Riot, shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot, playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless, tonight it's a blast

Shit!

The barricades spring up from nowhere
Cops in helmets line the lines
Shotguns prod into your bellies
The trigger fingers want an excuse
Now!

The raging mob has lost its nerve
There's more of us but who goes first?
No one dares to cross the line
The cops know that they've won

It's all over but not quite, the pigs have just begun to fight
They club your heads, kick your teeth
Police can riot all that they please

Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha
Ah, ha-ha, yeah!

Riot, the unbeatable high
Riot, shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot, playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless, tonight it's a blast

Riot, the unbeatable high
Riot, shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot, playing right into their hands

Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
