Haunted souls alone in the night
Blood oath, dead is alive

There is ghost haunting the halls of my heart
Like nails through my mind and everything goes dark
A strangers face but the pain that I love
Who knew suffering would be so much fun

It'll only hurt for a second
It's My favorite fucking lie
I'm just as lost as you
As empty as every word you'll hear tonight

Drown me in blood
Let me taste the iron of lost love
Drown me in blood
Die a little inside you won't miss much

Sleep is good but death is better
The final words of my last fucking letter
I can still feel the scars that spell out your name
Prayers became regrets, they all end the fucking same

Blood oath, dead is alive

With every beat of this blackened heart
Unhallowed thoughts, I was dead from the start
Drag that blade through skin tonight
This is what fucked up really looks like

It'll only hurt for a second
It's my favorite fucking lie
I'm just as lost as you
As empty as every word you'll hear tonight

I'm just as lost as you
Drown me in blood
Let me taste the iron of lost love
Drown me in blood
Die a little inside you won't miss much

It'll only hurt for a second
I cut myself just to say I fucking did it
Run that blade down
Hold my hand and let me black out

Drown me in blood.
Let me taste the iron of lost love.
Drown me in blood
Die a little inside you won't miss much.
