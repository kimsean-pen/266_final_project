I got the recipe thumpin on it
and as for rivalry well I own it
You can't speak for me, doing all I can to survive

Don't ask for sympathy beg to differ
And as for symmetry I'm irregular
And maybe you're Greek to me
But I get it dead or alive

I'm your favorite anime
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul, got your back

It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer

get out the way if you can't stand the flack
me and my army we're on the maximum attack

It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer

If this was fantasy I'd condone it
But you move so thoughtlessly I'd atone for it
From under the bleachers to the windmills of my mind

Seems you protest too much as of lately
With all those straws you touch and so strictly
I'm gonna beseech yuh, you were just a matter of time

I'm your favorite anime
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul, got your back

I'm your favorite anime
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul, got your back

It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer

Get out the way if you can't stand the flack
Me and my army we're on the maximum attack

It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer

Get out the way if you can't stand the flack
Me and my army we're on the maximum attack
You have got to face up to the fact
This is only mine oh

It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
It's a (whoop) killer killer killer
