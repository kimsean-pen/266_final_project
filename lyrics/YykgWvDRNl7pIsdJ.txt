Here I stand,
blood on my hands,
at the edge of all I've known
to exist.
A life that consists
of getting by
under all those
flashing lights.

There she was,
faint and dumbstruck,
a passerby
to all her life
could have been.
A joyless routine,
an empty jar
at the bottom.

When they said to me
the sky will be a thing that you could see if you let it.

All she ever wanted was to find
a place where she could sit and watch the sunrise,
in real time.
Instead of through the automated screens that feed on
her dreams.
All we wanted was a life,
away from being plugged into mainline
at all times.
Standing with the combination key that opens
our dreams.
