And it's been runnin' for a long time and it's runnin' out in my mind
I can't explain it all to you it's really jumbled up
So for longer now I'm messed up and I'm wishin' now I'd 'fessed up
That concern's no use to you it feeds the pain that stung

So forget how I am dealin' explain to me the feelin'
It gets to that point instantly you're ready to unload
And I'm the one you're spitting at and I'm ready for my fitting at
Doesn't make much sense but when I get it calm it's slow

It's hard to admit anything I'm sorry for the weight I bring
I'll do whatever's necessary to make your mind glow soft
It's played out too far to stew and I've run out of grace with you
So I'm out and take a walk and we'll be better off

Whether I lied as much as you tried
Whatever you decide I hope it's good to you
For everybody's sake Lord knows we all need a break
Do what you got to this is hard to take

To the time I spent discussin' I'll sit back and stop the fussin'
I won't mention it to anyone and we'll be better off
I won't admit to anything sorry for the weight I bring
Do whatever's necessary to make your mind glow soft

Whether I lied as much as you tried
Whatever you decide I hope it's good to you
For everybody's sake Lord knows we all need a break
Do what you got to this is hard to take
