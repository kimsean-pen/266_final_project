Ah, hugh!

Show me the way to the hallways below
Rome, I will be there
I've seen them burning in fire
They all bear too much too bear
Why don't you think of all those who will come
Don't you waste your life
Don't you try show me the way
Don't need good advice

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
A guard as they say, paralyzed
Follow the cries from out of the blood
The wine in the cup

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

Regrin my friend we are passing the gate
Back into my world
I am afraid of the guard and I wish
Warnings had been heard
Welcome to Rome, it's our mission to make
Tortured spirits rise
Something's in here, oh I wish I could hide
From it's staring eyes

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
And I feel a chill
Staring eyes, while I hear the cries
From out of the blood, the wine in the cup

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

No way out, we got to run to the gate
No way out, for some of the souls it's too late
Jakob are you free

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
