Flashing by
It's a beautiful state were in
But how can we love in isolation
Think how happy we can be
If we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed

When I leave your side
In your eyes
Love's alive
You've come untied
Cause we're flashing by
Like Satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display

Let's run and hide
In our eyes
Love's alive
We've come untied
Cause we're flashing by
Like Satellites
Satellites

Satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart I cannot breathe
