People smile and tell me
I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me
As free as a dove

Conceived in love
Sun is gonna shine above
Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
An' everything will bring
A chain of love, oh, oh, yeah

In the mornin', when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
An' tell me everything is gonna be alright
Seems as though, a month ago
I was Beta-Chi
Never got high

Oh, was a sorry guy
Now, I smile and face the girl
That shares my name
Now I'm through with the game
This boy'll never be the same
An' even though we ain't got money

I'm so in love with you, honey
An' everything will bring
A chain of love, oh, oh, yeah
In the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
An' tell me everything is gonna be alright

Pisces, Virgo rising
Is a very good sign
Strong and kind
And the little boy is mine
But, now I see a family
Where once was none

Now we've just begun
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun
Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
An' everything will bring
A chain of love, oh, oh, yeah

In the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
An' tell me everything is gonna be alright
So love the girl who holds
The world in a paper cup
Come on then drink it up
Love her and she'll bring you luck
And if you find she helps your mind
Better take her home, home
Where don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own
Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
An' everything will bring
A chain of love, oh, oh, yeah
In the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
An' tell me everything is gonna be alright
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
