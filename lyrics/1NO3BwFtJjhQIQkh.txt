I told you you'd have to leave here
And you listened with a cryin' stare
Now you've got the nerve to tell me baby
Yeah-yeah a no-no you don't care
You just don't care baby
Sun turns back at the sight of you
And your evil only clouds the air
You you just laugh at what you do
Hey-hey-hey hum now you don't care
Hey... you don't care baby
Oh-oh-oh oh
Wow
Your feelings smashed now you're leaving
To find someone who'll dare
To change all the wrong like you done to me
Hey-hey-hey no-no you don't care
Hey-hey-hey you don't care
