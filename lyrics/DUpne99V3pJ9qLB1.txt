Turn it up a bit, please

My baby
Baby does
My baby does me good
My baby does
My baby does me
My baby does me good

My lady
Understands
Understands me right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right

My baby cares, she really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good, then she hurts me so
She winds me up and then let's me go
Turns me on and then tells me no

She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me

One day, she tells me that she cares
Another day, she tells me she don't love me
She really, really does me

Now, people, do you believe this?
Do you?
She really, really, really, really, really, really
Does me
