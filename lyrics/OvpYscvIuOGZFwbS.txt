I can hear the ocean noise
I can feel the pulsing crowd
Buzzing like a radio
Pumping like a disco sound
I can see a burning sun
Breaking through a raining cloud
Just let my heart beat, heart beat
Beating through the town...

Lost forever in love
I am a favorite son
I am a Champion
Oh I have a fire inside
Of a loaded gun
I am a Champion
Oh I have a fire inside

I don't wanna waste my time
I'm just trying to find my way
Racin' through a perfect town
Racin' on a perfect day
I sometimes wanna close my eyes
and listen to the words You say

Oh, people never rise and stop
people never rise and stop
People never rise and stop

In love
I'm your favorite son
I am a Champion
Oh I have a fire inside
Of a loaded gun
I am a Champion
Oh I have a fire inside

Out the window, in my mind
Where the wind blows, from time to time
Where the seed grows, a perfect vine
Whatever's yours is mine
Oh, in love, in love, in love
I'm your favorite son
I am a Champion
I am your favorite son
I am a Champion
