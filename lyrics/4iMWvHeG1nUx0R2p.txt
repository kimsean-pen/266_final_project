Now we gonna do this like we used to
Taking it back to the roots, you know

Repeat it in your mind
You better understand
We gonna start a fire
That wasn't supposed to end
We taking it back
Yeah, we taking it back

We gonna keep it real
The rest down the drain
We run melodies
But you know we ain't playing
We taking it back
Yeah, we taking it back

Yeah

We taking it back
Come on

Repeat it in your mind
You better understand
We gonna start a fire
That wasn't supposed to end
We taking it back
Yeah, we taking it back

We gonna keep it real
The rest down the drain
We run melodies
But you know we ain't playing
We taking it back
Come on

We taking it back
Ha, yeah
We taking it back
Let's go
We taking it back
Ha, yeah
We ain't playing no games no more
