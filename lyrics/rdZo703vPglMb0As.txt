Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can't touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one a wolf will betray a lamb
Lead astray the gazers
the razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
every flower's a perfect one

To paradise
with pleasure haunted
haunted by fear

A sin for him, desire within, desire within
A burning veil for the bride too dear for him
A sin for him, desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

I am the fallen
you are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative as its discovery

To paradise
with pleasure haunted
haunted by fear

A sin for him, desire within, desire within
A burning veil for the bride too dear for him
A sin for him, desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

Bless me, undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God, I must confess
I do envy the sinners
A sin for him, desire within
A burning veil for bride to dare for him

A sin for him, desire within, desire within
A burning veil for the bride too dear for him
A sin for him, desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
