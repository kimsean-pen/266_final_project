Drown me out with your voice
I've not spoken for days
Left your car on my driveway
Bad blood flowed through my veins
Backed me onto to the ground
Spare me out in the rain
Come to me, the sweet release
Find a way out my head

They're saying there's one song left
No time for no regrets
I take my T-shirt off
Swing it around my head
Tonight you drove me to smoke
Whole pack of cigarettes
Tonight you done me over, I

Wouldn't be who I'd be without you
Wouldn't be who I'd be, be who I'd be
Be who I'd be without you
You done me over, I
Wouldn't be who I'd be
Be who I'd be without you

I got caught up in your details
Grow vulnerable to your eyes
The kids were born to the stinging nettles
Watch me writhe in the pain
Anyone else would have bound to see
But you were doing alright on your own
Come to me, the sweet release
Lead me down to the edge

They're saying there's one song left
No time for no regrets
That time you done me over, I

Wouldn't be who I'd be without you
Wouldn't be who I'd be, be who I'd be
Be who I'd be without you
You done me over, I
Wouldn't be who I'd be
Be who'd I'd be without you

It's safe to say
I wouldn't let you blow my mind
Up the wall, up the wall
I'll never do it again
It's safe to say
I wouldn't let you blow my mind
Up the wall, up the wall
I'll never do it again

Wouldn't be who I'd be without you
Wouldn't be who I'd be, be who I'd be
Be who I'd be without you

It's safe to say
I wouldn't let you blow my mind
Up the wall, up the wall
I'll never do it again
It's safe to say
I wouldn't let you blow my mind
Up the wall, up the wall

They're saying there's one song left
No time for no regrets
I take my T-shirt off
Swing it around my head
Tonight you drove me to smoke
Whole pack of cigarettes
Tonight you done me over, I

Wouldn't be who I'd be
Be who I'd be without you
