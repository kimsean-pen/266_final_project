Yeah, oh, yeah
You know, you know, you know
I'm full it
Aye I'm in the booth
Aye, aye
Shot out Bobby Johnson, aye

Found myself in the dark place
Last girl made my heart ache
Now I'm tryna get my soul, yeah
Why all yall fake flex
Mama told me not to take shit
So I never really take shit
I don't care what you rep bro
Ex Bitch doing bank bro
Wow I really shoulda kept her
Really shoulda kept your mouth closed
I've been runnin out of amo
Different station, little trap woah
Every city with a bad hoe

Satan's got a grip on me
Heaven's looking very bliss
Steal my faith and everything
Eating off that apple tree
Sunlight shining every beam
Gloomy days keep scaring me
All my friends are enemies

All my friends are enemies
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are ene- yeah
All my friends are ene- yeah
Windows tinted, you can't see us in it
Prescription pills made me a villain
Never busy, man I'm always chillin
Fake friends up in the grass
Gotta keep it low, let the snakes pass
My main girl gotta side door
Like Mike bitch, got more hoes
Insane though she a crazy hoe

Friends gon turn to enemies
Satan's got a grip on me
Heaven's looking very bliss
Steal my faith and everything
Eating off that apple tree
Sunlight shining every beam
Gloomy days keep scaring me
All my friends are enemies

All my friends are enemies
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are ene- yeah
Out the booth bitch
