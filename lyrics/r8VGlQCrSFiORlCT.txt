So you fell in love, and it wasn't with me
Hey that's fine, it's about time I let go
But whatever curse you put here in me
Can you lift it, babe, before I hit the road?

You were a charmer, I was a heartbreak junky
You were a diamond, I was the heap of fool's gold
You were the jet plane, I was a parachute failing
I was the cheap ad, when you were the centerfold

Then my sun set hard on Carolina
Where she howled about the Pender county line
And her six-string fingers ran the length of some boy's body
In younger dreams, I thought that body might be mine

You were a cold crush, I was a heartbreak junky
Now you're a mother, and I'm a flashback son
Yeah, I'm a wasteland, you've got all your milk and honey
And back then, I swore you were the only one

So disenchant me baby, I've been dying to know
How to give up, get out, stay gone
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before
She was so sweet, baby, so sweet
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped into
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you
Yeah, I made it with you

But now the bars are closed, and the city sleeps tight
As I ramble home my wretched merry way
Where down was up, and feeling bad felt so right
I thought that vertigo was here to stay

We're talking hellfire, but at the time it seemed funny
When all the demons left the woodwork to play
With an angel, and a heartbreak junky
Stuck in their rock-bottom masquerade

So disenchant me baby, I've been dying to know
How to give up, get out, stay gone
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before
She was so sweet, baby, so sweet
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped into
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you
Yeah, I made it with you

So when Eden burns behind you in the rearview
And you're off to find a stranger paradise
Where you can sing your own way out
Well, you know that I'll be 'round
With a sweet talk woman fading slowly
On a lovesick mind
