There is only death

This is the beginning and the end of all things
The gate and the key
All are judged in the shade of the Cathedral

Their names written in flames on that terrible, endless list
True pain engraved on their face
The wailing spilling through the rifts agape

Whisper "be still" to the violent heart and its thundering beat
The earth yawns deep and the cloak sweeps silent
Casting the shadow of unceasing sleep

The ground untended
Relinquishing spaces, an ocean of faces
Smothered by the black of a burial gown

Follow me down

Your call so fervent
Hot thorns through the neck pierce the servant
Of the night
Unending
The light here is bending
The gnarled spires bare
And from its towers a mockery of black trumpets blare
Lamentations fill the air
With the braying of dogs, oil slick through their fur

Follow me down

Hush now, no tears please
The horn sounds for me
Hush, writhe, cry
Hush, writhe, cry

It will never stop
Until every soul is charred beyond burned
Fling wide the gates of Hell

Your prodigal son has returned

Twixt jagged teeth of petitioners led by bound wrists
Past men gasping for air in lakes of boiling piss

Unable to drown
Follow me down

Your call so fervent
Hot thorns through the neck pierce the servant
Of the night unending
The light here is bending

Follow me down
