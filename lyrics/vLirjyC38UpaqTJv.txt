Father universe
Plenty of meanings
Glory and passion
Bleed and pain
Born in sorrow
Died like a hero
Brought to life
The hope of men

Once illusion then
You turned this woe into faith
You've been dupe'd so
We're spinning lost hurricanes
Into a soaring game
Of disbelieving time
One by one
We must lay
Dawn the laws
