I said, "I smoke... ever now and then"
But when I really need one I gotta have one
Just dying, great tricks

So to the 6.9 that was a double deuce
You said something about, "It's on"

Look here

Little fuckin' tooth

Carlos?
Hey now, you can do it on command?
You know as well as you do you can come whenever you want
Tacos
I'm the one who gave taco his name
You know that?
I said, you believe that, I said
"We had that barbeque"
And he goes
"Oh, you wanna go to taco?"

Dun nun nun, dun nun nun, dun dun dun!

Orale!

My mama's talkin' to me
Tryin' to tell me how to live
But I don't listen to her cause my head is like a sieve

My daddy he disowned cause I wear my sister clothes
He caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose

My basketball coach
He done kick me off the team
For wearing high heel sneakers and acting like a queen
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree, to a tree
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree

Gonna tie his pecker to a tree
Get your boogie on
Go head

The world is coming to an end and I don't give a damn
As long as I have my bitch
Oh and my flight gear
It don't bother me
If people think I'm funny
'Cause I'm a big rock star
And I'm makin' lots of money!
Money! Money! Money! Money!
