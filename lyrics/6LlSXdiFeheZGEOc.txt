PiL)

A face is raining
The pride of history
Across the border
The same as murder
Is this living
He's been careering

The steady hand as planned
Behind the reasoning
No claim for property
There is bacteria
Both sides of the river
Is this living
He's been careering
No one should be there
Trigger machinery

Mangle the military
Blown into breeze
Is this living
Scatter concrete
The jagged metal bad life
He's been careering
Manufactured

Is this living
Across the border
A face is raining
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living careering

There must be meaning
Behind the moaning
Spreading tales
Is this living

Like coffin nails
He's been careering
It's raining
I need to hide
I've been careering

Trigger machinery
Is this living
Across the border
There is bacteria
Both sides of the river
Armoured machinery mangled
