Torment, indimidation
A nation in trepidation
Drones over homes
Watching the world explode

Terror; a violent extermination
Fear spreading hate
Deep roots in abuse
Savage intolerance

Human persecution
Cold blood execution
Death toll's rising
Bodies are piling

Terror
Fear spreading hate
Civilization sent to its grave
Torment
Infidels
Slaughtering lives
Massacre of human kind
Bloodshed
Genocide
Innocent souls
Victims stole, raped and sold
Horror
