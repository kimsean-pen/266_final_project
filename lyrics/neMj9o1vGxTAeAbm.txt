Come with me to the islands
Come, my love follow, follow me
Under the lure of pure enchantment
Love will unfold her golden mystery

All night long I will hold you
'Till the stars slip into the sea
I'll weave a crown of rainbows in your hair
Many a moon I'll spend with thee

Love is waiting follow, follow me

Come with me to the islands
Come, my love follow, follow me
Under the lure of pure enchantment
Love will unfold her golden mystery

Love is waiting follow, follow me
Love is waiting follow, follow me
