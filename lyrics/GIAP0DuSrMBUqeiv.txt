Melody day what have I done
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
Then your smile it melts away again

Melody day where have you gone
And the hope I had is dying
And what we had has come undone
Then your smile it melts away again

Melody day what have I done
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
Then your smile it melts away again

Tell them
Tell them I always knew why
So long
So I would like to say goodbye
