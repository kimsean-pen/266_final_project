You'd better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to
Give it all you got
Cause you forgot
To take it to the top
Come On
Ruby Blue

Why do you make a start
With no means to go on?
It's on the tip of your...
Ruby, we used to love you truly
You used to make us laugh
It really was a gas...

But now you're a bore

One
Two
Three

It was you
And them
And me
Look what you do
Oh, Ruby Blue

You'd better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to
Give it all you've got
Cause you forgot
To take it to the top
Come on Ruby Blue
Ah Yeah

Nobody cares anyway
If you play the painted lady

Four and more and
Five and six
Who would have believed
It would come to this?
Look what you do
Oh, Ruby Blue

You'd better stop
And try to think
Look what you're doing
Oh, Ruby

You never get to
Give it all you've got
Cause you forgot
To take it to the top
Oh Ruby Blue

One
Two and
Three
Look what you're doing
Ah Ruby
It was you
And them
And ME

Look what you do
Oh, Ruby Blue
