The villains and the heroes are merging
Everything is blurry
Time is standing still
The sky is switching with the ground
My world is turning upside-down
My sense of judgement seems to be compromised
You're too strong to be denied

Ooh I'm brainwashed, captivated by the fame
Oh it's taking over me now
Mighty baby, untamed lover
Ooh I'm brainwashed
Double - oh who, seven digits
Connect me to your, Sweet Center
Baby-baby, take me with you
Brainwash, brainwash
Brainwash, brainwash

You're speaking, it's so clear
But all the words are hard to hear
And I think I kind of like it that way
Mirror mirror on the wall
Says you'll catch me when I fall
I've always been the hunter
Not the other way
Now why do I feel like the prey?

Ooh I'm brainwashed, captivated by the fame
Oh it's taking over me now
Mighty baby, untamed lover

Ooh I'm brainwashed
Double - oh who, seven digits
Connect me to your, Sweet Center
Baby-baby, take me with you
Brainwash, brainwash
Brainwash, brainwash

I saw this coming, but I did nothing
I saw this (I saw this)
I want this (I want this)

Found out how to make it now
Take me over, take a vow
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
Take me over now

Ooh I'm brainwashed, captivated by the fame
Oh it's taking over me now
Mighty baby, untamed lover
Ooh I'm brainwashed
Double - oh who, seven digits
Connect me to your, Sweet Center
Baby-baby, take me with you
Brainwash, brainwash
Brainwash, brainwash
