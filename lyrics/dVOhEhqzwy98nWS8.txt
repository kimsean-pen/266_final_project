War to end all wars
Hatred lost control
Casualties now mounting
Tales yet still untold

Life's eradication
Of man now beyond all reason
Totally insane
The human race becomes

Lest we forget - thoughts will always haunt the mind
Lest we forget - the bitterness remains

Vast termination
Man made rationality
Complete elimination
Of life beyond brutality

Eternal resentment
Reoccurs time after time
Driven to despair
Extinction drawing near

Lest we forget - thoughts will always haunt the mind
Lest we forget - the bitterness remains

Lest we forget - the thought will always haunt the mind
Lest we forget - the bitterness remains

Commence removal of all things valued in life
The persecution what was once believed right
Humanities objective now totally deranged
When ignorance transpires this world becomes insane
