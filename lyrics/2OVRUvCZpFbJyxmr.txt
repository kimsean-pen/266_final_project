You parted the clouds
And showed me the sky
On radiant wings
You taught me to fly
My sanctum, my temple
My tempest, my storm
My beacon so bright
My guide in the darkest night
You raise me from ashes...
As my daunting shadows return, again
...My sword in the Viper's den...

Breaking all boundaries; our spirits reign free
Order and havoc; at our own decree
Endless allegiance
The hero that rides by my side
Flying on wings of fire

The night falls and cities burn
The world falls apart
A Valkyrie, her sword ablaze,
Disintegrates my jaded heart

Devour me! Reforge me!
With our merging souls in immortal embrace
...My spellblade in Minos' maze...

Breaking all boundaries; our spirits reign free
Order and havoc; at our own decree
Endless allegiance
The hero that rides by my side
Flying on wings of fire

Arcane, ethereal
Map out the stars, as one
Sailing the rays of the sun
Free rein celestials
Trailblazers of the skies
The Empyrean we leave behind
On wings of fire, ethereal!
Feeling...
Celestial...

Breaking all boundaries; our spirits reign free
Order and havoc; at our own decree
Endless allegiance
The hero that rides by my side
Flying on wings of fire
