The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always
Always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced 'til three
The way you've changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

Bah-bah-da-doo-dee-doo-doo-doo
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I always
Always keep the memory of, yes

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced 'til three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
Swing it, boys

We may never, never, never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
(Swing it, Ella)
Still I'll always
Always keep the memory of
(Yeah, ma'am)

The way you hold your knife (da-bah-doo-doo-'n-dang)
The way we danced 'til three (yes, oh yes)
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
(Would you repeat that again, deary, please?)
No, they can't take that away from me
