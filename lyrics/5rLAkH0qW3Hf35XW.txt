After all of this time
After all of these seasons
After your one decision
To go to the water for reason
Now it's only the ocean and you

All of these lines
Will all be erased soon
They go out with the tide
Then come back with the waves
It's only the ocean and you

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love
But you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in

When this work is done
And this coat is dry
When this world is too much
It will be
Only the ocean and me

When these sails go up
Mountains fade away
Stars come out
I'm finally free
Now it's only the ocean and me

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love
But you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love
But you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
