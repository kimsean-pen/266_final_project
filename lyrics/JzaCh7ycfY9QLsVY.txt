Looking out the corner of her eye
As she sits alone and drinks her wine
Every man just wants to pass her by
In hopes that he can catch her eye
That glow that's in her eye
Gives you visions in your mind
She's from another space and time
That's when you'll know you're hypnotized
Her intoxicating will not be denied
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
You fall so deep in love with the girl

It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

Like a rare Picasso or Monet
The kind of beauty studied every day
Every woman wants her grace and style
But no one can replicate her smile
That glow that's in her eyes
Gives you visions in your mind
She's from another space and time
That's when you'll know you're hypnotized
And her intoxicating will not be denied
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
You fall so deep in love with the girl

It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

In your eyes we see the tiny white snowcaps of mountains
The purple glow of distant stars
The blue shine of black metal
Red rose petals falling slowly through the sunny air
