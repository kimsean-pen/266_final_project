Oh damn
Volume way up on my phone
And next to my head on the floor
And beats on repeat
The rain tap dancin' on my windowpane
Whoever said no pain
No gain
Don't know pain
Intimately like I do
As infinitely as I do
Been lied about and lied to
Too many times to fight it
Some bridges were built to burn
No need to help ignite it
A party of one or party of none
Please keep me disinvited
Tuck you in
As I tuck another tear behind my eyelids
Good night
