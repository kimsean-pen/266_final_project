Lying wide awake in the dark
Trying to figure out who you are
Always going nowhere
Afid of going somewhere
And somewhere's a place in your heart

Sometimes when I think about you
Why you're always running away
Sitting in your car
Changing who you are
Drowning the thoughts of your life in the music

Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
You can't commit to even her
How you gonna get through the year

You can't
Playin' on the sides of the net
Too many people want too many things
And you only want to forget

Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
Too scared to commit to even her
How you gonna make it through

You're always listenin'
You're always listenin'
You're always listenin'
To yourself

You're always thinkin'
You're always thinkin'
You knew what everybody else
Should do with their lives

I'm wide awake in the dark
Tryin' to figure out where you are
Always goin' nowhere
'Fraid of goin' somewhere
And somewhere's a place in your heart
Somewhere's a place in your heart

Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
You can't commit to even her

Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
Too scared to commit to even her
How you gonna get through the year
