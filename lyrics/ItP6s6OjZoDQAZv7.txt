Olalla more than a name
Rest your eyes and stay in the shade
You are hiding over the hill
In a quiet never so still

From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe in better times
From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe
To believe

Oh Olalla where will you go?
If the line ends out on the road
There's a story meant to be told
When the door is shut in the cold

From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe in better times
From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe
To believe
To believe
To believe
To believe

Oh Olalla on the border line
There is a world down on its knees
For better times
Oh Olalla don't you fear the night
There's only time left to believe
To believe
