You asked if I've been sleeping
Just hear me out
I can't remember
Swallowed by fear these thoughts betray me
It's had it's hold on me for far too long now
Don't tear me down
If it's a dream
Where do I go?

If it's a dream
I've lost all concept
It's too late, it's too late. They won't let me go
They're sinking around and around you

As your head starts to weaken your body's the reason
So how can you say that's enough?
As your head starts to weaken your body's the reason
This is not enough
I fell asleep inside your arms
I fell asleep inside
How will I find myself?
Will this be over soon?
Find yourself
Before it comes to an end
Don't be afraid
It's almost over now

Don't fade away
We're not the same
It's too late, it's too late
They won't let me go
They're sinking around and around you

As your head starts to weaken your body's the reason
So how can you say that's enough?
As your head starts to weaken your body's the reason
This is not enough

I fell asleep inside your arms, I fell asleep inside your arms
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away (away)
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away (away)
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away (away)
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away (away)
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away
(So how can you save them tonight?)
I feel it sinking in, I feel it slipping away.
(This is not enough)
