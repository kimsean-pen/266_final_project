natasha: maybe you think you're not right for me
that you'll never be everything I need
well i'll tell you straight from my heart you are, you are

liz: if you don't think that you've got the pedigree
that you're not someone who can talk to me
well i'll tell you straight from my heart you are, you are.

chorus: you are, you are my reason (my reason)
you are the air I breathe in (that I breath in)
ask who's in my heart you are, you are (and you are)

liz: if ever I wanted to run away (to run away)
i'd go only if you would come with me (go only if you'd come with me)
'cos no one can talk to my heart like you are, you are.

natasha: oh, if I do for you what you do for me (what you do for me)
if i'm on your mind every time you sleep (and in your dreams)
say the words and no matter how far i'll be where you are.

chorus x1

ooh, I wish you'd ask me how I feel
jenny: i'd say that i'm infatic
ooh and when your near to me
jenny: this urgency is automatic
ooh you're my addiction boy
jenny: and I don't wanna break the habit
natasha: i'd say that your in my heart, your in my heart

chorus x1

liz and jen: maybe you think you're not right for me (you are my reason)
that you'll never be everything I need (the air i'm breathin')
well i'll tell you straight from my heart you are, you are

natasha: you are my reason for lovin' for livin' for breathin'
