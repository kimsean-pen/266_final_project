"The Epilogue"

It's a strange day
The roses are in bloom
But in a strange way
I know somehow we're doomed

Look around through the town
Not a soul to be found
In silence, not a sound
There's no one around but you

In the back of the car
On our way from the bar
In silence, here we are
Reminding us we're doomed

Well I guess that it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
And I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you

In a strange place
When the sun goes down, we move
Into a strange phase
Like we've got nothing left to lose

So we slip through the town
With our heads in the clouds
In silence, not a sound
For miles and miles around

Fall asleep in the park
Underneath all the stars
In silence, here we are
Reminded of how we're doomed

I guess that it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you

It's you
All that I want is you
Yeah, you
All that I want is you

So I guess that it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
And all that I want is you

I guess that it's we come to the end
We've circled around our doom
Yeah, I won't stop, not till I get what I want
'cause all that I want is you
