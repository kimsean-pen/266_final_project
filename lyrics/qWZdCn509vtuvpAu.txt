You're waking me up
I hope I land on two feet
Clueless up until today
Writing off anyone that tells me anything
Stubborn locks of gold
Hiding my face inside of my head
Running my mouth but not telling ya how I feel
How I feel

Until now, I've kept this to myself
Been sleeping right through it all
It feels good to finally figure out
I needed this all along

You're waking me up
Oh, everything feels different
You're waking me up
Oh, everything is solid gold

You're waking me up
I never saw the bright side
Not up until today
I always saw the darkness in everything
Stubborn locks of gold
Hiding my face inside of my head
Running my mouth but not telling ya how I feel
How I feel

You're waking me up
Oh, everything feels different
You're waking me up
Oh, everything is solid gold

You're waking me up
Oh, everything feels different
You're waking me up
Oh, you're waking me up

Everything I see melts with my eyes
Every thought I have glows with the light

You're waking me up
Oh, everything feels different
You're waking me up
Oh, everything is solid gold

You're waking me up
Oh, everything feels different
You're waking me up
Oh, you're waking me up
