I've been misplaced in so many ways.
Broken battlegrounds hiding veils of delicate deceit
Yet here I breathe, teeth still gleam from holy water,
While millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter
My head in a bag, and my hands are bound to my feet.
And voices sing,
"Were we laced like common thieves?
Tossed in a cell to feast with fleas.
All because we never admitted a word"
What will I see tonight in these eyes? And what will I know when the morning comes?
Must we remind of exchanges existing so long ago?
Would we arrive at agreeable musings? Sentimental, or just confusing?
We lost what we had, then we took it back.
Friends in the gutter, enjoy one another.
Just give yourself to the dust and the dirt where you stand.
What will I see tonight in these eyes?
And what will I know when the morning comes?
I'm not who you think I am.
And even if I thought you'd know,
I never would have told you so.
And more alarming, I would have done the very same.
Would have stole more than your name.
Would have cursed and brought the world on your shoulders.
I was in the wrong place at the right time.
And what's the worst i'd see by giving myself to the earth below me?
Not knowing how far i'd fly by casting away the old me.
And just how long can I stay in illusions formed here long before me?
And how long can I breathe the stolen breath you won beneath?
There's that subtle smile that did me in.
She mourns in agony, reminds me where i've been.
She greets,"I'd never let this happen again."
Where's her heart?
Mimicking the patriarch.
She's naive.
