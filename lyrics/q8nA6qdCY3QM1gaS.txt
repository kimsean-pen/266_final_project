Need's got headlights and I'm in the middle of the road
And it's hard to have a swagger when you're carrying the load
But two shoulders they bode well
And two arrows are well bowed
But I'm sorry if I ever made you cry

Certainty's a sprinter and I'm just now catching up
Now my legs creak and I'm thirsty. Still, you always fill my cup
Well I thought you were a mountain until I saw you erupt
And I'm sorry if I ever made you cry

When I made you cry; that's when I knew
When I made you cry; that's when I knew

A mist of red amidst the treads along the yellow dotted line
And the corpse of non-commitment now for scavengers to dine
And the bulb above your head is like a bachelor's exit sign
That's why I'm sorry if I ever made you cry

Though a crystal tells the future it's a diamond makes it so
Sea is rough but you can't mute her so just let your lumber go
And I've labored all this paper as a way to let you know
That I'm sorry if I ever made you cry

When I made you cry; that's when I knew
When I made you cry; that's when I knew
