Peace at last
The opus laughs
When I tell it I'm ready
(ooh-oh)
Steal the rhythm out from my heart
Your burning hands make a perfect star
Black sun on the horizon
Turning tricks to tell our senses apart
But I like it
It's just a little frightening
To lose everything
I've had so long
Steal the rhythm out from my heart
Your burning hands make a perfect star
Black sun on the horizon
Turning tricks to tell our senses apart
But I like it
Ooh, into the sun our memory return
Ooh, spirit bonds explode
Are you ready to know everything?
Oh, believe and, believe and we will become one
Oh, letting go with your soul
Oh, let it go with your soul
Steal the rhythm out from my heart
Steal the rhythm out from my heart
