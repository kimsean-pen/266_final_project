In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine then the story's told, yeah
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew

That the chains were on
That the chains were on

My, my, my, in the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me, and that's free

But still your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still your chains are on

You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes

When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew

That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
Oh my the chains were on

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still the chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on

Hey, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Yeah, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Hey, the chains are on

You've seen them walking on the water
Oh the chains are on
You've seen flying through the sky
My, the chains are on
They were frightening in the darkness
Yes, the chains are on
They had rainbows in their eyes
Hey, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
