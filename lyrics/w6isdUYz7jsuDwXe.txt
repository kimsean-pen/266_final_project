I've had enough of your trust
You just hold me on the cusp
Locked out
Can't make a sound
You're kicking me when I'm down

I've tried to lie
To set ignorance aside
But you're scared
You won't fight
You're kicking me when I'm down

I won't let you out so easily
There's fire in my eyes
You better run and hide

Will you fight
Will you believe in the answer
Will you die
Or will you reset the standard

This is therapy this is sanity
There's no defeat
Will you stand with me or rot with the enemy

Now you feel what I feel
These fists are made of steel
I feel weak
But I'm proud you're not kicking me when I'm down

I may burn
I may bleed
But I'm standing on my feet
I'm not fragile like you think
You're not kicking me when I'm down

I won't let you out so easily
There's fire in my eyes
You better run and hide

Will you fight
Will you believe in the answer
Will you die
Or will you reset the standard

This is therapy this is sanity
There's no defeat
Will you stand with me or rot with the enemy

You're possessed
You're disguised
I know what to think
I will never be defeated by the enemy
Will you fight
Will you believe in the answer
Will you die
Or will you reset the standard

This is therapy this is sanity
There's no defeat
Will you stand with me or rot with the enemy
