See me I call you like once and I say that
you're leading me on with your time though
I really went off on you hard because my
feelings' like dead when you see me I'm not at all
Is everything fine I say, not at all
I cash the check and I'm so in love
The only thing that can relieve me from
death is you kissing my neck and I'm so in love
The only thing that can relieve me from death

Is you switching lanes
I'm carving you in veins
What's your number?
I can take another if I want but I don't wanna
Because you're leading me on
Tying me on to your stressors
Sympathetic waves across the oceans where I met her
I can't wait 'til you get home
I can't wait to go to sleep
There's a part of me that dances when I know that it's for keeps
If my hair wasn't long
If the money was gone
Would you still want it?
Something keeps me feeling like a way and I can't stop it
There's a price I had to pay
Baby, I know I'm forever
There's a feeling and it's love
Baby, I don't know what love is
