Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November
The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November
The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Its spring and its summer
And its winter forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
There's no need to answer
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
And are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table
