Its all things to the menagerie
We die and wait for the burn
Its all things to the menagerie
We came to learn
Through the glass our cares are laughable
We are flies, were six billion terrible
Women in vogue, to the house nightly
Wanton Galore, the happy house nightly
We are flies, were blue and were beautiful
Multiplied, were six billion terrible mortals forlorn
Through the glass darkly, Wanton Galore
The looking glass darkly
Wild child set free in the night
Wild child set free in the night
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Wild child set free in the night
Wild child set free in the night
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Too bad, the mad, darkly obsessed
To the house nightly, so sad
We have let go the possessed
The happy house nightly
Too bad, the mad, darkly obsessed
To the house nightly, so sad
We have let go the possessed
The happy house nightly
Its all things to the menagerie
We die and we wait for the burn
Its all things to the menagerie
We came to learn, await the return
Of the child made wild
Of the child made wild
Of the child made wild
Its all things to the menagerie
We die and we wait for the burn
Its all things to the menagerie
We came to learn
Wild child set free in the night
Wild child set free in the night
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Wild child set free in the night
Wild child set free in the night
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
Through the glass darkly, the looking glass darkly
