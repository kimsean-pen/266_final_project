I hear your life is feeling pretty dull
You want something satisfying that'll make it fun
You wanna change but
Your mom and dad don't want to ever see you escape the norm

Stuck in a city unable to travel
You want your hair to unravel and
Feel it loosening after change
You feel
Society is placed on a path it chose ahead for you (?)

So you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, maybe gives you that self belief
Yeah you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, makes you feel like a rebel in need

Street lights, late nights, he wants to
Take you for a ride on his motorbike
You finally got the chance to feel alive and let go tonight
He watches James Dean on movie screens,
Smokes straights wears leather and tight jeans
He's the man that you need in your dreams when you're sleeping tonight

So you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, maybe gives you that self belief
Yeah you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, makes you feel like a rebel in need

Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, take the time to realise it never works out,
Pick yourself up, wipe your tears dry, try to find the confidence you're holding inside,
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, take the time to realise it never works out,
Pick yourself up, wipe your tears dry, try to find the confidence you're holding inside,
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, take the time to realise it never works out,
Pick yourself up, wipe your tears dry, try to find the confidence you're holding inside,

So you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, maybe gives you that self belief
Yeah you take a bad boy
take a bad boy home
to see
If he makes you feel special, makes you feel like a rebel in need
