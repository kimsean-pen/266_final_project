Heavy hearts,
Starry night,
Summer highs,
Release our minds, but

I couldn't get much higher,
When I asked and you said you might,
Though the time we had was little tonight,
You gave me your heart and said we'll be fine

We raise our hearts, high
We raise our hearts, high

Walked with you,
On barefoot nights,
Dreaming on,
As we fill the sky,
Oh and I,

I couldn't get much higher,
When I asked and you said you might,
Know that exactly on this little night,
You gave me your heart and said we'll be fine

We raise our hearts, high
We raise our hearts, high

We raise our hearts, high
