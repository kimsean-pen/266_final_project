Couldn't wait for the phone call
Had to go and ruin it all
Systematically
Threatening all your friends
Again and again
One by one

First word, two syllables
Sounds like you're miserable
Is it real or just something inside
I'd love to hide
But at least I feel your hand

I'd like to reach out to your broken
Let me let me let me love you
And what you are
I'd like to reach out to your broken
Let me let me let me love you
It doesn't have to be
So hard
It doesn't have to be
So hard

If I bottle up all this emotion
Set it out to sea
I'm sure that on a foreign shore
That when they found the bottle they'd be screaming at me
Oh, is it all her fault
I don't want this (inaudible)
And is it all my fault

You get what you give
You just get what you give

I'd like to reach out to your broken
Let me let me let me love you
And what you are
I'd like to reach out to your broken
Let me let me let me love you
It doesn't have to be
So hard
It doesn't have to be
So hard
