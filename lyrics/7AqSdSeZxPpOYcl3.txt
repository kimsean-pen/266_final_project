Ooh, yeah

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show? (Yeah)
She said, save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me, baby
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady, (Shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-hoo, encore
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh

I'll admit (I'll admit), it's my fault (my fault), but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmh
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh-yeah

She said, boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show? (Yeah)
She said, save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know

How long has this been goin' on? huh
You've been creepin' 'round on me (On me)
While you're callin' me, baby
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady (Shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, (Lately) baby
