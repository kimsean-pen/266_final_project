Leashed to cemeteries that I carry
With... Me... A weight across years
A long unbroken stride
Set to the poem of burning desert

The past is severed from memory,
The spent links swept away
Are the fangs in our hearts are now gone
Or is it anger that keeps us alive?
Chalk outlines tell nothing,
But continue without pause
My reflection shows ashes, I've found my place,
Seated at a table of wolves

The last and only wish
Can't be fulfilled
Balled up letters left unread
As if it was never written
The past stays the past
The dead stay the dead
Wall up memories so I'll forget
In the end there's nothing that you can take back
