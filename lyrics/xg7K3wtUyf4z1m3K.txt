As I stare into these ruins made by man
I tremble as I realize it's the end
More and more I wonder what we could have done
But instead we wage a war that can't be won
Yeah instead we wage a war that can't be won

I stand on the ash of all I've ever loved
Memories of a broken heart
Now I'm alone in the dark
I know there's a way out when all hope is gone
Find your light in a new dawn
But there's no way to do this on our own

I search for solace in this waste that I once called home
But my attempts of piecing life together leaves me alone
I can't repair what's been done
When the sky is as black as the ground that I walk on

But I can't give up on this
I have to wonder what we could have done
I have to wonder
But instead we wage a war that can't be won
Yeah instead we wage a war that can't be won

I stand on the ash of all I've ever loved
Memories of a broken heart
Now I'm alone in the dark
I know there's a way out when all hope is gone
Find your light in a new dawn
But there's no way to do this on our own

You think that this is the end? You're wrong
You think that this is the end? Oh!

You think that this is the end? You're wrong
You think that this is the end? You're wrong
You think that this is the end? You're wrong
This is the start of a new generation

I stand on the ash of all I've ever loved
Memories of a broken heart
Now I'm alone in the dark
I know there's a way out when all hope is gone
Find your light in a new dawn
But there's no way to do this on our own
