You give me chills like a snowflake
Make me feel good on my worst day

Sweet and cool
Like a peppermint
Wake me up
Like it's Christmas Day

Ain't no one like
Neowana
I got all your presents
Cross them off your checklist
'Tis the season
Bring you joy

Red, green, red, green
You've been waiting to unwrap me, wrap me
In you arms is where I'm happy, happy
Underneath these lights
So red, green, red, green

Red, green, red, green
You've been waiting to unwrap me, wrap me
In you arms is where I'm happy, happy
Underneath these lights
So red, green, red, green

Touch on my skin, call me velvet
Swirl in my love, it's so passionate

Sweet and cool
Like a peppermint
Hooked on you
Like a candy cane

I'm in your control
Your gift, your gift, your gift
Taste my love
So good, it's heaven sent

Oh, sweet and cool
Like a peppermint
Hooked on you

Sweet and cool

Like a peppermint, ooh
