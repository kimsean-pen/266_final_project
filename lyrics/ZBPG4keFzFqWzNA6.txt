In a dream I saw a light that was very far away
It hovered over miles of the darkest sea I've ever seen
And the universe is mine but I haven't heard a thing
About where I will return when it's finally time to leave

Spirits in the trees
The fields of things
The people I've yet to meet
And the memories that I keep

Don't be afraid, I'm not going away
I'm just keeping track of my mental state
Don't be afraid, it's what I always said
But I am afraid, I've always been afraid

If your terrified of living like me, I hope you'll be fine
Cause were terrified together in this terrifying time
And being alive is not singing along
Or looking outside of the window into the darkness of it all

And I know I love you blue
It's the color in my heart
And it's been there all along
And I'll keep it after death

And like Sunday morning told me
It's nothing at all
But a cloudless summer sky
And a warm bright beam of light
