Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Didn't I give you everything
A woman possibly can?
But with all the love I give you
It's never enough
I'm gonna show you baby
That a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on, come on

(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart, now baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart, now honey
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good

Yeah, out on the street
And you know deep down in your heart
That ain't right
I know you never never hear me
When I cry at night

I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms I say it again
So come on come on, come on, come on and

(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart, now baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart, now honey
You'd better have a
Have another little piece of my heart, now baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good

You'd better
(Take it)
Take another little bit of my heart, now baby
(Break it)
Take another little bit of my heart honey, now baby
You'd better
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart, now baby
You'd better
Take it
Take another little bit of my heart, now baby
