We just go whenever?
Yeah

Sitting in your bedroom
That I've never seen before
There's a Barbarella poster
Hanging on your wall
Jane Fonda power starter
Not one to ignore
You said you wanted me
'Til you didn't anymore
You live far away, there was no way it could work
I thought I'd take a gamble, won the lotto in reverse

I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way
I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way

Sitting in a bar now
With some friends I don't know
Pretending they can't see me
Looking like I want to go
Now you've got your back to me
I just want to go home
Am I scared of losing you
Or am I scared to be alone?
Either way you pretty much can't treat me any worse
I thought I'd take a gamble, won the lotto in reverse

I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way
I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way

Oh, I washed both my hands of you when I flew home
Oh, in an aeroplane bathroom
This to-and-fro, oh, could have never been sustained
I wished I'd known
Oh, you didn't want me back the same
You're so fucked up anyway

I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way
I think you should know that
I really wanna say
I shouldn't have come over
Just so you could have your way
Just so you could have your way with me
