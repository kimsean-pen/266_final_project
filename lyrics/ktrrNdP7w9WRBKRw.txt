It won't help if you wait for me
I'm a slave to the dark
I know I'm not a saint, you see
The dawn is when it starts

Feel the shadow of my oblivion
Hoping mercy would show her face
On the road to your own perdition
In the coal-blackened rain

Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes
Damned and divine, scars of my broken kisses
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night

As the wind takes me away from you
Before the morning light
My sins are fading into view
I'm so weary deep inside

Feel the shadow of my oblivion
Hoping mercy would show her face
On the road to your own perdition
I may see you again

Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes
Damned and divine, scars of my broken kisses
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night

Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes
Damned and divine, scars of my broken kisses
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night

Every single dawn, I die again
