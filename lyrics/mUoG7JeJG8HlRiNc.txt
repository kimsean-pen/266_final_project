I heard he left you
Been too long
Been too long since we spoke
I never understood you
How you'd press on my heart till I broke

Who loved you better?
I need to know
Nothing lasts forever
Where do those feelings go?

Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me

Said you couldn't live without me
That I gave you the warmth that you missed
Always knew there'd be others
How many lives have you had since we kissed?

Who loved you better?
I need to know
Nothing lasts forever
Where do those feelings go?

Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me

Tell me you'll always remember
What we had before it all fell apart
Don't you forget about me, baby
Is it right if I love you more?
(Don't you forget about me)

Tell me you'll always remember
What we had before it all fell apart
(Don't you forget about me)
Don't you forget about me, baby
Is it right if I love you more?
(Don't you forget about me)
