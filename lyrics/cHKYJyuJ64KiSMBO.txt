Here we are in the prime of light
We're so right, yeah the time's right
Here we go am high of expectations
Let's not raise them
Oh the sun shine in your eyes
Break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best in life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take that
We can make it

Don't wait till tomorrow
Don't wait till tomorrow
Let's go
Don't wait till tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

Hesitation will only get you nowhere
Don't just stand there
Every moment's a gift
Here's your moment to live
Don't have no fear
Oh, the sun shine in your eyes
Break the ice
I can tell that you deserve the best ion life
If I offer you the chance to live tonight
Then take that
We can make it

Don't wait till tomorrow
Don't wait till tomorrow
Let's go
Don't wait till tomorrow
We waited all our lives
Don't waste another day

It's our time
It's our evening
Don't let it slip away
Tomorrow's too late
It's our night
Please believe me
If you're lost I'll help you find your way
Your way to tomorrow
Don't you know we're gonna get there together
Your way to tomorrow
Don't wait till tomorrow
Oh we're gonna get there together
