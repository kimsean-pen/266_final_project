You're talking it all sounds fair
You promise your love how much you care
I'm still listening and still unsure
Your actions are lacking, nothing is clear

No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

Remember when the words were new
They carried a meaning, a feeling so true
I'm looking for a long romance
Not a picture of passion or one time chance

No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

Don't fool your self
Your empty passion won't satisfy me
I know, so don't pretend that you want me
You don't want me, no

No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

We make love, it's all the same
Your eyes show nothing no lover's flame
Don't promise we can work it out
You can leave right now if you're feeling doubt

No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

No more words
You're telling me you love me you're looking away
No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises

No more words
You're telling me you love me, you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises of love
No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises of love
