Hook up with me, meet at the rally
Follow the shouting, I am longing for you
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
I waited so long, I couldn't find a cause
Tired or wasted, I think you're decent
I waited so long, there'll be no decency, no

(don't you give me those)
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all

Remember the time we talked about everlastings?
Don't you know we'll both fall to pieces too?
April 22nd at the Avalon, you teased me
Hook up with me, meet at the rally

Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all

Don't go away we're so near
Look around, you see
There is nothing to say but the things I know
I got nothing to say but the things I know

Standing in line, I think you're pretty
Lying on your bed, I think you're pretty too
Young girl, girl, you're everything
Hook up with me, meet at the rally

(don't you give me those)
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all

Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk louder
Just as long as you're gone
I won't leave you alone
