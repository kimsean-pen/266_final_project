Insert your needles elsewhere
I'm broken as it is
Cannot stand or take the fall
Consider it as a bliss
Bewildered by your ego
Such savage since you smiled
When I can see your pins in me
Iron gifts come pouring down

Pouring down

Mon amour?

Mon amour
Chéri mon amour
Soaked in your breath now
We reek as mammals do
Reality emerges
And presents itself upon you
Like a petty piggy laughter
So empty and estranged

Of each other, from one and another
And iron gift just keep pouring down

Pouring down
It's voodoo mon amour

It's voodoo mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo
Mon chéri mon amour
It's voodoo mon amour
It's voodoo mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo
Mon chéri mon amour
It's voodoo mon amour
It's voodoo mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo
Mon chéri mon amour
