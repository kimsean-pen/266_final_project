Summertime
Everywhere I turn tonight
Looks like paradise
Hidden in your eyes

Lightning strikes
Anywhere and sometimes twice
I'm so happy now, Happy we survived

All the little pieces, keeping us together, tearing us apart
All the little secrets, Leaving us forever buried in our hearts
I wouldn't go taking your sweet hurt
From you, unless you want me to
Take your time
Take your time with me tonight

We can both rewind
Start over again
All you need is to leave behind
Leave behind your troubled mind

You're so happy now
Happy and alive
All the little pieces, Keeping us together, Tearing us apart
All the little secrets, Leaving us forever Buried in our hearts

I wouldn't go taking your sweet hurt
From you, unless you want me to
All the little pieces, keeping us together, tearing us apart
All the little secrets, leaving us forever buried in our hearts
I wouldn't go taking your sweet hurt
From you, unless you want me to
Summertime
Everywhere I turn tonight
I'm so happy now
Happy we survived
