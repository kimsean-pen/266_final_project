For all the times I let you down and all the times you cried
When I'm walking out the door and you keep asking why
You know, you know that I won't be there
Believe me when I tell you that we have no other way
I beg and plead believe me when you hear me say

I'm sorry for the time we'll lose
I'm sorry, I need it this time
I now it's over, we will make it through
Believe me, I will make it up to you

There'll be days when you get lonely and nights that you get scared
You'll look for me to hold you to show you that I care
But you know, you know that I won't be there
Believe me when I tell you that we have no other way
I beg and plead believe me when you hear me say

I'm sorry for the time we'll lose
I'm sorry, I need it this time
I now it's over, we will make it through
Believe me, I will make it up to you

I will always let you down
There's so much we'll never do
But I swear that I'm
I swear that I'm doing it all for you

I'm sorry for the time we'll lose
I'm sorry, I need it this time
I now it's over, we will make it through
Believe me, I will make it up to you
I'm sorry for the time we'll lose
I'm sorry, I need it this time
I now it's over, we will make it through
Believe me, I will make it up to you
