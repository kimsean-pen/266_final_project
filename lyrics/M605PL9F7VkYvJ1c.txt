I feel lost with a stranger
I'm really feeling for nothing
Looking for a way down
An escape from the cure
Never been one for falling
Felt nothing for feeling
I put my guard down
And gave it to the world

In a world of patience
I can taste the cure
All alone in silence
Don't waste the words

At the cost of their whole lives
Never cared to be stronger
Can't judge the dead now
Have enough debts with God
They're in love with the danger
Lay at the hands of not knowing
I put my guard down
And gave in to the facade

In a world of patience
I can taste the cure
All alone in silence
Don't waste the words
If my world resists
I can not explore
Now I'm trapped in violence
Lost what was before
