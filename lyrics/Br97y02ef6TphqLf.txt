I once saw a dragonfly
Caught in a spider's web
As I looked at her once more
I thought that she was dead

So I left her alone and I went on my way
And I was dreaming of Paris and Pierre Boulez
But she called to me with a beat of her wing
She called to me and said, "Free me!"

She said, "Come and fly away
With me tonight
Come and fly away
With me
Come and fly away
With me tonight"
She said, "Ah ah ah..."

I've been up there before
Riding the wind and
Laughing and open
But now I am afraid of flying
I am afraid of finding the black again
I am afraid of flying
I am afraid of finding the black fade, black again

Come and fly away
With me tonight
Come and fly away
With me
Come and fly away
With me tonight
She said, "Ah ah ah..."
