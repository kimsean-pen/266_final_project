I didn't know when to expect you
Or even if you'd come at all
And now that I try to possess you
I'm still the one you choose to call

I don't know just where you came from
But I need you now,
If you leave me for the stars,
It's not something I'd ever allow.

The circumstances that that you've gone through,
I never seem to cross your mind,
But just consider what we could do,
You'd be surprised at what you'll find

I don't know just where you came from
But I need you now,
If you leave me for the stars,
It's not something I'd ever allow.

When it all comes back to you,
The words you say,
Make me wonder if it's true,
The story goes for another day.

I don't know just where you came from
But I need you now,
If you leave me for the stars,
It's not something I'd ever allow.
