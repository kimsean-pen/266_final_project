Stay up 'til dawn
I can't go home again now
After tonight
Seems like I'm out of your life
Apologize
No, it won't make it better
What can I say?
It's all too late

Tell me, is this the part when
When we part ways forever
Tell me, is this the part when
Part when
We are
O-O-O-Over
Wish I was, wish I was
SO-SO-SO-SOBER
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting all this fight
You're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-O-Over
Guess we are over

Walk through the door
You see that I've been crying
Head hanging low
You say: "where the fuck have you been?"
Should I deny
And maybe dodge this bullet
You read my mind
I just can't lie

Tell me, is this the part when
When we part ways forever
Tell me, is this the part when
Part when
We are
O-O-O-Over
Wish I was, wish I was
SO-SO-SO-SOBER
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting all this fight
You're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-O-Over
Guess we are over
(O-O-O-O-Over)
(O-O-O-O-Over)
(O-O-O-O-Over)
(Over)
Guess we are over

I can tell that you know when it kills you
What you need me to say's gonna hurt you
Wanna run, but I stay 'cause I have to
Have to
Tell you
And I know that you're so gonna hate me
If you did what I did, I would hate you too
I would hate you too
And we are
(Over) O-O-O-Over
Wish I was, wish I was
SO-SO-SO-SOBER
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting all this fight
You're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-O-Over
Guess we are over
(O-O-O-O-Over)
(O-O-O-O-Over)
Guess we are over
(O-O-O-O-Over)
(O-O-O-O-Over)
