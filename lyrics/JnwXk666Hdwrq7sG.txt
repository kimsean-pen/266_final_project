I could stand behind my barricade
Do what I'm told and be afraid to change
While isolated by the mainstream
With the current up against me
Well maybe if my arms
Were ten feet tall
I could finally reach that crystal ball
'Cause I
Still find
Inside
There's something braver
And I
I won't be
I won't be
The silent damnation
I will never be voiceless
My weapon of choice is
I'd rather be dangerous
I won't be left defenseless
As God as my witness
I'd rather be dangerous
Dangerous
I'm not making conversation
But I'll state my observations
Well I could buy my faith
Like a plot in the ground
But I was never lost
And I never had a doubt
'Cause I
Still find
It's not my
Imagination
And
I won't be
I won't be
The silent damnation
I will never be voiceless
My weapon of choice is
I'd rather be dangerous
I won't be left defenseless
As God as my witness
I'd rather be dangerous
Dangerous
Everybody
Is somebody
And anybody is you
I own my story
I won't say sorry
Yeah
And neither should you
I will never be
I will never be voiceless
My weapon of choice is
I'd rather be dangerous
I won't be left defenseless
As God as my witness
I'd rather be dangerous
Everybody
Is somebody
And anybody is you
I will never be voiceless
As God as my witness
I won't be left defenseless
As God as my witness
I'd rather be dangerous
Dangerous
