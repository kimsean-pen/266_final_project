Hey where we going?
Yeah, no?
Okay fine

I read a fun fact about the brain and
How it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or thereabouts (yeah)
It got me thinking about my head and what
I can do to help stimulate it, makes me sad, but
I've forgotten what I'm on about

Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there unless you're righteous
I wear a happy face like I'm end game
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peeling
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away, yeah

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Hey, Debbie Downer, what's your problem?
Don't wanna be here, still, call a shotgun
You got the FOMO coursing through my veins
This is not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domesticated, still a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew with your mouth closed?
And it's all gone wrong

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life, alright

I got a Type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out other-worldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows

Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And, hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
