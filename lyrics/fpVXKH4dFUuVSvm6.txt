I was a liar
I'll never be holy in your eyes
But you'll never be either
Cause I know that underneath your smile
Hide the nights that you regret
And the days you can't forget
Cause you know me
And we'll never be holy

I been keeping to myself
And looking back over my shoulder
Trying to live my life just like somebody else
And forget all the empty words I told you

And unless these demons follow me home
It's easy to bury the guilt on my own
Now my fears will finally swallow me whole
Cause I wasn't honest
And I didn't want it to end like that

I was a liar
I'll never be holy in your eyes
But you'll never be either
Cause I know that underneath your smile
Hide the nights that you regret
And the days you can't forget
Cause you know me
And we'll never be holy

It's a sickness I can't seem to shake
Until I wake up alone and ashamed
Or a tie that I'm too scared to break
In case I'm drunk and I need you again

I was never the one
I was always just easy
And you were only enough to follow through
Maybe when you're alone
And you look in the mirror
You can feel in love as I do

Just unless these demons follow you home
It's easy to bury the guilt on your own
Now your fears will finally swallow you whole
But I wasn't honest
And you never wanted to end like that

I was a liar
I'll never be holy in your eyes
But you'll never be either
Cause I know that underneath your smile
Hide the nights that you regret
And the days you can't forget
Cause you know me
And we'll never be holy

And we'll never be holy
No we'll never be holy
Cause the nights that you regret
And the days you can't forget
Leave you lonely
And we'll never be holy

I'll always be a mess if I keep living this way
Despite all of my flaws I still hope you're okay
I don't know if I can honestly say
That it's getting better
But at least together
We were holy
