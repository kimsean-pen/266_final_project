You drove me into the dark for a secret unveiling
You told me you saw the signs and went back to the start
Too many times has the light drawn us home when we're failing
It wears us and tears us apart when we're walking too far

We give it a break, cause I've just myself to blame
And I think I'm all worn out from the nights I've spent alone
It's easy to say that I'm just a world away
And I think I'm all worn out from the time, the time, the time I had
In love

Lost in the halls of my heart and my head I have found you
Echoing through all the spaces I never could reach
You like to think that you keep me so honest and so true
I'm always going to pretend that I lie through my teeth

We give it a break, cause I've just myself to blame
And I think I'm all worn out from the nights I've spent alone
It's easy to say that I'm just a world away
And I think I'm all worn out from the time, the time, the time I had
In love
