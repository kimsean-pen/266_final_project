It's not for you to say what's best for me to do with my time
You're not the one who has to put these socks on every morning
Just wait for me to block this out of my head
Just wait for me to get these fucking words out of my lungs
Pull the skin off my bones
So that I can finally breathe freely
for the first fucking time in my life

How dare you come in my life and make me rely on you?
How can you live with yourself knowing you did this to me?
