She gave it all, you gave her shit
She coulda done, just anything
Or anyone
Cause she's a Goddess, you never got this.
You put her down, you liked her hopeless
To walk around, feeling unnoticed
You shoulda crowned her
Cause she's a Goddess, you never got this.
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder
colder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Finally surfaced above the downs, feeling her boldest
She came around, cause she's a Goddess
Finally saw this
And now you're back, trying to claim her
Cause she is gone
And now without her
You all alone
Cause she's a Goddess, you shoulda saw this
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder
colder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder
colder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder
colder
Fuckin' with a Goddess and you get a little colder
