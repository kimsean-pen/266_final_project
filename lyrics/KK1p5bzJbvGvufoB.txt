Creek's on the rise
The Devil's peaking through your eyes
And I'm hypnotized
By the thoughts inside my mind
You can't deny it
Not 'til you tried it
I'm losing my mind
I think about them all the time

If you don't know the night moves
Baby, don't know the right moves, no

These girls drive me crazy
Don't know what they been thinking
They wanna waste my time
No time for games to play, yeah
This new road I've been takin'
I hope they'll understand
I need a woman
I need a woman

Turn back the time
To 10:15 last Saturday night
When we locked eyes
And bombs went off 'fore we lit the fire
Ya can't deny it
You can't sympathize it
I'd rather go blind
Than be without you by my side

If ya ain't got the hot legs
You can't know what to do next, no

These girls drive me crazy
Don't know what they been thinking
They wanna waste my time
No time for games to play, yeah
This new road I've been takin'
I hope they'll understand
I need a woman, ugh!

These girls drive me crazy
Don't know what they been thinking
They wanna waste my time
No time for games to play, yeah
This new road I've been takin'
I hope they'll understand
I need a woman

I need a woman
See baby, don't ya know?
I need a full-grown woman
I need a woman
