When blues got me down
Then I get turned around
I tend to cut myself off
From things I shouldn't run from

It doesn't really matter
Sometimes we run for cover
I'm always on the outside

Stabbed me in the back
Wanting things that I lack
Sticking to your ploy
Is this something you enjoy?

Publicity and insecurity
Just wanna be me
It's my need to be free

(Chorus)
It doesn't really matter
Sometimes we run for cover
I'm always on the outside, oh
You never seem to wonder
How much you make me suffer
I speak it from the inside

Looking right at me (at me)
Won't receive my plea (my plea)
Tell me what you mean (you mean)
I'm not what's on the screen, (ohhhh)
Faking what will be (will be)
Fighting the fatigue (fatigue)
That's quite enough for me (for me)
Makes me wanna be alone (be alone, be alone, be alone, be alone...)

Keep it to myself

(Repeat Chorus:)
It doesn't really matter
Sometimes we run for cover
I'm always on the outside, oh
Keep it to myself
You never seem to wonder
How much you make me suffer
I speak it from the inside

(Repeat Chorus:)
Keep it to myself, oh
It doesn't really matter
Sometimes we run for cover, oh
I'm always on the outside, oh
Keep it to myself
You never seem to wonder
How much you make me suffer
I speak it from the inside.
