When I walk down the road dear
When I walk down the streat
There's a shadow racing
Right next to me

And with everything I do
With all that I say
That shadow keeps looming
Right in my way

In my mind I see a big sky
In my mind I see a cloud
I hear the bells, they're a ringing
Somewhere far not too loud

And the feeling is deep
Oh, the feeling is wide
When the shadow is looming
Right by my side

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh

So long XXX
You can't set me free
So you must be going
But our time was sweet

Oh, there's nothing left to do
Oh, there's nowhere to be
'Cause the shadow is moving
Right next to me

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh

And the bells, the bells
They ring, ring, ring
And the bells, the bells
They ring, ring, ring

And the bells, the bells
They ring, ring, ring
And the bells, the bells
They ring, ring, ring
