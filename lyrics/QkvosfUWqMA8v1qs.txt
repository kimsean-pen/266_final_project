Fade till you see through me
But i won't leave so soon
For whom do i still linger?
It is you
It is you

And i have never known such bliss,
as a hand swept down across my wrist,
or an eyelash brushed across my face
It's like everything's in place

Fade till you see through me
But i won't leave so soon
Who do i still sing for?
It is you
It is you

Fade till you see through me
I'm a cold translucent blue
but it's warm when you stand near me
Oh, it's true
Yes, it's true

And I have never known such bliss,
as a hand swept down across my wrist,
or an eyelash brushed across my face
It's like everything's in place

Oh it's you
Yes it's true
