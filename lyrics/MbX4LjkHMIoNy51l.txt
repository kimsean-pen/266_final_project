Oh well you look so reckless
Cool but your tone is careless
Shapes that the moonlight's making
Who's got your hands shaking?
Eye through an ashtray and you my darling

But this moonlight is not moonlight
It's electric, electric light
It lands so soft in my bedroom
On the carpet, and when you lie down talking
I'm not listening
I just think it's funny how we are

United, united, united on the carpet
United, united, united once again oh

These houses along my street
They're so ugly staring down at me
They hold meetings in the night time, they speak quietly
They try to make me leave
They're laughing, I'm not listening
I'm just thinking how good it will be when we are

United, united, united on the carpet
United, united, united on the carpet

You're in my heart
You're in my car as well
You're in my heart
You're in my car

When I fall asleep
I often hope that it's for good but God I...
Don't want to die
I just want some sunshine

United, united, united on the carpet
United, united, united on the carpet

You're in my heart
You're in my car as well
You're in my heart
You're in my car as well
