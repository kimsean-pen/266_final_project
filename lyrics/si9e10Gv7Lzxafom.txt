No more maybes
Your baby's got rabies
Sitting on a ball
In the middle of the Andes

Yeah, I'm a freak of nature
Yeah, I'm a freak

If only I could be as cool as you
As cool as you

Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak

Try to be different
Or get a different disease
Seems it's in fashion
To need the cold sore cream

Yeah, I'm a freak of nature
Yeah, I'm a freak

I don't really know
How to put on a cool show
As boring as they come
Just tell me where to go

If only I could be as cool as you
As cool as you
As cool as you
As cool as you

Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Body and soul, I'm a freak, I'm a freak
Freak
Freak
Freak
Freak
