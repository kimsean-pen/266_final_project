To be honest, I didn't think my heart could weigh so heavy on my chest
Is it really safe that I carry my loss so closely
Now it's starting to hurt you and the way that you know me
I learned so fast
I've never known anyone like you
Really there's no place like you
But now you're leaving
Now you hate me, and I don't blame you
Cause I'm carrying the weight of two souls on my back and I'm wearing thin
How am I used to this
How did you even love me anyways
And I know that going my way isn't easy
But now I'm wondering how you see me
Cause I've never let anyone this close before
Really there's no place like you
But now you're leaving
Now you hate me, and I don't blame you
Cause I'm carrying the weight of two souls on my back and I'm wearing thin
How am I used to this
How did you even love me anyways
And now I'm wearing thin
How am I used to this
Now I'm living in isolation
There's a part of me I buried with him
That I'd do anything for you to see
I don't know how we ended up like this so far away
But there's just no place, there's just no place like you
