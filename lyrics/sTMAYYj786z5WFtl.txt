I wish I could stand on a star
I wish I could be where you are
They say "don't you ever give up"
It's so hard to be somethin' when you're not
But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone
No one by my side
Now I walk with you
With my head held high
In the darkest sky
I feel so alive
Adrift a lonely, little cloud
Above ground where i stand so proud
My face glowing loudly through the crowd
As I walk with the beauty of the night
But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone
No one by my side
Now I walk with you
With my head held high
In the darkest sky
I feel so alive
But I have walked alone with the stars in the moonlit night
I have walked alone
No one by my side
Now I walk with you
With my head held high
In the darkest sky
I feel so alive
