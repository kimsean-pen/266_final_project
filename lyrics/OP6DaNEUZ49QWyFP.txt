Cross the border
Into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour

Just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul from
The dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes

And it's harder than you think
To believe this sadness
That creeps up my spine
And haunts me through the night

And life is good and the girls are gorgeuos
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering 'round
With a half pack of cigarettes

Searching for the change that I've lost somehow
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy

I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know
Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all

Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from
Walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home

I look at the people as they sit there alone
Life is good, and the sun is shining
Everybody flirts to their ideal place
And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them

Trying to pretend that they've got som space
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually

I know, I know
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually

I know, I know
Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering 'round

With a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually
I know, I know
You keep telling me so
