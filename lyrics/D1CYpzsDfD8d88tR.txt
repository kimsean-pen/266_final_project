C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you've already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real, just
Say the word and I'ma give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating

Sometimes I think what I need is a you intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good by the way that you move, oh, hey

But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

If you want it, you've already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real, just
Say the word and I'ma give you what you want
