I remember when we were skin and bone, tough and cruel
But bruises brown and fade away
Trinkets in a coat pocket stolen from kids at school
Burned a hole and fed a shame

Someone should have told you that you'd always have a place to go
Uh oh I thought you would have known
Someone should have told you that you'd never find yourself alone
Uh oh, we lost you to the snow

I remember when we would hang about in hollow trees
New sounds, sitting smoking leaves
Walking past boarded up windows gets you down
Sh*t town, knew you couldn't breathe

Someone should have told you that you'd always have a place to go
Uh oh I thought you would have known
Someone should have told you that you'd never find yourself alone
Uh oh, we lost you to the snow

Or maybe you climbed out after all
I didn't wait around to see you fall
You must have known it. You must have known it
You must have known it. You must have known it
