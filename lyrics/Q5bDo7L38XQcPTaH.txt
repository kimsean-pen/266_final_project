Look in these eyes you'll see the dark
That little space inside my heart
The darkest side withholds the light
The light that brightens me inside

You don't know

Angels don't fly, they have no wings
It is another of those things
That we make up, that we believe
The real thing is not what we conceive

You don't know, I won't let you see me
I will hide, I will lie as true as can be
You just don't have what it would take
To be a part of me

The darkest side withholds the light
The light that shines, you can't deny

You don't know
You don't know, I won't let you see me
I will hide, I will lie as true as can be
You just don't have what it would take
To be a part of me

You don't know
You don't know, I won't let you see me
I will hide, I will lie as true as can be
You just don't have what it would take
To be a part of me

These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
These arms are my heart
