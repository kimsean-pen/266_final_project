Long you both laid in the sun's yellow stare
On the edge with eyes rolled back in the waves we calling him
As he teetered on the edge
The waves were calling him

He had seen it, felt it's might, bent under

Washing away
He thinks of you
Everything slows
Lights flashing through

The water flies
Over his head
You are me now
As you lay on my bed

The water flies
Over his head
You are me now
As you lay on my bed

This is what he'd always known
The promise of greater beyond the water's final horizon
