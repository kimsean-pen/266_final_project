Between a crucifix and the Hollywood sign, we decided to get hurt
Now there's a few things we have to burn
Set our hearts ablaze, and every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And every city was a gift
And every skyline
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
Set a life inside of me
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
Set a life inside of me
What are we gonna do?
We opened the door, now it's all coming through
What are we gonna do?
We opened the door, now it's all coming through
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
set a life inside of me
So much time on the other side
Waiting fou you to wake up
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And every city was a gift
And every skyline
And meanwhile a men was falling from space
And everyday I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
I'm happy you decide me
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
Big, blue, beautiful
Big, blue, beautiful
