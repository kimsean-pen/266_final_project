Passerby, it hurts every time!
Passerby, it hurts every time!
You make me feel like a whore!
Thirsty and hungry, always begging for more
Tonight with you, tomorrow with another
You selfish jerks don't even bother
You don't even bother asking me how I feel
When I'm breathless and drowning in tears
Broken, carried away by the melody
Trying to keep it together because you're staring at me
The face you see when you look at me, it's not Me!
It's just skin and muscles, not the real Me!
Not the Me you hear when I sing to you
Not the Me you feel when I touch you
Not me!

Passerby, it hurts every time
When I open up, giving you my confession
Merciless, you're eating me alive
Still, you are my only way out, my salvation!
I know the frosting on the cake is sweet
But the stuff inside is bitter
Mouth-full of razor blades
Lost in a deadly mirror maze
I know the frosting on the cake is sweet
But the stuff inside is bitter
Mouth-full of razor blades
Lost in a deadly mirror maze

Passerby, it hurts every time
When I open up, giving you my confession
Merciless, you're eating me alive
Still, you are my only way out, my salvation!

Hello dark stage! Embrace me!
Let the time pass by me, erase me!
Let me disappear in silence, swallow me!
I'm small and breathless, forgive me
