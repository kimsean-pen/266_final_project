Some folks say there's a price on love
Watch your freedom go watch your freedom go
Just can't breathe when you're 'hand in glove'
Watch your freedom go baby I don't know
But how can they mean it
How come they give it up
How long until they see
The modern laws of lovin' don't apply to me

Chorus
Twenty four seven stay here with me
Twenty four seven throw away the key
Twenty four seven I don't wanna be free

You get by if you kiss and tell
Hear the people say hear the people say
Two strong hearts gotta share one cell
Hear the people say but it ain't my way
How can they mean it how come they add it up

I'll give my heart and my soul if loving you is prison I don't need parol

Chorus
Twenty four seven stay here with me
Twenty four seven throw away the key
Twenty four seven I don't wanna be free free free
Twenty four seven around the clock
Twenty four seven I never want it to stop
Twenty four seven mmmm here with me

I'm gonna count the time
That you're gonna be mine
Seven days a week
Twenty four hours ain't enough for me

How can they mean it
How come they add it up
I'm gonna give my heart and my soul if loving you is prison I don't need parol
Repeat chorus
