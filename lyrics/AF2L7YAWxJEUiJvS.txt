Here come the ice cream man
With the 90s twang
Mokuba Lives
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Owww

I got this one shorty, body unbelievable
She ain't a keeper though
Keep it on a need to know
Just drawed a hotty 'bout a week ago
I've been looking for a main chick
Be my sugar, be my baby
Now I found one she ain't going nowhere
Nowhere nowhere

Girls say I'm bright, girls say I'm rude
Monday I'm aight, Sunday I'm boo
Look at that fuck off, whip we came tru'
Skr, you're a Sideshow Bob we made you
Lowkey ting she my su-su-sugar
Headscarf visit like it's ju-ju-jummah
Them boys stutter when it's mu-mu-mullah
She ain't tryna look for a looker
Walk in the party, sporting Armani
Black ripped jeans that I bought with a car key
You already know man, brought in the Army
Chicks looking at me like, talk to me Hardy
Or they're hollering at Sam, winking smiling they just want a madman
Get the champagne man are spraying like gas can
Lifestyle Gangland, word

I got this one shorty, body unbelievable

Nowhere nowhere

You're unsigned
Baby you can be my sunshine
You know a real nigga always on time
A soldier at the very front line
I know it's rainy days sometimes
Baby you can be my sunshine
You know a real nigga always on time
A soldier at the very front line

Ha, here come the ice cream man
Dark skin nigga with a 90s twang
Pull up, hood up, might be with Georgia, might be with gang
Hey, mans got a broader selection
Carribbean order collection
Quick hood tour with my peng ting
Dip dip then I call up a next ting
Hide your woman when I pull up she'll belong to me
Be my rider, be my baby, be my company
We've both been working, things were crazy, link up overdue
Girl I wanna roll with you, do you wanna roll with me ooh

You're unsigned
Roll with me (Baby you can be my sunshine)
Come roll with me (You know a real)
Roll with me (at the very front line)
Come roll with me (I know it's rainy days sometimes)
Roll with me (Baby you can be)
Come roll with me (You know a real nigga always on time)
Roll with me (A soldier at the very front line)
