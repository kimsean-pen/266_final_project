Want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

Bass is thumping crowd is jumping
Shake your body the beats keep on pumping
I'm excited candyguided
On the floor when we all dance united

Thunder rolls from the heavens above
When we enter the gates to the temple of love

Want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

We all want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

I'm on fire take me higher
Drown my heart in a pool of desire
Keep on shining intertwining
Feel aligned through the chemistry binding

Thunder rolls from the heavens above
When we enter the gates to the temple of love

Want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

Walk the rope in the temple of sin
Keep an eye on the records I spin
Through the gates to the temple of love
Where the DJ comes crashing from the heavens above

Want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

We all want love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night

O-o-o-oh
O-o-o-oh
O-o-o-oh
In the heat of the night

We all ant love, o-o-o-oh
We all need love, o-o-o-oh
We all want love, o-o-o-oh
Get it right in the heat of the night
