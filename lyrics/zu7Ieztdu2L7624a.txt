It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the rain down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for!

I'd fight for you!
Hey babumba
Hey babumba hey
Hey babumba hey
I'd fight for you!
Hey babumba
Hey babumba hey
Hey babumba hey
I'd fight for you!

Friends are cool
But we both know
They don't wanna see us together
Don't wanna lose
What I live for
I'm willing to do whatever

'Cause I don't wanna see you cry (cry)
Give our love another try (try)
I bet we get it right this time (time)
As long as you're prepared to fight (fight)

I don't wanna live another day (hey!)
Without your body next to me (hey!)
I'm not gonna let them break us down (hey!)
'Cause baby I know now! (Yeah!)

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you (I'd fight for you)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do (I'd fight for you)
Just like the rain down in Africa (I'd fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for
Whoa-oh-whoa!

Lets go!
What they say
It don't even matter
They don't really understand (Whoa!)
Without each-other
We are barely breathin'
Lets get air in these hearts again

'Cause I don't wanna see you cry (cry)
Give our love another try (try)
I bet we get it right this time (time)
As long as you're prepared to fight
Prepared to fight

I don't wanna live another day (no!)
Without your body next to me (no!)
I'm not gonna let them break us down (hey!)
'Cause baby I know now!
Know now know now! (Whoo!)

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you (I'd fight for you)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do (I'd fight for you)
Just like the rain down in Africa (Just like the Rain)
(I'd fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for
Whoa-oh-whoa! (I'd fight for you)
