Ah, ah, ah, ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la, la, la
Ah, ah, ah, ah ah

Once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us, and we changed
Then you sat alone in pride, and I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way?

We went round for round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause

I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

Oh, this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night
Wanna pause it, but I can't make it stay

We went round for round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause

I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you

No need to call my phone 'cause I changed my number today
And matter fact, I think I'm moving away, away
Sorry, the frustration's got me feeling awake
And I just keep having one last thing to say

And I just wanna hold you, touch you, feel you, be near you
I miss you baby, baby, baby
I'm tired of try'na fake through, but there's nothing I can do
Boy, I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause

I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, baby

I can't wait to hate you
'Cause right now I need you
I can't wait to let you go
