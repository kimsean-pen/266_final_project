You don't have to speak out loud
You can say it in your sleep
Just come see me in my dreams
No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep

Tell me if you could decide
What you could provide
Wanna know your insides
With no time left to hide
Do you still believe in fate?
Great love still awaits
Or is it really too late?
No time to escape

You don't have to speak out loud
You can say it in your sleep
Just come see me in my dreams
No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep

I dream of keepin' you confined
No one else is all mine
Put our differences aside
Two worlds collide
Baby, I'm a piece of glass, I shatter so fast
Don't know how long I'll last
Is one day too much to ask?

You don't have to speak out loud
You can say it in your sleep
Just come see me in my dreams
No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep

Tell me what's on your mind
Are you leavin' me behind?
Do you feel what I feel?
Is it buried deep inside?

You don't have to speak out loud
You can say it in your sleep
Just come see me in my dreams
No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep
You don't have to speak out loud
You can say it in your sleep
Just come see me in my dreams (my dreams)
No wonder I'm smiling in my sleep

You don't have to speak out loud
You don't have to speak out loud
