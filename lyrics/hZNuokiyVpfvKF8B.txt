Oh when you cross that line that you know you can't erase
To fall in lust not love
Ain't no sin at all
And tell me when you're with your best friend's friend
Do you still feel out of place
No thanks i took that ride
God only knows i've tried
Believin'
I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell i luv your lies
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell i luv your lies
The first time you look for love
You find you dont know jack
So much for mind games
You play to win
Cause first you lose your hearts desire
Then you get it back
But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss
I'm feelin'
I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell i luv your lies
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell i luv your lies
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person
Who needs me
If ignorance is bliss
Then take me off the list
I'm leavin'
I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart and hope to die
To tell i luv your lies
I imagine everyone survives
For givin' up all that you got
To tell i luv your lies
