You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with

Babe, you gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with

You don't understand that a girl like me can love just one man
Three thousand miles, that's how far you'll go
And you said to me, "Please don't follow"

So, you gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with

Babe, you gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with

You don't understand that a girl like me can love just one man
You've been gone a week and I tried so hard
Not to be the cryin' kind, not to be the girl you left behind

You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with

Babe, you gotta go where you wanna go (Go where you want)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you want)
With whoever you want (Go where you want, do what you want)

Babe, you gotta go where you wanna go (Go where you want)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you want)
With whoever you want (Go where you want, do what you want)
