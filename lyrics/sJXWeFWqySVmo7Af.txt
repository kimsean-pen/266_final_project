Don't want to be second best
Don't want to stand in line
Don't want to fall behind

Don't want to get caught out
Don't want to do without
Oh and the lesson I must learn
Is that I've got to wait my turn?

Looks like I got to be hot and cold
I got to be taught and told
Got to be good as gold

But perfectly, honestly
Oh, I think it would be good for me
'Cause it's a hindrance to my health
If I'm a stranger to myself?

Oh, miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
Bring me to my knees
Well, I must be my own master
Or a miniature disaster will be, oh
It will be the death of me

I don't have to raise my voice
Don't have to be underhand
Just got to understand

That it's gonna be up and down
It's going to be lost and found
And I can't take to the sky
Before I like it on the ground

And I need to be patient
And I need to be brave
Need to discover
How I need to behave

And I'll find out the answers
When I know what to ask
But I speak a different language
And everybody's talking too fast

Miniature disasters and minor catastrophes
Bring me to my knees, yeah
Well, I must be my own master
Or a miniature disaster will be, will be, yeah, yeah

Well, I've got to run a little faster
Or a miniature disaster will be, will be
Oh well, I need to know I'll last
If a little miniature disaster hits me, oh, oh
It will be the death of me
