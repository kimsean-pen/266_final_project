I will never believe what they say
There is a strength in enduring
They never speak for themselves
We are disappearing

You will be all that I seek
In a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep
In an open space
They would live inside you

We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going till we can't hear
(Dead air)

We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going till we can't hear
(Dead air)

We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air

This is a call to your arms
To take on mind over matter
Replacing fist over fist
We are disappearing

You will be all that I seek
In a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep
In an open space
They would live inside you

We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going till we can't hear
(Dead air)

We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going till we can't hear
(Dead air)

We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air

We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
We a- we a-are
We are all just dead air
