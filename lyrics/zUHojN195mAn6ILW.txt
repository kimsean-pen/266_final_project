Now my head's exploding and time is standing still
Looking in the mirror, the only truth i see, now who i wanna be
Things ain't getting clearer, the fog is getting near
See my life descending, dreams are never ending
Brain is filled with doubt, anger and fear

I wanna runaway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going and i don't care when it ends
I just wanna runway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going and i don't care when it ends

Sitting in the corner, trying to disappear
Hoping they don't see me, they'l only laugh and jeer,
Pretend that i can't hear
I wish this was a movie and the end i'd be ok
The heroes never coming, he's busy doing something
Hiding in the darkness everyday

I wanna runaway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going and i don't care when it ends
I just wanna runway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going and i don't care when it ends
I wanna run

I wanna runaway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going and i don't care when it ends
I just wanna runway, oh i wanna runaway
I don't care where we're going I don't care
