When I lay at night
They come passing by
One after the other
On the left side of my heart

When I lay at night
They come take my hand
They don't make a sound
When they lie with me

When I sleep at night
They're passing by
One after the other
On the left of my heart

When I sleep at night
At night
At night
At night

When I sleep at night
When I sleep at night
