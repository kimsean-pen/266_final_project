At dawn's first light
Run for your lives!

Viking ships
Come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last

Warlords invade
With axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse

Under attack
No turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack
No turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death and glory!

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

Wounds won't mend
Your bitter end
Death to all
Flee of fight
Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not
How hard you fought

Under attack
No turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death and glory!

The ships bring terror
To these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting
Through the waives
Like spades are digging graves
Solo
At dawn's first light
Run for your lives!
Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longship arrive
Run for your lives!
