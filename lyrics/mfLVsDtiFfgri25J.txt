"hey baby, you're on a subliminal trip to nowhere.you better get your trip
Together before you step in here with us!"

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
Baby come on back to Wolfman Jack (Wolfman Jack)
If you want yourself a day man, well I don't mind
You just ditch him when the sun goes down
'Cause the moon shines bright
And everything's all right
When the Wolfman, he creeps into town

Now you maybe want a man who throws round his money
But he ain't as cool as Wolfman Jack
And you might want yourself a man
Who don't act so funny
But he ain't your fool like Wolfman Jack

I don't mean to treat you evil
I'm just a good boy gone bad
But if I catch you after dark walking through the park
I'm just liable to do something mad

You maybe think you know what love is about, girl
But it's nothing till it's Wolfman Jack
And everybody knows, you go round and shout it
That your only thrill is Wolfman Jack

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
(Baby come on back to Wolfman Jack)
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack
You can't do this to me

Look me in the eyes baby, now you cut that jive
You know the Wolfman's just about
The number one cat alive
You got my great big eyes spinning 'round in my head
(How could you love another man instead?)
