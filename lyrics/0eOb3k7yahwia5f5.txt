Only you can heal inside
Only you can heal your life

It must have been an angel
Who counted out the time
Yes, it must have been an angel
Who raised a knowing smile

And I just couldn't reach you
No matter how I tried
No, I just couldn't reach you
So instead I ran to hide

Only you can heal inside
Only you can heal your life

Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me? Are you there?
Father, can you help me?
'Cause I know that you care

And I don't have to fight it anymore
For all those years I was dreaming
And I don't have to worry anymore
'Cause I found my belief in

Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me? Are you there?
Father, can you help me?
'Cause I know that you care

Only you can heal inside
Only you can heal your life
