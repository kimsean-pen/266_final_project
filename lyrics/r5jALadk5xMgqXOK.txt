I'm hot
You're cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby

C'mon girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself... Back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress!)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath!

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Oh, starin' me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby

We're burnin' up in the place tonight
Gonna sing it loud
Gonna feel it right
Get up and dance don't try and fight it
Big Rob's for real
And that's no lie
Stop, drop, and roll
And touch the floor
Keeps on burnin up
More and more
I got jb with me
Layin' it down
Now come on boys
Let's bring the around!

I'm sinkin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby
Burnin' up for you baby
