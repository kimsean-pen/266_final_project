Hey you,
You can't have to please everyone that pleases you
You don't have to put on a face and keep it all day too,
Oh, you.
But when you smile, well the legend lives on for a while.
Least there's dust in my eyes,
Oh, you.
Don't have to hide away on your own for one to approve.
And if you stay hiding baby, know I'll hide with you.
Oh, you.
When you act like a child, well the legend lives on for a while.
Least there's dust in my eyes,
eyes.
Hey you,
You're not the only one to leave so soon, do-do
Sometimes you have to see another one often
Oh you,
And every time we get high, well the legend lives on for a while.
Least there's dust in my eyes,
eyes.
