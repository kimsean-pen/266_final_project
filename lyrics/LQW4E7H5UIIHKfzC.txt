Broke into the old apartment
This is where we used to live
Broken glass, broke and hungry, broken hearts and broken bones
This is where we used to live

Why did you paint the walls?
Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?
This is where we used to live

Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why did you keep the dish-rack?
These things used to be mine
I guess they still are, I want them back

Broke into the old apartment
Forty two steps from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord, narrow laneway filled with crooks
This is where we used to live

Why did they pave the lawn?
Why did they change the lock?
Why did I have to break in? I only came here to talk
This is where we used to live

How is the neighbour downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your T.V. and stomped on the floor just for fun

I know we don't live here any more
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me, her body keeps me warm and I'm happy here
This is where we used to live

Broke into the old apartment
Tore the phone out of the wall
Only memories, fading memories, blending into dull tableaux

I want them back
I want them back
This is where we used to live
I want them back
This is where we used to live
I want them back
This is where we used to live
I want them back
