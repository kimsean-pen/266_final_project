Tell me, does it set you free?
And if it doesn't, you don't need to speak
I can see it in your eyes, it's all you need
And now that I feel alive without needing to justify the meaning

Tell me, does it set you free?
Tell me, does it set you free?
We'll believe you

We came from nothing but the truth, we won't fall for your excuses
Each disguise gets more obvious
We'll see right through it
All I believe is the way we treat each other comes 'round
Back around

What if I told you we won't take no for an answer?
Hope your system has up, has upheld to its standards
What if I told we don't fit your demographic?
We can see through the mask you hide beneath

Where are your now
That all your lies are crumbling?

No time for secrets
I've heard it all, believe me
When I say the walls are paper thin
We can hear everything
Do not need to speak at all
It feels like it's all been said before
You're no longer on your own

I'll feel it all when I sleep tonight
I've seen it all but I can't see the light
Lead me astray this time
I've seen it all

What if I told you we won't take no for an answer?
Hope your system has up, has upheld to its standards
What if I told we don't fit your demographic?
We can see through the mask you hide beneath

Tell me, does it set you free?
And if it doesn't, you don't need to speak
I can see it in your eyes, it's all you need
And now that I feel alive without needing to justify the meaning

No time for secrets
I've heard it all, believe me
When I say the walls are paper thin
We can hear everything
Do not need to speak at all
It feels like it's all been said before
You're no longer on your own
Tell me, does it set you free?

We're coming apart, the feeling that we belong to each other
Or are we too far gone?
Poisoning, it's turning on us
That's full of contradiction
Just look at what we've become
