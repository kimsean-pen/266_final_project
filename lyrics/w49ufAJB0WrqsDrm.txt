The dark descends through the promised land
Down kingdom come and the acid ban
I'm bad alone, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city

In Marianne I dug the hole
And watched her trip on my heart of stone
And in the end all that crawled, was my skin
I couldn't kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city

Ghost arrives at its bitter end
To the promised land and the dark descents
I'm bad alone, burned inside out
Nothing to kill it
I hit the city
I hit the city
I hit the city
I hit the city
I hit the city
1, 2, 3, 4
I hit the city
