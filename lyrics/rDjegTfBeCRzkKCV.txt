I flirt with Brancusi's gesture
I'm a bird in space
As his ghost escorts me to a magic place
I'm dressed all in colours, neither white nor black
Ask the begged question, need I come back

I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
How I long to be

Sing on Olympus Mons so all the world can see
Perfection in my structure, I have all I need
There's not a single stain on my song tonight
When time is endless and I'm always right

And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
How I long to be

And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
And I'll look nice like a bird in paradise
Forever caught in mid-flight
How I long to be
How I long to be
How I long to be
