I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go
I go dancing it's so intense
I will dance 'till the bitter end
No point in asking,
'Cause I always dance alone

Hypnotized by the raw emotion
Music stop and the spell is broken

I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go
I go dancing it's so intense
I will dance 'till the bitter end
No point in asking,
'Cause I always dance alone

Don't hold back my dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen,
Hypnotized by the raw emotion
Music stop and the spell is broken

Oooh how I move
Oooh don't hold back
My dance devotion
How I move, how I move, how I move

I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go
I go dancing it's so intense
I will dance 'till the bitter end
No point in asking,
'Cause I always dance alone

Don't hold back
My dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotized by the raw emotion
Music stop and the spell is broken
