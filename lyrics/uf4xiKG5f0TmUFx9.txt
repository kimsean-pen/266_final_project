Say, I wanna go outside
Stimulation amplifies, you know.
You need to stay behind
And I let me walk where the transit lights are

Tremors down my spine
Felt it for the hundredth time
When I'm trapped and I can not fly
And you don't own me

Take me over, take me tonight
Dream no more and leave it all behind
Take me over, take me tonight
Dream no more and leave it all behind

Dream no more and leave it all behind

Chase the moment
Take me over now
Take me over now

Chase the moment
Take me over now
Take me over now

Say, I wanna go outside
Guess I got to feel alive
And I don't want to leave this fight
And I let me home to where the transit lights are

Passions are confined
Feel like this heart ain't mine
Don't need to walk the line
I'll break this grand design

I feel closer
I feel closure now
And I am gonna break down
Chase the moment
Take me over now, now

Take me over, take me tonight
Dream no more and leave it all behind
Take me over, take me tonight
Dream no more and leave it all behind

Dream no more and leave it all behind

Chase the moment
Take me over now
Take me over now

Chase the moment
Take me over now
Take me over now
