I threw darts at a spinning globe
Swapping out passport photos
I walk west in a setting sun
Every single step I grow another second young

All my hair grows in
Wrinkles leave my skin
I still don't fade
I'll be back again when the tide is in—someday

I don't know who else to ask
Sitting in the dark, holding an empty glass
Stain my teeth with more red wine
I'm a romantic, but never pearly white

All my hair grows in
Wrinkles leave my skin
I still don't fade
I'll be back again when the tide is in—someday

Elephant shell
You're my cave and I've been hiding out
Will you tell me a little bit about, a bit about yourself
