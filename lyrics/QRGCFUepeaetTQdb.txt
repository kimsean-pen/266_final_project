Think of the times, together
When nothing seemed to matter
The tears (tears), we cried for
The days we leave behind

Never wanted,
Never wanted anything that hurt like this

Fading
It's over now
(Don't you know it's over now?)
Over now
(You know it's over now)
Fading
(Some kind of big surprise)
Fading out
(Don't you know your world is burning down?)
Burning down
(Your world is burning down)

Don't try to make me stay
I need to try to find my way (My way, yeah)

Fading
It's over now
(Don't you know it's over now?)
Over now
(You know it's over now)

Living astranged,
I've fallen, into a life forgotten
So cold (cold), and helpless
I'll heal inside this storm

Never wanted,
Never wanted anything that hurt like this

Fading
It's over now

(Don't you know it's over now?)
Over now
(You know it's over now)
Fading
(Some kind of big surprise)
Fading out
(Don't you know your world is burning down?)
Burning down
(Your world is burning down)

Don't try to make me stay
I need to try to find my way (My way, yeah)

Fading
It's over now
(Don't you know it's over now?)
It's over now
(You know it's over now)

Fading
It's over now
Over now
Fading
I'm fading out
Burning Down

Don't try to make me stay
I need to try to find my way (My way, yeah)

Fading
It's over now
(Don't you know it's over now?)
Over now
(You know it's over now)

It's over now
Fading
It's over now
Over now
