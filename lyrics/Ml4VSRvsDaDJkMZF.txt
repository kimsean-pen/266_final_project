Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur
Of what is known as (parklife)
And morning soup can be avoided
If you take a route straight through what is known as (parklife)
John's got brewers droop, he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons
They love a bit of it (parklife)
Who's that gut lord marching?
You should cut down on your porklife mate
Get some exercise
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand In hand through their
Parklife
Know what I mean?
I get up when I want except on Wednesdays
When I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (Parklife)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea
And I think about leaving the house (parklife)
I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too
It gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (parklife)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day
Safe in the knowledge there will
always be a bit of my heart devoted to it
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their
Parklife

Parklife (parklife)
It's got nothing to do with your vorsprung durch technic you know

And it's not about you joggers
Who go round and round and round and round (parklife)
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their
