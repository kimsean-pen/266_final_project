Times before I walked through the valley
Below the sun
I've wandered endlessly and waited for
My time to come

I think I'm drowning
Can someone lend a hand?
Can someone save me?
Cause I don't think I can

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying face down

Returning home I find myself
Wishing I was already gone
But how long does it take to find me
Well I'm waiting for someone

I think I'm drowning
Can someone lend a hand?
Can someone save me?
Cause I don't think I can

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying face down

I've gone too far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you
When I'm lying face down
I can't relieve my soul
I'm lost in a moment
Lying, Lying

I've gone too far to turn around
I've gone too far to turn around
In a moment
Lying face down
