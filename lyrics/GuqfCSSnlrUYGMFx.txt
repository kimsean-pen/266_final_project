The obstacles in sight
should never have the right
to be part of the problem.
But even if we tried
we'd hardly have the time
to spend in living our lives right.
Don't say that I could change
'cause even if you stayed
we'd still be climbing up this mountain.
So let us go our ways
and skip out all the pain
and forget all the...
Bricks we've laid into this path
yet the house remains undone.
Flooding at every cloud
and withering in the sun.
How's one meant to grows
when walls keep caving in.
The ceiling above us
has denied its existence in...
Bridges built for better days
but they won't hold our weight.
The ropes have been wearing thin
and tangling in the wind.
How's one meant to grows
when walls keep caving in.
The ceiling above us
has denied its existence in...
Of all the times we tried
I've still been up all night
writing songs of you.
And even though you're gone
they will still live on in a memory or two.
Of all the streets I see
no one will ever be comparable to you.
And with these words I go
I just wanted you to know
that my dreams are still of you.
