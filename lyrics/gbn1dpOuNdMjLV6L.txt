The crossin' seemed so small when
You decide to drive
The choice you have was made up, surely
You were right

You held up buying coffee
Something you despise
The only thing that keeps your mind
From staying alive

And I'm gonna be a lone ranger
Keep me warm
Oh, will you come and break my heart?
Free my blood

It's just that feelin' (It's just that feelin')
That takes me down to where we go
Just that one feelin'
Makes me mad like no one else
Just that one feelin' (Oh-woah-oh)
Just that one feelin' (Oh-woah-oh)

They turned and flew straight passed us
We could not turn back
The heat was up, the road was cold
And we were gone

And I'm gonna be a lone ranger
Keep me warm
Oh, will you come and break my heart?
Free my blood

It's just that feelin' (It's just that feelin')
That takes me down to where we go
Just that one feelin' (Just that one feelin')
Makes me mad like no one else
It's just that feelin' (It's just that feelin')
Takes me down to where we go
Just that one feelin' (Oh-woah-oh)
Just that one feelin' (Oh-woah-oh)

So strange
Moving round every day
The world gets warm
Living life in this way

It's just that feelin'
(Oh-woah-oh)
It's just that feelin'
And I'm gonna be a lone ranger (be a lone ranger)
(Oh-woah-oh)
And I'm gonna be a lone ranger (be a lone ranger)
It's just that feelin'
And I'm gonna be a lone ranger (be a lone ranger)
Kepe me warm
Oh, will you come and break my heart?
Free my blood
