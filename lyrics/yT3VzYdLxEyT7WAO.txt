So what do you feel
While you windin' through these older streets? And
What are your favorite kind of dreams?
So I, bet I just pause while the colors in this garden bleed and
Why don't you lay your head on me

So I bet you waste your time love, anywhere is here
Said, ooh, you tell your secrets, tell them all of it

So I feel it creeping up my neck when it's real late
Let it cover me up, let it cover me
Yeah, when it feels like a dream for you some days
Let it cover me up, let it cover me

Couple lit eyes on the corner staring right at you
Tell me what trouble you're into
So why don't you frighten me and wrap your legs under the sheets
What is your favorite kind of dream?
Said, damn, I'd never guess, crazy kind of life
Said, you don't talk that much are you the quiet type?

So I feel it creeping up my neck when it's real late
Let it cover me up, let it cover me
Yeah, when it feels like a dream for you some days
Let it cover me up

Don't you love it here?
Said, I want to fall
Where you really been?
Said, I want to crawl
Don't you love it here?
Said, I want to fall
Don't you love it here?
Don't you love it here?

Don't you love it here?
I want to fall
Where you really been?
I want to crawl
Don't you love it here?
I want to fall
Don't you love it here?

I feel it creeping up my neck when it's real late
Let it cover me up, let it cover me
Yeah, when it feels like a dream for you some days
Let it cover me up

Don't you love it here?
Said, I want to fall
Where you really been?
Said, I want to crawl
Don't you love it here?
Said, I want to fall
Don't you love it here?
Don't you love it here?
