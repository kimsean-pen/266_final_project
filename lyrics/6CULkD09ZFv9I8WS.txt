Unleash your long tie
And descend with me
Beneath the dream
Of any normal life
The footprints on your soul
Have stomped out your will
So why are you trying to
Wrap my sleave around

Hope... There's no hope
Your loss let me be the guide

You take a sip
And clear that haze of mine
Speak to me
I've been your friend
For quite some time
I've cost you everything
But I'm not the one to blame
The bottom of a barrel
Is a place you run for

Hope... There's no hope
Your loss let me be the guide

The bottle called
And you must obey
And I promise it won't let you
Think of better days
The bottle called
And you can't ignore
A reason to ask if
You will ever endure
