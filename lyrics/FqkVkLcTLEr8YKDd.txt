I can move more cookies than a Girl Scout
Twistin' up a wood, feet up, at your girl house
Ooh I love this shit, oxy itchin' in my back now
Shakewell movin' bricks, tell my people stay 10 toes down

Who that fuckboy, smokin', takin' selfies with my blunt
Walk up to his face and run my fade, he scared of one on one
Got a couple goonies who don't fight, they just start to dunk
All my migos savage and they barely turnin' 21
You don't want no static, Mexico make 'em fall back
Bee chop of bladge and fell McGee the way he flought back
Ain't no fuck shit, bitch I been a scrub since day one
I just got more cheddar so I'm keepin' me a couple guns
Still keep repping 818, that west atleast
Still rest in peace to Biggie [?], it ain't the same 'round here
You lil fuckboy better act right, get put down with a lead pipe
Y'all ain't sippin' no Act pint, you got Kyro and jugged by
Just a gang who got no shame for money, SMG
Packer pullin' up with shooters, packin' them SMGs
What you say, I'm known for slangin' pills and kickin' them dope rhymes
All my Compas grippin' cuetes, they all 15s and carbines
