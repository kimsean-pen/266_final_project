Nobody ever told her she was beauty
One day, she realized she was already free
The color in her eyes was fire rising
She found the light inside, a new horizon

Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies

She battled trials and every kind of tribulation
She reveled in adventure and imagination
She never listened to no hater, liar
Breaking boundaries and chasing fire

Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies

It don't matter what people say
Cause they don't know you, where you come from or where you're going
You are phenomenal woman
You are phenomenal, phenomenal!

Oh my my, oh my, she flies
Oh my my, oh my, she flies (she flies, ah-ha!)
Oh my my (oh my my), oh my, she flies (she flies)
Oh my my (fly), oh my, she flies (she flies)
Phenomenal woman
