For such a long time, we've been standing in line
and it's been so long, that we've forgot the reason
we're hanging on

Come away with me far away with me
You will never know until you go
When will you go?

Fly away with me, just leave the gravity
it's all just for show, when will you go?
Oh just let go

Superficially, we're officially, born as pure as snow
but you won't know, cause you won't go
but there in front of me, the lights are glistening
calling out for you, I think you should go

Cause we're all wide asleep, run away with me

Come away with me, far away with me
You will never know, until you go
When will you go?

For such a long time, I've been thinking
that we're all wide asleep
cause we've forgot the reason we're here at all
