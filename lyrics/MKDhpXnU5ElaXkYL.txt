Well, don't be taken aback
We can't afford to make this any messier than it needs to be
You know it's not an attack
Just a series of pointed questions and I swear my only intention is to keep it clear

So if you're waitin' for some slack
You're not gonna get it, cuz I haven't got anything left to pass
And if you even have to ask
You're probably not ready, so maybe you should ready yourself for that

I'd love to say that my mind's made up
Let's hope our mistakes are all behind us now
And pray there's always time for second acts

Another quick equation
As if crunching any numbers ever helped us to explain a thing
And now we're left with the remainder
Seems like it's always just the same, but how it was can never be reclaimed

Why don't you save yourself some math
It's not worth addressin', and we're really only guessing here anyhow
And if you even have to ask
You're probably not ready, so maybe you should ready yourself for that

I'd love to say that my mind's made up
Let's hope our mistakes are all behind us now
And pray there's always time for second acts
(Time for second acts...)
There's time for second acts...
(Time for second acts...)
There's time for second acts...
(Time for second acts...)
There's time for second acts...
(Time for second acts...)
I'd love to say that my mind's made up
Let's hope our mistakes are all behind us now
And pray there's always time for second acts
