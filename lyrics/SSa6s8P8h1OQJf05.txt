This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't never say bye (No no no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we won't never say bye

As a child, there were the times
I didn't get it, but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes on Sunday mornings
And I missed you but I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say if you were with me today, face to face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you've gone too soon and the hardest thing to do is say bye

Bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye

And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you've gone too soon and the hardest thing to do is say bye

Bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye

This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't never say bye (No no no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we won't never say bye bye

Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
Every day life goes on I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
And the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
So come on somebody sing it with me wave your hands up high, hey
'Cause this is for my people who just lost somebody
So this is for everybody
Just kept your head to the sky
We won't never say bye bye
