Pullin' back from the precipice
Feel so small now, stars shine bright above
Don't know why
Receive a better life for a song
Can't but try, other leads apply

Lookin' up at tragic rush on underground
Birds will turn and fly
Don't know why
Passin' through the day, only child
Breathe a sigh, other leads apply

Raining all day, trying to reach you
Feel so helpless, can't stop counting time (but in)
Don't know why, hands (something) stealin' my heart
Graceful divesâ€ , other leads apply* (rain down from the sky)
