Our summer came to an end
On this wild side of the road
I could never see the sun again
You left only one red rose

In a heartbeat my whole life has changed
This morning of september on the road
All the landscape colors turned to grey
You left only one red rose

I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september
I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september
I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september
I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september

Our summer came to an end
On this wild side of the road
I could never see the sun again
You left only one red rose

In a heartbeat my whole life has changed
This morning of september on the road
All the landscape colors turned to grey
You left only one red rose

I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september
I will be haunted forever
By this morning of september
