There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear witness
We can use
Be constructive
With your blues

Even when it's only
Warnings
Even when you're talking
War games

Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?

You don't live in a business world
He never goes and he never stays
We'll have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe

It's all over, the baby's crying
It's all over, maybe I can see out of here

All over, the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me
Out of here

All over, all over, all over, all over

Quiet down
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence and the mark and yen and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, we're going to crack your little souls)
Why don't you quiet down?
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence and the pounds and pence and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, we're going to crack your little souls)
We are the dollars and cents
