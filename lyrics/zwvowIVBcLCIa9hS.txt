There's a place we used to be
There's a face that I used to see
There's a picture with you by my side
There's a moment that I wanna find

I don't know where to start or how to begin
But I know, I love you still

If you ever turn away, if you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh, to hold you close tonight, I'd wait for life

There's a voice shouting inside my head
There's a space on your side of the bed
There's a hope every time there's a sound
There's a silence that's playing too loud

I don't know where you are or how you may be
But I know, I love you still

If you ever turn away, if you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there's something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh, to hold you close tonight, I'd wait for life

If I close my eyes
I'll dream a little deeper, baby
'Cause you are always on my mind
Yeah you are always on my mind for life

If there's something in your heart
That tells you to stop
Oh, to hold you close, yeah
Oh, to hold you close tonight, I'd wait for life

I'd wait for life
