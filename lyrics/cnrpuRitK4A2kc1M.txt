She had excuses and she chose to use them
She was the victim of unspeakable abuses
Her husband was violent, malicious and distant
Her kids now belong to the state of Massachusetts
They've been taken away
Betty was a bright one, Tommy's off his head
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past
Send them both to DSS, now you've had your chance
The poison who stole your babies
The judges took your rights
You can have your children for tonight
I suppose you were a victim, I suspect you may have lied
You've lost all ambition, why don't you give this thing a try
If you can't and you fail you won't be the only loser
These kids don't stand a chance with you in their future
They've been taken away
Betty was a bright one, Tommy's off his head
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past
Send them both to DSS, now you've had your chance
The poison who stole your babies
The judges took your rights
You can have your children for tonight
Betty was a bright one, Tommy's off his head
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past
Send them both to DSS, now you've had your chance
The poison who stole your babies
The judges took your rights
You can have your children for tonight
