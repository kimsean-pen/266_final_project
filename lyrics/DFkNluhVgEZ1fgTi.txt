I wake up at one
My day's just begun
Say hello to the sun

I'm felling sublime
The weather is fine
So i'm gonna shine
In finest of club
The best country pubs
Nobody will stop me

So now
Whatever i wear
It's gotta have flare
So you people can stare
And i'll catch your eye
When i walk on by
Nobody will stop me
Ooh

Come take my hand
Let's start the show
Strike up the band
And you'll see

Everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
For satisfaction
Everybody wants
Everyboy needs
So get up, get up, get up
To get some action

It's the ticket
You've been waiting for

'Cause everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
Oh yeah

And so
After the show
To my home we'll go
Promise i'll take it slow
And welcome in you in
With Lambrini and gin
The perfects of skins
(Haha)

Then I'll
Undress with my teeth
Too see what's beneath
Under your silken briefs
In my own boudoir
The je ne sais quoi
Nobody will stop me
Ooh

Come take my hand
Let's start the show
Strike up the band
And you'll see

Everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
For satisfaction
Everybody wants
Everyboy needs
So get up, get up, get up
To get some action

It's the ticket
You've been waiting for

'Cause everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
Roll up, Roll up

Everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
For satisfaction
Everybody wants
Everyboy needs
So get up, get up, get up
To get some action

It's the ticket
You've been waiting for

'Cause everybody wants
Everybody wants
Roll up, roll up, roll up
Roll up, Roll up
