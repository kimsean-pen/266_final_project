I am only human, this time will be different
I swear, we're just moving forward
I won't make you sorry if you stay

I know that I could've tried harder
And this liquid courage has got me feeling smarter
So I'm hoping I will find the right words to say

Tell me what is left round here
Other than you, my love
Tell me what is left round here
Other than you, my love

So, don't say we're through
Don't say we're through
Don't say we're through
Don't say we're through

It don't help to act like nothing happened
But our time is short, let's put this plan to action
The more you think about it
The worse it's gonna be

It's no secret, were were never perfect
But I guarantee that this will all be worth it
Come on, let's give it up
I'm going to make this up to you

Tell me what is left round here
Other than you, my love
Tell me what is left round here
Other than you, my love

So don't say we're through
Don't say we're through
Don't say we're through
Don't say we're through
