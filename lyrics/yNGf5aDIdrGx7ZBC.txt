when i was younger, so much younger than today
never needed anybody's help in anyway
but now those days are gone and i'm not so self assured
now i find i've changed my mind, i've opened up the door
help me if you can i'm feeling down
and i do appreciate you being around
help me get my feet back on the ground
won't you please, please help me
and now my life has changed in oh so many ways
my independence seems to vanish in the haze
and every now and then i feel so insecure
and now i just need you like i never did before
help me if you can i'm feeling down
and i do appreciate you being around
help me get my feet back on the ground
won't you please, please help me
