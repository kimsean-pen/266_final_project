I told you that I loved you and I meant it then
You know I'd never lie to you, I don't pretend
So don't make up
That this was a fake love

I told you that I'll always care, you laugh out loud
I try to open up and now you're freakin' out
Was this made up?
Was this just a fake love?

You're blowin' your cover
You're fuelin' my hunger
Oh, your pullin' makes me push away, push away
Oh, you love me like a hurricane, hurricane
You're makin' my mind up for me
Was hopin' for a different story
Wish I loved you like it's yesterday, yesterday
Before our love became a hurricane, hurricane
Wash me away

It's crazy how it didn't use to be this way
It's funny how the more I give the more you take
Don't tug me down
My mind's made up now

You're blowin' your cover
You're fuelin' my hunger
Oh, your pullin' makes me push away, push away
Oh, you love me like a hurricane, hurricane
You're makin' my mind up for me
Was hopin' for a different story
Wish I loved you like it's yesterday, yesterday
Before our love became a hurricane, hurricane

I hoped you would wish that I was happy too
Not askin' you to hold my hand while I break you in two
Oh no

You're blowin' your cover
You're fuelin' my hunger
Oh, your pullin' makes me push away, push away
Oh, you love me like a hurricane, hurricane
You're makin' my mind up for me
Was hopin' for a different story
Wish I loved you like it's yesterday, yesterday
Before our love became a hurricane, hurricane
Wash me away
