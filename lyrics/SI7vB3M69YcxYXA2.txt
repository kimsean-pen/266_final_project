Don't need your number, babe, but I'll take it anyway
I spent my nights recalling our showers in the morning
And what you said that day, I'll take it to the grave
But once I'm in the grave, you won't care anyway

So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse
So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse

No need for comfort, babe, but I'll take some anyway
Don't need the roller blades you got on holiday
I'll take the feelings that I wish I never had
You take your favorite band, that shit was always bad

I think I've seen a ghost, she walks along this coast
And on the breakfast shows, all the FM radio hosts
Keep playing "Paparazzi"
I think I loved you most when we were in my galaxy

So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse
So let's imagine right now
I'm just another night owl
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse
So let's imagine right now
(So let's imagine right now)
I'm just another night owl
(I'm just another night owl)
And if you're going out tonight, girl
The city is my lighthouse
