Behold! We come with manna drawn from Heaven
Ancient portals stand prepared
Come now, soar with us above the many waters
The world starts here and now

Hearken! We brought the voice of the hidden realm
Mute explosions lead the way
Come now, give ear to the silent roar
Of the metamorphosis

As fallen from the heavens -- As granted from above
Forbidden harvest divine, the very flesh of the gods
Succumb now to the spirit and succumb now to the void
And succumb now to the darkness in which you shall evolve

Behold! We come with manna drawn from heaven
Nameless dimensions lay ahead
Come now, and kneel before the spirit
Of this holy elixir

Hearken! We brought the voice of the hidden realm
Tongueless knowledge falls like rain
Come now, accept the dense fear
In which you shall evolve

As fallen from the heavens -- As granted from above
Forbidden harvest divine, the very flesh of the gods
Succumb now to the spirit and succumb now to the void
And succumb now to the darkness in which you shall evolve

As fallen from the heavens -- As granted from above
Forbidden harvest divine, the very flesh of the gods
Succumb now to the spirit and succumb now to the void
And succumb now to the darkness in which you shall evolve
