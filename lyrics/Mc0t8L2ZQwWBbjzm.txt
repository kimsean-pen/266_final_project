Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruise's colors
Everything fades in time, it's true
I wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you?

(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I selling you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every mood

Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

Now that I've found my reward
I'd hrow it away long before
I'd share a piece of mind with you
