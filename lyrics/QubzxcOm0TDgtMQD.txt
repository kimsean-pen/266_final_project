Too blind to see what this takes from me
Push forward even though I'm dying
A cruel fate is what I will soon face
Reason with myself but I know I'm lying
I awake just to fall in line
Until I can no longer fathom, repeat shortly after

But knowing the outcome
I march time and time again
Til it breaks me
Can't let it break me
Wake, work, break, suffer
Wake, work, break
Wake, work, break, suffer
Wake, work, break

Deny the fear of the unknown
And accept what lies in the darkness
I ain't content with being the workhorse forever

Tooth and nail I fight myself
On whether it's worth it or fucking futile
Pushed to the edge by the end of the day
Gaze at the mirror, stare myself in the face
Workhorse, when will you work for yourself?
