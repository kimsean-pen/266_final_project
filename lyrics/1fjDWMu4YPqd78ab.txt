You got an albatross around your neck, around your neck
You got a hundred broken lightbulbs above your head
They said that you had it coming but I wouldn't bet
Cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb,
And then you see red.

Some blood, some blood

You got an albatross around your neck, around your neck
You got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed
And you got a hungry green-eyed monster that you keep fed
And it keeps on coming over, it wants you dead

Some blood, some blood

Oh, you burnt the lungs that your ancestors created
You sat by the banks of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back and the water had abated
You drank, you share but you still could not be sated
Quicksands of the mind and the sinkholes you may find
When you look through the twisting of the vines,
The twisting of the vines.

Time comes round again, it's etching at your bones
Chill wind comes round, it's blowing through your home
Quicksands of the mind and the sinkholes you may find
When you look through the twisting of the vines.

You burnt the lungs that your ancestors created
You sat by the banks of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back and the water had abated
You drank, you share but you still could not be sated
You said you're scared of the clocks that keep ticking over
I'll find a way through a life that we're living over
Again and again through a life that we're living over, again and again

A life that we're living over,
Again and again, again and again and again
Again and again, again and again and again
