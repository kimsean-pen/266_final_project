Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, Warhead
Fuck 'em, man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white
Ohh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Yeah
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, oh yeah!
Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, Headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, ooh
Ohh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh, yeah

White-knuckle tight

Ooh
Give me Fuel
Give me Fire
My Desire
Ohh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
On I burn
