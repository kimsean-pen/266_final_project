I would like to climb high in a tree
I could be happy, I could be happy

Or go to Skye on my holiday
I could be happy, I could be happy

Maybe swim a mile down the Nile
I could be happy, I could be happy

All of these things I do
All of these things I do
To get away from you
Get away, run away, far away, how do I
Get away, run away, far away, how do I
Escape from you?
