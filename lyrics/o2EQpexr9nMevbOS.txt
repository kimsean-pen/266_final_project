Flying birds
Excellent birds
Watch them fly
(There they go)

Falling snow
Excellent snow
Here it comes
(Watch it fall)

Long words
(Excellent words)
(I can hear them now)

CHORUS
This is the picture (this is the picture)
This is the picture (this is the picture)
This is the picture (this is the picture)
This is the picture (this is the picture)

I'm sitting by the window
Watching the snow fall
I'm looking out
And I'm moving, turning in time
Catching up, moving in
(Jump up) I can land on my feet, look out

This is the picture
This is the picture

CHORUS

(Looking out, watching out)
(When I see the future I close my eyes)
(I can see it now)

I see pictures of people (rising up)
I see pictures of people (falling down)
I see pictures of people (they're standing on their heads)
(They're ready)
I see pictures of people (rising up)
I see pictures of people (falling down)
I see pictures of people (they're standing on their heads)
(They're ready
(They're looking out) look out
(They're watching out) watch out
(They're looking out) look out
They're watching out, I'm watching, watch out

I see pictures of people
I see pictures of people (they're watching, they're watching out)
I see pictures of people (watching out)
I see pictures of people (they're watching, watch out)
I see pictures of people (they're watching, watch out)
I see pictures of people (they're watching, they're watching out)
I see pictures of people (they're watching, watch out)
I see pictures of people (watching out)
I see pictures of people
Hey, hey
