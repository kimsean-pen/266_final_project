Close your eyes
And give in to the night
Soar above the stars
Forget what's behind
Don't stare up at the setting sun
Or the light of dawn

Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a gilded trail of stars

Rise, rise
Above the golden way of stars
Rise, rise
Beyond the trail of stars

The light will lure you
To lands forged by demise
To the shores of death
The blooming meadows
Seduce and intoxicate
With a deceiving scent

Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a trail of stars

I've seen the lights up in the sky
Like beacons from another shore
So don't look back, don't look ahead
Just close your eyes, give in to the night

Close your eyes now
Give in to the night
Soar above the stars
The blooming meadows
Seduce and intoxicate
With a deceiving scent

Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a gilded trail of stars

Rise, rise
Above the golden way of stars
Rise, rise
Beyond the gilded trail of stars
