You're not alone below the moon
All of us wait, for moment's gone too soon
You and me, breathe, to ignore the reason
Freedom
Scream again

Inside of me, doors will stay open
A thousand lives to live
Waiting like universes do without an end
Love break into my innocence
Innocence, innocence, innocence
Innocence, innocence

Stay close to me
Everything you knew
Left with the wind
In times like this we do
You and me, breathe, to ignite the feeling
Freedom
Scream again

Inside of me, doors will stay open
A thousand lives to live
Waiting like universes do without an end
Love break into my innocence
Innocence, innocence, innocence
Innocence, innocence
