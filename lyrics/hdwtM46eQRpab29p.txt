Across the border
Thought I'd find my remedy
Cross the line and make a life

We rolled on a Saturday and left it all behind
Don't regret a single thing
It was my time

Tracing my shadows
Down across the desert floor
Waiting for the man to come

This land has no sympathy
No one to help you fight
The plants will keep you on your knees
From daybreak 'til night
And I have a heart to give
And hands to make it fight
And now I'm out here on my own
Some kinda life

But who will look out for me?
Who knows my name?
Is there anyone out there
Who knows my kinda pain?

In this country
Tossed my name out to the wind
Felt my weathered life divide

Thought of my dear family
The friends I left behind
Thoughts like that bring me to my knees
I strike 'em from my mind

And now my home is everywhere
I sleep beneath the sky
No government to care for me
But I'll get mine

And I keep my spirit up
I keep it close beside
The sun will rise and make me work
The moon will calm my tide

And I live life right by the book
It keeps me going on
And some will call me criminal
So god help the blind

But who will look out for me?
Who knows my name?
Is there anybody out there?

Who will look out for me?
Who knows my name?
Is there anybody?
