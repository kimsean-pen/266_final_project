How are we supposed to stop?
Without that, I don't ever want another chance
I wonder why we start at all
I won't go back
Amen, the hallelujahs
I wonder why we start at all

How will we ever start over?
How will we ever start over?

Where are we supposed to go?
We're on the grind
We're trapped in a primitive past
I don't want to stop at all, but
I won't go back
I don't ever want to try again
How will we ever start over?
