Ah-ah-ah

Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on the mind

Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
Other half die

Makes you wonder
Oh wonder, wonder

Here come the man
With the look in his eye
Fed on nothing
But full of pride

Look at them go
Look at them kick
Makes you wonder
How the other half live

Devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Devil inside
Devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Ahh-ahh-oh

Here come the world
With the look in its eye
Future uncertain
But certainly slight

Look at the faces
Listen to the bells
It's hard to believe
We need a place called hell
A place called hell

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Oh-oh-oh
Ahhh-na-na-na-na

Well here comes the woman
With the look in her eye
She's raised on leather
With flesh on the mind

Words are weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
Devil inside
Devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Devil inside
Devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
Devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Devil inside
Devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na

The devil inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ah-ah-ah
The devil inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Ah-ah-ah
Ahhh
Ah-ah-ah
Ahhh
