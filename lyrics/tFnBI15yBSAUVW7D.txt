We are the scientists in the lab
Looking through a microscope
The little glass slides they never lie
How can this small mind cope?

I've never seen anything like it before
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own
But don't turn your back you stupid science world
This is reaching for the telephone

A one celled creature, a one celled thing
It hardly knows it's alive
You're better off dead if you only knew
Your growing life is taking a dive

I've never seen anything like it before
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own
But don't turn your back you stupid science world
This is reaching for the telephone
