So my demons your time has come
You will find me lay here
You and I both entwined
How refined an encounter
You ignite within my mind
With one desire
When it falls into place
Rush of fear takes over
Suddenly you succumb to impatience
And Surrender
So my demons your time has come
Well I swear we are in limited landscapes
Well I swear the tide swallows me, youre in denial
