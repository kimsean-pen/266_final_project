I am on the rock
And then I check a stock
I have to run like a fugitive
To save the life I live

I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

I'm on the run
But I ain't got no gun
See they want to be the star
So they fighting tribal war

And they saying Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

I'm on the rock
Running and you running
I take a stock
Running like a fugitive
I had to run like a fugitive
Just to save the life I live

I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm gonna be Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion
Iron Lion Zion
Iron Lion Zion
