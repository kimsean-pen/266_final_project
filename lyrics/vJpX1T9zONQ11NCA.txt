Hold me up, hold me down
Leave me in the withering pines
Steal my love, steal my kisses
Take 'em to the bartering lines

Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use

Spinnin' so hard I cant stand
Shadow of a shadowy man
Hold me up hold my hand
The treasures that she misses make the man

Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use

So hold me up, tie me down
Leave me in the withering pines
Steal my love, steal my kisses
Evaluate the differences in life

Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use

Repeat
