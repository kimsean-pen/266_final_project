The weekend is back
But so is he
Head to the flood lights
See the fraternity
They're waiting
I hear them up in the north
And down in the south
All that is spewing
Spewing out of his mouth

Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me

At his and hers dating
Bored minds agree
Requirements to be stated
And replies awaited
She wants a loose fit
He wants instant whip
Guesstimates her arrival
Will she want it really badly?

Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain

Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me

A car, a house, both in a street
The boredom of a sober week
The weekend's here, hip hip hooray
To make the blues just go away
