Why won't you get closer to??
to come across a little over familiar
but I could use a little time when you call my name

Tell me where you've been, what you've done and who you know
when you close your eyes
do you hold on or do you let go
and when you need to move on,
can you move on?

Yeah it keeps me feeling
it keeps me believing
I need meaning
just like everybody else

How did I let it get so lost since the last time??????????

When you need to turn it on
can you turn it on?

Yeah it keeps me feeling
it keeps me believing
I need meaning
just like everybody else

Yeah it keeps me feeling
it keeps me believing
I need meaning
just like everybody else
Yeah

Why you wanna come on your own?
Oh, why you wanna come on your own?
'cause it's a whole lot better
a whole lot better
a whole lot better ohh

Why you wanna come on your own?
Oh, why you wanna come on your own?
'cause it's a whole lot better
a whole lot better
a whole lot better ohh
