It's a part of me, a part of you
Tear me open, tell me black and blue
It's a part of my disguise
And my world it knows your mind
All alone I wake up next to you

I'm just trying to fall in line like everybody else
Each night I die wake up like a ghost
She's fallen from the edge
I'm fighting just to stand my ground

I can't get you, get you
Outta my system
Can't get you, get you
Outta my system
Love is like a razor blade
Open up your way away
I can't get you, get you
Outta my system

It's not hard to see inside of you
I'm afraid that I might find the truth
Yes their love is just a lie
Break my heart and hope to die
If you're gone I'm buried next to you

I'm just flesh and bone like everybody else
She's cold no heart no bones like a ghost
She's climbing to the top
I'm fighting just to break her down

I can't get you, get you
Outta my system
Can't get you, get you
Outta my system
Love is like a razor blade
Open up your way away
I can't get you, get you
Outta my system

My heart, my home, my hand I hold
is sanity
I melt it down, I wait around for you
I break away, I lose my way
I'm all alone here anyway
My heart, my home, my hand I hold
is sanity

I can't get you, get you
Outta my system
Can't get you, get you

Love is like a razor blade
Open up your way away
I can't get you, get you
Outta my system

I can't get you, get you
Outta my system
