All the old, Familiar signs.
I was hoping, Still to find.
The weather easing, Ever shielded, By the pine.
Out in front, I'm near behind, Heather even, Either side.
And tried, your path, Will ease our task, Come Spring.
And in my head, You're by the gate.
But you won't be there, As I come to the door.
Out of sight Though never far, From our thoughts.
And in my head, You're on the shore.
With the waves at your feet, The wind in your hair.
And in my dreams, You're with the birds,
As they take to the skies, And their song fills the air.
