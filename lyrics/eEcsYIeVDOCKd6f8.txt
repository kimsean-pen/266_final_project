Oh no, don't cry, its in your heart
So dry those eyes
Keep holding on for your dear life
Be a soldier of hope!

There's been many reasons for a while to sit and cry
But now I know they're coming to an end
I've been fighting on the front lines
A soldier for the good times
Fighting for the freedom of my friends

My hands have felt suppression
A life of toil and blood
My heart has heard the soul cries of the poor
But now I'm coming home again
And I'm never going away my friend
I'm going to hold my head high ever more

So I say
Oh no, don't cry, its in your heart
So dry those eyes
Keep holding on for your dear life
Be a soldier of hope

I hung up emotions for a campaign of the heart
But finally my heart has led me home
I leave the brutal truth behind
And follow with a lighter mind
A man of hope and glory I've become

So I say
Oh no, don't cry, its in your heart
So dry those eyes
Keep holding on for your dear life
Be a soldier of hope

So I say
Oh no, don't cry, its in your heart
So dry those eyes
Keep holding on for your dear life
Be a soldier of hope

Be a soldier of hope
