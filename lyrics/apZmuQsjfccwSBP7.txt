Where was u when I needed u the most? (youu)
Where was u when I needed u the most? (youu)
When I needed u the most, when I needed u the most
When I needed u (youu)
Where was u when I needed u the most? (youu)
Where was u when I needed u the most? (youu)
When I needed u the most, when I needed u the most
When I needed u the most, when I needed u

Neglected, rejected
Hardly selected to be projected by you
Standing alone in the wild woods
Wild hearts
Where no ones taking care of
My heart feels depression
'Til I got your attention
I just needed affection
Bad intentions alone
So of course you don't get it

Where was u when I needed u the most? where was u
Where was u when I needed u the most? when I needed u
When I needed u the most, when I needed u
When I needed u the most, when I needed u
When I needed u the most, when I needed u
When I needed u the most, when I needed u

Left me in rest
Left me in pain
Ripped off a past
No mercy, no mercy
Left me insane
You fucked up my brain
I hoped you would stay
Have mercy, some mercy
Some mercy

You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching
You stop catching fevers
You stop catching
Down with you so long
You stop catching
You stop catching fevers
You stop catching
Down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
You stop catching fevers
I was down with you so long
