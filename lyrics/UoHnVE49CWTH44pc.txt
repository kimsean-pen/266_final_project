You're still the one
I'll leave it for you
You're still the one
It's not the same as you are

No one's around
I'll leave it for you
No one's around
It's not the same as you are to me now

You're still the one
I'll leave it for you
You're still the one
It's not the same as you are

And no one's seeing
We might be all the same
No heart with no words
And no one's there to remind us

You're still the one
I'll leave it for you
You're still the one
It's not the same as you are

No one's around
I'll leave it for you
No one's around
It's not the same as you are to me now
