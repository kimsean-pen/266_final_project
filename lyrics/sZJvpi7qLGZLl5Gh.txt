Dove sei adesso
Dove sei, amore mio
Dov'è l'amore
Dov'è l'amore
I cannot tell you of my love
Here is my story
I'll sing a love song
Sing it for you alone
Though you're a thousand miles away
Love's feeling so strong
Come to me baby
Don't keep me waiting
Another night without you here
And I'll go crazy
There is no other, there is no other
No other love can take your place
Or match the beauty of your face
I'll keep on singing till the day
I carry you away
With my love song, with my love song
Dov'è l'amore
Dov'è l'amore
Where are you now my love?
I need you here to hold me
Whisper so sweetly
Feel my heart beating
I need to hold you in my arms
I want you near me
Come to me baby
Don't keep me waiting
Another night without you here
And I'll go crazy
There is no other, there is no other
No other love can take your place
Or match the beauty of your face
I'll keep on singing till the day
I carry you away
With my love song, ooh with my love song
(Don't keep me waiting)
Non c'è nessuno
Non c'è nessuno
Non c'è nessuno
Bello come te e ti amo
Come to me baby
Come to me baby
Another night without you here
And I'll go crazy
There is no other, there is no other
No other love can take your place
Or match the beauty of your face
I'll keep on singing till the day
I carry you away
With my love song, with my love song
I carry you away.
(Dov'è l'amore)
