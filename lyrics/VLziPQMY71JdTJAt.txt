Blink...
So what?
It's hard to tell the difference
We cheat
Why not?
It's hard to know what you want

Does it make a difference how I feel
As long as I come back to you?
Does it make a difference if it's real
As long as I still say I love you

Breathe
Why not?
It's hard to know it stops
We cheat
So what?
It's hard to know the reasons why

Does it make a difference how I feel
As long as I come back to you?
Does it make a difference if it's real
As long as I still say I love you

Call for blood
Where you don't know what happened
It's dark enough
If you don't know the difference

Does it make a difference how I feel
As long as I come back to you?
Does it make a difference if it's real
As long as I still say I love you

DARK ENOUGH
You don't know what happened
And it's not for blood
If you don't know the difference
