I can't take another hollow point conversation
It's getting hard to fake
The sounding you, an out lasting vibration
It something I can't shake

The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

You and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
Take one down for the young man easy (Young man easy)
You kept me outta my head, I fill the space in your bed
I own the beat of a breakdown, breakdown
'Cause you and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
And I don't wanna give it up

You caught me in a moment of redemption
It's nothing to explain
You have me on the edge of indiscretion
You said you'd feel the same

The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

You and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
Take one down for the young man easy (Young man easy)
You kept me outta my head, I fill the space in your bed
I own the beat of a breakdown, breakdown
'Cause you and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
And I don't wanna give it up

Drugs and candy
Drugs and candy

The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

You and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
Take one down for the young man easy (Young man easy)
You kept me outta my head, I fill the space in your bed
I own the beat of a breakdown, breakdown
'Cause you and me are like drugs and candy (Drugs and candy)
And I don't wanna give it up

Drugs and candy
No, I don't wanna give it up
Drugs and candy
You keep me outta my head, I own the beat of a breakdown
And I don't wanna give it up
Drugs and candy
