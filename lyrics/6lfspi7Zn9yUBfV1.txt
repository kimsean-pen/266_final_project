Complicated, Love is overrated.
You live in a fantasy i'm you're inner spaceship,
You've been trying to reach out, I've been at a distance
Put in your own power while you sitting in your feelings
I remember roller coasting.
Took me through the motions,
That's why i've been ghosting (Ghosting)
And that don't mean that i don't think
about you, i do love you (ooo ah oo)
The things i want.The things i need,
Two different things and i don't think that
its youu youuu.

(I wont live in a lie for you.)

I miss you i miss you oh oh oh

I do do (I MISS YAH)

I do i do (I MISS YAH)
But i got pride too

I miss you i miss you oh oh oh
I do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do But i got pride too.

Used to call you, Even when we argue,
Hadn't said our default
everything was my fault
Jump out in the sky for you.
You're the plane i'm on the ground for you.
(Oh oh) You cry, cry,
Cry almost every night, night.
Why do i keep it inside,
When i could just pull up
Should really just hold up

So I can just low up
The things i wantThe things i need, two different things,

And i don't thing that its youu. you
I wont live in no lie for you. (Ohhhhh)

I miss you, i miss you Oh oh oh
I do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do. (I MISS YAH)
But i got pride too
I miss you, i miss you Oh oh oh
i do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do But i got pride too.
I miss the little things. Going shopping and little sprees,

All kind of things fast in the breeze.
The things i want. The things i want (WHOAA)

Remember the times that you called me?.
Remember the times that you told me.
Fall apart. all and more.
I don't want no tissues. I rather be with you. (Whoaaoaaaa)
I miss you, i miss you Oh oh oh
i do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do (I MISS YAH)
But i got pride too (I got pride to!)
I miss you, i miss you Oh oh oh
i do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do But i got pride too
I miss you, I miss you Oh oh oh
I do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do. (I MISS YAH)
But i got pride too
I miss you, i miss you Oh oh oh
i do i do (I MISS YAH)
I do i do (I MISS YAH)
But i got pride too.
