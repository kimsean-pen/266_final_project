I never wanted
I never wanted to be born
Into this cruel world
Into this cruel world I was torn

Left behind with grief
Lacerated by life
Shackled into caves of grieves

From an union
From an union of force and fear
Arose my kin
Arose my kin enslaved

In hopelessness
In hopelessness and suspicion
The seed of eternal tomorrow

I was born a captive
A captive of the night
In between
Hopeless days

I was born on sleet
On sleet covered roads
I've been driven by howling winds

A beggar, a drifter
A refugee from my own life
And a companion
Companion of the ghostly lights

But still they came
They found the way to get to me
They beckoned me to follow

I was born a captive
A captive of the night
In between
Hopeless days

I was born on sleet
On sleet covered roads
I've been driven by howling winds
