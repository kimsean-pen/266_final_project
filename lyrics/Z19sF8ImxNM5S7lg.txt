I keep her to myself
My little secret, don't tell anyone
Or else I'll never call you my friend
And I will never bring you to this place again
I swear

Then she gets so high
That she starts to cry, my little baby-o
And I wonder why
She wants to know what it's like to die
But I say "don't you worry my dear friend,"
And "I will be here in the morning for you again."
I swear

And she goes where everybody knows her name
And thinks about the secret
And she wonders if I feel a sense of shame
I'm just hoping she can keep it
