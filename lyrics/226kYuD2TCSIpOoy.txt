Along the black death-land river
The mother runs and tries to find her son
Searching for her lost hero she wades the river deep to her belt in mud

Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!

Fear in her heart she calls her son,
As she rakes the tuoni river and sees the black swan.
Now she wades the river deeper to deathlands shoals and shallows and finds her son.

Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son!
Oh! heavy-hearted am I
Tuoni has taken my son
