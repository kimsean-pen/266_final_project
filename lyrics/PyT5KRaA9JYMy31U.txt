Runnin' through these bottles,
Runnin' through these bottles (Runnin')
I can't see what's real, I'm livin' in a bubble (Bubble)
Turn up at the party, tryna get in trouble (Turnt)
Yes, she came with me,
I'm tryna keep it subtle (Shh)
Runnin' through these bands,
Runnin' through these bands (Bands, bands)
Now I'm in demand, now I'm in demand (Me?)
Fader talkin' 'bout me, they think I'm the man (Man)
Pagans think I fall, I got another plan (Plan)

I don't do no drugs, I don't want no pills (Drugs)
Get that out my face, I just wanna chill ('Low me)
Diamonds dancin' on me, all my niggas grilled
(Bling, bling)
And she can throw it back, but that neck is ill
Mmm, I live it up (Live it)
Tell that girl that she can stay
If she gon' give it up (Throw it, throw it)
You couldn't run a track with me
'Cause you ain't fit enough (You ain't fit enough)
I know my competition down,
Go 'head and pick 'em up (Do it)
I be posted in the tent, I got a dagger on me (Shank)
Baddies bruk it down,
She can get the dagger from me (Dagger, dagger)
London in my aura, boy,
I got the swagger on me (Grove)
You see all my shit, and boy,
You can't grab it from me (Never)
Two-steppin' in the Wraith (Wraith),
Grabbin' on her waist (Waist)
Build 'em with your man,
We all know that he's a waste (Waste)
Them niggas couldn't do it,
So I'm settin' pace (Pace)
Ain't nice up in my hood so
I ain't checkin' for no face (Face)

Runnin' through these bottles,

Trinny boy me baddest so me hot steppin' (Trinny)
My youngins run the roads with a cocked weapon (Bow)
My bruddas open carry like it's Alabama (Whoa)
My bro' just touched a suite
And now he's in the slammer (Free him up)
Pourin' up my Henny from my nigga's pot (Splash)
I'm from the West and where
The drillers make their triggers blast (Baow, baow)
Now I'm shuttin' down the shows
To make the figures last (Stash, stash)
Me and you are not the same,
We had a different past (Different)
Peng ting throw it back like I'm playin' catch (Throw it, throw it)
I go deeper and she sprayin',
And I'm sprayin' back (Sprayin' back)
Fillin' up your glass, girl (Pour it, pour it)
Tell me how you stay low-key with all that arse,
Girl (How you do it?)
With my goons dem (Goons), me a bad mind (Badder)
I'ma sekkle any brudda,
Make it nap time (Sleep)
See the flow I always use,
They tryna grab mine (Tryna grab it)
I can't even be that cross 'cause I ain't baptized (Word)
