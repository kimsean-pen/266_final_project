Hat of greens shows symmetry
In front of hat, alone, sits me
Fourth day
I don't want it anyway to be reliving
It won't be that bad again because
This can't amount in comparison

I should intimidate you as you should intimidate yourself

Thirty minutes of make-up
For all to see but you
Are not what I want you to be
Universal there
At three AM on the first of a year
When it started, I'm not sure
In a jumper, with a bracelet
In a jumper, with a bracelet
On your right wrist
That turns with a golden knob
Opening amidst a dense yellow light, fade
To reveal an infinite sky

And juxtaposed to the accelerating swell of the musical score pushes
it's audience to realize just what is ahead,
the characters' fear and the physical manifestation of their hopes
and dreams coming closer and closer and
closer and closer and closer and closer and kiss me

My dad says things that make me laugh
He meows Tom Petty songs and that is why I stay
Unlike running water, can't run away
There are more here than merely bodies
Things without fear of surrounding
Me, branches to catch me falling
Perhaps someone who understands

That when I say I'm sad I mean it
That there is no excuse, I need this
What I said about hat of greens
Has led me to see that my superimposition of a face
Upon a poster on it's way
Arriving any day, that will accompany me every night
In a welcoming of rest
Tacked onto the drywall
Surrounding me
Will probably
Return me to this fading
The sky being a bedroom
Kiss me but I don't want to
