When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

I'll never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that, you feel that way too

I feel that way too

Is when I fall in love

I fall in love

With you

When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

Or, I'll never, never fall in love

In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun, oh

When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give

Oh, I'll never give

My heart

Oh, I'll never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that, you feel that way too

Is when I fall in love

When I fall in love

When I fall in love
With you
