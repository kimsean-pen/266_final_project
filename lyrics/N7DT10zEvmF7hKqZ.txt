All that, all that I wanted was to have a good time
I just needed to have a little fun
No plan, no time for love but then I ran into ya
Now I, I've got you always on my mind

All I want is to be with you but we're trying to take the time we need
I don't have a chance to miss you when you're always right here

I know it's hard to say you want me
'Cause we got more to figure out
But I don't wanna take it slowly
'Cause I already see you now
I see you right next to me
(In my bed, in my dreams, in my head)
You're here right next to me
(In my heart, under my sheets, in my thoughts)
Already next to me
Whatever you say in every way
I see you next to me
You're always right next to me

All that, all that I wanted was to hang with someone
Someone to hold and to love me for the night
I try, I always try so hard to keep a distance
But you got all the things I need (all the things I need)
Just wanna feel you next to me (feel you next to me)
All I want is to be with you but we're trying to take the time we need
I don't have a chance to miss you when you're always right here

I know it's hard to say you want me
'Cause we got more to figure out
But I don't wanna take it slowly
'Cause I already see you now
I see you right next to me
(In my bed, in my dreams, in my head)
You're here right next to me
(In my heart, under my sheets, in my thoughts)
Already next to me
Whatever you say in every way
I see you next to me
You're always right next to me

I actually see something in you that I haven't seen in anybody else
Um, I love how you're so honest and you're so sweet and genuine

I know it's hard to say you want me
'Cause we got more to figure out
But I don't wanna take it slowly
'Cause I already see you now
I see you right next to me
(In my bed, in my dreams, in my head)
You're here right next to me
(In my heart, under my sheets, in my thoughts)
Already next to me
Whatever you say in every way
I see you next to me
You're always right next to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're always right next to me
Mmm
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
