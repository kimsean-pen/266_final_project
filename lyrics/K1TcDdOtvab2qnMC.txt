I woke away from home
Your residing words
Reach across my husk
Go long and face it all
We speak with iron tongues
And temper the heart for me

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I was you, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I could too, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea
This is us colliding

I woke on wasted bones
Banished to the front
To conquer all we want
Unclaw the earth of us
Reveal what I've become
And temper the heart for me

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I was you, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea
This is us colliding

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I could too, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea
This is us colliding

We could be lost to be saved
Fear the waters are wild again
I'm always sworn against the sky

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I was you, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea
This is us colliding

Our love bore the wildest sea
If I could too, then I'd take it all back
Our love bore the wildest sea
This is us colliding

This is more than you'll ever know
This is us colliding
This is more than you'll ever know

This is more than you'll ever know
This is us colliding
This is more than you'll ever know
