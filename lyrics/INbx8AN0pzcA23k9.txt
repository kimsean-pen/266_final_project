Rock bottom, everybody needs one
Eyes open, I can't see in the dark
Saudade, everything falls apart
Wide open, they can't peek in our hearts

I'm still bummed from a promised kiss
What she took from me
I'm still bummed from a blind date
All the words she said

Bad poems, everybody reads one
Heart open, I can't feel what's inside

(Saudade, everybody finds out)

I'm still bummed from a stolen kiss
What she took from me
I'm still bummed from a blind date
All the words she said

Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me, tell me, I need to be told

Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me

I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again
I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again

Rock bottom, think that I just found mine
I'm open, come and watch my innards
Saudade, everything fell apart
Hearts open, there's no fee to come inside

I'm still bummed from a kiss
What she took from me
I'm still bummed from a blind date
And all the words she said, so

Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me all the words she said
Tell me

I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again
I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again
And I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again
I can change
Whatever you want me to be
Again
