Hey there, it's good to see you again
It never felt right calling this just friends
I'm happy if you're happy with yourself

Take off your shirt, your shoes
Those skinny jeans I bought for you
We're diving in, there's nothing left to lose

I'm gonna break down these walls I built around myself
I wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around
Let the walls break down

I used to wear you like a ball and chain
I'd run and hide at the call of my name
It was obvious, you were too much for me
Oblivious, I was young and horny

In retrospect, I wouldn't do it again
Stop talking shit to every one of your friends
I'm not the same boy you knew back then

'Cause I can break down these walls I built around myself
I wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around
Let the walls break

I can't breathe, my body's shaking
You got a way with the way you take me
'Cause you break me down
You know you break me down

I'm gonna break down these walls I built around myself
I wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around
Let the walls break down
(I'm gonna break down these walls I built around myself)
Let the walls break down
(I'm gonna break down these walls)
'Cause you break me down
('Cause you break me down, 'cause you break me down)
Let the walls break down
