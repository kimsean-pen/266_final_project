Twilight burn across the sky
Time has come the doom is near
Stillness rules this cloudless night
Armageddon is here

Woe to you
Earth and Sea
TOTAL DESTRUCTION

12 days of total eclipse
Yet the stillness rules this night of mist
But slowly clouds of death are forming
The time has come to Reap

Burning skies
Battle cries
TOTAL DESTRUCTION

The end of mankind universe
So many battles yet to fight
Take heed forever learn
When the bells chime THE RETURN...

Screams of fear
The doom is here
TOTAL DESTRUCTION
