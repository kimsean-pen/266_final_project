This is our admission and our mission
Is to bring down the walls
It's our mission not fall to submission

Life is an addiction with conviction
You're a Hollywood star
My addiction to feed my conviction

Light up the fire I bring you back to life
Taking us higher
Like it's the fourth of July

We can make it hot hot
Bring it on the rocks
Round round down, right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot
Drop it like it's hot
So swing another round right, cause we will never stop

Speeding up my future
I'm unbound
As I restring my guitar

I've got no regrets
Along the path
To be a hollywood star
A Hollywood's sunet I'm bound to the boulevard

Wrapped in a wire bringing me back to life
Get ready to fight we ignite like the fourth of July

We can make it hot hot
Bring it on the rocks
Round round down, right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot
Drop it like it's hot
So swing another round right, cause we will never stop

A lonesome desire
A freak on a ward
I'm torn into pieces as I restring my guitar
So is this my future
My boulevard scars
Got shattered into nothing
A self-proclaimed superstar

We can make it hot hot
Bring it on the rocks
Round round down, right until you wanna drop
We can make it hot hot
Bring it on the rocks
Round round down, right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot
Drop it like it's hot
So swing another round right, cause we will never stop
