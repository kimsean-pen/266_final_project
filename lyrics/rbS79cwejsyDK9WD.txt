Second place is only right
Sending love to you each night
You won the race
You did survive
Flickering into the holy light
Mouth the words you couldn't say
Your last regards
Your will
Whatever
Maybe I was young and crazy
Said "do you want to see the grave?"
Seal the image in your brain
Your stone's a monumental shame
