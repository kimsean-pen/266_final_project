When the answers surround you, wait
Until the present surrounds the grave
You won't feel so sad
With wool covered eyes, what did we expect you to see?

And here comes another one, tear it down
And here comes another one, not for you
And here comes another one, you'd wear yourself out
You'd wear yourself out, you'd wear yourself out
(Everything captive by half measures
All of it air)

None of your great successes
Written in chapters
With numbers like Vanity Fair
All of your great stories are
Left up in your head
Unresolved

And the urgency of that sound
And the way that you drown it out
I just don't understand
But if I had a choice I'd surely do the same

And here comes another one, tear it down
And here comes another one, not for you
And here comes another one, you'd wear yourself out
(Everything captive by half measures
All of it air)

None of your great successes
Written in chapters
With numbers like Vanity Fair
All of your great stories are
Fragments and tatters by half measures
Beyond repair
None of your great success
Read
All of it air
Left undone
