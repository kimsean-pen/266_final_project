I'm so sexy
To you now
To amass this
A whole life
A whole lifetime
And was it sad too
You never had a dreamboat
Our cards weren't laid out

I'm so sexy
To you now
I'm so sexy
To you now

I'm so sexy
Our cards weren't laid out
I'm so sexy
Laid out
Excuse for all the love we have now
All your love was
I'm so sexy
I see it now
I'm so sexy
