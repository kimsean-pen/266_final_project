Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was an empty sea
Until a silver fox and her cunning mate
Began to sing a song that became
The world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was a cold black egg
Until the god inside burst out
And from its shattered shell
He made what became
The world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was an endless land
Until our ancestors woke up
And before they went back to sleep
They carved it up into
The world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe wasn't even there
Until a sudden bang
And then there was light, was sound
Was matter and it all became
The world we know

Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, dance eternal
