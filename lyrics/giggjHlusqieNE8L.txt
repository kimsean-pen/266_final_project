Yeah
Lets take em back
Uh huh
'91 I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?"
Things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame
Comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music still sincere
Let's get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
In '94 was "My Life"
And my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you

And told you what I been through
Hate or love it
The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me

Hate or love it

The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin' to find my way
Then I dropped the "Mary" album
And people would say that
It's just not gonna work

And my feelings they did hurt

But my fans showed me so much love

And I owe it all to them

Then I came with "No More Drama"
I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died
I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day
And it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now
Because of all of these things
Hate it or love it

The underdogs on top

And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me

I'm the soul hip-hop queen

And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Hate it or love it
The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me

I'm the soul hip-hop queen

And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
"You Remind Me" of a "Real Love"
"You Don't Have To Worry" "Real Love"
"All Night Long" "I'm Goin' Down"

Shoo doo do, do, do, do, da

Shooo, do, do, do, do, da
"Reminisce on the love we had"
You are "Everything"
"Love Without A Limit"
What you gonna do without

"My life, my life, my life, my life"
Hate it or love it

The underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Hate it or love it
The underdogs on top (hate it or love it now)
And I'm gon' shine
Homie until my heart stop (I'm gon' shine right now)
Go head envy me (it's our time)
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere (hate it, hate it or love it)
But you already know me
Hate it or love it
(I'm gon', I'm gon' shine now)
I'm gon' shine
(I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine out)
Go head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't going nowhere
But you already know me
Right now I wanna thank
Each and every person out there
That's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
I wanna thank TV, radio, talk shows
Friends, family
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hangin' in there with me
During the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life
Where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (hate it)
Hate it or love it (love it)
Hate it or love it (hate it)
Hate it or love it (no, no)
Hate it or love it
