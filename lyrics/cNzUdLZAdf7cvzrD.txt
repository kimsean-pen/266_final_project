I was looking at the leaves
Climbing to the tops of the trees
But you were nowhere to be found,
Just beneath all the green
You were buried like a little seed
Among the roots and underground,
I was licking at the leaves
But I was in short sleeves and you,
You were like some sickness that I caught.
My sweetheart moved away,
Swept off like garbage in the alleyway,
And I need more grace than I thought.

'Cause brother, I'm far,
Brother I'm far away from everything!
Oh, brother I'm far,
Brother, I'm far away,
Brother, I'm far away from everything good!

She's like a hot cloth on a fevered head,
And like a needle she leads me
Well, I follow like thread
Tie me up!
Untie me!
All this wishing I was dead is getting old,
It's getting old!
It goes on, but it's old.

I was swimming through the waves
For what must have been days
But could find no relief,
When I started sinking down
I thought for certain I would drown
Until I saw you in the ocean underneath
All the bright colored fish
Tell of a treasure in a dull shell,
"Such subtlety, so easily missed!"
You, my hidden pearl of pure and perfect love,
And I'm a living example of 100 percent the opposite of this,
If I ask the same questions,
Well you say I ask the same questions,
Well maybe I repeat myself from time to time,
If I ask the same questions,
Well you know I ask the same questions,
But it's because everyone who answers me is a liar!

She's like a hot cloth on a fevered head,
And like a needle she leads me
Well, I follow like thread
But you untied me - didn't you untie me, Lord?
And now I haven't even thought about
Killing myself in almost five months.
