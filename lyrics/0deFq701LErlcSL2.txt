I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
I'd paint the gray sky blue
And just for you

I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
And I'd paint the gray sky blue
And just for you

So don't tell me you want the rain
From a cloudy sky

To wash away the pain that I've given you again
I've always tried to find what satisfies your mind
But I will never know where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring I would buy you anything

I'd read some poems for you
Just for you
I hope they won't make you blue
Like they used to do

So please tell me they're like the rain
From this cloudy sky

That wash away the pain that I've given you again
I've always tried to find what satisfies your mind

Don't tell me you want the rain
Don't tell me you want the rain
From this cloudy sky

To wash away the pain that I've given you again
I've always tried to find what satisfies your mind
But I can never know where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring I would buy you anything
