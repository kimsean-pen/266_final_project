Placing your blame on the other
And Pointing fingers for your struggles
playing the victim
complicit system
The evil eye
cast from your white gaze
Is too blind to see, the house of esteem
Was built on the backs of slaves
No purity
Just inequality
A false story of pride
A coward's tale
From the mouth of those
Who watched their dreams all fail
Those values that you preach don't apply to yourself
Playing the victim, complicit system
turn your back just like everybody else
No purity
Just inequality
The fear
in those who hold everything
Begins when power slips
From their hands
