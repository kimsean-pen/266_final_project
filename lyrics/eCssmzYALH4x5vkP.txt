You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
Yeah, you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
And the list it grows and grows and grows and grows
And gro-o-o-o-ows
Until it's everyone you've ever-

First was Phil, he used to call me his friend
But friends don't ruin each other to get ahead
He told my boss I faked my drug test
He got a raise, I got a note on my desk

Then there was Sally, she was one of a kind
I was a ladder she kept trying to climb
But when I asked if my love was enough
She said she'd rather sleep her way to the top

Now I know, now I know, now I know, now I know that you're-

You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
And the list it grows and grows and grows and grows
And gro-o-o-o-ows
Until it's everyone you've ever-

Never celebrate till after the meal
Even when you think that you closed the deal
Cause when the bill comes and they all look perplexed
You didn't sell it you just bought the check

I wrote this song with a good friend of mine
He cut me out and now I can't sing a line
Well, sure I'm bitter, sure, the whole thing hurts
But I guess it's just time I learned

Now I know, now I know, now I know, now I know that you're-

You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
And the list it grows and grows and grows and grows
And gro-o-o-o-ows
Until it's everyone you've ever known

You're nobody till somebody wants you dead
Yeah, you're nobody till somebody wants you dead
And the list it grows and grows and grows and grows
And grows and grows and grows and grows
And grows and grows and grows

And grows
(You're nobody till somebody wants you dead)
And gro-o-o-o-ows
(You're nobody till somebody wants you dead)
And grows
(You're nobody till somebody wants you dead)
And gro-o-o-o-ows
(You're nobody till somebody wants you dead)

Until it's everyone you've ever known
