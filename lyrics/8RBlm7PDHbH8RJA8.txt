I let it in
Maybe I should let on
When I feel everything but say nothing is wrong
It's the path that I paved
The road leads into itself
I've been walking for days feeling sorry for myself

As soon as I plant my feet
The rug is pulled from under me
Always reaching for the brass ring
Around and around and around
No luck reversed
The carousel turns

I let you in
Maybe you should let on
When you feel everything but tell me nothing is wrong
I lie there at night
Sleep to no avail
My mind racing in circles
A dog chasing its tail

As soon as I plant my feet
The rug is pulled from under me
Always reaching for the brass ring
Around and around and around
No luck reversed
The carousel turns

How can I say what I want to say
When every word pushes you away?
How can I say what I want to say
When every word pushes you away?

Pushes you away
