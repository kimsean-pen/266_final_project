Touching the sky You were
In my Heart's hole
You lie silent
(The blue of the tiny sky
The yellow of the tiny starres)
Lost You are to me
Though in You
I had hoped to lie
Your teeth are mirroring
The tiny starres
Smokey, You flood by me

Ripples of jasmine
Heavy smoke in Your path
Wait for me by the summer stream

Black sky is around You
You pass, dissolve and stutter "Farewell"
Lost You are to me
The ice is some distant bed

Lost You are to me
Your tongue hovels on Your lips

The starres are very far now
And You are very far now

Ripples of jasmine
Heavy smoke in Your path
Wait for me by the summer stream

The starres are very far now
And You are very far now
The starres are very far now
You were not real at all
And I had hoped to say:
"The starres are very real"
Oh You were not far at all
(I had hoped to say...)
Over beyond me and You
The sea waves "goodbye"
As it laps in my Heart
And You are very far now
And You are very far now
The starres are very far now
As if dead

(And then I wept I thought of You
And then I wept I thought of You
And then I wept I thought of You
And then I wept I thought of You
And then I wept)
