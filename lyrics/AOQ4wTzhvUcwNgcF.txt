Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whisky bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise

She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Well a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said, I hope that you're able, boy

Well, I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Well, then suddenly we heard a siren
And everybody started to run
Jumping out of doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And she was holding my right
Well, I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
Well, I'm gonna be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5-9 beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
