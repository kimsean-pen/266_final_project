Watching you slip through the cracks
then you came back
see those faces listen to you
there world is new
use, use your simple intuition boy
with you, with your vision you can bring me joy
you're getting under my skin
under my skin
you're getting under my skin
bring, bring a little revolution here
show me love will will take away my fear
show me how you're gonna bring me near
now that you've started a fire you can't put it out
I'll be frozen
something inside me was choking and you let it out
we are chosen
