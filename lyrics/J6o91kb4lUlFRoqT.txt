Vast Souls
And Inhumans,
Bitten By Infected Jaws

Abandoned Minds
And Corpses
Lurking With Moulded Eyes
Lacerated Bodies
Without Mourners
Nodding In Gallows

Crushed Skulls
Tasting The Fur
Of Dying Cats

Needles, Injecting Pain
Flamable Skin
And Deadly Thirst
Beyond Mind
Is Sleep To Be Found
Leap, Leap, Leap, Leap
From Life,
Leave Yourself,
Die With Me
