Well I don't know how and I don't know why
When something's living well you can't say die
You feel like laughing but you start to cry
I don't know how and I don't know why

I don't have many and I don't have much
In fact I don't have any but I got enough
Cause I know those eyes and I know that touch
I don't have many and I don't have much

but oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
For you

Well I don't know where and I don't know when
But I know we'll be lovers again
I'll see you someday before the end
I don't know where and I don't know when

but oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
Oh darling my heart's on fire
For you

'Cause only love songs will break your heart
'Cause only love songs will break your heart
'Cause only love songs will break your heart

Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
Oh darlin' my hearts on fire
For you
