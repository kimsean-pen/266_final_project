Inside me there's a sad machine
Wants to stop movin'
I disagree for the things you do
You should stop doin', oh

All the while
All the while

I want my frustrations
To know that you are alright
Not what I was doin'
You played a fool

Hold my head it's about to fall
All that is happenin'
Get what you would've changed to me
If you had it comin', oh

All the while
All the while

I want my frustrations
To know that you are alright
Not what I was doin'
You played a fool

I want my frustrations
To know that you are alright
Not what I was doin'
