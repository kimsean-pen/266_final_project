I feel my heart explode to particles.
Love is always here and I told you so.
Restless in dreams, love carved in stone
This rhapsody of life in a way, I guess, we all know it.

Hand in hand we stand while we watch it flow
Heaven can you help us, no we can't go.

Covered by roses
When this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die.
The choirs have awoken
Left no words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time,
Need to live every moment

We built our castles high, turned our dreams to gold.
We took the blows with pride, went through it all.
The dawn is closing in, new tales are told.
This rhapsody of life in a way, I guess, we all know.

Covered by roses
When this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die.
The choirs have awoken
Left no words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time,
Need to live every moment

For all we are is falling stars in the night
A blinding light raging down from the sky
The rise and fall, the rhapsody of our lives
It's all we know, we've got to let go

She dwells with beauty, beauty that must die.
And joy, whose hand is ever at his lips.
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might
And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

Covered by roses
When this dance is over
We all know our beauty will die.
The choirs have awoken
Left no words unspoken
Remember you as long as I can
Hold you in my arms all night
And spill the wine until the end
We all have our place in time,
Need to live every moment
