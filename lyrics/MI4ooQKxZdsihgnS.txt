That beat is hard

This is how it goes
Welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up, fired up, fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot, outside of the bar
Twenty deep, twenty feet from the boulevard
Black hoodies, black caps, black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before all the masses
Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat

Is to see how it sounds, echoing off the street
I just take it for a spin, pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rearview shaking
Then play it again, so there's no mistaking

San Andreas the block, get this bitch earth-quaking
Like...
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo

We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
You're not ready
I got plaenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily while you're back peddling
Forget the chitchat on me, homie kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitchslapped

So zip your lip back, listen and watch
We got the whole block rockin' off the way the beats knocks
You don't have to warn the people on the corner, they know
That if you're standing on that corner, then you're getting that show

World premiering you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earth-quaking
Like...
Oh, ready for it, here we go

We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
Oh, ready for it, here we go

We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system out
Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud

Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn out that system like...
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
