Don't know what day it is
What's going on?
Is this real?
Oh no, no, no, no, no

(One)
I woke up short of breath, but I've still got a long day ahead of me
I don't know what day it is but tell me 'cuz I gotta know who to be
Is this me up in the mirror? 'Cuz I thought it was somebody else
Well it's a realization, when you find out you don't even wanna look at yourself

Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground

(Two)
Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets
And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me where in line can I cut in?
Downtown wandering aimlessly around still don't know what I'm tryin' to find
Well you could flash all the pretty lights in front of me, I still won't see the signs

Where do I go?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground

I'm losing my
I'm losing my

I'm losing my ground
Where do I go?
What do I do?
Why do I do this to myself?
Why do I do?
Why do I do?
Why do I do?

Don't wanna go back there
Don't wanna go back there
Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm loosing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground
Ground
I'm losing my
I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground.
