Warm nights, slow hands, you let me sleep
In your arms with your heart in front of me
Sweet words, small clouds
You said to me you'd be loving me forever

We got lost in the night
Now we're stumbling through the dark
And sometimes I wonder why we have to work this hard
But here we are

I remember nobody loves me like you do
(I remember, I remember)
I remember I don't want perfect, I want you
(I remember, yes I remember)
You know you're the only one
How could I forget this love?
I remember no matter what it's me and you
(I remember, yes I remember)

Long nights that month you went away
Phone calls, your voice, it's not the same
So you drove all night just to say
You'd be loving me forever

We got lost in the night
Now we're stumbling through the dark
And sometimes I wonder why we have to work this hard
But here we are

I remember nobody loves me like you do
(I remember, I remember)
I remember I don't want perfect, I want you
(I remember, yes I remember)
You know you're the only one
How could I forget this love?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I remember no matter what it's me and you
(I remember, yes I remember)

Dancing under the stars
Kissing you in the dark
I remember your love, oh
Never giving you up, giving you up, oh
Dancing under the stars
Kissing you in the dark
I remember your love, oh
Never giving you up, giving you up

I remember nobody loves me like you do
(I remember, I remember)
I remember I don't want perfect, I want you (I want you)
(I remember, yes I remember)
You know you're the only one
How could I forget this love?
(Yeah, yeah, ohh)
I remember no matter what it's me and you
(I remember, yes I remember)
No matter what, no matter

Dancing under the stars
Kissing you in the dark
I remember your love, oh
Never giving you up, giving you up, oh
