I've just had the craziest week
Like a party bag of lies
Booze and then deceit
And I don't know why
I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same
And I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
Christmas came early for me

I put one foot forward
And ended up 30 yards back
And am I losing touch
Or am I just completely off the track
And I don't know why
I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same
And I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
Christmas came early for me

So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same
And I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
Christmas came early for me
