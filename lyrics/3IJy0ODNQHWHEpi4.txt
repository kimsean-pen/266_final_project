The blaze of northern light reflect the dawn of Gods
Of ancient Pantheons who rest no more in peace

Faith of the old, the strong one from above
The invincible
The invincible

All the Gods of the sky and the earth proclaim this day, this day
See the signs in the day and the night foretell the one, the one

Open up the Runa and belief of the strong and the brave
Open up let the Gods of your heart and your soul show the way

The eye of the high one have seen the dawn of Gods
In the well of Mimer, through the flight of ravens

Faith of the old, the strong one from above
The invincible
The invincible

All the Gods of the sky and the earth proclaim this day, this day
See the signs in the day and the night foretell the one, the one

Open up the Runa and belief of the strong and the brave
Open up let the Gods of your heart and your soul show the way

The blaze of northern light reflect the dawn of Gods
Of ancient Pantheons who rest no more in peace
