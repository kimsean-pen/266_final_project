Mama, how've you been
Come on and turn around
Put your head up then turn around
All of the sky

I know, I know, I know why
I know, I know, I know why

You've got me one way and turn around
You remind me of our song
All brought up on my own
You make me other ways
You burn the eyes on my own eyes

I know, I know, I know why
I know, I know, I know why
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

It's alright

Always, upward
Always, upward
Always, upward

Tell me you're not around
Then you're asking me to be alright
(In and out, in and out)
I'm always, I'm always, I'm always down
And I know, I know, I know why
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
And it's alright, it's okay, it's okay

Got to keep my mind at ease
Got to keep my head up
Got to keep my mind at ease (always, upward)
Got to keep my head up (always)

It's alright, I know, I know why
It's alright, I know, I know why
