It's too late to regret
about what I've done in my thoughts
I've condemned myself
there's no chance for parole

The prison break was very easy
But I'm still in prison
This broken prison looks easy
But my sky is the roof
There's no keys to the lock
and the clouds the wall's mold
My prison is your freedom
C'Mon explode the game now
C'Mon explode the same

Like a bird in a cage
wave my wings but i cant fly
I've used a spoon to dig
But there's no food outside to eat

My prison is your freedom
C'mon explode the game now
C'mon explode the same
C'mon explode the game now
C'mon explode the same

The factory the church the school
throughout these prisons I've survived
But uniforms, masters, clocks and time
are nothing comparing to the wall's of a mind
