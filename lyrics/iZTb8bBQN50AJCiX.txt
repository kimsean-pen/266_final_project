This is it, love,
Where shadow meets the light
I can't speak now
I can't find an honest sound
Those moves I made
Each one faster on the wire
I was a child then
I made mistakes and I shall lie here with them

So come close, I won't fight
But try to hold and I will run
Will you come with me this time
Tomorrow is its own
All I need
Is one last hour, if you would grant it
I'd reclaim my wrongs
Here in the flight of night

Don't draw the blinds now
Keep your eyes closed
There are still some miles to go
One for beginnings, one for no end
One for the time we long to spend
One for the half moon, in the flight of the night
One for the morning from which I ride

And one for
And one for this
See I move for this
There has been nothing more

See, I run for you
'Til I can run no more
I will outrun the light
I will run
