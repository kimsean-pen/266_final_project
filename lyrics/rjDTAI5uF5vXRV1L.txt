Sun is burning, chicks are hot
as I'm riding down this road.
Heaven must be on the way
drinking whiskey, smokin' weed.
I am surfing on the sea, ocean's waves are after me.

Desert has surrounded me
and my mind is full of speed.
Wish I could run to the void
sitting on my motor steed.
Watch the asteroids and the trees, walk the grey lunar hills.
