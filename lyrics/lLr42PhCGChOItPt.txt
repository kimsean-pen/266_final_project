Lay down your secrets
I wanna get to know you
In the air that you're breathing
I wanna get to know you

On the street signs and sun arise
I wanna get to know you
Or I'll forget the feeling
Before it's here and over, over

I'll be the left side if you'll be the right
I'll let the eyes fall into the night
Hold out the ocean over your hands
Hope that the answer goes with the ask
I'll be the left side if you'll be the right
I'll let it bloom and then let it die
Hold out the ocean over your hands
Waiting for something to play out

And your love, your pieces
I wanna get to know you
And I realize in the cold light on the day time
That I'm going under

I'll be the left side if you'll be the right
I'll let the eyes fall into the night
Hold out the ocean over your hands
Hope that the answer goes with the ask
I'll be the left side if you'll be the right
I'll let it bloom and then let it die
Hold out the ocean over your hands
Waiting for something to play out
