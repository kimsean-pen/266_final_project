Best love, yes love
By far
Best love, that's my lady

You love me like you know I could be leaving in a moment's notice
You telling me to stay until the morning
You know a nigga homeless
You give me everything inside the showroom
Your old school trophies
You used to work the small forward
Now you working corporate, dipping in a sports whip

I hope I never have to cut you off (Best love)
You're my best one (Yes love)
By far
I love it (Best love, that's my lady)

I think she could be in it for the long run
My niggas said I'm on one
I never knew a love stronger
My heart is a great big boulder
Hey, you fuck me like you know this could be something like your very last moment
I could leave it at the drop of a Fedora
But damn it girl I want you

I hope I never have to cut you off (Best love)
You're my best one (Yes love)
By far
Yeah, I love it (Best love, that's my lady)
Best love
I love it (Yes love)
By far
Best love, that's my lady

I hope I never have to cut you off
