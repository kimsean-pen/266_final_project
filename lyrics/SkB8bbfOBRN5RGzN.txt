Calm, breathless, awake
Abuse me, savour all you can

Uncover the signs
They come in waves
They'll be brighter
Than you ever could imagine

A little close
A little brighter flash
Into the room
Through the door we crash

Won't you come away with me
We can rest our bones
Like a ghost let's get away
Just give me one more horizon

Uncover the signs
They come in waves
They'll be brighter
Than you ever could imagine

Swim saviour
Swim save us
Swim saviour
