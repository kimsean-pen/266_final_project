I love the light in your eyes
fall of your hair as you turn
stay inside for a little while
stay tonight
don't let this all be a dream
wake up lonely instead
sense of loss, though it only was
in my head
I slipped these thoughts on your hand
symbolized with a band
by your side for the rest of my life
stay tonight
I love you
