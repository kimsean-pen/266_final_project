[Heidi]
I can tell you all the things you ever want to know
I'm just waiting on a chance that you might say hello
People always telling me to take my time
But I can't help that you're on my mind
Never thought that I would one day find
Somebody like you

[Chorus]
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling
Nothing's as good as you
What is it that you make me so crazy
I'm so in love with you
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight

[Amelle]
Ain't it funny, all the money never seems enough
Don't need no perfume or fancy dresses
I only want your love
So don't you ever listen to a word they say
As long as were together we will be ok
Never thought that I would one day find
Somebody like you

[Chorus]
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling
Nothing's as good as you
What is it that you make me so crazy
I'm so in love with you
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight

[Keisha]
The way the you're making me feel
So alive, so good, so real
And I know at the end of the day
I will never be the same

[Chorus]
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight
I just can't help the way that I'm feeling
Nothing's as good as you
What is it that you make me so crazy
I'm so in love with you
Baby it's alright if you take me out tonight
