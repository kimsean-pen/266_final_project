Still sick, Still sick
Still sick
Still sick Still sick
Still sick
Still sick
Still sick, Still sick

Still sick
Twelve grams in the zip
Us we don't mix
Triple 6 for my wrist
Blood on my lips
I can't stand I'ma sit
I was broke now I'm fixed
Black skies ever since
I won't buy, won't be missed
From the rain to the snow going in
I am sick I'm not seen
I don't know what I think
I can't see anything
Call my friends, give me wings
SG Drain who are we
Don't get lost in the shit
I don't want to be seen

Still sick, Still sick
Still sick
Still sick Still sick
Still sick
Still sick
Still sick, Still sick
Still sick
Twelve grams in the zip
Us we don't mix
Triple 6 for my wrist
Blood on my lips
