I'm alone
Can't wait until I feel your rain
So unreal
Can't find another place of your rain
I believe
I still believe in your warm rain
I'm alone
Can't sleep until I feel your rain

How can I find
Love, Faith and Trust inside of your rain
So unreal
Can't find another place of your rain
I believe
I still believe in your warm rain
So untrue
Help me to find through your warm rain

I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you feel the same
I'm sad, I feel like a little child

I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you feel the same
I'm sad, I feel like a little child
Somebody left, there is no rain

Oh no, I'm waiting
How about your rain?
I can't believe
I still believe in your rain
Like in heaven
I can't wait until I feel your rain
So where's your life
Who's living the rest of your life

I can't, I can't,
I can't live this life, I can't live this life

I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you feel the same
I'm sad, I feel like a little child

I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you feel the same
I'm sad, I feel like a little child
Somebody left, there is no rain

Yeah
And you set me free
Oh baby
And you're sad, you feel like a little child

I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you, why don't you feel the same?
And you're sad, you feel like a little child
Somebody's left there is no rain
