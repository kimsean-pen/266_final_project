Don't pull me down through your sorrow
I cannot drown these pitied depths
We did not choose to live this way
But we must make our own freedom
Pull the curtain and let the light shine in
Blow the cobwebs from your mind
Spring has sprung and we must follow her
Leave the winter far behind
Cold calling, hang up that call
Storm brewing, take shelter in my arms
Winds blow through those empty streets
Shadows growing, illuminate your mind
Death closing, take a different road
Winds blow through those empty streets
Pull the curtain and let the light shine in
Blow the cobwebs from your mind
Spring has sprung and we must follow her
Leave the winter far behind
Winds blow through those empty streets
Cold calling, hang up that call
Storm brewing, take shelter in my arms
Winds blow through those empty streets
Shadows growing, illuminate your mind
Death closing, take a different road
Winds blow through those empty streets
Don't pull me down through your sorrow
I cannot drown these pitied depths
We did not choose to live this way
But we must make our own freedom
Pull the curtain and let the light shine in
Blow the cobwebs from your mind
Spring has sprung and we must follow her
Leave the winter far behind
