Don't make it easy, easy, easy for me to go
You made it easy, easy, easy for me to fall, yeah

Don't even say it, I already know
When did we become so predictable?
Playing our roles
We stay in our role
Every step that we keep on repeating
Baby you see where it's leading
Similar roads
Familiar roads

And if I dared you, would you pretend?
Are we too scared to say that we should be friends?

I don't wanna be wanna be by myself
I don't wanna be by myself
I don't wanna be wanna be by myself
I just wanna be somewhere else

Don't make it easy, easy, easy for me to lose
You made it easy, easy, easy for me to choose... you

And if I dared you, would you pretend?
Are we too scared to say that we should be friends?

I don't wanna be wanna be by myself
I don't wanna be by myself
I don't wanna be wanna be by myself
I just wanna be somewhere else

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you
You
