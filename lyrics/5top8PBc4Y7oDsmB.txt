Jet, Jet, Jet

I can almost remember
The funny faces
That time you told me
That you were going to be marrying soon

And jet, I thought
The only lonely place was on the moon

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

Jet, was your father as bold
As a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you
That you hardly old enough yet?

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

Jet

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

Jet, with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll
Go for a ride in the sky

And Jet I thought that the Major
Was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

And Jet, you know, I thought
You was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh

A little lady
My little lady, yes
