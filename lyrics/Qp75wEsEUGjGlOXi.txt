Flowers bloom and I saw you standing
I know it's safe to come out of the woods
God knows what brought us together
But we grew better, we grew better

Dissolve into the air
I am another body
In this town
I don't care about anybody
Except a few around
And you never bring me down
You never bring me down

Wait for you to come home
And the nights become a drone
I ought to know
How to pass the time alone

Dissolve into the air
I am another body
In this town
I don't care about anybody
Except a few around
And you never bring me down

You never bring me down
You never bring me down
