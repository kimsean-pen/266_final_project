False tales
Lies of a washed up prom queen!

Why'd you tell me
Everything was fine?

Everything was okay?
Get on your knees, oh!
Oh, why?
Tear me up!

No, why?
Everything's dead inside!
Oh, you could've told me
at least I would've known!

No, you should've told me
and carved it in my bones!
Tear out my eyes!
Remove the gift of
Sight, proves ever cursing!

The light won't find us here!
Painted red, my eyes are burning!
And still you hide behind the waves!
Your silence is haunting!
Your words relentless

Burying in!
My heart betrays me

For a last first kiss goodbye!
Fall asleep!
Jar one eye!
Jar one eye!
Spilling every lie you've spilled before
Still I'm not forgiving you.
What's happened between us?
What can I give to save us?
Being righteous isn't quite enough.
What's happened between us?
What can I give to save me?
These oceans are far between our hearts.
The breathing has got too hard.
These oceans are far between our hearts.
The breathing has got too hard.
Oh!
Scream with the voice of an angel!
Lie in the name of the gospel!
Smile in the face of your victims!
Smile for me!
This is my last request to you!
Hold my breath!
I was clutching onto disaster!
Hold my breath!
