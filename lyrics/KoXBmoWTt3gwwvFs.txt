Go, ahead and tell me you got all you want
Fiver says you're wrong
And I suppose you've come down to help me
Move things along

And we lapped it up and we're wise enough to know
How it goes to get me honey
But we're wise enough to know
How it goes to get me honey
'Cause we know this feeling all a little too well

Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while
Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off

So yeah, go, ahead and tell me something real
Come on, how'd you feel?
And I suppose you've come down to help me
Add something to the reel
To the reel, to the reel

While we laughed it off and we're wise enough, who knows?
How it goes to get me honey
When we're wise enough to know
How it goes to get me honey
'Cause we know this feeling all a little too well

Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while
Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of the longshots paid off
One of the longshots paid off

And its by the by
If it makes those nights fine
We were side by side again
And now, we're all careless and roughed up
You know exactly how it goes
When you're giving us all kind of reason
Father had to go
Follow the heart I believe in, 'cause one of us must know
When you're giving us all kind of reason
Father had to go
Follow the heart I believe in, 'cause when the past is done we go
So go, so go, so go

Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while
Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of the longshots paid off

Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while
Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of the longshots paid off
One of the longshots paid off
One of the longshots paid off
