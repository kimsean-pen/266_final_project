High heels so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can't deny
High heels so high.

It started with the Persian cavalry
Admired by The French aristocracy
They wore high heels in the heat of war
The trend spread to the palace floor.
Far removed from practicality
High heels were the height of masculinity
Worn by King Louis the XIV
Higher than his kingdom had ever seen.

High heels so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can't deny
High heels so high.

Who could forget, Marie Antoinette?
Excess without a single regret.
So high with her feet up at Versailles
Meanwhile, leaving her people to die.
High heels. Unfashionable.
Just like women, irrational.
Monarchy is so last season.
The feet of the elite smell like treason.

High heels so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can't deny
High heels so high.

High heels were out of style.
At least for a while.
Women in pants, women on wheels
It's hard to march in high heels.
Regrettably, pornography brought back high heels for eternity.

They say a picture's worth a thousand words.
High heels accentuate a woman's curves.
So exotic, made erotic.
Forever and ever.

High heels so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can't deny
High heels so high.

High heels so high
Break through that ceiling, it's time.
We've got the power to decide
High Heels so high.

High heels
Who says they're only for women?
The future of high heels is only beginning.
Feminine and gentlemen we're all walking around in them
High Heels so high.
