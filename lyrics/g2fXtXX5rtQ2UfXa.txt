Come incite some violence
I'm bored of diplomacy
Suffocating silence
The curse, no dignity
The meek, the weak
The ones that have nothin' left to fight for
You take it all, pull the call
it's the wrong war

Fall faster, who is your master?
Who you gonna blame for this fucking disaster?

I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
Oh, we're just having fun
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad, mad world

I want to break the bank, black masks and gasoline
Line the street with tanks, on whose side do you wanna be?
The rich that ditch the immigrants to fight a new war
They wanna build a wall as they party on the dancefloor

Fall faster, who is your master?
Who you gonna blame for this fucking disaster?

I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
Oh, we're just having fun
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
No use in curing me (Hey)
From madness, insanity (Hey)
Well, I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
Well, it's a fuckin' mad, mad world

Now secure borders on January 27th
Suspends refugee admissions
For one-hundred and twenty days
While security procedures are reviewed
Though the resettlement of persecuted religious minorities
May continue during this time
On a case-by-case basis

Please lock the door, there are people surrounding
I cannot help them all on my own
It's a mad, mad world to live while others are drowning
Why can't these people just leave us alone?

I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
Oh, we're just having fun
It's a mad world
(It's a fucking mad world)

I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
Oh, we're just having fun
It's a mad world
It's a fucking mad world
No use in curing me (Hey)
From madness, insanity (Hey)
Well, I'm not the crazy one
It's a mad world
Well, it's a fucking mad, mad world
