We scoff and roll our eyes
Yeah, we've heard this all before in a different guise
These shrill alarmist fears
We don't deign to entertain them, covering our ears
So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away?
And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day?
I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise
Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing -
Why are they closing their eyes?
Now that heavy curtain sways
And the man who stands behind tries to give his name
So we ask ourselves, "Who stands to gain?"
Soon our tired talking points are feeling awfully strained
So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away?
And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day?
I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise
Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing -
Why are they closing their eyes?
So where will we go when the waters threaten to wash us away?
And all of our sons and our daughters wilt in the heat of the day?
I feel the sun draw nearer, I feel the sea start to rise
Who's looking back in the mirror? Why are they closing -
Why are they closing their eyes?
Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes?
Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes?
Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes?
Why are we closing, why are we closing our eyes?
