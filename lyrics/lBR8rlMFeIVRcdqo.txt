Treading down the street I've got the vibe in my feet
I'm feeling angry, angry
Thoughts of what you said are spinning round in head
I'm feeling confused, confused

I'm lovin' life right now but you're dragging me down
I don't know what to do but say it to you

Stop, just what you're doin' to me, you drive me mad
Oh baby, why can't you see that I'm sad?
You spin me round and you make me dizzy

Sitting with my friends I wait by the phone
I'm gonna give you, give you
A piece of my mind 'cause it's about time
Someone told you, told you

You're actin' like a child and it's drivin' me wild
I don't know what to do but say it to you

Stop, just what you're doin' to me, you drive me mad
Oh baby, why can't you see that I'm sad?
You spin me round and you make me dizzy

Stop, just what you're doin' to me, you drive me mad
Oh baby, why can't you see that I'm sad?
You spin me round and you make me dizzy

You better stop, you better stop
You better stop, boy, you better stop

You better stop, you better stop
I said, you better stop just what you're doin' to me
You better stop, you better stop
I said, you better stop just what you're doin' to me

You better stop, you better stop
I said you better stop just what you're doin' to me

Stop, stop
I don't care, stop
