Now there is no turning back,
Once gone, it traces impact.
Watch out, there's no changing,
A white light, right crawl out
Watch out the sun-covered track.

(Pre-Chorus)
Way before we seen it short come
The where that is a bad life,
And losing an empty station
We can be safe from this

Free, free, free
I was outside, now still got a place to go.

Way before we've seen it short come,
Nowhere, but it's a bad life,
You're losing an empty station
Again, we get a pass back,
And if she want, always wanna come back.

Free, free, free
I was outside, now still got a place to go.

Way before we've seen the short come,
Nowhere, but it's a bad life,
You're losing an empty station.
We can be safe and look

Free, free, free
I was outside, we still got a place to go.
