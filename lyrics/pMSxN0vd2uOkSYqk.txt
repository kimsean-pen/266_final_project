Must i forgive you
each time
and say you don't know what your're doing
there are no victimless crimes
i know of
out here in these graffiti ruins
my love
Oh i am not old
i'm told
but i am not young
oh and nothing can be done
don't start
my heart
is a smoking gun
oh and nothing can be done
I heard you leaving
late last night
i heard you screaming down the mountain
like you were running red lights
(red lights)
you had some trash-can-rock-band pounding
Oh i am not old
i'm told
but i am not young
oh and nothing can be done
don't start
my heart
is a smoking gun
oh and nothing can be done
Must i surrender
with grace
the things i loved when i was younger
(sweet embrace)
must i remember your face
so well
what do i do here with this hunger
Oh i am not old
i'm told
but i am not young
oh and nothing can be done
don't start
my heart
is a smoking gun
oh and nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
nothing can be done
oh nothing can be done
