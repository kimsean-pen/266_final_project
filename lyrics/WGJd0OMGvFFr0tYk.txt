I'm feelin' like I got the world in the palm of my hands
It's like I'm with you when nobody else is here, yeah
Me and you in here together are perfect
Just come a little closer, oh yeah, yeah
Hold on to me and feel the music
Free yourself tonight
Oh, just do what you want, what you want like nobody's watchin'
Do what you want, what you want, keep the party rockin'
What, what, what, give it up like nobody's watchin'
You know the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you
I can't seem to get this curiosity out my head
'Cause when I'm next to you, you make me wanna take you there
Whatever you need, you can find in me
'Cause I feel like, boy, touch me there
Chemistry is flowing, keep me going don't stop, baby
Hold on to me and feel the music
Free yourself tonight
Oh, just do what you want, what you want like nobody's watchin'
Do what you want, what you want, keep the party rockin'
What, what, what, give it up like nobody's watchin'
You know the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you
Calling you, calling you, calling you
The rhythm's calling you
The rhythm's calling you
The rhythm's calling you
Oh, just do what you want, what you want like nobody's watchin'
Do what you want, what you want, keep the party rockin'
What, what, what, give it up like nobody's watchin'
You know the rhythm's calling you
Lose control
Oh, just do what you want, what you want like nobody's watchin'
Do what you want, what you want, keep the party rockin'
What, what, what, give it up like nobody's watchin'
You know the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you
Do what you want, what you want like nobody's watchin'
Do what you want, what you want, keep the party rockin'
What, what, what, give it up like nobody's watchin'
You know the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you
