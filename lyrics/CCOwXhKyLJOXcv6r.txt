Poison like the air we breath in
This complicated world we weave
Spins around, pulls us down
This life we lead is overrated
mixed up fucked up
Calculated
That's the way
So they say
And all we ever need
Is a chance to be
Freedom lies beneath reality
(Find a way) find a way
Maybe today
And all the fairytales and fantasies
Can we find a way where we can be free?
(find a way)
Today
Underneath the way we feel
We've lost ourselves between what's real
No lost and found
We're broken down
Take a piece of someone's dreams
They're never simple as they seem
No thrown away
Like yesterday
(All we ever need)
I said all we ever need
(Freedom lies beneath)
Oh beneath reality
Just find a way
Oh maybe it's today
I said all the fairytales and fantasies
Can we find a way
Where we can be free?
(Find a way today)
Oooh today
(Today)
Oooh we all will be alone
If this house is not a home
It won't be too long before the air is gone
The love that lonely people crave it
Follows them into their grave oooh
We should never leave them lonely
(All we ever need)
(Freedom lies beneath)
I said freedom lies beneath
(Find a way)
Why don't you find a way
Just find a way
(All the fairytales)
I said all the fairytales
That you need is within
(Find a way)
Oh find a way
Why don't you find it today
I said all we ever need is
a chance to be
(Freedom lies beneath)
I said it lies beneath reality
Oh find a way
Find a way today
I said all the fairytales and fantasies
Ooooh be free
Oh find a way today
Just find it
Just find it today
Today
All we ever need is a chance to be
Freedom lies beneath reality
Find a way
Just maybe, maybe today
I said now all the fairytales and fantasies
can we find a way where we can be
free
Today
Today
