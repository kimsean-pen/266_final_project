Oh Heartbeat City
Here we come
And happy days
Count on thumbs
And nothin' really
Gets us down
As long as Jacki's
Back in town=85hmm

I'm glad you made it
I can't complain

Oh Jacki (echo)
What took you so long
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki (echo)
What took you so long
I thought you knew the way
(Heartbeat City)

The noise electric
Never stops
And all you need
Is what you got
And there's a place
For everyone
Under Heartbeat City's
Golden sun

(Jacki)
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki (echo)
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
(So long)
I thought you knew the way

Oh, yeah yeah yeah

You know
I'm glad you made it
I can't complain
I missed you so badly
When you jumped that train

(Jacki)
Oh Jacki
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
On just a holiday
Oh Jacki (echo)
(What took you so long)
What took you so long
(So long)
(Thought you knew the way)
I thought you blew away

(Heartbeat City)
Oh Heartbeat City
Lights at night
(Heartbeat City)
Keeps getting closer
Out of sight
(Heartbeat City)
Heartbeat City's
On the loose
(Heartbeat City)
Better catch
The blue caboose
Oh, huh, Heartbeat City
It's my life, uh
(Heartbeat City)
(Heartbeat City)
(Heartbeat City)
