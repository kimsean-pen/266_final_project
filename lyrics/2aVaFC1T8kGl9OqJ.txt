Shall I see tonight sister, bathed in magic greet
Shall we meet on the hilltop where the two roads meet
We will form the circle, hold our hands and chant
Let the great one know what it is we want

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward

Sister, we are waiting on the rock and chain
Fly fast through the airwaves, meet with pride and truth

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward

Father, we are waiting for you to appear
Do you feel the panic, can you see the fear?
Mother, we are waiting for you to give consent
If there's to be a marriage, we need contempt

Danger is great joy, dark is bright as fire
Happy is our family, lonely is the ward

La da da da da da, la la la la la
La da da da da da, la la la la la
La da da da da da, la la la la la
La da da da da da, la la la la la...

Remember death is far away and life is sweet
