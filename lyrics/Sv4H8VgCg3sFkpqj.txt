Lay back
For me.
You are just exactly what I need
In this cold town.

Lay back
For me.
The three of us in circus
And in liberty
It's been so long.

So throw your guilt religion
To the liars and the weak,
This is the politics and war
Of ecstasy.

And all the nonsense of that vision
That is failing every test;
It's the comedy and death
Of your senses.

The alternative to real world
Is just time for me and a fantasy
Be blind to myself;
To idolize.

The alternative to real world
Is just time for me and a fantasy.
I'm blind to myself
And idolize.

You work
So deep.
Astonished and in rapture
I can barely speak.
These are hard times.

Hormones
In key;
A slow whispered wet confession
From our body heat.
There's no return.

The alternative to real world
Is just time for me and a fantasy
Be blind to myself;
To idolize.

The alternative to real world
Is just time for me and a fantasy.
I'm blind to myself
And idolize.
