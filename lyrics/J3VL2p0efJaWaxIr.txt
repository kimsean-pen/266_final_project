Everything is so good in the summer air
Just put behind you all the problems that we share
Look into the sun, you'll see me and you
'Cause now you have the perfect view

I was so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see,
You're the only one for me

I was so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see,
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

Keep my promising, we're lying on the beach
Now we have each other and I feel so rich
Look into the sun, you'll see me and you
'Cause now you have the perfect view

I was so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see,
You're the only one for me

I was so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see,
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lamonade

So alone
Sunny
You're the only one for me

I was so alone
I really wanna come along
You're the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lamonade

Sunny, happy with the music, no money
I'm taking you in holiday
Sipping yellow lemonade

Sunny, no money
Holiday, sipping yellow lamonade
Sunny, no money
Holiday, sipping yellow lemonade
