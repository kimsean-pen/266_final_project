What did you learn today?
I learned nothin'
What did you do today?
I did nothin'
What did you learn at school?
I didn't go
Why didn't you go to school?
I don't know

It's cool to know nothin'
It's cool to know nothin'

Television's on the blink
There's nothin' on it
I really wanna really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea?
I want crisps
Why didn't you join the team?
I just didn't

It's cool to know nothin'
It's cool to know nothin'

Take a look, take a look, take a look at the
Kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat-beat, beat-beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Here comes the referee
The light's flashin'
Best bit of the day
Now that's livin'
Why don't you run away?
Are you kiddin'?
What is the golden rule?
You say nothin'

It's cool to know nothin'
It's cool to know nothin'

Take a look, take a look, take a look at the
Kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat-beat, beat-beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Take a look, take a look, take a look at the
Kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat-beat, beat-beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
