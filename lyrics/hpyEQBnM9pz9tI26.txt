(Michael Hutchence/Jon Farriss)

Oh so fine, we were trying
Out of nowhere just in time
Let you take me deep down the river
Kiss the changes that shape my life
Always left behind
All the tracks that I could find
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever

All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine
Here we lie looking up to empty sky
And the promises we find
I'm not the first one to ask why, yeah
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All we ever try

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever

Let you take me deep down the river
Kiss the changes that shape my life
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine
Do do-do-do-do, do do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find, all the truth you see
Rise and fall, but I know what's mine
