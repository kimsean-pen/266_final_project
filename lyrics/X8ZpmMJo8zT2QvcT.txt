Go Go Go Go...

Superhero
I'm tugging on your cape
Tell me will your sons
Know their father one day

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Will you be one of them?

Like an American drug
Makes a mean cock grow
...kill a priest
Makes a superman of glass

Go Go Go

The S on your chest
You're feeling like a god
An order of animal
We try to find a rod

Superhero, Sensei, Nero, smiling, hiding, riding, flying, sighing, sumo

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Ain't no grave going to hold this body down
The sun rises here to save us now
Its all erased
Storybook years
Sweet memories
Wash it away
Wash it away
Wash it away

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go!

Leader of men

Leader of men
Will you be one of them?

Leader of men
Will you be one of them?

Will you be one of them?

Will you be on of them?
