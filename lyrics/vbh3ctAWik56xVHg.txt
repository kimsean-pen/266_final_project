Have you heard of the new sensation?
A doctor's instrument that sends out vibration.

We have the tools here in our hand. Take a stand.
You cannot depend upon a man.

Scientific, it's terrific.
Restoring color to my cheeks when I feel frigid.

If you want to fly sky high, take my advice.
Feel the engine rumble in this device.

Vibrator. Turn it on and plug it in.
Vibrator. Rev it up and do it again.

V for victory and V for vibration.
We can do it while defending this nation.

Modern appliances will make the perfect life.
Mother's little helper will make you the perfect wife.

Feelin' groovy. So flip that switch.
You need a helping hand sometimes to scratch that itch.

To all my sisters switchin' it on.
Keep casting spells with that Magic Wand.

Vibrator. Turn it on and plug it in.
Vibrator. You rev it up and you do it again.

Sweat, ladies, sweat. Twist it all around.
Work, ladies, work. Till you hit the ground.

Vibin' in the club and we won't stop now.
It's so hot, I got to cool it down.

Vibrator. Turn it on and plug it in.
Vibrator. You rev it up and you do it again.
Vibrator. It's turning me on when I'm plugging it in.
Vibrator. It isn't wrong and it isn't a sin.
