I'm in love with a zombie
Can't keep it's hands off me
I think he's looking at me
But he's looking right through me

You think you're so cool, boy
Blood rushing through my veins now
Do you want me for my body?
Do you want me for my brain?
Brain, brain, brain

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, cold, yes, I'm freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating

I'm in love with a zombie
When he put his hands on me
Saying truth to my body
But when he don't call me

And I know that he like me
'Cause he chasing me nightly
And I want him to bite me
'Cause I know I'm gonna like it
Like it, like it, like it

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, yes, I'm freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating

Cold, cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, yes, I'm freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating

Baby, all I want is an answer, when I walk past ya
Why you gonna act like I'm Casper?
Every boy wanna know, irresistible, kissable
But you think I'm the invisible girl

Keep it down low, we be creeping, freaking
Got me feeling so aa-aa
Trying to keep cool, heart beating, you're heart's freezing
But I still want ya-a-a

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
I'm in love with a zombie, boy
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Cold, cold
Cold, cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Cold, cold
