Two hearts fading, like a flower
And all this waiting, for the power
For some answers, to this fire
Sinking slowly, the waters higher...
mmm
Desire
Desire
With no secrets, no obsession
This time I'm speeding, with no direction
Without a reason, what is this fire?
Burning slowly, my one and only... mmm
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
You know me, you don't mind waiting
You just can't show me, but God I'm praying
That you'll find me, and that you'll see me
That you'll run and never tire...
mmm
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
