What shines when the eyes are dull
What folds in when the hinge is gone
The moth is dead without the dust
I'm dead without a fuss

All I know is you
No I can't change

Below the shelf it's a happier home
And all your neighbours they love each other
And your friends are having so much fun
They're baking cakes and swapping numbers

All I know is you
No I can't change

The slightest weight upsets the scale
Simple words are growing vague
We're twinned but put against
One shape under the magnifying glass
Please no ad-lib, the world is cruel and outsides
Licking lips
All i know let's shed the myth
Let's cut out this bit and this bit
