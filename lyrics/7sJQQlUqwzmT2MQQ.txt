People talk about what we do
You like that stuff and I do too
Tie me down
And I could never do anything
Till you tell me to

I know you're into
Everything that's bad
And I know you can do things to drive me mad
And are you gonna take it?
Take it away?
Won't be the last time I'll be led astray

We get tied up in the moment
Where the nightmare is the same
This feels like a movie that I wanna watch again
Slo-mo, in slo-mo
It's slo-mo, in slo-mo

I will comfort you
But you always stop me before I do
And I slide into you're mid-week party
I know why you ignore me
I could be wrong, I could be real
You got me felling all them feels
I'll slip up, I know I will
Cause you are slick as an oil spill
I'm led astray

We get tied up in the moment
Where the nightmare is the same
This feels like a movie that I wanna watch again
Slo-mo, in slo-mo
It's slo-mo, in slo-mo

Are you gonna fade
Just fade away?
Cause you can doesn't mean you should
Even though I'm sure that you could

We get tied up in the moment
Where the nightmare is the same
This feels like a movie that I wanna watch again
Slo-mo, in slo-mo
It's slo-mo, in slo-mo

We get tied up in the moment
Where the nightmare is the same
This feels like a movie that I wanna watch again
Slo-mo, in slo-mo
It's slo-mo, in slo-mo
