I go through the pages of my own life, day by day
Like a dream on the horizon, they seem so lost
all led astray
I see them passing away

These feelings inside me
keep bringing me further and further down
Been lost for so long, can't find my way home
I don't even know where I belong

I've faced all the ages all alone, by myself
Never ending is the treason in every night
and every day
The circle drives me insane

These feelings inside me
keep bringing me further and further down
Been lost for so long, can't find my way home
I don't even know where I belong

These feelings inside me
keep bringing me further and further down
Been lost for so long, can't find my way home
I don't even know where I belong
