Hey baby, three months since I walked away
I've been out here lookin' for space
Now I need you, babe, I need you, babe
Oh baby, uh-huh, I'm a little hotter I know
But it's no fun being hot on your own
That's why I need you, babe, I need you, babe, oh

How come they don't make 'em like you, babe?
Oh, I never expected, I shouldn't have left it, for real
We can make this hard or this easy
So before you move on I got something to tell you
For real

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not

Oh, my body get hot like that (Hot, hot, hot)
Gimme that love, I'ma throw you right back (Ah, ah, ah)
When it's late at night, I know it gets so hard (So hard)
So if you need somebody, I'ma give you that love (Oh)

How come they don't make 'em like you, babe?
(Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I never expected
I shouldn't have left it, for real (Oh, oh, for real)
We can make this hard or this easy (Oh, oh, oh)
So, before you move on I got something to tell you
For real (Oh)

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not (Hey!)
In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
(I'll forget you not)
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
(No, no, no, no, no)
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not (Da, da, da)

Oh, I wish that we could chill like we used to do
Felt like there was no one in the room
Except me and you (Da, da, da)
Now I'm passing people in the street
Wishing they were you
Oh, baby, baby, I'll forget you not (Not, hey)

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
(I'll forget you not)
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
(Oh, oh, won't forget, won't forget, won't forget)
Bada-bang-bang (No, no)
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not (No, no)

Oh, no, no, no (Baby, baby, baby)
Sorry that I had to let you go (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, no, no (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe my friends they were right all along (Ooh, baby)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Wish I knew then, baby what I know now (Oh, oh)
Oh, na, na, na, na, na
