I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one that's pure inside
Everyday, everyway I smell of suicide
Bitter sins how they grow within, so you tell me it ain't right
I am all sins and you're my reason for life

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one, that's broken from giving
Everday, everyway I swear just one last try
Killing me with the death to be something that's so right
I am all sins my hands are scarred with time

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

Some leave me
Feel through my eyes

I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand gonna stone you, stone you

I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand gonna stone you

Make a change, gotta rearrange
Idle minds, crushing time
I am all sins and you're my reason for life

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I will stone you, stone you
Put my god damn arms around you
And I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo

I will stone you, stone you
Put my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you
My little Halo
