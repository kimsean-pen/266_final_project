I want it, I need it
I taste it, I breathe it
It fuels my aggression
It fuels all my questions
I cannot conceal it
It hits me, I feel it
It kills me, I bleed it
Now I believe it

I, I want it
I, I need it
I, I breathe it
You are the new drug
I, I want you
I, I need you
I believe you
You are the new drug

I want it, I need it
I trust it, I breathe it
It fuels my aggression
It fuels all my questions
I can not conceal it
It drives me, I feel ite
It fills me, I need it
Now I believe it

I, I want it
I, I need it
I, I breathe it
You are the new drug
I, I want you
I, I need you
I believe you
You are the new drug

Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath

I, I want it
I, I need it
I, I breathe it
You are the new drug
I, I want you
I I need you
I believe you
You are the new drug
