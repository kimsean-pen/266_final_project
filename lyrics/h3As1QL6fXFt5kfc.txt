Close the curtains, cash me in
Gather photographs of the Devil you let in
Digging deep inside my soul
I don't know, I don't know

Where to turn
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn the life right outta me
Do I run or lay down and die?
Is it time to close my eyes?

Keep me numb, I'll follow direction
A pawn to pass around and be bled until I'm dry
It's hard to see what's underneath
Is it me? Is it me?

Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn the life right outta me
Do I run or lay down and die?
Is it time to close my eyes?

For so long all I've known, all I've seen's green lights
Fuck your greed, all I need's somewhere
To catch my breath, rest my head and ease my mind
I've been holding on, but my grip ain't what it used to be
I'm much older, I'm bitter, I'm jaded, I'm lost
Can somebody give me a sign?

Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn the life right outta me
Do I run or lay down and die?
Is it time to close my eyes?
Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn the life right outta me
Do I run or lay down and die?
Is it time to close my eyes?
