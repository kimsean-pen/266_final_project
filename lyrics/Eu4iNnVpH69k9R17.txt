That Old Pair Of Jeans
You Always See My Wearing When It's Grey
You Know What I Mean
I'm Riding A Lazy Mood

Cause You've Been Waiting Got Me Ready To Go
And I've Been Sraying Off The Way That I Know, Keep Me
Wise Enough, Nothing To Owe
Guess I Need Ya And I Want It To Show

Lying Here In My Sanctuary
Days Go Past Its Autumn Already
And I Wish It Would Thunder
Lying Here In My Sanctuary
Day's Go Past It's Autumn Already
And I Sit Here And Wonder

And I'll Kick Off My Shoes
Think About The Things I'd Like To Do
Everything Going Smooth
There Ain't Nothing I'd Rather Do

Cause You've Been Waiting Got Me Ready To Go
And I've Been Sraying Off The Way That I Know, Keep Me
Wise Enough, Nothing To Owe
Guess I Need Ya And I Want It To Show

Lying Here In My Sanctuary
Days Go Past Its Autumn Already
And I Wish It Would Thunder
Lying Here In My Sanctuary
Day's Go Past It's Autumn Already
And I Sit Here And Wonder

What I Say And What I Mean, Are Two Very Different Things
Can't Tell Life From Lies Got A Bad Sense Of Spins
What I Say And What I Mean Are Two Very Different Things,
Babe, It's Time To Figure It Out

Holding Your Hand In My Hands And I Wont Let Go
Keeping Your Words And Your Face Is A Place Like Home
I've Been Blind Don't You Know
