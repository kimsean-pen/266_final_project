Find me in the shadows,
find me in the darkest night,
Lost in the battle,
Between wrong and right.
I feel lifeless,
I'm so helpless,
Pull me back from the end!
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life,
Resuscitate,
look into my eyes,
I can see the light I dont wanna let go,
I'm fighting for my soul,
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life,
I feel my heart beating,
Poundin' inside my chest,
I can hear your breathing,
You're saving me from death!
I feel weightless,
I see heaven!
Pull me back now,
Pull me back from the end!
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life,
Resuscitate!
Look into my eyes!
I can see the light, I dont wanna let go!
I'm fighting for my soul!
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life!
oh-o-o-oh woah!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
oh-o-o-oh woah!
I'm alive!
I'm Alive!
I'm Alive!
I'm Alive
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life
Resuscitate!
Look into my eyes!
I can see the light, I don't wanna let go,
I'm fighting for my soul!
Resuscitate!
Bring me back to life!
Oh-o-o-oh woah
I'm Alive!
I'm Alive!
Oh-o-o-oh woah
I'm alive,
I'm Alive!
