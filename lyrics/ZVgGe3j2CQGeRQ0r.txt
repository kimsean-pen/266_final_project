You're two-faced
all sideways
you're dry-eyed
and nightfly
your thin chokes
and splits spokes
you're high-staked
you're right-faked
your floor creeps
and deep sleeps
you catch up
you young pup
you old dog
you bullfrog

double X12

you drive paved
you grew a shave
you hardball
you held gold
you last heard
backward
you luck charm
you black diamond
your next kin
your lost twin
your short-step
your better rip
you cast light
you snapshot

yeah, you're my double shadow
you're my double shadow X2
you're my. double
you're my.
double shadow
