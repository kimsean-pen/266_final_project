Only know
I don't know anything too
I've spent a lot of time here
Sensing love throw you

There's a one thing, one thing
That you can't do
I was faced to shining
Time's eluding use

Where are those cars
That think they don't like me
It's only crime

Holding on
There's only one thing to do
Find a better place to chime in
Find a changing room

I'd only know
When you feel the way you do
Your love is getting cold here
Time's eluding use

It's not a drug
So you could be the wild thing
I'm on your side
