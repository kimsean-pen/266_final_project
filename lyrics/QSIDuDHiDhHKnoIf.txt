A raven, a raven is flying overhead and
I feel hopeless, hopeless in this place
Sometimes I feel I'd be better off dead, ooh
Sometimes I feel I'd be better off dead, ooh

I'm falling apart
With the rising and the falling of my heart
I cannot bear the inadequacy
Ooh, I have heard to look up when
You need a sign but I can't see

I can't fight my demons anymore
I'm pounding at the door
Oh who will heal me, am I too late
Where I long to be is in your arms, ooh

Help, where do I turn
I'm desperate to find the strength to learn
I'm losing hope in resisting temptation
Ooh, in the dark I can't find
You, shine your light 'cause I can't see

I can't fight my demons anymore
I'm pounding at the door
Oh who will heal me, am I too late
As I watch the raven spread its wings
It keeps its eyes on me and won't let me get away
Where I long to be is in your arms, ooh

A raven, raven is flying overhead and
I feel hopeless, hopeless in this place
Sometimes I feel I'd be better off dead

When I go to sleep I don't want to wake up
Don't want to wake up, don't want to wake up
When I go to sleep I don't want to wake up
Who will heal me

I can't fight my demons anymore
I'm pounding at the door
Who will heal me, am I too late
The raven spreads its wings
It keeps its eyes on me and won't let me get away
Where I long to be is in your arms, ooh
