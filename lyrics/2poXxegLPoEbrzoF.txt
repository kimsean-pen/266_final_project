you know how much i love you
i give you all my life
no one may take my life from me
i lay my life down, the point is on this plane
take the potion like we used to take an ocean breeze

no, there's no plane, there's no plane
we can't catch the plane-- in time i simply put my lot with you
and the plane will come out of the air
there's no way you can fly
i will take your call, i'm part of you

santa claus is checking his list, going over it twice
seeing who is naughty and who is nice

the sins of man, the sins of man
we win, we win when we go down
born out of season, in due time we give them our dead children
our children, our children are sublime

it's so simple, no convulsions
it's so simple, you don't know what you've done

santa claus is checking his list, going over it twice
seeing who is naughty and who is nice

the night brings the moon, it's much more difficult
that's nothing, like stepping on another plane, you have to step across
this world, this world, it's not our home
stepping over to another plane
the next plane free at last

santa claus is checking his list, going over it twice
seeing who is naughty and who is nice
