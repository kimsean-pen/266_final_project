Just live and let die
Check, check, check, come on

If you could take a minute of your life
That certain minute when you feel the lightning strike
To each his own on the level of that moment
But it's your moment, and you know you'll fucking own it
Glorified and embraced by your victory
When you're done, you escape with that memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong page is turned

It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next

At some point, we come down from the highs
And so be it, we move on with our lives
Some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math, you can laugh when I die
If life is just a fantasy, then could you
Live this fantasy life? If so, then would you?
Just remember that the doors are not closeable
And your motherfucking heroes are disposable

It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next
It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next

Just live and let die, just live and let, just live and let
Just live and let die
Just live and let die, just live and let, just live and let

So what about the hardcore that ain't hard anymore?
Or the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore
Or the old fighters who can't fight anymore?
Or the white kids who ain't white anymore?
Or the actors that don't act anymore?
Or the rappers that don't rap anymore?
Or the hipsters that don't hip anymore?
Or the limpsters that don't limp anymore? Come on

Just live and let die, just live and let, just live and let
Just live and let die
Just live and let die, just live and let, just live and let
Just live and let die

But no, it's impossible
Just to live your, live your life and let us die
Oh, motherfuck that
You wanna talk about some shit? Let's talk about the

Hardcore that ain't hard anymore
Or the shit talkers who ain't shit anymore
Or the old fighters who can't fight anymore
Or the white kids who ain't white anymore
Or the actors that can't act anymore
Or the rappers that can't anymore
Or the hipsters that can't hip anymore
Or the limpsters that can't limp anymore, come on

It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next
It's an E! True Hollywood Story
