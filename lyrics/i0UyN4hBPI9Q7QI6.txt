She said don't worry
About me, it's inside your head
But then I worry
About everything that she has said

Oh tell me you love me
Over and over again
Just tell me you love me
Over and over again

She said don't

She she she said said

Don't worry about a thing
But then I just worry
I don't know why I can't try

She said, she's sad
She said, she's sad
She said, she's sad
She said, she's sad

She she she said said

She said, she's sad
She said, she's sad

She said don't worry about me
It's just inside your head
But then I worry
About everything that she has said

I'll tell you I love you (She said)
Over and over again (She said)
I'll tell you I love you (She said)
Over and over again (She said)
I don't know why we can't try (She said)
