I think she took my soul but I didn't know
That gypsy woman's got me under control
She fed me lies, yeah, she casts her spells
That gypsy woman's really ringing my bells
And to hell, I will go knocking right on Satan's door
Heavens no, this ain't it
Honey, I won't beg, I'll just take it quick

She took me to my knees and now she's got me praying

Save me, she's a liar
And I can't seem to untie the rope
She's got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control

I can feel the hole that she left
Gypsy woman robbed me of my best
She said she couldn't say
Gypsy woman wore black on our wedding day
And to hell, I will go knocking right on Satan's door
Heavens no, this ain't it
Honey, I won't beg, I'll just take it quick

She took me to my knees and now she's got me praying

Save me, she's a liar
And I can't seem to untie the rope
She's got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control

'Cause I don't need what you've been givin' me
So, gypsy woman, stay the hell away from me
'Cause I don't need what you've been givin' me
So, gypsy woman, stay the hell away from me
'Cause I don't need what you've been givin' me
So, gypsy woman, stay the fuck away from me!

Save me, yeah

Save me, she's a liar
And I can't seem to untie the rope
She's got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control

Yeah, she's a liar
And I can't seem to untie the rope
She's got wrapped around her finger
I think I lost the last bit of my self control...
My self control
