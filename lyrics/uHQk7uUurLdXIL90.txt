No one's ever seen me like this
No one's ever seen you like this

Luck
Luck ran out
I lost the love
It run me down
Stopped being fun fun fun

So don't come round
Don't go waste your time
Waste my time

Won't get me outta bed
I'll be lying here
Can't be arsed to be there for a friend
Being there for a friend is something ain't done lately
Haven't seen ya lately

Oh we know
Shits not right no

No one's ever seen me like this
No one's ever seen you like this

Everybody
Hey!
What you wait...
So what you waiting for?
Hey!
Everybody

The TV shows you're done with it
The festivals you're done with it
The record sales I'm bored of hearing every downer
On a low
Oh we're so done this time

Swerved to miss that man
Time you crashed the van
Bust the windscreen
Almost broke your hand
Cost you half a grand
You been acting crazy
I been acting shady
Oh we are fucked this time
Fuck

Hey!
What you wait...
So what you waiting for?
Hey!
Everybody
'Cause it's a killer
Yeah it's a killer
'Cause it's a killer
It's a killer

No one's ever seen me like this
