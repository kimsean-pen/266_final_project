Sacrifice my vanity
Kick off my heels
A careless weight on your hatred
Understand it's so simple
A simple please
To keep the faithful on wounded knee

To the madness i do confess
I never see myself as blessed
(confused, unaddressed)
Like a saviour i do caress
The truth is boredom more or less
(unused, obsessed)

My time is only given up to you
Too much to choose
It's not mine to contemplate
If i can lose
With this blood on my shoes

Compromise in full extreme
Cut off my heels
Name a price on what's sacred
Guaranteed i've got something
A royal disease
Take a flood to clean these streets

To the madness i do confess
Forever see myself as blessed
(immune, obsessed)
Like a saviour i do caress
The truth is boredom, it's excess
(take more, give less)

My time is only given up to you
Too much to choose
It's not mine to contemplate if i can lose
With this blood on my shoes
