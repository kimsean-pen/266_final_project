In a fashion coat I float down my city
Don't you think I look pretty anymore
I'll do everything to you but I can hardly come
Cause I'm so afraid of you falling

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

I'm not stupid I swear
I read the foreign news to understand my nation
You get two options in The You Estates
Black city bloodbath or white country rape

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

Everywhere I am is just another thing without you in it
Everywhere I am is just another thing without you in it
Everywhere I am is just another thing without you in it
Everywhere I am is just another thing without you in it
