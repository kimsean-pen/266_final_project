Try to turn it off but it's hard to see
Through this emptiness slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less, then I can start to breathe
But still your heart is out of reach

What were we thinking
And what will we do now, hey
Right now, right now, right now, ooh

The sun hasn't shined today at all
A funny thing you haven't called
Tell me why or should I be asking?
How should I respond to it all

Times were good
I wish you were around more, I can feel you at my door
But it's not you, it's someone else
What can I do, ooh, what did we do

What were we thinking, baby
What will we do now, oh
Right now, right now, right now

And tell me you made up your mind
It wouldn't be the first time
See absurd, it's my own heart that hurts me
I'm a prime myself the fool, 'cause I fell in love with you

Oh, what were we thinking
Oh, and what will we do now, ooh
Right now, right now, right now, ooh

Try to turn it off but it's hard to see
Through this emptiness slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less then I can start to breathe
But still your heart is out of reach

What were we thinking
Oh, what can we do now, oh
Right now, right now, oh

Try to turn it off but it's hard to see
Through this emptiness slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less then I can start to breathe
But still your heart is out of reach, oh, oh

I should have known its was right in front of me
Screaming girl just walk away, see it can't ever be
We carried on making our mistakes, thinking love was free
Now you've taken part of me

Oh, what will we do now, baby
Right now
