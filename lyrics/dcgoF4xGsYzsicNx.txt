Hey baby are you listening?
I've battened all the hatches down
I've taken all of your prescriptions
But no remedy I've found

Counting the days
Yeah, until some freedom can scream my name
Counting the days
Yeah, until the gods break these chains

Hey baby are you watching?
I'm saddled in for your sideshow
I'm never one to become precious
'Cause life is so touch and go

Counting the days
Yeah, until some freedom can scream my name
Counting the days
Yeah, until the gods break these chains

Dig in, get in, dig in
What you're looking for
Dig in, get in, dig in
What you're searching for
Dig in, get in, dig in
Yeah, dig, yeah, dig

Counting the days
Yeah, until some freedom can scream my name
Counting the days
Yeah, until the gods break these chains

Counting the days
Yeah, until some freedom can scream my name
Counting the days
Yeah, until the gods break these chains

Break these chains
Break these chains
Break these chains
