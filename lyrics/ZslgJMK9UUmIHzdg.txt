Too much makes me lazy
Not enough and it makes me crazy
Too much makes me crazy
Not enough and it makes me lazy

Time stops just for a moment
Then again it's only an instant
Time stops just for an instant
Then again it's only a moment

They always keep themselves clean
Know what I mean?

You have to face them sooner or later
These tigers made of paper
Don't pay now
You have to pay later
Confront your tigers made of paper

They always keep themselves clean
I can't shake this feeling
Something's going to happen
