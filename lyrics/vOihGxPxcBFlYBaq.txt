I'm glad you are a girl
I'm pleased to know you
I like you for you
I'm happy you're growing up

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still sur- vur- vive
You are angry and that's okay

Forgetful or pretending
Tired, ill, or angry, or cold
More assured of what to do
But I do care for you (What a beautiful gift for me)

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay ... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay ... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay ... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out
