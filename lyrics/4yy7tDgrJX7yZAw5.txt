Aqualung, we were young
Dancing through the water
Like we could turn the tide
Just you and I

We always survive
Crash into each other
Like when two waves collide
But please don't let me drown?

Suffocating, water
Deep water, deep water
And if you drag me down
Aqualung breathe harder

Breathe harder, breathe harder
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Yeah please don't let me drown

Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Yeah please don't drag me down
Further and further and further we go

Deeper and deeper
We're lost in the storm
Yeah, yeah
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna breathe for my life

Aqualung
Put the anchor down
Deeper under ground
Lost in endless ocean

Where no one can be found
Drifting out of line
Floating on our backs
We ignore the warning, the red flag

Well please don't let me drown
Aqualung breathe harder
Breathe harder, breathe harder

Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Yeah please don't let me drown
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life

Yeah please don't drag me down
Further and further and further we go
Deeper and deeper, we're lost in the storm

Yeah, yeah
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna breathe for my life

Aqualung
Swim for my life, swim for my life
Yes I gotta swim for my life, swim for my life

Gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Swim for my life, swim for my life

Yes I gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life

Yeah, please don't drag me down
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna breathe for my life
Aqualung
