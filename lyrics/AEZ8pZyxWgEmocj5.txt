Talking to the moon with the lights down
Half a dozen ovals in your mouth, your muse
Kurosawa bleeding through your headphones
Knuckles in my back till your nails turn blue
Bet you remember back when I was headstrong
Tugging on the ends of my invisible noose
Thought you'd be jumping ship, but I was dead wrong
You can sail on thin ice long as I can too
Uh, if this love's an accident waiting to happen
Let's go out with a bang, with a bang
Uh, I'm up to go under
To drown with each other
Yeah, we both feel the same
Told me two years ago I was selfish
But you're the one who put us in the mushroom cloud
Liquor bottle saying what I'm thinking
Dancing in a minefield, don't look down
Uh, if this love's an accident waiting to happen
Let's go out with a bang, with a bang
Uh, I'm up to go under
To drown with each other
Yeah, we both feel the same
Doesn't matter
You jump, I jump, that's all we want
Doesn't matter
You jump, I jump, that's all we want
