Now did you hear the sound
Ascending from the ground
A prayer from those who stayed
Or died along the way

We trust the trembling air
To take us anywhere
Transcending gravity
And hoping that we'll be set free
(Set free)

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade away

I'm whispering your name
A memory set to flame
Like all I left behind
Becoming someone else
This time

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade away

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens

Unbound
Instantly
Airbourne
Aimlessly
We drift apart
To finally fade away

Fade away
