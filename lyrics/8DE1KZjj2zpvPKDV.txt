He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him
You might say he was born again.

You might say he found a key to ev'ry door.
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast, and it don't last for long.

But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight
Is softer than a lullaby
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains
He saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once
And he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude
The forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside
Himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply.

Rocky mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder
But his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing, he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
He knows he'd be a poorer man
If he never saw an eagle fly

Rocky mountain high
Colorado rocky mountain high

I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire
And everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
