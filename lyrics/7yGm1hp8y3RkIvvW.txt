what? wait.
the freckles in your face.
my head in outer space.
the devil in our frame.
and i couldn't believe, you were wasting your time with me.
i'll stay mute (cause i never find the words to say.)
and just stand still (cause you always find a way to slip away.)
i was lost. i was scared. i have always been this way.
i have always been afraid. forthcoming yet delayed.
"so reassemble and remake."
you and i walked together on the beach, no shoes on our feet,
and you said the sand underneath is like the people we might meet.
and "every single grain will some day be washed away."
and i should've felt lucky just to have washed up on your beach.
but i said "if im sand, what the oceans? the wind? and erosion? the lightning and the rain? and how come we feel pain?"
and i've realized i was so wrong once again. just misinterpreting everything you said...
