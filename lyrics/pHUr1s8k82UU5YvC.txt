Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up throught the water
I kept sinking down, down, down
I feel like I'm dying
I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was
Until you came around

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're goin' down

Take you down to the basement
You look around, 'round, 'round
We sit there in silence
I watch you go down, down, down
I feel like I'm flying
I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy
Until you came around

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're goin' down

You're goin down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're goin'
Down

Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're goin' down
Down, down, down

You're goin' down, down (doown)
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're goin' down
