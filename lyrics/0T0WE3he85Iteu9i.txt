So hard to say goodbye
Meaning it today
I've said goodbye before
Leaving you alone
By the sea
So hard to say goodbye

Hello, Sunshine
Come into my life
Hello, Sunshine
Come into my life

In honesty
It's been a while
Since we had reason
Left to smile
Helllo, Sunshine
Come into my life

I'm a minger
You're a minger too
So come on, minger
I want to ming with you

In honesty
It's been a while
Since we had reason
Left to smile
Hello, Sunshine
Come into my life

You're not so innocent
You're a disgrace to your country
If you fled a million miles
I'd chase you for a day
(If I could be bothered)
Hello, Sunshine
Hello, Sunshine
Hello, Sunshine
Hello, Sunshine
Hello, Sunshine
Come into my life
