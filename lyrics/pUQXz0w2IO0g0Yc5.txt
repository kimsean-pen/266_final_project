I've been spaced out
In an absent dream
That branched out of the thought

of you and me
It started out like a seed
And then it grew like a tree

Never joined at the hip, no
I barely see you or know you
But I feel like I do
Now I'm invested
I am captivated and consumed
Seems you're my latest muse

All of your love is way too much
for me to ask of you
But these thoughts are inescapable
When they're illustrating you falling through the floor when I walk in the room
Making your tired eyes widen and your cheeks turn rouge

And sure your taste and touch are two things that I want
But babe neither are what I ponder on the most
I see me heading out onto the road
As a temporary load
Such a vivid vision that makes me wanna know

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you want nobody's love and company but mine

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you never met a woman that made you feel this alive

I will lose my mind
I've come to find whenever in your presence
I am present
Imagination has me seated at your side
It's nothing short of bliss
It's the best thing in the worst way
Loving you like this
Loving you like this

Blazing street lights
Through the window glass
Your feet on the gas
Mine up on the dash
And though you're driving too fast
All the world is still

Imagery such as this is symptomatic
You can call me a fanatic
I'm an addict to what I can't ever want
Some would say this is fiction but it is not
I can get so high off a vivid picture that's occupying my mind

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you want nobody's love and company but mine

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you never met a woman that made you feel this alive

I will lose my mind
I've come to find whenever in your presence
I am present
Imagination has me seated at your side,
It's nothing short of bliss
It's the best thing in the worst way
Loving you like this

Loving you like this

Drive

All the world is still
Hands on the Wheel

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you want nobody's love and company but mine

Do you want to,
Do you want to,
Do you want to drive?
Say you never met a woman that made you feel this alive

And I will lose my mind
I'm fortified whenever in your presence
I am present
It'd be a pleasure to be seated at your side,
No it's nothing short of bliss,
It's the best thing in the worst way

It's the best thing, best thing x 3

It's the best thing in the worst way
Loving you like this
