Devil unkind always creeping in the blind
With shadows of the dearly departed
Planting the seed that in time will bloom to be
Trouble that will rip you apart

I cannot lie, I am barely holding on
Caught in the mire I've come to know for way too long
Drawn to the light but now the light is dead and gone
If there is a god why did he take my father's soul

I cannot fight this worried mind
In the end it's all my fault
The fate you find, you choose in time
When you draw the devil on the wall

Voices inside, they keep screaming in my head
A choir of anguish pulling me into the dark
A slow moving calm that I am needing left for dead
Solace to me, it seems to be so very far

I cannot fight this worried mind
In the end it's all my fault
The fate you find, you choose in time
When you draw the devil on the wall

The devil unkind always creeping in the blind
With shadows of the dearly departed
Planting the seed that in time will bloom to be
Trouble that will rip you apart

I cannot fight this worried mind
In the end it's all my fault
The fate you find, you choose in time
When you draw the devil on the wall
Yeah
When you draw the devil on the wall
Yeah
