It never was compatible but something made it flammable
We were young and so jealous and we let it all go to waste
Don't bother having a conscience, now stuff our life into bags
We were young and so jealous and we let it all

Fake the smallest version of myself
Can't shake this moment inside of my head
Duck in shame and sink into my shell
And play it over and over again until the favors end

Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
Feeling like you're fading, complaining and wasting away

I slip the sloppy g'day, the drink is always amazed
At how much I would like to let it control me
I make a pact with my friends we'll never lose a game again
Unless the shots I take are served from the bar

I'm about to dunk
You're telling me I'm the chosen one (But I'm stuck inside a funk)
But lately I've been the frozen one (I'm scared of getting punked)
You're telling me I'm the chosen one (So I'll become a drunk)
But lately I've been the frozen one

Stop that you ain't no friend of mine
We don't believe your lies
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door

Stop no need to apologize
No way to make it right
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door

It never was compatible but something made it flammable
We were young and so jealous and we let it all go to waste
Don't bother having a conscience, now stuff our life into bags
We were young and so jealous and we let it all

Fake the smallest version of myself
Can't shake this moment inside of my head
Duck in shame and sink into my shell
And play it over and over again until the favors end

Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
Feeling like you're fading, complaining and wasting away
