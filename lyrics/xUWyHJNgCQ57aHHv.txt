I read you,
And god I'm good at it, I'm so spot on,
Chord shapes in air,
Go press that dissonance, if you dare,
And you breathin' in,
Finesse an innocent, from her partying.

And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know.

What part of no,
Don't you understand? I've told you before,
So just get off my case,
This isn't happening, stop this now,
And I, where was I?
I have to be somewhere,
Now where did I put it?

And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know.

Is this it? Is it?
Is this it? Yeah,
Is it? No,
Is this it? No,
Is this it? No,
Is this it? No,
Is this it? Yes,
Hello we're back,
And we're taking calls,
Now what was the question?

And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling,
And I'm high enough from all the waiting,
To ride a wave on your inhaling.
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know,
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know,
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know.
