So it's Halloween
And you feel like dancin'
And you feel like shinin'
And you feel like letting loose

Whatcha gonna be?
Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day
Better plan all week, better plan all month, better plan all year

You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year you'll ever admit that
I can see your eyes, I can see your brain, baby, nothing's changed
I can see your eyes, I can see your brain, baby, nothing's changed

Because you're still hiding in a mask
Take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween
After Halloween

You'll go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months
"Remember what I did, remember what I was, back on Halloween?"

But what's in between
Where are your ideas?
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not everyday, are you so afraid, what will people say?
Why not everyday, are you so afraid, what will people say?

After Halloween
After Halloween
After Halloween

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through

But what will the boss say to you?
And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street they might glare at you
And what do you know you're pretty self-conscious too?
So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed

Why don't you take your social regulations, shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations, shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations, just shove 'em
Up your ass?
