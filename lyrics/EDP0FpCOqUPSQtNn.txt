Come on, come down
and cut me open, open
Come on, calm down
and sew me shut like before
shut like before
And you push your way and it's always the same
The stars look different, never like last night's
You - Just like cosmic, just like magic
Getting me the same way
Come home, come on
I'm way too old for all your rough games
Tough luck kid go on
