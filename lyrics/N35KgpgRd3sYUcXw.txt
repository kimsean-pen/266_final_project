Over, over, don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over, don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over, steady breakin' me on down, ooh
Break, breakdown, steady breakin' me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breakin' me on down

You call yesterday to basically say that you care for me
But that you're just not in love immediately, I pretended
To feel similarly and led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the thing that's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually, I'm dying inside

Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through

Do you cling to your pride and sing, "I will survive"?
(Gotta get control and roll, roll, roll on)
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave leave this way"?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?

Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
(Break, breakdown, steady breakin' me on down)
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile, gradually I'm dying inside

Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

Gonna break ya down, down, down, only if ya let it everyday
(Don't let it)
Crazy situations rockin' my mind, tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it
If ya feel the same way that I do, then let me help y'all

All singin' tunes, sayin',
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, yeah"
Hopin' for the sun but it looks like
rain, P.O.D'ed but it's still the same
Came far but it's been a long road
Trouble's gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on

Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall, it's over
It's endin' here, I said it's over, it's endin' here
(Here, here)
So I'll be on my way and maybe we can meet up in the future one day

But for now I'm bailin', bailin', bailin', baby, gotta get up
Can't take no more, I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into a thug humble eye
Tell me, if we lived a lie, would our souls unite?

Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray the Lord for Him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm goin' through lately
Breaks me down, set me free, let me be, let me be

Who else do I have to rely on? Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on?
Can I get my vibe on? While you look into my eyes
You won't underestimate and this soldier story
I'm'a tell you right now I'm fed up

Wrong if I let my lead bust? Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
I'm a stress you through it, if it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over

Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside

Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry.
