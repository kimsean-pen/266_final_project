Up close and personal
Study your body
I wanna stay right here
With your arms around me

Hold you like I do
Show me all of you, oh
I'll show you me too

Give it to you like it never been kissed
Like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never done this
Like you've never been touched

Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never been
Give it to you like it never been, oh
Give it to you like it never been, oh

Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never been
Give it to me like it never been

Deeper than physical
I got you open
Know how to take you there
Put you in motion

Hold you like I do
Show me all of you, oh
I'll show you me too

Give it to you like it never been kissed
Like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never done this
Like you've never been touched

Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never been
Give it to me like it never been

There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you
There's nobody like you

Give it to you like it never been kissed
Like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never done this
Like you've never been touched

Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never been
Give it to you like it never been kissed

Like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never done this
Like you've never been touched

Like nobody else exists, except for us
Give it to you like it never been loved
Give it to you like it never been
Give it to me like it never been
