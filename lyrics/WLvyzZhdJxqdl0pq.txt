This is my open letter
This is something to remember
I won't be buried before my time
I'm not searching for forever
I've got my eyes opened wide

I've been searching under rubble from your past
Just looking for a reason to make your life last
No need to look skyward for you to find hope
No need for redemption to be saved from the rope

(Fuck, no!)

Well, I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'Cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears
Let me give you my life, let me give you my fears

Just so you can hold on and sing while I do
Sing these words out so loud, like I sing them for you
This is your open letter, something to remember
We can still keep on fighting even though life is not forever

Well, I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'Cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears
Let me give you my life, let me give you my fears

This is my open letter
This is something to remember
This is my open letter
I'm not searching for forever

Well, I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'Cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears
Let me give you my life, let me give you my fears

One more time!

I'm not searching the sky for a reason to live
'Cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears
Let me give you my life, let me give you my fears
