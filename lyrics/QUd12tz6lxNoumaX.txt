Oh I wish I was the sparrow in your kid's eye
Like a fly above is summer all day long
On an island in the heart he has to carry
Past the many you have let into your song

And I said oh my lord why am i not strong
Like the wheel that keeps travelers traveling on
Like the wheel that will take you home

And in the forest someone is whispering to a tree now
This is all I am so please don't follow me
And it's your brother in the shaft that I'm swinging
Please let the kindness of forgetting set me free

And he said oh my lord why am I not strong
Like the wheel that keeps travelers traveling on
Like the wheel that will take you home

And on this Sunday someone's sititng down to wonder
Where the hell among these mountains will I be?
There's a cloud behind the cloud to which I'm yelling
I could hear you sneak around so easily

And I said oh my lord why am I not strong
Like the branch that keeps hangman hanging on
Like the branch that will take me home
