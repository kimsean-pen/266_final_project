Now she sits by the riverside
Watching the waters glide by
With a sigh
And the things she put faith in
Are ripples just waving her by
With a sigh

She sees lovers pass by with much more than a kiss
Ah this - is a girl who had everything
Find she's nothing at all

Now the wind seems so cold
Seems all old as it laughs at her fears
And her tears
And as ducks swim away from her
Visions of past love appear
In her tears

She sees love in his face as she tells him to go
And so - here's a girl who had everything
Find she's nothing at all

What would she say if she saw him, yeah
Now that she's gone, man, you're losing, yeah
Now you can see what she's seeing, yeah
For sure she's more than just choosing

Now she sits by the riverside
Watching the waters glide by
With a sigh
And the things she put faith in
Are ripples just waving her by
With a sigh

She sees lovers pass by with much more than a kiss
Ah this - is a girl who had everything
Finds she's nothing at all
