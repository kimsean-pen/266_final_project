I could I would

Get out the wood works
Man, my knees hurt (ahh)
All the way to the bottom of the big bad world with my feet first
I don't see her I just am her
(To go)
For the rich folks
To pay for the unpaid
I don't wanna back space neither
I need to feed a so-co
Someone really need to go global
But I don't drive no more (?)
Man, I'm just still so local
This is me
They don't pay my achievements
Less they pay me on TV, what happened to me?
I never thought I'd actually
Ever find the passion to be
Me
One-hundred like two fifties
In the back on as a man, that's a man's wallet

Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he
Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he

If I go other way, other way (other way)
I'd amount everyday, everyday
Life won't be on repeat
Won't find me on the keys
I'll be in new, in heat
Can't handle the law, you see
Ain't nobody have to pay for me
Ain't nobody have to pay for me

(Maybe I just need to get away from home for a while
I can feel a little bit o' Satan from inside, you know)

Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he
Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he

Too cool for the effort
All that talk is expected
I wanna say ‘off record'
I'm ‘bout to be the man in these streets
Might go Peter Pan and fly free
Don't want bigger chains or Gucci
Big money might make you the man you see, you'll see
One hell of a wise guy
You've got a heavily bright mind
But still, just settle for Five Guys
You didn't wanna go deep
But, fortunately
I came to mess up your sleep
I came to pull off your sheets

(I wanna-I wanna-I wanna-I wanna see you)
Not through the peep-hole, baby
Don't wanna pree you
Nope, I believe you
You know I believe in you, yeah

Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he
Sometimes the thing you need is just some time for yourself
Get up, get out
Go find your peace, but you wouldn't be free
If not for he
