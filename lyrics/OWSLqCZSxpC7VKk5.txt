Would you jump if I told you,
You could never lose?
An empty house, glass walls
Caving through the roof
Mama told me not to play with
Glass when I was young
Held on tight, waiting for my
Hands to come undone
Broke my skin, broke my heart,
Broke the wall near the TV room

Is it nothing new?
Is it nothing to you?

Shackled to the back of your headboard
Hoping you would fall down into me, crash into me
Won't you love me now? Fucking love me now
It's all broken, unspoken
Just breathe me in, taste me on your lips
You can let me go, if you need to let me go

Fucking love me now
Love me now, love me now

If I told you I was broken, would you love me still?
Shattered hearts, crossed stars, never saw myself
True lovers never cover up each others scars
Fucked me over once or twice, yeah, who's counting scars?
Shut my eyes, shut my mouth, shut the door to our little home

Is it nothing new?
Is it nothing to you?

Shackled to the back of your headboard
Hoping you would fall down into me, crash into me
Won't you love me now? Fucking love me now
It's all broken, unspoken
Just breathe me in, taste me on your lips
You can let me go, if you need to let me go

Fucking love me now
Fucking love me now
Love me now, love me now
Fucking love me now
Fucking love me now
Love me now, love me now
(Ooh)

Shackled to the back of your headboard
Hoping you would fall down into me, crash into me
Won't you love me now? Fucking love me now
It's all broken, unspoken
Just breathe me in, taste me on your lips
You can let me go, if you need to let me go

Fucking love me now
Fucking love me now
Love me now, love me now
Fucking love me now
Fucking love me now
Love me now, love me now

Won't you love me now?
Fucking love me now
It's all broken, unspoken
