Experience babe
Kickin' stones and cans
Experience babe
Cigarette-stained hands

It's not too late
Hear it in the wind
It's not too late for you
Feel passion creepin' in

Intoxication
Familiar smells of the hotels
Infatuation
Of knowing who you are

You and I, You and I
You and I
Arrow through my heart
Catch a star

Isolation
Rows and rows of cars
Isolation
Like Jupiter and Mars

Staring faces
Set in celluloid
Welcome to the late show
Starring Null and Void

Complications
Things get in the way
Sweet sensation
Of knowing you are near and not too far

You and I, You and I
You and I
Arrow through your heart
Catch a star

You and I, You and I
You and I, You and I
You and I, You and I
You and I
Freeway through your heart
Catch a star
Catch a star
Catch a star
