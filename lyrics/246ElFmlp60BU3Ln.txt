Ah!
When we go numb
Ah!

When we come down
High up on this chasin'
Hardly moving but it feels right

(Fe-Fe-Fe-Feels Right)
(Fe-Fe-Fe-Feels Right)
(Fe-Fe-Fe-Feels Right)
(Fe-Fe-Fe-Feels)

Drift away
The haze slows down the pulse
Latency
A mind of cruise control

What you want?
What you need?
Well I'll give you all or nothing
What you want?
What you need?
Is what I've got, trust me

Static

Static
Moves
Uh!
Static
Static
Stuck
on
You
Static
Static
Moves
Uh!
Moves
Uh!

We escape
We're lying on the moon
Stay awake
To see the naked truth

What you want?
What you need?
Well I'll give you all or nothing
What you want?
What you need?
Is what I've got, trust me
