I'm about to break you
Ha-ha-ha

This is not a love song
Hunny if you want one better turn it off
Everything was working
Hunny when we kissed and never spoke at all
Slammin' doors and breakin' plates
Somethin' else I'd rather break
Johnny boy, it's time to take it like a man-man-man

Kiss the boys and make 'em cry
Make 'em cry, make 'em cry
Don't need your heart 'cause I got mine
I got mine, I got mine

Take my love
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard
Take my love (take my love)
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you

Boom boom smash
Boom boom crash
Boom boom smash
Boom boom crash

Drama, drama
Call your momma
Take the caddy keys, and go
Feels like we are stuck here in a badly written TV show
Slammin' doors and breakin' plates
Somethin' else I'd rather break
Johnny boy, it's time to take it like a man-man-man

Kiss the boys and make 'em cry
Make 'em cry, make 'em cry
Don't need your heart 'cause I got mine
I got mine, I got mine

Take my love
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard
Take my love (take my love)
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard?
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you (ha-ha-ha)

Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy (sit down, hold still)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy (it'll only hurt for a moment)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy (and before you even open your eyes)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy (i'ma break you hard)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy (i'll be gone)

Take my love
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard
Take my love
Before I go
'Cause you should know
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard
Break you hard
I'm about to break you
