One life, one decision
One life, one decision

One life, one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living

How does it feel at the bottom of the barrel?
All your friends don't care no your friends don't care at all

How does it feel at the bottom of the barrel?
All your friends don't care no your friends don't care at all
Rejected, rejected
You're never gonna be the one respected

Infected, infected
This is the way that every life is ended

No, no, this life won't swallow me whole
No, no, this life won't swallow me whole
If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track
To laying face down from a heart attack

One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Make sure it ends with you still living
One life, one decision

One life, one decision
One life, one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
You're never gonna touch the surface

I sure hope it's worth it
You can lie to everybody around you

But you can't lie to the hole inside you
No, no, this life won't swallow me whole
No, no, this life won't swallow me whole
If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track

To laying face down from a heart attack
One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Make sure it ends with you still living

One life, one decision
One life, one decision
One life, one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track
To laying face down from a heart attack
One life & one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Make sure it ends with you still living
