The window looks onto the garden
and the smallest roof of our house
you bring the roof down on my head
You and I get kept on the haunted roof

My body, body, eyes, you look into, look into

The window looks onto the garden
and the smallest roof of our house
you bring the roof down on my head
You and I get kept on the haunted roof
