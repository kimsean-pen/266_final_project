I spin shoes, spin shoes
There with a stare searching my brain
The secret is to hide in silence
Secret is to forget the violence

I gain and lose without belief
I search and see, search and see
It uses minor incline
Never fine, never fine
Never fine, never fine
Never fine, never fine
Never fine, never fine

I slid in glue, slid in glue
I recall all the good I do do
The secret is to hide in silence
The secret is my inner violence
