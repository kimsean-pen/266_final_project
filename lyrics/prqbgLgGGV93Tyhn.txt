For better or for worse
Our vision of the future's getting blurred
Between the black & white
Naming every shade of grey has left us colourblind

We are
All for none & none for all
We are
The sickness & the symptom & the cure

We are
All for none & none for all
We are
The sickness & the symptom & the cure

So close your eyes
Let the colours fly
& hide from the noise outside
We're colourblind

From the black & white
But we've never burned so bright
It's weighing on my mind
Did we forget the way a diamond shatters light?

A sight for weary eyes
The colours of the twilight rise & bridge the great divide
We are
All for none & none for all

We are

The sickness & the symptom & the cure
We are

All for none & none for all
We are
The sickness & the symptom & the cure
So close your eyes
Let the colours fly
& hide from the noise outside.
We're colourblind
From the black & white
But we've never burned so bright
Set fire to the sun
Let the colours run
So close your eyes
Let the colours fly
We're colourblind
From the black & white
So close your eyes
Let the colours fly
& hide from the noise outside
We're colourblind
From the black & white
But we've never burned so bright
