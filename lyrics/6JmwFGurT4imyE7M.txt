Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming beautiful exterior.
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect posture
But you're barely scraping by, but you're barely scraping by.

Well this is one time, well this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you've come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness.
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect makeup
But you're barely scraping by, but you're barely scraping by.

Well this is one time, well this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you've come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.

And you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you've come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.
