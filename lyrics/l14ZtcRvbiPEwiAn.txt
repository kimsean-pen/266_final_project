I ain't got no time, no
'Cause when this day is gone
I still got shit to run
I could make it for you
'Cause you're so beautiful
I'd rather drink you up

Honey, on your knees
When you look at me
I'm dressed like a fucking queen
And you're begging 'please'
I rule with the velvet tongue
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost, but I'm having fun
Holy, (holy), holy, yeah
Holy, (holy), holy, (holy)

'Cause I could lose it all
Can't watch it fade to black
Can't let it end like that
'Cause I got power aura
Won't let it all fall down
I got my guards all around

Honey, on your knees
When you look at me
I'm dressed like a fucking queen
And you're begging 'please'
I rule with the velvet tongue
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost, but I'm having fun
Holy, (holy), holy, yeah
Holy, (holy), holy, (holy)

What I'm saying, saying
What I'm saying to you
What I'm saying, saying
What I'm saying

Honey, on your knees
When you look at me
I'm dressed like a fucking queen
And you're begging 'please'
I rule with the velvet tongue
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost but I'm having fun
Holy, (holy), holy, yeah
Holy, (holy), holy, (holy)
