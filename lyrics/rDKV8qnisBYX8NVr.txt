This asset, a chameleon, a million eyes ripping in places
settle down to find cold places, you live your life on a broken face
her majesty following me to control this impurity
our machines that never taught you how to love or be free
containment, containment, isolation, a fair call
your weeping soul lost in futility of this rightous way to be
so hold yourself, so cry till death
and your hands ripping up everything that you ever loved
She can't see the light, a vision not so bright
she put me in this hole, a seeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something i must give
a putrid parasite, she thinks she's always right
she cannot see a night, her future burns so bright
she put me in this hole, a creeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something i must give
a putrid parasite, she thinks she's always right
Freeze on a balcony of this stage covered in broken glass
that scrapes up all the sands of your time running low
why did you sell your soul?
why did you let me go?
i never understood this game so please refrain from tormenting me
She can't see the light, a vision not so bright
she put me in this hole, a seeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something i must give
a putrid parasite, she thinks she's always right
she cannot see a night, her future burns so bright
she put me in this hole, a creeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something i must give
a putrid parasite, she thinks she's always right
i must be out of time, i could be out of life
i must out of time, i could be out of mind
i must be out of my mind, i cannot see this light
i don't know why this is, i cannot give to live
