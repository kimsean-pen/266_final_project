Here we are with our backs against the wall
We've got big city dreams
But we don't move from the asphalt
We run away from our own imagination

But at the same time we got this amazing fascination
We've got hopes on the horizon
We can't stop climbing the mountain
We're sick and tired of keeping silent

We are, we are, we are
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together, now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face

So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together, now
Who are they, with their so-called innovations

They hold on like they've found their own salvation
They shy away from the slightest alteration
But at the same time we got the same fascinations
We've got hopes on the horizon

We can't stop from climbing the mountain
We're sick and tired of keeping silent
We are, we are, we are
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together, now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down

'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face

So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together, now
Just let go, it's a free fall

We're almost home, it's a free fall
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together, now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
We are gonna come together
We're gonna come together, now
We are gonna run together
We're gonna turn it upside down
'Cause with the smoke in the mirror
I can't see your face
So let's run to the fire escape
Come together
We're gonna come together, now
