I'll be sitting on the left side
You'll be sitting on the right
Dying to share our problems
Make everything alright
Then I see a darkness
You see the blinding light
Will Oldham's in the corner moaning
Can't you write your own lines

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid cause here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

There's a dozen corpses on the left side
I swear ones smiling at me
Compliments on your confessions baby
Wow you really showed me
You think you're full of conviction
Really you're just trying to survive
Tie them up then slit them out
It's good to help the boy shine

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid cause here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid cause here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid cause here it comes
You're not the lucky ones
You're not the lucky ones
You're not the lucky ones
