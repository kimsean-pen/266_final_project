Living by myself
Paranoid as hell
There's nothing I can do
Yesterday's tomorrow
My dreams are never true
But somehow
I keep on lovin' you

Emotions are attached
'Cause something happened that
No one can help
I broke out of my shell
Just to find that
That I don't belong
I broke out of my shell
Just to find that

I'm living by myself
Paranoid as hell
There's nothing I can do
But somehow
I'll keep on lovin' you

I keep on lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh oooh
Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh oooh
Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh
I keep on Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh Oh Oh
Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh oooh
Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh oooh
Lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh oooh
I keep on lovin' you
Oh oooh Oh Oh Oh
