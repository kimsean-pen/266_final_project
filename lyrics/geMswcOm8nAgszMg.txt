All the locals hide their tears of regret
Open fire 'cause I love you to death
Sky high with a heartache of stone
You'll never see me 'cause I'm always alone

I'm in love without a trace of dissent
I'll buy the torture 'cause you pay for the rent
Tied high with a broken command
You're all alone in the promised land

I'm in love with this malicious intent
You've been taken but you don't know it yet
What you will know must never live to be found
'Cause it's a subject in the eyes of the clown

What we are looking at
Is good and evil, right and wrong
A new world order

A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
We're not about to make that same mistakes right

A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
