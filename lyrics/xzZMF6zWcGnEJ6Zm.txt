Uh, bag-flippin', cash-trippin', pull up
Beat the block like a ass whoopin'
Stash box, keep the smashing, racks in it
Bought that bitch a Fashion Nova dress just to see her ass in it
Twerk for my Instagram
She just got a hundred missed calls, it's her man, damn
Oh that's your nigga now, huh?
Said you wasn't with him, now you with him now, huh?
Things different now, huh?
You committed now, huh?
Guess I can't hit it how I hit now, huh?
Don't hit me when ya nigga ain't around
There's money to be made bitch, I won't wait around
I flex on her for fun, but I do not play around
"S" on my chest and I keep a cape around
Gang gang with me, yeah I keep like eight around
Even when you think they ain't around, they around

Woah, woah, woah, we ain't playing fair
Oh no, no, you don't want to take it there
Thinkin' 'bout my next move in my thinking chair
This chip is on my shoulder and it's stayin' there
'Cause I been through a lot of bull
And they can't stand me 'cause I'm misunderstood
And I need a bad bitch just to give her good good
Ya girl, I like to eat, I hope you like to cook, cook
Used to get the works from my cousin, WupWup
Where the foul, free the guys out the woop woop

Teacher said you'll never make it
Turn my textbook to a checkbook
I put food on the table
And I did that without a cookbook
I'm rich and they fucking hate it
And while they looking mad, I'm just looking good

Ay, I feel like flexin'
Bitches call my phone
Don't feel like textinf
My Louis clothes that's French, that's what I'm dressed in
Dior my cologne, she said my scent is her obsession
I became possessive, soon as the money came in my possession
I'm selfish, no question
My alarm is set to every second, no resting
My haters spend a lot of time with me,
I'm their bestfriend
I'm their bestfriend
Go bestfriend, go bestfriend, go bestfriend
Go bestfriend, go bestfriend

Aye, teacher said you'll never make it
Turn my textbook to a checkbook
I put food on the table
And I did that without a cookbook
I'm rich and they fucking hate it
And while they looking mad, I'm just looking good
Huh, aye, and while they looking mad, I'm just looking good
