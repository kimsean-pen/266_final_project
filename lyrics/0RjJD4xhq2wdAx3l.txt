Something here, it never looked right
We've been fighting on the front lines for so long
I go digging in a graveyard
To find the remnants of your heart but it's gone

And I won't make for my revenge
I will seek to see the end
And I won't sing a battle cry
I will let the sleepers lie

Sing, Oh, Whoa
Crash the gates, light a fire and watch it burn
Sing, Oh, Whoa
Storm the walls, light a fire and watch it burn
Sing, Oh

Now it's quiet all around us
Smoke rising from the ground up and I stare
You go digging in a graveyard
But the remnants of my heart are nowhere

And I won't crave to feel contempt
I will faithfully forget
And I won't claim a victory
I will revel silently

Sing, Oh, Whoa
Crash the gates, light a fire and watch it burn
Sing, Oh, Whoa
Storm the walls, light a fire and watch it burn
Sing, Oh...
Sing, Oh, Whoa
Crash the gates, light a fire and watch it burn
Sing, Oh, Whoa
Storm the walls, light a fire and watch it burn
