You send up the ladder
Down without a rope
Was the only time it mattered
Ow, when I was broke
Then you're my second nature
A-coming over me
And though I might be shakin'
I'm standing on my feet
Goin' 'round in circles
Pickin' out a cue
Travelin' with no memory
Ow, in my shoe
Down don't bother me
If the music say
You can take a picture baby
Time won't care
And you're my second nature
A-coming over me
And though I might be shakin'
Down don't bother me no more
Down don't bother me no more
Down don't bother me no more
Down don't bother me no more
