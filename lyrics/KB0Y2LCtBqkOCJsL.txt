For a moment silence break
Glimpse of hope and dreams awake
Ancient fable told of creatures in the sky

When the bell begins to strike
Beasts to wield the silver light
Give the majesty a toll for all the might

Save your passion for glory nights
And the strength to carry on
In sickness and hell in the magical spell of life

For the heroes of history
To the land of islands
Bid farewell to a mystery
They'll never come back
Present and past in a future dream
In a land of everlasting
Pick your weapon
Poison and greed and the fire that it feeds
A blessing in sorcery

See the blade begins to shine
In the hand of all divine
Mage and sorcerer of all the things we praise

Hear them whisper underground
Trolls and gargoyles by the pound
Sea without a shore and ship without a sail

Save your passion for glory nights
And the strength to carry on
In sickness and hell in the magical spell of life

For the heroes of history
To the land of islands
Bid farewell to a mystery
They'll never come back
Present and past in a future dream
In a land of everlasting
Pick your weapon
Poison and greed and the fire that it feeds
A blessing in sorcery

In a past life on a dark night
Silver dagger in the moonlight
Into battle raining fire
Darker forces aiming higher
In the final hour force awaken
For the sacred order blood forsaken
Kneel to my defenders my immortals
Darker powers call

For the heroes of history
To the land of islands
Bid farewell to a mystery
They'll never come back
Present and past in a future dream
In a land of everlasting
Pick your weapon
Poison and greed and the fire that it feeds
A blessing in sorcery
