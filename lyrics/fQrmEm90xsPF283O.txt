'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

Silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
One more, one more

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough

Say one more, one more, one more

Silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries

Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
(One more, one more)

We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held my vision
When ya gonna say my name
When ya gonna say my name
A quick charade
Beyonc√©
Lemonade
When ya gonna say my name

When ya gonna say my name
No delay
No half-way
Lemme hear you say
One more, one more, one more
