And we will fall back into the ocean

The mountain tops are hard to see
They tell how far you really are from me
The clouds are thick
But they can't hide you
They can't hide you from me

Some things are...
Some things are here to kill me
Can you feel it now?
We're burning up
Amongst your flames
Amongst your love, our life

You're like the sun (I am in the earth)
And I am earth
Together we're one (It's where you'll find me)
But someday your fire will die
And I'll grow cold without sunlight

And I will freeze, baby (You, you're in the sky)
I will die (It's where you'll find me)
I'd freeze
I'd die for you

One thing I know you didn't know was how to
Fall head first hand in hand into the ocean blue
We count down, take a breath, and jump
We're falling
You scream: "Baby, we're simply growing!"
I think, baby, I wouldn't mind to die like this

I may not say everything that's on my mind
I am in the earth
It's where you'll find me
You're in the sky
From you

Don't fret, baby, we're simply growing
And my darling, I wouldn't mind to die like this
Don't fret, baby, we're simply growing
Don't fret, babe, the sun is coming
