Fly, navigate, communicate
You remember, still,
All the words I've chosen wrong
The hand of time, it seems to accelerate
My hour of wolf
Morning flight will slice the sky
I would like to stay but can't today
Talking is flaunting
Silence is so taunting
The word I don't say has its own gravity
Fly, navigate, communicate
If you dare.
I will abdicate
All rights to say when things feel wrong
The gate's closed for the day, turn, go away
Passport in one hand...
Exit the strange land
Things you have not planned...
Words have their meaning, like salt in the sea
For once I'm doing things right
I won't communicate in turbulent times,
But will navigate and fly
I'm trying to land in the sea, but the sea is on fire
Now we have to brace for the impact,
We'll crash in the sea of bittersweet depravity
I can't fly
I can't navigate
Refuse to communicate
oh, I tried today...
We can't fly
We can't navigate
We fail to communicate
We're afraid to care
