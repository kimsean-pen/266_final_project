Nations falling
To defeat
Warheads
Crushing the Earth
Cries of help
Burning flesh
Suffocation
No way out

Suffering
Deep in our minds
After World
Obliteration

Suffering
Deep in our minds
After World
Obliteration

Super Powers
Threat of war
Politicians
Nothing gain
Society
Pay the price
World wide
Dream is gone
