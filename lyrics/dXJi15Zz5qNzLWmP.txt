Thought that I'd forget about it
But I can't seem to kick the habit
I can't hear over all this racket
Never shoulda called, so just go and tell your friends about it
I said some things I wish I hadn't
I wish that we could talk about it
Don't think I can live without you, banging on your door
Screaming: you're the only way I'll have it

When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time
Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do

I still have your denim jacket
The one with the Madonna graphic
I sit around and pout
See it laying on the couch
'Cause I guess you just forgot to pack it
Everyone I've asked about it
Has said you're doing fine, I doubt it
So go ahead and laugh about it, banging on your door
Screaming: you're the only way I'll have it

When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time
Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do

So much on my mind
(Since I came alive)
Back in ninety-five
(Maybe you were right)
All I seem to find is a universe of thought
(But just do what you're taught)
I'm sorry I cannot
(The feelings that I fought)
They're all here to stay so I'll take one on the chin
(I'll start over again)
Better than I've been
(Break before I bend)
I guess that all depends, can I find a way alone?
(Pencil or the stone)
Before my time runs out
(I really need you now)
You're the only way I'll have it

When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time

Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do
I hope you feel blue
Less than I do

Less than I do
Less than I
