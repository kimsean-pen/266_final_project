In this old house, I'm not alone
In a bedroom, a telephone
You made the call and I just stood by
I stripped the sheets and emptied out the sty

And the crowds, they light the carnival
Calling us, calling us
And all they want, another voice
To lead us on, lead us on, lead us on

Even wasting the time with you
Doesn't matter if I think it through
You took the car around the bend
And ran it in the ground, let's pretend

And the crowds, they light the carnival
Calling us, calling us
And all we ask, another voice
To lead us on, lead us on, lead us on

I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
