You were working hard baby
Sending me to sleep with your young's
They were scrapping in the yard
Handing out the jobs
Something I could do to you
Watching as you threw me to them
Severing the dreams of you

Something I could do to you
You make me up a weak looking boo
Your shoulder isn't way up high
And friends they take you on a ride
And show you a good time
But some things get through
And I forget how new

Salt is in the sink
Shaking like a tear
From your little aching
You're coming home your coming back to me

Something I could do to you
You make me up a weak looking boo
Your shoulder isn't way up high
And friends they take you on a ride
And show you a good time
And show you a good time
A good time

Yeah
