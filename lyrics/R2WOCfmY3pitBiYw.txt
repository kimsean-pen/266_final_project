I don't know how to say this
But I have to go
There's nothing I could say to you
You don't already know
It's not as if we grew apart
It's just that you got old
You always tried to keep me warm
But I've never felt this cold

And I'm sorry I can't tell you
That I love you anymore
Or that I care about you more now
Than I ever did before
If you can hear my crying
Then I'm sorry if it hurts
Although your pain has lifted
I feel worse

I hope you can see us
From your castle in the clouds
You were brave until the very end
And you made us all so proud
I can feel you fading
And it's ruining my soul
Just stay with me
I don't want to be alone

You were more than just a heart beat
You were a partner and a friend
I will carry you in my heart
Until the bitter end
And when I finally fall down
I promise you will live on
You will never be forgotten
Even though you are gone

And I'm sorry I can't tell you
That I love you anymore
Or that I care about you more now
Than I ever did before
If you can hear my crying
Then I'm sorry if it hurts
Although your pain has lifted
I feel worse

I want to stay this warm forever
I want to be this close to heaven
