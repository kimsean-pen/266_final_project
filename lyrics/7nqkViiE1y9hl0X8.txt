Take your hands away from your face
So I can see everything you are
And everything you used to be
You used to be to me
Something you don't want to be, I know

You, you're like the sun
And I am earth
Together we're one
But someday your fire will die
And I'll grow cold without sunlight

And I will freeze, baby
I will die
I'd freeze
I'd die for you

Things, they always die
Just give it time
They always die
But we, someday we'll see
Our love will shine
Our love will shine

Your love won't fade, darling
Lover, I cannot do this alone
Things like these are better off untold
Someday the sun will die and I'll grow cold
I hope someday your love finds its way home

'Cause you are the sun
And I am the earth
You are the sun and I...
