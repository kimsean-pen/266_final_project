Mike WiLL Made-It
Drive my heart into the night (night, night, night)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love, without it

You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then
What'd you say forever for?
If forever is out the door
I'll ignore when you call

Drive my heart into the night (yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
I don't want to leave home
Without your love, without it
(Oohh, oohh, oohh, oohh)

You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you, yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

Drive my heart into the night (night, night, night)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (morning, morning, morning)
I don't want to leave home (leave home without your love)
Without your love
Without it (without it)

(Oh, ooh, hey)
(Oohh, oohh, oohh, oohh)
(Oohh, oohh, oohh)
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you let me on (me on)
I thought you would be there when I go (I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished, all I know all the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there done that (done that, done that)
Drive my heart into the night (night, yeah, yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home (home)
Without your love
Without it, oh
