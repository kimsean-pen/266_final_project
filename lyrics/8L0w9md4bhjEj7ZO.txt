I don't mind all the time we had to spend
I don't mind that you'd do it all again
I don't mind the things that you said
But I would've rather not known
I don't mind the things that we did
I don't like it, I guess it happened back then
I don't mind where you've been
But I would've rather not known
You said, I need you
(I don't need you)
I don't think I need you
(I don't think so)
Maybe we just can't let it go
You said, I want you
(I don't want you)
I don't think I want you
(I don't think so)
Maybe we just can't let it go
I don't mind all the time we had to spend
I don't mind that you'd do it all again
I don't mind the things that we said
I miss you every time I go home
You said, I need you
(I don't need you)
I don't think I need you
(I don't think so)
Maybe we just can't let it go
You said, I want you
(I don't want you)
Maybe I don't think I want you
(I don't think so)
Maybe we just can't let it go
Maybe we just can't let it go
