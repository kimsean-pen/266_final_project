I don't need no one to tell me
How to feel the beat
And I don't need no beat to tell me
How to move my feet

Just go and do what you do
'Cause there's nothing to prove
I'm just being me
W-watch me, do me

I don't need no magazine to tell me
Who to be
And I don't need to pose
For p-p-paparazzi

Just keep the cameras flashing
To try to catch this action
I'm just being me
W-watch me, do me (me, me, me!)

Light up the floor!
Play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the high high let the base vibrate
Feel the room rock

Light up the floor!
Just like before
Let me hear that
Base-drop from the boombox, make your heart stop!
Feel the room rock

I'm doing all I wanna do
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me
Watch me, do me, me, me

Watch me, do me, me, me
Watch me, watch-

I don't need no music
When I wanna sing a song (w-watch me)
I don't need miss popular
To know what's right or wrong (w-watch me)

I'm busy burning the track
Not holding anything back!

I'm just being me
W-watch me, do me (me, me, me!)

Light up the floor!
Play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the high high let the base vibrate
Feel the room rock

Light up the floor!
Just like before
Let me hear that
Base-drop from the boombox make your heart stop!
Feel the room rock

I'm doing all I wanna do, ooh...
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me
Watch me, do me

I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready to go, let's go!
Let, let it
Let, let, let it explode, yeah!
I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready to go
(Go, go, go, go!)
To go, to go!

Light up the floor!
Play me one more, (play me one more)
Let me hear that
Click clack on the high high let the base vibrate
Feel the room rock

Light up the floor!
Just like before (j-j-j-just like before)
Let me hear that
Base-drop from the boombox make your heart stop!
Stop! Hahaha...

I'm doing all I wanna do, (all I wanna do...)
And I won't stop until I can't move
I'm just being me
Watch me, do me, me, me!

Watch me, do me, me, me!
Watch me, watch me!
