It's time for something
It's time for change
It's time to get things re-arranged
Oh yeah

The summer heat
Has been getting to me
And last summers love
Is gone, gone, gone

I've been saving my love for a rainy day
And it's really coming down today!

Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
You can make a broken heart go away

I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it
On the summer rain

Yeah, Yeah
I'm gonna blame it
On the summer rain

I'm blind to some things
Yeah blind as love
But I can see us giving it up
When you're next to me
Butterflies are flying
I know everything is fine, fine, fine, fine

I've been saving my love for a rainy day
And now I'm looking for a better fate!

Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
You can make a broken heart go away

I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it
On the summer rain

I wanna live this day forever
Yeah that will be alright
I said I love this stormy weather
You are the sunlight (yeah baby)
So come on and shine on me
Shine on me

Cause out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
You can make a broken heart go away

I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
Yeeah!
(I'm gonna blame it)
(On the summer rain)

Then out of the blue you came
You shine a little light on a cloudy day
You can make a broken heart go away

I'm not gonna lie, this feeling inside
I can't explain
I'm gonna blame it
On the summer rain

Blame it on the summer rain

Yeeah!
Ohhh

Blaming it on
The summer rain
The summer rain

Rain, Rain, Rain
Rain, Rain, Rain
Rain, Rain, Rain
Rain, Rain, Rain
Rain, Rain, Rain
Rain, Rain, Rain
