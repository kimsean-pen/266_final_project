This is a story about control.
My control.
Control of what I say,
Control of what I do.
And this time I'm gonna do it my way.
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
Are we ready?
I am.
Cause it's all about control.
And I've got lots of it.

When I was 17, I did what people told me, uh!
I did what my father said, and let my mother mould me
But that was a long ago.
I'm in

(Control)
Never gonna stop
(Control)
To get what I want
(Control)
I like to have a lot
(Control)
Now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
Now I know I got to take

(Control)
Now I've got a lot, ow!
(Control)
To get what I want
(Control)
I'm never gonna stop
(Control)
Now I'm all grown up

Jam, ooh ooh

Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own (decisions)
When it has to do with all my life, my life

I wanna be the one in control
So let me take you by the hand, and lead you in this dance

It's what I got, because I took a chance

I don't wanna rule the world, just wanna run my life

So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take

(Control, ooh ooh)
Now I've got a lot, ooh
(Control)
To get what I want, ow!
(Control)
I'm never gonna stop
(Control)

Now I'm all grown up, ooh!
Free at last

Out here on my own
Ooh ooh ooh yeah,

Now control this!
Oh!

Cuz I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
Blaine and Artie:
I wanna be the one in control

I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
