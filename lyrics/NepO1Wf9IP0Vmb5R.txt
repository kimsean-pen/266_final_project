This information is for everyone
I've never had my chance for much too long
I'm sick of buying lots of jewelry
No matter if it's Rome or Tennessee...
Cause I wanna get in touch
(Touch)
With the man I miss so much
(Touch)
And you should guarantee day by day
Innocent love
(You need my innocent love)
My innocent love tonight
(I cannot get enough)
You can stay by my side
And give me everything
Innocent boy
(You need my innocent boy)
My innocent boy tonight
(You now can get enough)
You can stay by my side
And show me everything...
