What did you know?
I held my breath through every tunnel
I wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under
I never get that far

Everything's so uncertain, can't find the right direction
You look in the mirror and tell me you see clear
I see, I can see me, but I can't get past this feeling
I talk, but no one listens, can't make my own decisions

Every night I lie asleep
Trying to wake up from this dream

Numb, but I still feel it crawling under my skin
I threw it all away, but it still stays the same
Try and forget my name, but it's something I just can't change
I threw it all away, but it still stays the same

Every night I lie asleep
Trying to wake up from this dream

What did you know?
I held my breath through every title
I wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under
I never get that far
