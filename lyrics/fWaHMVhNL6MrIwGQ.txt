Loose lips sunk ships
I'm getting to grips with what you said
No, it's not in my head
I can't awaken the dead day after day

Why don't we talk about it?
Why do you always doubt that there could be a better way?
It doesn't make me want to stay

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut, praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

You said we're fatally flawed
Well, I'm easily bored
Is that okay?
Write me off your list
Make this the last kiss
I'll walk away

Why don't we talk about it?
I'm only here, don't shout it
Given time we'll forget
Let's pretend we never met

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut, praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

Screw you, I didn't like your taste
Anyway, I chose you and that's all gone to waste
It's Saturday, I'll go out
And find another you

Why don't we?

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut, praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
Away
Blow away
