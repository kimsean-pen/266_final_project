The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the Great Flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East, Africa was a neighbour
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant
Of The Atlantian culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends, from all lands, were from far Atlantis
Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice, and let us sing, and dance
And ring in the new
Hail, Atlantis!
