I've been working overtime
But I can't get you off my mind
I'd sleep in the pouring rain
When will you come home again?

Spinning like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinning like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change

But they never did

I'm hanging on to the end of this rope
Somewhere on the outskirts of hope

Life without you not around
Another kid in lonely town

And I'm spinning like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinning like a Gravitron

When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did

Now I'm standing outside your house
And I'm wondering baby
Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you feel the thud when I fall?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
Did you lock the door when it shut?
Did you see the knife when it cut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground?

For the kid in lonely town
Lonely town
Lonely town
The kid in Lonely town
Lonely town
Lonely town

Spinning like a Gravitron

When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinning like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
(And I'm wondering)
Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
(And I'm wondering)
Did you lock the door when it shut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground?
For the kid in lonely town
Lonely town
Lonely town
Lonely town
Lonely town
