Eyes cut deep
More than words she spoke
Guess I got found out
Harrowing
But I still believe
In miracles and hope
For the best in us
Know what I mean
By night I don't sleep
Runnin' from the hounds
Tryin' to take me out
Ain't no escape
Valkyrie
Fire in the dark
Tore my heart clean out
Cowering

Death haunts me
Shadow on my shoulder at all times
Can't get over it
Is this just a dream?
Ain't never sure what's real or illusion here
Anyways
At times I can't breathe
The pressure and the crush
Going under man
Not again
Hold memory
Sacred while you can
Set sail with grace
All faculties

Feels like I'm coming down
From these years of swingin'
Hammers in my head
Feels like I'm coming down
From these years of swingin'
Hammers in my head
Feels like I'm coming down
From these years of swingin'
Hammers in my head
Feels like I'm coming down
From these years of swingin'
Hammers in my head

In the heat of summer
I lost the time of day
In the heat of summer
I lost the will to stay
In the heat of summer
I lost the night for days
In the heat of summer
I lost my mind at sea
In the heat of summer
I lost the time of day
In the heat of summer
I lost the will to stay
In the heat of summer
I lost my mind at sea
In the heat of summer
I lost the night again
In the heat of summer
I lost the time of day
In the heat of summer
Cold comfort for the pain
