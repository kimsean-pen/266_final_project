Suto, suto

I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck

All black fit, you can't see me with the lights out
All these fights, I just really wanna lie down
All that hate, but they started bein' nice now
All your love, but I feel it start to wind down
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Askin' whats wrong
I said, "Nothin'"
All these people wanna piece of me
No peace, no sleep, can't breathe, yeah
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck

Got it from my Mo-o-om
Wish she wasn't go-o-one
New style what I go-o-ot
I think I'm the o-o-one
Do you hate me?
Do you love me?
Askin' whats wrong
I said, "Nothin'"
All these people wanna piece of me
No peace, no sleep, can't breathe
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck
I was in the clouds
Always lookin' down
I was by myself because
No one was around
Now I think I'm next
But I'm still depressed
Hangin' by a thread
Maybe hangin' by my neck
