One day one woman asked him
"what do you to survive?"
He said 'oh my dear listen here
And this is what he cried

On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
"dancing to be free"
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy

My knees they got some cuts and bruises
From skating all my days
'Cuz when I skating with my friends
My troubles drift away

I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
I like to move around
Cuz getting down and jumping up
These are some good things that I found

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some loving
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancing

My waist it's got a slinky belt
With a clip that's quick to open
Because loving is the sweetest thing
And from my waist it happens

And my stomachs got some tasty food
That's making me feel good
Cuz sharing some meals is something
I wish the world could do

And my chest it wears a singlet
Ah my chest it beating proud
My chest suggest I am a man
That no institution can knock down

And around my neck is superstition
Hanging from a chain
Because I got my gods but in the end
I make my own way

CHORUS

My mouth it's got a great big smile
That shows some great big teeth
To friends it brings a happiness
And to enemies it brings defeat

And my eyes they've got some vision
That can see through many lies
Well my eyes they look for better things
The better things to see in life

And my ears are wearing head phones
That do play my favourite songs
Not music I'm told to like
But the songs that make me dance along

Cuz on my feet are shoes for dancing
'dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy
