Give it a rest I'm quite aware
It was a doomed affair, from the start
Everyone told me to stay away

It's just a game she plays, with her heart

But I'm a man made of flesh and blood
Oh god just give me, love's what I crave
And as she goes walking out the door
She turned to me once more, and she sang

I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them

Now I'm alone sitting in the park
Sitting in the dark, trying to breath
Everyone tells me to carry on
The damages are done, set me free

I was a man made of flesh and blood
Oh now just dirt and mud in my veins
I know she left, but she's haunting me
I hear her mocking me, as she sings

I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break, I don't break
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break, I don't break
I don't break hearts, I destroy them

Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!
Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!

I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break hearts, no that's not me
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break, I don't break
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
I don't break, I don't break
I don't break hearts, I destroy them
