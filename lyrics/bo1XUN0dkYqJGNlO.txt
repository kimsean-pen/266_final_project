I see you drivin' 'round town with the guy I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget him too!"
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh—?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a "Forget you!"

Yeah I'm sorry
I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more an Atari
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Uuhh, she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know it)
Ooooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go, run and tell your little girlfriend

I see you drivin' 'round town with the guy I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget him too!"
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shh—?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a "Forget you!"

Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause bein' in love with your face ain't cheap
Now, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Uuhh, she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know it)
Ooooh, I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate you right now

I see you drivin' 'round town with the guy I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget him too!"
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Huh, now ain't that some shh—?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a "Forget you!"

Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mama but she told me, "This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, yeah she did it, yeah she did it)

Uh! Whhhy?
Uh! Whhhy?
Uh! Whhhy baby?
Oh! I love you
I still love you! Ohhh!

I see you drivin' 'round town with the guy I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget him too!"
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shh—?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a "Forget you!"
