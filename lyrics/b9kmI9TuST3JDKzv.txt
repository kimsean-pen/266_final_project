Well I could bore you with a truth
About an uneventful youth
So you could get that wrap from someone else
And I could make an observation
If you want the voice of the generation
But I'm too self-absorbed to give it clout

And I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're young and bored at 24
And you don't know who you are no more

There's no hope and it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
'Cause they never go away
I know I am so self-obsessed
I guess but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I grow

Well I could look for inspiration
Find it in the job of an English nation
But wouldn't that be cheap and ill-informed
And I could bet you don't believe me
If I said it came from deep within me
But I promise you I'm telling you the truth

And I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're 24 and young and bored
And don't know who you are no more

There's no hope and it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
'Cause they never go away
I know I am so self-obsessed
I guess but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I grow

Well I wish I was comfortable in my own skin
But the whole thing feels like an exercise
And trying to be someone I would rather not be
I tried to second guess if you would be approving
I find my life ever so moving
Keen, wide-eyed and unassuming
Oh (okay)
There is no hope but there's desperately
No hope but there's definitely
No hope if you don't believe me
Oooh
Yeah, there is no hope but there's desperately
No hope but there's definitely
No hope if you don't believe me
Oooh but I, I don't really care about
Anybody else when I haven't got my own life figured out
'Cause when you're 24 and young and bored
And don't know who you are no more

There's no hope and it's hard to come of age
I think it's a problem
'Cause they never go away
I know I am so self-obsessed
I guess but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
I grow

There is no hope
I know it's a problem
But they never goes my way
I know I am so self-obsessed
I guess but there's no hope
And I hope it's just a phase
Well, I grow
