Down by the river I was strung by your grace
Into depths of oblivion and to the lovers' place
I was stucked in a puddle full of tears and unwise
Dark doings, now I know that we've paid unlike

I felt like we can throw away the falseness of a past
And I know, too, it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window, that's what those lovers do

Down by the river, hmm
Down by the river
Down by the river
