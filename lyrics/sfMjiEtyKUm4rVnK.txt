Babe don't give up yet
When we've come this far
Remember when we met
At the old Prospector

Blindfolded acid trips
Your tiny fingertips
Piano songs off time
Wood teeth stained from the wine

Problems come in threes
Then we beat them down
Its nothing when compared
To the hangovers, we've shared

But rents on time
We've got cigs and cheap red wine
Come on and share my table
And pour your heart into mine

Time can be so blunt 'til its no fun
But all in all, time's treated us fine
Time can be so blunt 'til its no fun
But all in all, time's treated us fine

It ain't no use to act
Like we're mom and dad
We've done enough of that
Impressions, good and bad

Flattering copycats
Caught digging through our trash
Licking our rusty cans
Life in the frying pan

Problems come in threes
Then we beat them down
Its nothing when compared
To the hangovers, we've shared

But rents on time
We've got cigs and cheap red wine
Come on and share my table
And pour your heart into mine

Time can be so blunt 'til its no fun
But all in all, time's treated us fine
Time can be so blunt 'til its no fun
But all in all, time's treated us fine

Lucid trips in joy ride ships
We watched the neon lights
A lovers ride to thaw out frigid times

Lucid trips in joy ride ships
We watched the neon lights
