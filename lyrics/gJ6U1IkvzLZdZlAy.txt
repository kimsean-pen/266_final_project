Woh

Runnin' out on the streets
He lives from day to day
Lookin' for somethin' to do

He needs to get away
Hopin' that maybe one day
He could be someone
Prayin' that maybe someday
He could be number one

In his world of make believe
Yeah, he always tends to be

On the loose
So young, so tough, so wild
On the loose
Again
Ohh, dreamin', dreamin' about

All the things he'd like to do
Tryin', tryin' so hard

To make it all up to you
In his world of make believe
Yeah, he always tends to be
On the loose
So young, so tough, so wild
On the loose
Again
Ohh, he's got somethin' to say, yeah
Ohh, You'd better not stand
In his way look out

Ohh, in his world of make believe
Yeah, he always tends to be
On the loose
So young, so tough, so wild
On the loose
Again
Yeah
On the loose
So young, so tough, so wild
On the loose
Again
