And he's back again
Big decision, hoping the cards will fall kind
Not impossible
But your parents won't stop crying
And you got nothing but the dregs again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you caught someone else's flowers from the tower

Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
On me

I had it coming, I had a ten-year plan
I had a plot on the corner
I dug a hole to the turtle shells
I keep the lid on eternal
Did you ever
Did you ever really wanna make something out of nothing?
And do you ever
Ever dream about a patch of dirt?
And about the time the Martians attack
And the tidal wave and the lightning crack

Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down

And if you're clever, you glide like a feather
Take a number, follow to the letter
Or you can sever, soar to the heavens
Take a loan out, pay it back whenever
And if you're clever, you glide like a feather
(Big boy, bring the hammer down)
Take a number, follow to the letter
Or you can sever, light up the heathers
(Big boy, bring the hammer down)
Get your hands on the leather

Big boy, bring the hammer down
I spent a long time just kicking up the dust
Big boy, bring the hammer down
I spent a long time just waiting on the rust
Big boy, bring the hammer down
I spent a long time not getting up to much
Big boy, bring the hammer down
I spent a long time just kicking up the dust
