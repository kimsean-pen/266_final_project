I fight fire with fire
And I run rivers in rain
A fever spreading like wild
Gonna kill like Abel and Cain
Nobody to see, nobody to lose
Young blood on the street,
been blackened & bruised Get ready for me,
cause i'm ready for you Go sharpen the blade,
bear witness to truth My those teeth are
pearly white, THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH!
HEY My HVY MTL DRMR, Get ready for some third rail love...
My pretty little demon,
Burn bright like the midnight sun.
Rage like Eve in the garden
The sweetest fruit you can
bear When the riptides draggin you under
Are you gonna drown?
Nobody to see, nobody to lose Young blood on the street,
been blackened & bruised Get ready for me,
cause i'm ready for you Go sharpen the blade,
bear witness to truth My those teeth are pearly white,
THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH! HEY My HVY MTL DRMR,
Get ready for some third rail love... My pretty little demon,
Burn bright like the midnight sun.
Burn bright like the midnight sun
HEY My HVY MTL DRMR,
Get ready for some third rail love... My pretty little demon,
Burn bright like the midnight sun.
