The way he looked that night
Vaguely silhouetted in the light
So patiently awaiting after dark
I dreamt that he would someday steal my heart

The pounding at the door made my heart leap
Patronizing silence filled the street
And goosebumps teased my spine and my hand shook
I opened up the door to take a look

Oh yeah
Thought a one night stand wouldn't be so bad
He took everything I had
A one night stand wouldn't be so

He woke me in my slumber late at night
Struck me in the head with his flashlight
Delusional and sinking in the stars
Didn't think you'd ever go this far

I let in a robber
I let him in cause I just wanted company
and he took me hostage
But only cause he didn't want to be alone like me
