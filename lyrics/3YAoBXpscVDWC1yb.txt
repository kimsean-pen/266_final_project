Sometimes it rages... rock a little
Even when it's calm... still rock a little
Just like the sea... I rock a little
Say it was just like me
Still rock a little

Then you knew her... funny little dancer
And you watched her all night long
You were trying to learn from her teachers
One thing that she wanted
She would not be tangled up... in it

Hit it,
It's about time, lily
Oh, I know lily
Rock a little
Hit the stage... Hit the stage
Rock a little

She's home now;
She says I've gone far beyond that song
She says rock and roll ballerina
Where else would she go?
He knows his daughter, says
Where does she live?
He says, Oh, up there somewhere

Then he says, Go ahead, lily
Hit it,
Hit the stage, dancin'... go on
Hit it... Well, I know lily
It's about time, lily
Hit it

Well, I know lily
It's about time, lily
Hit it
Hit the stage
Hit it

Hit it, lily
It's about time, lily
Hit it
I know, lily
It's about time, lily
Hit the stage
Hit it, lily

Lots of them
And all one of a kind
But the most importatn thing was
What was on her mind
Pale... pink... satin... worn out in a week
But you loved you the most
And you said...

Go ahead, lily
Hit it
No explanations and I tell you no
You say... Nothing
That is how songs are written
Stories are told, rumours are started

That is how songs are written
Stories are told, rumours are started

Go ahead, lily
Hit it
It's about time lily
Hit the stage, dancin'
I know, lily
Hit it
Hit the stage

Go ahead, lily
Hit it
It's about time lily
Hit the stage, dancin'
I know, lily
Hit it
Hit the stage

Go ahead, lily
Hit it
It's about time lily
Hit the stage, dancin'
I know, lily
Hit it
Hit the stage
