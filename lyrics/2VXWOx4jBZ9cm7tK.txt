Who said it's over now?
Who said we don't know how?
Words from my open mouth
I'll eat anything that I want now, now
Who said it's all been done?
Long way 'til kingdom come
I won't give up on us
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall down
Stay up late until my eyes go heavy like
the strings pulled in toward the ground now
I can see it through the crystal light
I'm turning green, turning pink like a rainbow, oh
Thoughts are running through my mind and I wonder where I find
All the things that my hunger calls
I can breathe underwater now
I'm seeing things as they'll be when the kingdom falls

Who said it's over now?
Who said we don't know how?
Words from my open mouth
I'll eat anything that I want now, now
Who said it's all been done?
Long way 'til kingdom come
I won't give up on us
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall down

In the dim of the fading light
The shadows creep and they turn into friends of mine
I can hear it as they cheer me on and tell me
"Don't close your eyes 'til the night's all gone"
So I pushed through the lonely way
I find the will in myself for one more day
Then I'll rise like the silver moon up
in the sky I can see from the clearer view

Who said it's over now?
Who said we don't know how?
Words from my open mouth
I'll eat anything that I want now, now
Who said it's all been done?
Long way 'til kingdom come
I won't give up on us
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall down
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall down
I'll be waiting here

I can feel it in my soul
I can feel it in my pulse now
I can feel it in, I can feel it in, feel it in my soul
I can feel it in my houses
I can feel it in my houses
I can feel it in, I can feel it in, can feel it in my mind so
I can feel it in my mind so, I can feel it in my mind
I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it
