Found out everyone is shallow
No depth
The ugly seem to follow
Blinded void, gaping hole
Weed out, weed out the visions you saw
Speak out, speak out, you talk for us all
Shut out the weakness you brought

All said and all done
All said and all done
I know
She can never run
She can not run and go
Let it all out
Let it all out and show
All said and all done
All said and all done
She knows
