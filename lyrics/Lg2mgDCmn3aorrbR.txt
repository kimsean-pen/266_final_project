Cursed by nature
Hence sea confines... mystifies
Haunting the mortal mind
Since the mist of time
As a myth, it had survived

Praised, was, their knowledge
Beyond it's shores... idolized
Their kingdom's splendid sites reigned high
As perfection of mankind

Drowned, entirely
Within one night
Swallowed, was, their empire
In the mist of time
Dreadful floods, none had survived

The mighty Sola Terra
Forever, fell asleep
Mysterious sinking drama
Lost in Daedalian deeps
The mystic Sola Terra
Forever, shall exist
Within the grips of ocean
Lost in abyssal mist
