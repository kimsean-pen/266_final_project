Huh, huh, huh, oh yeah
Oh, listen to me people

I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy (buyyy)
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdy fly (flyyy)
And I don't have the time
To think about what makes a flower grow (makes a flower grow)
And I never gave it second thought
To where the river flows

(Too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby) Oh, yeah
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Oh yeah, yeah

I said I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's gonna' last (pala, la, la)
And I ain't got time
To do no studyin'
Once I get out of class (pala, la, la)
I'm telling you I'm just a fellow (just a fellow, yeah)
And i got a, one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time (just) (have)

(Too busy thinkin' bout my baby) Oh, yeah
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Don't you know I'm too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby
Oh, and I ain't got time for nothin' else
Oh yeah, yeah (oooh, oooh)
Oh, yeah, yeaaah (oooh, oooh)

All the diamonds and pearls
In the world
Could never match her worth
No, no, she's some kinda' wonderful people tell ya'
I've got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
Oh, with a one, one track mind (oh, yeah)
And when it comes to thinkin' 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time

(Too busy thinkin' bout my baby)
Oh, and I ain't got time for nothin' else
You know I'm
Too busy thinkin' 'bout my baby
And I ain't got time for nothin' else

(Too busy thinkin' about my baby)
(Ain't got time for nothin' else, no, no)
Oh yeah
(Too busy thinkin' about my baby) Oh, oh
(Ain't got time for nothin' else, no, no) She's never hard to find
(Too busy thinkin' about my baby) 'Cause she's always on my mind
