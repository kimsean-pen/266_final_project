I feel myself return to what I know
Not for my health but for a bid to keep control
You bleed on the page
An honest search for any other way to feel empty

Fear dwells as I fell for nothing
My sorrow swallows everything
I know that I was blind to the truth
My sorrow swallows everything

Walk too close, dissolve the way I'm gone and I'm not coming back
You don't get to decide my fate for me or tell me what I lack

(We fall, we fail, we hate)
(We bend, we burn, we break)
(But I still feel the same)
(But I still feel the same)

I can't escape, fate starts to choke
I see your face and think of everything
I went through on my own (my own)
Broken, abstain from what I know
I see your face and think of everything
I went through on my own (my own)

Fear dwells as I fell for nothing
My sorrow swallows everything
I know that I was blind to the truth
My sorrow swallows everything.

(We fall, we fail, we hate)
(We bend, we burn, we break)
(But I still feel the same)
(But I still feel the same)
