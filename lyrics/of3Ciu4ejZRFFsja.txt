Independent, that's how you view yourself
Now that you're twentytwo, twentytwo
If I could do it, I would stay young for you
We could live inside a place
Where we'd never have to face
All the people who disgrace us
And make us hide our face

Busted and used, that's how you view your girl
Now that she's twentytwo, twentytwo
If I could do it, I would stay young for you
We could live inside a place
Where we'd never have to face
All the people who disgrace us
And make us hide our face

If I could do it, I would fly into the sun
I would become warm
And I meant it when I said you're my favourite son
With your finger that is reaching
For the trigger of the gun
And you know you've got to prove it
To yourself and everyone

I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone
I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone

If I could do it, I would take her in my arms
I would unwrong all his wrongs
I could stay here and write a thousand songs
Just to show her that the stars
Still come out behind the fog
There's a light on in the lighthouse
You can see it in the dark

I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone
I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone

I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone
I do not go quietly
Into the night that calls me
Even when I'm alone
