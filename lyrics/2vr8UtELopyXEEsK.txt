Demon who denies me
Who cuts off heads and severs necks
Who renders incoherent the words I speak
Sealing my mouth against the magic which resides in me
You who shall not see me
Kneel on your knees
Go with thy face behind thee

Wander without purpose
With your face averted
Looking back in dread
Upon the tormentors belonging to Shu
Who relentlessly follow you
Crawling after you
To cut off your head and sever your neck
At the behest of one who has despoiled his lord

On account o your threats unto me
To reduce me to incoherence
To cut off my head
To sever my neck
To seal my mouth
On account of the magic which resides within my body

May your face be downcast at the sight of my countenance
May the flame of the eye or Horus go forth against you
For abhorrence of you is in Osiris
Thus abhorrence of you is in me
On account of the magic which resides within my body

May your face be downcast at the sight of my countenance
May the flame of the eye or Horus go forth against you
For abhorrence of you is in Osiris
Thus abhorrence of you is in me
Go back to the tormentors belonging to Shu
Dead yet deathless
Who relentlessly follow you
Shambling tirelessly on rotting limbs
Crawling after you
To cut off your head and sever your neck
