I have a bone to pick with you
cause you're lazy like a bone
you pull all the stops

Lies all are said and done
lies soon catch up with one
you pull all the stops

I work my fingers to the bone
and you just didn't run
but yet you're having fun

I have a bone to pick with you
cause you're lazy like a bone
you pull all the stops

cause you're lazy like a bone

I feel you in my bones
and make no bones about

Well you're running with the hare
and hunting with the hounds
I'm a bag of bones
can you sign my bones
