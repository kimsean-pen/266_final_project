I'm walking up the hope for a tip
And it's telling me you're hiding, you're hiding, you're hiding
I'm begging you to stay the same
The only constant is your changing, your changing, your changing

And it lights up well
I bring you down to hell
The street it has my name
I'll burn it to the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground
This town, this town, this town
Burn it to the ground
Oh

And when you walked out on me
I asked the bridges where you're going, you're going, you're going
I'm begging you to stay the same
The only constant is your changing, your changing, your changing

And it lights up well
I bring you down to hell
The street it has my name
I'll burn it to the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground
This town, this town, this town
Burn it to the ground
Oh

And it lights up well
I bring you down to hell
The street it has my name
I'll burn it to the ground, the ground, the ground, the ground
This town, this town, this town
Burn it to the ground
