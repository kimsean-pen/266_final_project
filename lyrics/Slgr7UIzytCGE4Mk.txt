Let's get away, wanna take ya to somewhere I know
Somewhere I know
Baby, I just wanna go, take you to somewhere I know
I'd say the lost islands are waiting outside of the bar
Out at a bar, waiting outside in a car, let's get up out of the bar

'Cause I wanna go somewhere I know
Where we can take it slow
I wanna go, I wanna go
I wanna go somewhere I know
Where we can take it slow
I wanna go, I wanna go

I'm underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go, I wanna go
Underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go, I wanna go

Topping up the fuel, filled with azure cool
To the crystal pool
Let's get away now, let's get away now
The silver engine on
This pirate ship is done, million ways to run
Let's get away now, let's get away now

'Cause I wanna go somewhere I know
Where we can take it slow
I wanna go, I wanna go
I wanna go somewhere I know
Where we can take it slow
I wanna go

I'm underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go
Underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go, I wanna go

Let's get away, wanna take ya to somewhere I know
Somewhere I know
Baby, I just wanna go, take you to somewhere I know
I'd say lost islands are waiting outside of the bar
Out at a bar, waiting outside in a car, let's get up out of the bar

'Cause I wanna go somewhere I know
Where we can take it slow
I wanna go, I wanna go

I'm underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go
Underwater 'cause I'm drowning in your body
Maybe we can leave this party
Take ya somewhere that I know
I wanna go, I wanna go
