BREAK THE LINE

you can get it
come and climb under my skin
overtake it
pushing me on a fast lane
come lets get away
noone knows you like i do
we will pass it if
you let the tires kiss the ground

you should go ahead
so fast
you should go ahead
so fast
you should go ahead
so fast

break the line
we have to go
cause theres no way back
where we are comming from

i'm your engine
got you strapped into my seat
here is our tactic
we get faster
the more i scream
come lets get away
noone drives you like i do
i'm collapsing
when the tires kiss the ground

you should go ahead
so fast
you should go ahead
so fast
you should go ahead
so fast

break the line
we have to go
cause theres no way back
where we are comming from

and all i try is to break the thin line
nothings gonna stop the way of life
be sure that it's safe
i'll show you a place
where we can be and everyone is dreaming of

you should go ahead
so fast
you should go ahead
so fast

break the line
we have to go
cause theres no way back
where we are comming from
