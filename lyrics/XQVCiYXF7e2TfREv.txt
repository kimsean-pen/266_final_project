Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
O-o-oh

Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
O-o-oh

Caution cities
Razed by no one
Caution waits but never find hope
Caution lifts we did this wrong
Caution has the way and I don't feel this anymore

Caution of the world he said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
O-o-oh

For a long time we stayed down
And all we said was sleep alone
Watch the city fall
With those eyes so low
Watch the sunlight
Watch it go
Watch the storm rise
Watch the storm fall
Watch the storm rise
I watch the storm fall

Caution of the world he said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
O-o-oh
