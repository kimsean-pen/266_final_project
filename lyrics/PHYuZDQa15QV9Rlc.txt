If you're trying to hurt me like I hurt you, then you win
And if you're trying to love me like I love you, then we win
And if you're trying to finish what we started
Then we'll lose the love and I don't wanna lose you

Are you trying to make me cry?
Are you trying to make me cry?

Stop trying 'cause I'm die, die, dying, die, die

I believe in us, and I really do
I can barely take it, can't get over you
If you're trying to lose me then you're going the right way boy
I can't take this shit much more, I'm staring at the door

Start to love me like I love you, treat me good
I give you a lot, I love you a lot tell me why I should
If you're trying to hurt me like I hurt you, then you win
I can't turn back the clock, take what I got, give me everything

If you're trying to hurt me like I hurt you, then you win
And if you're trying to love me like I love you, then we win
And if you're trying to finish what we started
Then we'll lose the love and I don't wanna lose you

Stop trying 'cause I'm die, die, dying, die, die

It's gotta stop, we argue a lot, ain't no matter what we do
Be careful what you're saying because am trying to stay with you
So let's make a future plan 'cause this ain't the way of living, boy
I know that I hurt you bad, boy, I know that I hurt you bad

Baby, it's time to face it, need to know that you want this too
And if you want to save this then we both know what you can do
Ain't no point in looking back and I know that I love you mad
So quit how you act, don't turn your back
Think about what we have

If you're trying to hurt me like I hurt you, then you win
And if you're trying to love me like I love you, then we win
And if you're trying to finish what we started
Then we'll lose the love and I don't wanna lose you
