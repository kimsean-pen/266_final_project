Fiending children writhe
The cradle cap will fall
Rings attach the hands
Shadow black and cold
Etching out a space
Forge the thumbprint
Fake the name
Leave without a trace
Spark the friction
Breath to the edge

Stare into the tunnels eyes
Nature is cruel
Make everyone pay
This road will
Lead you to the end
Pacing the room
Forgetting the rules

Dry rust teaming from the lip
Arms will make the gate
Buckle from the weight

Fiending wet nurse writhe
It echoes through the night
String attached to cans
We digging with our hands
Etching out a space
Forge the thumbprint
Fake the name
Leave without a trace
Spark the friction
Breath to the edge

You're pushing for weeks before the day
Beware
Mirror
You've got the right to stay sedate
To panicked, depressed
Corroborated
In time you'll know
You've got the right to stay sedate
Oh Oh
Don't shake the alter
We tasted blood
We tasted blood

Dry rust teaming from the lip
Arms will make the gate
Buckle from the weight
Blind wince tear away the lips
Legs to push the weight
Heavy through the gate
