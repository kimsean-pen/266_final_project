I'm standing on the outside
I don't know where I'm going to
But I do know just one thing
I know that it is over with you.

I've been very lonely
I did not think I could go on
I was caught in memories
And dreams that showed up

My baby, you left
Blind men could see
I was in love with you
But you weren't in love with me

Suppose I'll have to keep in
Keep in inside, I don't know why
But I know that I'm changing
But baby it helps if I try

My friend, you left
If blind man could see
I was in love with you
But you weren't in love with me

(background voices)
In love with you
(background voices)
In love with you

Now I'm standing on the outside
I don't know where I'm going to
But I do know just one thing
And baby, it is over with you

My friend, you left
If blind man could see
I was in love with you
But you weren't in love with me

Oh, my friend, you left
Blind man could see
I was in love with you
But you weren't in love with me

You weren't in love with me
You weren't in love with me
Ah, ah, yeah
You weren't in love with me
Yeah, yeah
You weren't in love with me
You weren't in love with me
Ah, yeah
You weren't in love with me
Ah, yeah
You weren't in love with me
