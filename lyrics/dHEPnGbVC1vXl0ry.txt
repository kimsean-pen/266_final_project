My my, cold hearted child, tell me how you feel
Just a blade in the grass, spoke unto the wheel
My my, cold hearted child, tell me where it's all gone
The luster of your bones, those arms that held you strong
I been worryin' that my time is a little unclear
I been worryin' that I'm losing the one's I hold dear
I been worryin' that we all live our lives in the confines of fear

My my, cold hearted child, tell me how you feel
Just a grain in the morning air, dark shadow on the hill
My my, cold hearted child, tell me where it all falls
All this apathy you feel will make a fool of us all
I been worryin' that my time is a little unclear
I been worryin' that I'm losing the one's I hold dear
I been worryin' that we all live our lives in the confines of fear

Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
(I've been worryin', i've been worryin')
Oh i will become what i deserve
(I've been worryin', my time is a little unclear)
Oh I will become what I deserve

I been worryin', I been worryin' that my time is a little unclear
I been worryin', I been worryin that I'm losing the one's I hold dear
I been worryin',
I been worryin that we all,
all live our lives in the confines of fear
