You know it's the place I need
But you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
The doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick
I'm like the taste of Macaroni, on a seafood stick
You got me switched on baby, like electric Eel
And I'm tight with Axel Foley, that's just how I feel
Like a grapefruit and a magic trick
The prodigal son
I'm walking
I'm walking
I'm walking
I walk so quick

And it just don't mean a thing
We've been waiting far too long
We'll play it out again
This is just my serenade

You're in love with a Psycho
You're in love with a Psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it

You're in love with a Psycho
You're in love with a Psycho
And there's just nothing you can do about
You never gonna be without it

Jibber jabber at the bargain booze
Reciting Charles Bukowski I got nothing to lose
And I wait for you to follow me to share my chips
But you're walking
You're walking
You walk
You walk so quick

Nobody's gonna take you there
I stick around for the thousand yard stare
I go to sleep in a duffle bag
I'm never up, never down, down down down

You're in love with a Psycho
You're in love with a Psycho
And there's just nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it

You're in love with a Psycho
You're in love with a Psycho
And there's just nothing you can do about
You never gonna be without it

Maybe this will be the fine solution
Maybe this way we'll find a solution

You're in love with a Psycho
You're in love with a Psycho
And there's just nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it

You're in love with a Psycho
Tu amor es muy loco
And there's just nothing you can do about
You never gonna be without it
