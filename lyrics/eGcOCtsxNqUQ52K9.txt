I pulled up to a palace in no town
Twenty minutes from Bali, oh yeah
Got a feeling that is about to go down
Party people wanna party so I say

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Imma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Everybody outside when the night ends
We can do it all again when the sun's up
You know I really wanna be that you want and
You know you really wanna give me your love

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Imma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
Better gimme, gimme, gimme that love

Gimme, gi-gimme that love
Gimme, gi-gimme that love
Gi-gimme, gi-gimme that lo-o-o-o-ove

(Gimme, gimme now)
Gimme that...
Gimme, gi-gimme that...

Hang out with my girls in Nevada
Caliente, baby looking for fun?
No rush but just don't make it harder
We both know that you really wanna

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Imma love you, love you, love you long time
So gimme, gimme the way that I like it

Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
Baby, when I see you
I want you, want you, want you
My body, body go crazy, crazy
Better gimme, gimme, gimme that love

(Gimme, gimme now)
Gimme that...
Gimme, gi-gimme that...

We can do it the way I like it
(Gimmie, gimmie the way I like it)
We can do it the way I like it
Gimme, gi-gimme that...
Gi-gimme that...
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gimme that...
