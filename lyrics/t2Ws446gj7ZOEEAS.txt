I'm about to hit send
I'm waiting for the weekend
The days go by so slow
Saturated [?]
Does my disappointment show?

I'm so sick of drinking by myself
Nobody likes a f*cking downer
Pretty sure I've heard this one before

I tried to smile but I don't care
It always ends up as a blank stare

My anxiety is [?]
But it'll sure leave me alone

I'm so sick of drinking by myself
Nobody likes a f*cking downer
Pretty sure we're better off alone
And there's only so much more that I can give

That I can give
There's only so much I can give

I'm so sick of hating all my friends
But I'm too lazy to get new ones
Pretty sure I've heard this one before
And there's only so much more that I can give

Pretty sick of drinking by myself
Nobody likes a f*cking downer
Pretty sure we're better of alone
And we all deserve exactly what we get

All by myself
I don't need nobody else
I got myself
I don't need nobody else
