Oooh Ooooh
Oh I Oh I
Oh I Oh I
Oh I Oh I
One night of love
Is not enough
Don't let me breath
You won't believe
Oh I oh I
Oh I oh I
One night of love
Is not enough
Don't let me breath
You won't believe
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
Oooh Oooh
There's a firefly,
There's a firefly
Gonna burn this place down
There's a firefly
Run run run
There's a firefly
Gonna burn this place down
Place down place down place down
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's to cold
In this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one
To help me get to sleep
Ooooh Ooooh
Oh I, Oh I
One night of love
Is not enough
Don't let me breath
You won't believe
One night of love
Is not enough
Don't let me breath
You won't believe
Oooooh ooh
One night of love
Is not enough
Don't let me breath
