The first strike of the hammer
Made my heart beat faster
The ratata remind me
That there was something behind me

You can hear them
you can hear them banging on the tree
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be, staring at the wave
Staring at the wave
Staring at the wave

They told me I wasn't everything
Before the bombs have been falling
I was a thief of the master
I was a walking disaster

I know you hear me coming
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel it coming
come on and get you down

You can hear them
you can hear them banging on the tree
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be, staring at the wave
Staring at the wave
Staring at the wave
