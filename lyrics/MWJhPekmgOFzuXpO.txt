His wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies
And yet reality is dual, walking with good and evil

Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step

Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions impulsions into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be just

His wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies
And yet reality is, dual, walking with good and evil

Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step

Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions, impulsions into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be just
