Ein, zwei, drei, vier

Gonna show you what I'm all about
I'm gonna make your toenails curl
Gonna show you how to make me smile
I'm really into long legged girls

I was talking to you all night long
Every line was a favourite song
Gonna show you how to make me laugh
I'm gonna tear ya down

Gonna show you what I'm all about
I'm gonna shoot ya down tonight
I don't really wanna freak you out
But I'm gonna make ya feel alright

I was talking to ya all night through
And I knew you was rollin' me too
Gonna shake you 'til your lips turn blue
I'm gonna tear ya down

Gonna show you how to strut your stuff
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
Gonna show you how to change your luck
I'm really gonna do it to you

I was talking to ya hours and hours
I promised you hearts and flowers
I'll give you supernatural powers
I'm gonna tear ya down
