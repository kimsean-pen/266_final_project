Oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah Slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music
(STAY-C:)
Take your time, find a way to do
Control the line, let the record get into your mind
And let it start to renovate
Do it good do it now and don't you wait
I'm an addict, I don't give none
Yes I'm hooked up the music on the run
If you wanna be high take it score
And give me more
(NANCE:)
Slave to the music (oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah)
(Oh nay na na na nay na) I'm a slave to the music (na na nay-ah)
(Oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah) (STAY-C:)
I'm a party freak and I really mean a freak
Every day of the week
I can't live my life without jammin'
That is why my life is so slammin'
I take you up to a place where you never been
Far away from home and then back again
Get ready for this and get dressed
'Cause when you miss the boat you're gonna be stressed
Yeah, 3, 2, 1
Countdown and the party has begun
Let's do it right now let's go for it
'Cause I feel for you when I show for it
S-T-A-Y and C
If you wanna have fun you better call me
Get down get down to the sound
I'm in town
(NANCE:)
Slave to the music (oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah)
(Oh nay na na na nay na) I'm a slave to the music (na na nay-ah)
(Oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah) (STAY-C:)
Hmmm, you better believe what I told ya
'Cause if you don't I will come back to hold ya
And when you're ready, come on and tell me
I'm gonna be right there waiting for the yell C
Yes, 'cause I'm talkin' about a change
I'm talkin' about a change of lifestyle
The way you went to me was very strange
Stay tuned for a while
I could have been a criminal
Because I live like an animal
A whole place is mad, that's terrible
I was a kid so I tried to live with it
Thinking I was a weak individual
But I was not, I was so strong
And so the music helped me get along
Take a look at me now 'cause here I am
I'm your main man
(NANCE:)
Slave to the music (oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah)

(Oh nay na na na nay na, na na nay-ah)
