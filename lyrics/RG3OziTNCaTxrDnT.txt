People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground

People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground

(Oh yeah!)

If you dream of the top
You will be over the edge
If you get it on side
You'll be taking ditch
You'll be loving our love
But you don't know why
It's the term of the day
So we never excite

Your heart isn't there
So you might as well say:
"I know it, I got it
but I know that time will set me together"

People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing a their ground

People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing a their ground

(Oh yeah!)

If you dream of the top
You will be over the edge
If you get it on side
You'll be taking ditch
You'll be loving our love
