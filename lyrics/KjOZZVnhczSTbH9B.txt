Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart

I've been saving up this treasure for years
I hid it somewhere so no one could touch it
With every love I had some reason to leave
No other like it 'cause it's so authentic

Many driver couldn't bear her though
Try to break through the gate but didn't have the gut
When I looked in your eyes, I felt a glitch
So I present you with my most precious gift

I put my love in a jar
In my heart, like a piggy bank
And I'm giving it to you
So whatever you do

Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart

Never knew that love can be so epic
But you save me 'cause you're all heroic
Legend has it that you've earned this throne
Since you came and pulled the sword out the stone

Many driver couldn't weather the storm
You came in my life and turned the lights on
Now when you touch me baby, I can't resist
So I present you with my most precious gift

I put my love in a jar
In my heart, like a piggy bank
And I'm giving it to you
So whatever you do
Don't shatter my heart

In a big emergency, don't break the glass, call me
Our love can save anything like the Father, believe me
I'll give you my all 'cause my heart makes me stronger
And if you pour into it I can go even harder

I put my love in a jar
In my heart, like a piggy bank
And I'm giving it to you
So whatever you do

Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart

Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart

Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart, don't shatter my heart
Don't shatter my heart
