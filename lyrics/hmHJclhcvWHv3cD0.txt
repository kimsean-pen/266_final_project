I had what I thought
Were clear open eyes, bright blue
Vision not of a light
Carrying pictures to lay on you

Close up eyes let him in to mind opening
It's the edge of love
You can't unthink a thought
Either it's there or not

Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's on earth
The breadth and the height
Of an undiscovered first

Now hopeful mountaineers
Climb up to eclipse the light of the old sun
'Cause it has been said
The two would know once the two'd been told

Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's on earth
The breadth and the height
Of an undiscovered first

Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell her what's in store
The height and the breadth
Is it wrong to want more?

Is this the right mountain
For us to climb?
Is this the way you live
For you to be mine?

Is this the right river
For us to ford?
Is this the way you live
For me to be yours?

Is this the way you live
For me to be yours?
Is this the way you live?
Is it wrong to want more?

Is this the way you live
For me to be yours?
Is this the way you live?
Is it wrong to want more?
