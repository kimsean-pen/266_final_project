If you don't want to stay and
If you don't want them to question you
Lay him on his side, don't freak while
Eyes roll back to bone and the mouth is blue
Maybe it's the way we feel and
I wanna love the sky and the universe
But that don't get the door 'round here and
It don't even come close too

If you don't want nobody
If you don't want anyone to come through
I can understand, it would be
Something you don't like when I brush up to you
If you don't want that feature
If it's not right, you can skip any beat
And you'd understand it would be
Something I don't like when you come up to me

What is in the fold of pleasure
Making it the point 'cause you never let go
The sun is nailed hard to the weather
It rips up the cars and the homes and the roads
No triple just import red, yeah
The people don't know what it is to be
Living off the dins and stink, yeah
Living off the puke in the rogue dead sea

If you don't want nobody
If you don't want anyone to come through
I can understand, it would be
Something you don't like when I brush up to you
If you don't want that feature
If it's not right, you can skip any beat
And you'd understand it would be
Something I don't like when you come up to me

If you don't want nobody
If you don't want anyone to come through
I can understand, it would be
Something you don't like when I brush up to you
If you don't want that feature
If it's not right, you can skip any beat
And you'd understand it would be
Something I don't like when you come up to me

Something I don't like when you come up to me
Something I don't like when you come up to me
Something I don't like when you come up to me
