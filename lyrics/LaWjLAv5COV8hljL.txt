Morning
Five o'clock in morning
Looking up at the ceiling
Maybe my head upon the want

You got
In my head in I can't stop
So I making my ears pop
Cause your standad I let you go

I came here for life
But you pay no attention
So I keep on wishing you eh

Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh

Don't wanna be with nobody, nobody but you...

Since you left me

Why now
But you why won't you back now
I'm a girl and I am proud
Tell me why do I feel so down
Let go
Oh baby, gotta let go
But I'm too sentimental
It's a circle in under cloud

You faded away
But I still got affection
Did I give the motor It bear

Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh

Don't wanna be with nobody, nobody but you...

Since you left me

And Nobody here
Nobody in my bed
Nobody to read me
No bedtime stories

Lonely the dark
Got this is in for me
Can someone please turning the life

Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh
Since you left me (Since you left me)
Since you left me oh
Since you left me oh

Don't wanna be with nobody, nobody but you...

Since you left me
