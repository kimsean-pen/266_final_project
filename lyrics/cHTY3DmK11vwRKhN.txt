Walked into hard times
Stepped into hard times
All of me is hard time
Welcome to hard times

Waiting for the world end
Waiting for the light to bend like stars
Waiting for the silent end
Bringing us a fate that's just so hard

Walked into hard times
Stepped into hard times
All of me is hard time
Welcome to hard times

Waiting for the sign of love
Waiting for the light inside the fire
Waiting for the time of love
Waiting for the truth you said was higher

Oh and the loves are open
Oh and the dust is done
Like it was before apocalypse
Oh counts will lift us then
Will we'll see it when it's done

Walked into hard times
Stepped into hard times
All of me is hard time
Welcome to hard times

Walked into hard times
Stepped into hard times
All of me is hard time
Welcome to hard times

Walked into hard times
Stepped into hard times
All of me is hard time
Welcome to hard times

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
Say what you mean
Mean what you say
Say what you mean
Mean what you say
The ocean waves
Say what you mean
Mean what you say
