Alone and stranded, out of time
Are you receiving me alright?
Out in the cold Arcturan night
Why are you leaving me behind?

Lost to the void, all sense of time
Was there no meaning to my life?
The air I breathe is running dry
Don't think I'll last another night

I can't hear you if you're calling out my name
I can't see you and I'm feeling just the same
I can't see you, I can't hear you, I'll believe it when I die

When I was young, I dreamed I'd fly
I wish I'd had the nerve to try
I see my life before my eyes
All that I've loved and I've despised

I can't hear you if you're calling out my name
I can't see you and I'm feeling just the same
I can't see you, I can't hear you, I'll believe it when I die

Well I'm a million miles away
From the whos and whys that used to matter
Throw it all away
You could throw it all away
If I had just one more day
I would speak my mind, goodbye forever
All I have to say
And I'd mean all that I'd say
And to those that I've betrayed
Before I close my eyes and sleep forever
Sorry for the pain
But you might've done the same
And I'd thank you for today
And for all the moments not remembered
Wish I could repay
But you're a million miles away

This is the captain of the Pike
Are you receiving me alright
