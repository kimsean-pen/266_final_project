Scream!

Fell forth, destroy the source
Can't see and my voice is hoarse
Tried to wash all your hands of us

But you should know better than to leave us in disgust
Let me take you right to the point
All you ever do is dedicate the disjoint
That does it the time has arrived

Take it or leave it you better not side
You did it again
All you ever did was doubt
What do you want?

Let me tell you what it's all about
One life
Nine hearts

And eighteen hands that'll rip you all apart
We're here to decimate
To show you all we will never fall
It's gonna get serious and critical

Don't stop because the feeling is terminal

Scream!
Scream like you never have before!
Scream!
Scream till you can't scream anymore!
Scream!
Scream like your throat is bleeding!
Scream!

Scream till your heart stops beating!
Scream for me!

Get off of me and get away

Show the whole damn world this will never die
No matter how the energies scatter
Got to know nothing exists but the dream

Give it all till there's nothing left to give
Save it all, quit saving you
If you're going to let the pain inside

Never underestimate the way you live your life

Scream!
Scream like you never have before!
Scream!
Scream till you can't scream anymore!
Scream!
Scream like your throat is bleeding!
Scream!

Scream till your heart stops beating!
Scream for me!

All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?

Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way
All our lives!

All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?

Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way

This stress is a feeling that you can't compress!
Everything you're going through is total stress!
Are you going to be a momentary king or just a run around?
Or will you handle the matter and prove you exist?

All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!

Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!

Save it all and make a better way
All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!

Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way

Scream!
Scream!
Scream!
Scream!
