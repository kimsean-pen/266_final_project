You thinkin' local or you thinkin' international
You dreamin' big or dreamin' little
If you haven't picked a side
Then you're standin' in the middle

You're causing problems or you're solving it

You got a vision or you blind
If you can't make a decision please make up your mind

You either losin' it or winnin' it
Receivin' it or sendin' it
Stiff as a stick
Or you're flexible and bendin' it
Endin' or beginnin' it
For real or pretendin' it
Living like a [?] connected to the internet
You could be the smartest with the most intellect
Or you could be the dumbest livin', stupid failing every test
You settle for the weakest or aim to be the strongest
You procrastinate and be a pro of makin' progress

You either stoppin' or you goin'
Livin' in the dark
Or you shinin' or you glowin'
Speedin' or you slowin'
Hidin' or you showin'
Rentin' or you leasin'
Or you buyin' or your own it

You either smilin' or you frownin'
You either serious or clownin'
You either swimmin' or you drownin'
Standin' in the valley
Or you towerin' the mountain

You either lazy or you hustlin'

You either hatin' or you lovin' them
Smilin' or huggin' or your anger mean muggin' 'em
You either first or behind
You either comin' late or you're showin' up on time
You got vision or you blind
If you can't make a decision, please make up your mind
