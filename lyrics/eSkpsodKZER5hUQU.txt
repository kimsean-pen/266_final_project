She was built with a brain
and some swagger.
A little scream, little cry
little laughter.
She's a ten
I'm a joke in my own mind.
But she still loves to dance
with my punch lines.

This love found us
now I see it.
This love up down.
Please believe.

Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
and
Baby cuz I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
Baby I'm a little confused
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
and
Baby, it's a wonderful news.
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah

Oh, it's not that you should care.
I just wanted you to know.

I'm a fight with myself
till I'm bleeding.
Just a taste of your skin
starts the healing.
Anyone from my past
get your ammo.
Find my sun in the dark side
of my shadow.

This love found us
now I see it.
This love up down.
Please believe.

Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
