I'm coming out of the void
Along a spiral trace
Escorted by a thousand souls
Remembered but still unknown

I don't need wings
To reach the sky
And I don't need hands
To hold you tight

My youth's my defense
And pureness my weapon
I'm Lilith's son
I've got the moon in my veins

Son of Lilith

You don't have to listen
To understand
And you won't find words
If you want to explain
