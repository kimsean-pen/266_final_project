When it's said and done, you're the only one (you're the only one)
And when it's said and done, you're the only one (you're the only one), you're the only one

Whoever said this pain, would ever go away
Didn't know what it meant to, be here without you
Is everything you see, reminding you of me?
Does it hurt when you breathe too?
'Cause it does when I do, cause it does when I do

When anybody says your name I wanna run away,
I keep remembering I can't forget you
It doesn't matter when I try it happens anyway,
It's been forever and I can't forget you
With every single day, it won't go away
The way I feel about you
And when it's said and done, you're the only one
And I can't regret you, so I can't forget you

When it's said and done, you're the only one (you're the only one)
And when it's said and done, you're the only one (you're the only one), you're the only one

I hate to feel this way, my days all feel the same
And yesterday was proof, that tomorrow will too
No matter what they say, can't drink it all away
Cause all that I do, is think about you, is think about you

When anybody says your name I wanna run away,
I keep remembering I can't forget you
It doesn't matter when I try it happens anyway,
It's been forever and I can't forget you
With every single day, it won't go away
The way I feel about you
And when it's said and done, you're the only one
And I can't regret you, so I can't forget you
(So I can forget you)

Stop haunting my dreams
Please set me free
Stop haunting my dreams
Please set me free
(You're the only one)

When anybody says your name I wanna run away,
I keep remembering I can't forget you
It doesn't matter when I try it happens anyway,
It's been forever and I can't forget you
With every single day, it won't go away
The way I feel about you
And when it's said and done, you're the only one
And I can't regret you
Stop haunting my dreams (It's been forever and I can't forget you)
Please set me free (It's been forever and I can't forget you)
Stop haunting my dreams (It's been forever and I can't forget you)
Please set me free (It's been forever and I can't forget you)
