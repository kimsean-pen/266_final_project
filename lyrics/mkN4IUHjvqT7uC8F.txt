You act like you don't know me
When you see me on the street
Making like I turn you off
When I know you think I'm sweet

It don't have to be like that
I guess you're insecure
If you say what's on your mind
I'm an in for sure

So I walk a little slower
And I try to catch your eye
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by
There may never be a sign
No flashing neon lights
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right

So,

Why not (why not)
Take a crazy chance
Why not (why not)
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You might lose a lot
So,
Why not, why not

Why not take a crazy chance?
Why not take a crazy chance?

You always dress in yellow
When you want to dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told
You keep waiting where you are
But what ya never know
Let's just get into your car
And go baby go

So,

Why not (why not)
Take a crazy chance
Why not (why not)
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment
You might lose a lot
So,
Why not, why not

Oh,
I could be the one for you
Oh ya,
Maybe yes, maybe no
Oh,
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is you gotta let me know, Oh

You'll never get to heaven
Or even to L.A.
If you don't believe there's a way

Why not (why not)
Take a star from the sky
Why not (why not)
Spread your wings and fly

It might take a little
And it might take a lot
But,
Why not
Why not

Why not (take a crazy chance)
Take a crazy chance
Why not (do a crazy dance)
Do a crazy dance

If you lose the moment
You might lose a lot
So,
Why not, why not
