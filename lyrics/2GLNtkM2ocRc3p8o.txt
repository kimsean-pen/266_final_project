I wanna get high with you
in my room
and I want it to rain
I wanna stay in bed all day
I will change my name
Counting down the weeks till you
until you come home
A miracle's gonna come save me
It's the only way
I wanna build a place in you
where I can be made new
I wanna sleep until it ends
I won't make new friends
