The seas have parted
The endings started
The sky has turned to black.
A killing spree through eternity
The Devil stabs you in the back
It's midnight now you must escape somehow
Torture is his leisure
Don't try to hide he'll make you subside
As he exchanges pain for pleasure

Pain for pleasure, he's the hunter you're the game
Pain for pleasure, Satan is his name!
Watch out!
