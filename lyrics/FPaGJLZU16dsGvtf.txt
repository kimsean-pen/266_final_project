We are strong, young and ready
We can't know where we're heading
Far away and out of focus
Life goes by before we notice

Through the dark 'till early morning
In my heart I hear it calling
Watch the sky turn our faces
The night goes by as dawn embraces

And we burn and we shine
Caught up in the light
So don't hide your eyes
Look into the fire

Cause it feels so right, so good, unstoppable
We're so high, so close to heaven
Tonight we're so bright
You and I, you and I, both blind

We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Staring at the sun

We are one, we are golden
All our lives made for this moment
Before we know it we're that warning
The past is gone, the future's calling

Cause it feels so right, so good, unstoppable
We're so high, so close to heaven
Tonight we're so bright
You and I, you and I, both blind

We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Staring at the sun

We burn and we shine
So don't hide your eyes

Feels so right
We're so high
Tonight
You and I, you and I, both blind

We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
We're staring at the sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Sun-sun-sun-sun-sun
Staring at the sun

We burn
We shine
