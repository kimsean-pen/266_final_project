Do you ever look back
And no one's there
I feel thunder
I won't pretend you're not
Shaking up my world

No I took you for granted
But now I see
So let me be the man I know I can be

I've been changing
Can't believe how long that I've been waiting
After every single dream has faded
I can bring them back to you
Hearts done breaking
I promise I'm a risk worth taking
This time it won't be complicated
Cause all I want is you
We were made to last

Do you ever ponder
The sparks we had
No explanation
Just two madly in love wild cards
Playing against the odds

No I took you for granted
But now I see
So let me be the man I know I can be

I've been changing
Can't believe how long that I've been waiting
After every single dream has faded
I can bring them back to you
Hearts done breaking
I promise I'm a risk worth taking
This time it won't be complicated
Cause all I want is you
We were made to last

I paid for all my mistakes
And I know you suffered all I can say
We were made to last
Come back to me

I've been changing
Can't believe how long that I've been waiting
After every single dream has faded
I can bring them back to you
Hearts done breaking
I promise I'm a risk worth taking
This time it won't be complicated
Cause all I want is you
We were made to last
Come back to me
