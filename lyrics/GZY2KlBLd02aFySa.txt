You
You

I remember when
Way back then
We were just friends, friends
A bottle of gin
Now we're going in
Playin' old school jams (jams)
Layin' next to you

I give you my heart and my head
'Cause you know that we just can't keep
Our hands to ourselves

Time stops
Panties drop
Eyes roll back like the hands of a clock
So can we turn
Back the hands of time
Tonight
'Cause I'm
Feeling in the mood
Like it's 1969
Let's go back in time

Let's go back in time
Like it's 1969

Wake up in bed
With cold sweats
Ooh you got me restless
Head up on your chest
I'm your temptress
Now we're both breathless
Layin' next to you

I give you my heart and my head
Now we in too deep to keep
This lovin' to ourselves

Time stops
Panties drop
Eyes roll back like the hands of a clock
So can we turn
Back the hands of time
Tonight
'Cause I'm
Feeling in the mood
Like it's 1969
Let's go back in time

Like it's 1969
I just wanna do this, do this
Do this, do this, do this
Like it's 1969

Usually I'd be on my best but
You, bring out the wild side of me
I wanna give you everythin'
I wanna show you everythin'
I, move positions to our favorite year

Time stops
Panties drop
Eyes roll back like the hands of a clock
So can we turn
Back the hands of time
Tonight
'Cause I
I'm feeling in the mood
Like it's 1969
Let's go back in time
Rewind, our minds
Let's go back in time

I just wanna do this
Like it's 1969
Rewind, our minds
I just wanna do this
Like it's 1969
