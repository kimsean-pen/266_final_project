I wanna dance, I wanna sing this song,
I wanna feel it, all night long.

I wanna dance, I wanna sing this song,
I'm bringing fresh air all over the world.

I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, come by my side, no time to hide.
I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, feeling the vibe, no time to hide.

So I come to no Man's land,
I don't want no war,
I just got the mic in my hands,
I just wanna make you feel right, cool and calm.

And I bring this brand new style
straight from my heart,
taking the bad minds apart,
only the sky lives a star.

I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, come by my side, no time to hide.
I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, feeling the vibe, no time to hide.

If you're feeling the blues tonight,
let me in I gonna sing you something new.
Close your eyes let your body fly,
I'm telling you there is no drama in this room.

You can't deny and see your feet
dancing, moving to the rhythm of this tune.
The less you think, the more you feel,
let's jus follow the beat under the moon.

I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, come by my side, no time to hide.
I have some fresh air, take a deep breath
I have some music, feeling the vibe, no time to hide.

I wanna dance, I wanna sing this song,
I wanna feel it, all night long.

I wanna dance, I wanna sing this song,
I'm bringing fresh air all over the world.
