I've been drinking
Just to settle down
We keep sinking
Into the dark of the hollow
The light breaks overhead
But we won't follow
I keep drinking
Under endless clouds

I've been thinking
Just to sort it out
We keep dreaming
In the wake of the shadows
The sin has come undone
But I won't let go
I keep drinking

Under endless clouds

There's nothing wrong with me
There's something wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with me
We're all alone
There's something wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
There's something wrong with me
We're not alone

There's nothing wrong with me
There's something wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with me
We're all alone
There's something wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
There's something wrong with me
We're not alone
