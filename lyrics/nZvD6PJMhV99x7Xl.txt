Tell everyone in town
Tell everyone you know
I did this to you
I broke your heart
I crushed your dreams
I took them
They are mine
And they are worthless
I feel nothing
No remorse
No regret
I would do it again
Tell them again
Be the victim
The eternal victim
My boot pressed hard
Against the back of your weak will
My will pressed like cold steel
Against your soft skull
