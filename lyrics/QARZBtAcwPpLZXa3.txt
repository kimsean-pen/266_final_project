I was nowhere near ready when all it ended
So I hoped we could find a new day, cannot live without you

You gave me the chance, time and again, in
vain
Now my feelings for you, every tear, every smile, paid in full
Break the chain, but no longer can I take the pain

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I've waited, hated, blamed it all on you

Needed to be strong, yet I was always too weak
So I can only blame myself for this state we are in
I will take what you have for me now, if it's not too late
Did you change? I did too. Love can grow from the last grain

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I've waited, hated, blamed it all on...

You...
I need you... less and less...
Every day feeds this moral decay
Yet I have grown to love you even more

I fall back, and I turn another cheek.
You mouth the words you're not ready to speak
You're scared of me now; no I never had a clue
That I'd become so much stronger than you.

I will take - what you have - for me now, if it's not too late

If you like, I will leave; I will not miss the last train again

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I've waited, hated, blamed it all on you...

It's hard for me to love your face right now
I'm waiting, hating, needing being
Me...
I need you... less and less...
Every day leads us farther away...
From that moment
It's hard for me to hate myself right now
Finally I'm understanding me
One day we may have a new "me and you"
But first I need to learn to love me too...
