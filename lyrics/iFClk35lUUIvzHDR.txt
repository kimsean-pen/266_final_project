If you got the cash I got the time
I'm just a phone call away
You've been dried up for a long long time
With my hands intime I'll make you howl like a wolf
CALL ME!
Like a genie in the bottle
I'll rub you the right way
CALL ME!
With PayPal or cash
I want to be your backdoor man
I don't care about your present or your past
I love you as long as your money loves me back
I'll meet you at home, or at a sleazy motel
And I'll show you what your boyfriend don't understand
CALL ME!
Like a genie in the bottle
I'll rub you the right way
CALL ME!
With PayPal or cash
I want to be your backdoor man
Who said money can't buy you happiness?
It's your fantasy
Just give me a call
(hello?)
(hellooo?)
(HELLOOO??)
CALL ME!
Like a genie in the bottle
I'll rub you the right way
CALL ME!
With PayPal or cash
I want to be your backdoor man
CALL ME!
Like a genie in the bottle
I'll rub you the right way
CALL ME!
With PayPal or cash
I want to be your backdoor man
