January is the color of her skin
February are her lips so inviting
Silk hair as short as her fuse
She's been damaged, she's been misused

Her eyes reflect like the rain on the pavement
I take control, she explodes, sink into her depths
I'm the tremble in her voice when she attempts to speak
Fixate on the frailty

We lie awake and watch it grow
She hesitates to grab a hold
Her body shakes, her breath is cold
To keep her safe is all I know

Her lipstick stains like acid rain
Dissolving away my sense of restraint
The streetlamps burned through the cloak of the fog
Concealing the violence, I've been stung by the wasp

So come to me
No sense of restraint
So come for me
Come with me and disappear without a trace

Criminal, in how I crave the way she tastes
I'm the rapture in her head when she attempts to sleep
It's haunting, she kills me

No time or place to take it slow
And my head aches but I refuse to go
Her face as soft as snow
She looks so lost but she feels like home

Her lipstick stains like acid rain
Dissolving away my sense of restraint
Streetlamps burned through the cloak of the fog
Concealing the violence, I've been stung by the wasp

So come to me
No sense of restraint
So come for me
I will wait endlessly

I will break you carefully
So take me harmfully
You fit so perfect
I will wait

Her lipstick stains like acid rain
Dissolving the way my sense of restraint
The streetlamps burn through the cloak of the fog
Concealing the violence, I've been stung...

Some hurt me again, it's not worth saving
The heart that I've spent my whole life breaking
The windshield cracks through the cloak of the fog
Concealing in silence, I've been stung by the wasp
