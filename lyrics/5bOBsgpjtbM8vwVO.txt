Wake up, this is the mankind of
Morning shake-up
Feel your fingers fumble
Hear your belly rumble

Come on all you keepers
Kick off all your slippers
Before it slips your mind
Open up your peepers
Put on your wind cheaters
The weather is not too kind
But hey now

Hey na na na, hey na na
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Ain't going nowhere
Hey na na na, hey na na
Just form a circle, come on now
Hey na na na, hey na na
Just like the world

Now is forever
Can't we make it better
Is it up to you and me
Eternity

Raise up your eyebrows
From the ground
Hear your head rap
Feel your feet tap

Let your legs take you
To where your heart aches to go
Now get to move on
Can't catch your beat
For time 'cause you see
'Cause I'mma slide your shoes on
Hey now

Hey na na na, hey na na
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Ain't going nowhere
Hey na na na, hey na na
Just form a circle, come on now
Hey na na na, hey na na
Just like the world

Now is forever
Can't we make it better
Is it up to you and me
Eternity

Sideway Shuffle
Sideway Shuffle, Sideway Shuffle
I ain't go nowhere, love
(Hey na na na, hey na na)
I ain't go nowhere, love
(Hey na na na, hey na na)
Just form a circle
(Hey na na na, hey na na)
Just like the world

Sideway Shuffle, Sideway
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Sideway Shuffle
Hey na na na, hey na na
Hey na na na, hey na na
