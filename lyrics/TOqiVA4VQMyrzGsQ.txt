I've got a lot to talk about
My disdain for the Pacific threw my name into distant mouths
The heart is heavy when the words are weighing you down
I'm so fucking far down

Crosscheck, let the turbines shake the overheads
It took fifteen hours and a missed connection
Overwhelmed and I'm overstepping bounds

I've had a lot to think about
The questions linger but I'm too scared to speak out
Like what could you possibly see in a failure like me?

Make no mistake, the winds have changed
And I'll be catching the resulting tidal waves
On an empty slate to the landlocked states

Crosscheck, let the turbines shake the overheads
It took fifteen hours and a missed connection
Overwhelmed and I'm overstepping bounds

And if you're picking up on the misdirection
Keep the status quo with an ear against the ground
And if you let me stay I'll keep out of your way
I'll be the empty canvas if you be the paint
And if you let me stay I'll keep out of your way
My space is yours to occupate
