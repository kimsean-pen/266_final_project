Whenever the day will break
Another mistake will take hold
Of every inch of an honest state
A hell of a case you'd make
If only the tides weren't so strong
You're letting it in all your darkest ways

Now how does it end?

Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how to get it though
Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how...

To get in a constant phase
Of digging a heart-shaped grave for ourselves
Waste it all away
Inside of a king-sized cage
Enough of the comforts of home
But none of it all takes the bars away

Now how does it end?

Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how to get it though
Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how to get it

Hold on unless you want to go it alone
Hold on unless you want to go it alone
Hold on unless you want to go it alone
Hold on unless you want to go it alone
Hold on unless you want to go it alone

Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how to get it though
Not all we're building up is indestructible
But all we're hoping for
We'll know how to get it
