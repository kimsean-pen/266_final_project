May I have your attention? I got something to say
Got here in this station and Someone took my love away
May I have your attention? I think I shouldn't be afraid
But in this freaky station, I saw, you took my love away
Now it's yours
Now it's yours
Now it's yours
Now it's yours
Now it's yours
Now it's yours
Man, if I were you I would run
'Cause my love is tough, you should hide and disappear
Man, if I were you I would run
'Cause my love is tough, you should hide and disappear
I've lost a little love on a central station
I've lost a little love on a central station
