I've been feeling anxious, ain't been feeling right
I've been staying up, yeah, staying up all night
I've been calling exes, trying disconnect
I can't cut the wires, running 'round my head, head

Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect

Yeah, I need to take a breath, oh
Yeah, I need to disconnect, oh, oh, oh

I go all out night, yeah, I go home alone
Sleeping in my bed, head is at my phone (phone)
Looking at a screen, glowing in the dark (glowing in the dark)
I just wanna dream, but I can't seem to switch off

Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect

Yeah, I need to take a breathe, oh
Yeah, I need to disconnect, oh, oh, oh

Feel my body shutting down
I don't wanna hear a sound
Feel my battery running low
I don't wanna be alone

Yeah, I need it take a breath
Yeah, I need to disconnect
Feel my fuse about to blow
Babe, I need to hit the road
Don't know where I wanna go
I don't wanna be alone
Living through a telephone
Like a body covered in chrome
Feel my body shutting down
I don't wanna hear a sound
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Yeah, I need to disconnect

Wooh
Wooh
Wooh
Wooh
