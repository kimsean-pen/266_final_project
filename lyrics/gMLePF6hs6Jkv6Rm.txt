Please give me a redemption song
I need one real bad
No one seems to write them now
That John and Bob are dead
All I know is
We need one right now

If life's another game of chess
We lost a couple pieces
The ones who had a dream for us
The legends who will lead us
All I know is
We need them right now

The darkness makes it hard
To see the light
But the time is always right
To do what's right
If you only knew
I'm just as scared as you
You're not the only one

Is it ignorant to say that war
Is just no longer needed
And childish to think that love
Gives life a higher meaning
All I know is
We need love right now

The people we have given trust in
End up corrupt and rotten
They start with great ideals
But on the way that's all forgotten
All I know is
We need hope right now

The darkness makes it hard
To see the light
But the time is always right
To do what's right
If you only knew
I'm just as scared as you
You're not the only one

You're not the only one
Who's had enough
Give me your hand
So we can stand up
You're not the only one
Done waiting
For changes to come

(You're not the only one who's had enough)
The darkness makes it hard to see the light
(Give me your hand so we can stand up)
But the time is always right to do what's right
(You're not the only one done waiting)
If you only knew, I'm just as scared as you
(For changes to come)
You're not the only one

Please give me a redemption song
I need one real bad
No one seems to write them
Now that John and Bob are dead
All I know is
We need one right now
