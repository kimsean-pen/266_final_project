So, everybody, get down, just got out of rehab

I'm so high
And I'm so high

Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more

Oh shit, damn, had a couple too many
Didn't have shit planned, mixing vodka with Henny
Now I can't sit down 'cause I'm already spinning
Acting like I'm rich, man, spending every penny
So everybody get down like you just got out of rehab
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and knee-pads
'Cause I'm so high, I can't feel my face
'Cause me and weed go together like Diddy and Mase

So, everybody, get down like you just got out of rehab
And, everybody, get down like you just got out of rehab

Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more

I fuck with a six-pack, bong, or a zig-zag
Shit, don't puke, here, choke on a Tic-Tac
I walked a line but my eyes are crooked
A couple more drinks, bitch, now you're good-looking
Motherfucking real Hollywood, not some B-list actor
I'm faded as fuck, watch me moonwalk backwards
It's a house party, Los Angeles
So fuck the 5-0, my middle fingers are up

So, everybody, get down like you just got out rehab
And, everybody, get down like you just got out rehab

Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more

Blowing and banging every day in the low, low
I roll slow 'cause I'm allergic to popo
I smoke the douj when I chill with the Cholos
And y'all smoke pole 'cause you're chilling with homos
I sip Patr√≥n, and I chase it with SoCo
Pants so low, got my balls in a choke-hold
Bitches getting naked and they're posing for photos
And hopping on my dick like my shit is a pogo

So, everybody, get down like you just got out of rehab
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and knee-pads
'Cause I'm so high, I can't feel my face
'Cause me and weed go together like Charlie and J-Dog
So, everybody, get down like you just got out of rehab
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and knee-pads
'Cause I'm so high, I can't feel my face
'Cause me and weed go together like Charlie and J-Dog

Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, the bottle's low, and I can't feel my face no more
Oh no, we up in smoke, and I can't feel my face no more

Oh no, I'm so high
Oh no, I'm so high
Oh no, I'm so high
Oh no, I'm so high
