It's your uneasy mind
That's been making you blind
I won't lie to you

You've got trouble inside
Baby, I've nothing to hide
I've been good to you

All the way from New York City
Calling me constantly
He's asking if I'm sitting pretty
Waiting patiently

Darling, I would not forsake me
I'm telling you honestly, yeah yeah

What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
It's time to set me free
What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind

How can you judge
If I don't miss you enough?
Any fool can see

If you can't trust yourself
Can't trust nobody else
Did you lie to me?
Yeah, did you lie to me?

Even when we are together
Still the jealousy
You know, I just wanna dance forever
And you wanna take that from me

Suppose you really think you're clever
Stealing my liberty, yeah, yeah

What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
It's time to set me free
What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind

I got much to think about
Looking into you
I need to know when you're going out
And all the things you do
You may not be guilty by default
And have the nerve to question me
When it's you who could get caught

What do you think I'm gonna find
When I'm checkin' up on you?
Maybe you've got something to hide
Though I think I always knew
What do you think I'm gonna find
When I'm checkin' up on you?
Maybe you've got something to hide
Though I think I always knew

What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
It's time to set me free
What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind

What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
It's time to set me free
What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind

What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
It's time to set me free
What do you think you're gonna find
Checkin' up on me?
Baby, you've got a troubled mind
