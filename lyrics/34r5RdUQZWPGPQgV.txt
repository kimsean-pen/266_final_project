Yeah I said it's alright
I won't forget
All the times
I waited patiently for you
As you do just what you choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight my dear

Yeh I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
That you could be in love
With almost anyone
You think people are the greatest fun
And I will be alone again tonight for you

Hey I said its alright
You know I won't forget
All the times
I waited patiently for you
Now, you do just what
You choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight its true
