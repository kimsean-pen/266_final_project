Oh-oh
Yeah-ei-yeah

I'll push, to see how far I'll make you go;
Then pull, you like when I am craving more.
You know, that I'm the kind of girl need.
So prove how much you wanna be with me.

I know you like it, you'll be my everything.
If you don't fight it, relax and come with me.
I control you're body and mind;
Look into my eyes, I've got you hypnotized.

Like a pup-pup-pup-pup-puppet on a string.
Make you dance, make you sing,
Buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you do-do-do just anything;
What I want, what I dream.
I just pull a string, you'll come back to me.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...

You'll do, anything I want you to;
Don't move, unless of course I ask you to.
So bring me back something nice, something that I like.
You know I'll treat you right, I'll treat you right-right.

I know you like it, you'll be my everything.
If you don't fight it, relax and come with me.
I control you're body and mind;
Look into my eyes, I've got you hypnotized.

Like a pup-pup-pup-pup-puppet on a string.
Make you dance, make you sing,
Buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you do-do-do just anything;
What I want, what I dream.
I just pull a string, you'll come back to me.

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...

If you're gonna talk back, if you're gonna talk back;
Pack your bags, pack your bags;
Just like that, just like that.
You can't run away, you'll do exactly what I say.

Like a pup-pup-pup-pup-puppet on a string. (On a string, yeah)
Make you dance, make you sing,
Buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things. (Buy me fancy things)
I can make you do-do-do just anything; (Make you do just anything)
What I want, what I dream.
I just pull a string, you'll come back to me.

Like a pup-pup-pup-pup-puppet on a string. (ohh ...)
Make you dance, make you sing,
Buy me fancy things, buy me fancy things.
I can make you do-do-do just anything;
What I want, what I dream. (Yeah)
I just pull a string, you'll come back to me. (Whoo)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
I'll make you sing, yeah!
Buy me fancy things, oh!

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
I can make you do-do-do just anything;
What I want, what I dream.
I just pull a string, you'll come back to me. (Whoo)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la ...
Pup-pup-puppet on a string ...
