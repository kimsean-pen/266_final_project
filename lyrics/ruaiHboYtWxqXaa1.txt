Well she's thirty-six in the bust
Twenty-eight in the waist
Forty-four in the hips
She's got real crazy legs
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
And I'm telling you people
She's something fine that you really ought to see

Well she's not too tall
Complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out
The way she wears her hair
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
Well you upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well I've tried to describe her
It's hard to start
I'd better stop now
Because I've got a weak heart
You upset me baby
Yes you upset me baby
Well like being hit by a falling tree
Woman what you do to me
