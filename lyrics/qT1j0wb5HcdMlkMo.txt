The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge
That cuts through the air

You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me, why
You don't have to care, oh, oh

When the lightnin' strikes again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again

You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
Lost your mind
And then you lose control

By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go, oh, oh

When the lightnin' strikes again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again

When the lightnin' strikes again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again

(Lightnin' strikes again)
[Incomprehensible]
(Lightnin' strikes again)
[Incomprehensible]
(Lightnin' strikes again)
[Incomprehensible]

(Lightnin' strikes again)
[Incomprehensible]
(Lightnin' strikes again)
[Incomprehensible]
(Lightnin' strikes)
