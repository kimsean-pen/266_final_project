In a silent way we lie under heavy drapes
Just to mask away the light from the coming day

When, when, when we're older
When, when, when we're older
Can I still come over

Hold our naked sheets, our colored breathes we'll see
Your hair knots on top of me, oh how the heart it beats

When, when, when we're older
When, when, when we're older
Can I still come over
Can I still come over
Can I still come over
Can I still come over

When we're older can I still come over
When we're older can I still come over
When, when, when we're older
When, when, when we're older
