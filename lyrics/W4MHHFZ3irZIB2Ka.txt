A mass suppression depressed by life unsure what he's to live for
But then away came the better days when life opened its new doors
Struggling for a way everyday to live life not to fail but succeed
Overcoming on overwhelming load of power and greed
Break the chains
That grab one's soul
Break these chains
That take control
Break these chains
That take control

Wasting all that's left of a day
Watching time just fly away on his own
Dreams are surpassing him by
Why not live life to it's fullest and give it a try

How much does one simply have to conquer what he's become?
And how many others can say my fears have become phobias?
How much should one take for granted?
He's changed by life in order to see that he can succeed
And how can you?

We'll break the chains
We'll break the chains

A mass suppression depressed by life unsure what he's to live for
But then away came the better days when life opened its new doors
Struggling for a way everyday to live life not to fail but to succeed
Overcome

I will believe
I will believe
I will believe
I will succeed
