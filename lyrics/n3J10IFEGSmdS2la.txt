Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond
Emperium
Behold my coming
The fullmoon rise above me
Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky
Guarding treasures from forbidden light
I still remember, though ages ago it seems
The first time I entered the gates
The revelation of ritual death
By which I became devine
Sacrifice of the life I had among the flesh of light
And now I enter again
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see
In ecstsy I mock the world
Suddenly I memorize
Asking what I left behind
Nothing
Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing ever end?
Never
Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Eternally
