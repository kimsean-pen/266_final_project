They got a lotta girls
Who know they got it goin' on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see that
You're the only one I really want
And everything I need
Is everything you do

Any girl walk by don't matter
'Cause you're looking so much better
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy
She could be a super model
Every magazine the cover
She'll never ever mean a thing to me

She's no you
Oh, no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
Oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got

'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you

They gotta a lotta girls
Who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do
The way you move
You're more than beautiful
And just wanna let you know
That all I ever need
Is what I've got with you

Any girl walk by don't matter
Everytime you're looking better
I think you're perfect
There ain't nothing I would change
She could be super model
Every magazine the cover
She'll never ever take my heart away

She's no you
Oh, no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
Oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got

'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you

No one's ever gonna get to me, oh
The way you do
Now baby can't you see
That you are the one
The only one
Who's ever made me feel this way
Nothing's ever coming even close, no
No one's ever been comparable to you
Oh yeah

I don't want nothing I don't got
I don't need nothing but you
I can't get more than you give me
So don't stop anything you do

You're all that, all that
And then some
You know what just what I need
And no girl, no place and nowhere
Could ever mean a thing to me

She's no you
Oh, no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
Oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got

'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
(She's no you girl)
She's no you

She's no you
(They got a lot of girls who know they got it goin' on)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
(Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want)
I'm satisfied with the one I've got

'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you
