Deep

Feel my heart burning
Deep inside... yearning
I know it is coming

A fettered heart, waking
Tainted youth, fading
Leave it all behind
Delirious again
Mesmerize my senses
Souls entwine one more time

All our times will come
Certain oblivion
Leaving nothing but the memories of
All the things you give
They're all you'll leave behind
Within their mind

Open laughter held in distant days
Eternal stars have changed
I know that it can't be the same
There's no lament for you tonight

Feel my heart burning
Deep inside... yearning
I know it is coming

All our times will come
Searching oblivion
Leaving nothing but the memories of
All the things you give
They're all you'll leave behind
Within their mind

Time recedes every day
You can search your soul but you won't see
As we pass ever on, on our way
Towards some blank infinity
