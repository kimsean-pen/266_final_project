I'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump it's all over
A cautionary tale for you (ah)

(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)

I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of Dover
And then I'd let you push me over

CHORUS
And if that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over
And if that is the fact, then in actual fact
It's not where it's at, and it's over
Yes, it is

(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)

And now the bluebirds are over
Over the white cliffs of Dover
And when you push me over
Don't bury me, I'm not worth anything

La-la-la-la la la la la la
La-la-la-la la la la la la

CHORUS

(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
(Hah-ah)
