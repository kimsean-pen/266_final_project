Standing in a world with the street lights on
I don't keep my sneakers white
All I really got is a name in the park
To get me to another life

And I wonder what you're doing tonight

I'll burn the house down and I'll leave it behind
I didn't need the money but the money was nice
I need a countdown when the fire is high
Sitting on the curve and it's hot tonight

IT'S HOT TONIGHT
IT'S HOT TONIGHT

Do I miss a breath in the side of the street
Tomorrow seems a year away
Sitting by the fire and I save you a seat
You're not keeping track a day

And I wonder what you're doing tonight

I'll burn the house down by the end of the tonight
My pockets full of nothing and it's keeping me light
I need a countdown when the fire is high
Sitting on the curve and it's hot tonight

IT'S HOT TONIGHT
IT'S HOT TONIGHT

Drinking in the park
Staring at the stars like a satellite dish
I had a good time
And I'm ready to die

Nothing is enough to anyone else
I'll wait until they pass me by
Standing in a world with the street lights on
Watch me slip out of sight

And I wonder what you're doing tonight

I'll burn the house down and I'll leave it behind
I didn't need the money but the money was nice
I need a countdown as I'm watching it die
Sitting on the curve and it's hot tonight

IT'S HOT TONIGHT
IT'S HOT TONIGHT

IT'S HOT TONIGHT
IT'S HOT TONIGHT
