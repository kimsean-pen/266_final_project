What if I told you, that we're all the same
If no one is equal, in this endless game
What if I told you, it's out of your hands
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed

We all want the same

You again, the future, has failed us, it's coming round again
The sickness, the sadness, the cycles have to win
Somehow, we're tilted and the ringing in my ears
Won't go away, it's happening again

What if I told you, that we're all the same
If no one is equal, in this endless game
What if I told you, it's out of your hands
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed

We all want the same
We all want the same

Here we go again, the feeling of falling
It's all we'll ever know
Swing backwards and forwards
It's getting old

My hands are tied behind my back
And I can barely catch my breath
And here we go again

What if I told you, that we're all the same
If no one is equal, in this endless game
What if I told you, it's out of your hands
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed

We all want the same

And after all is said and done
We can right the wrongs and make our own
In time to start it all again
The cycle's gotta break

What if I told you, that we're all the same
If no one is equal, in this endless game
What if I told you, it's out of your hands
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed

We all want the same

The future has failed us, it's coming round again
The pendulum is broken, so we're swinging by the neck
Instead, we're tilted, the ringing in my ears
Won't go away, it's happening again

We all want the same
We all want the same
