What the hell are the things we're fighting for?
(Can't you see that we lost what we called a goal?)
Dude it feels like no one thinks anymore
(And you repeat the same shit like a broken record)

What happened to the world we're living in?
Where is the progress that I believed in?
What happened to the moral that we built?
Here is the truth now:

Welcome to the decay of the sharp minds that we had now it's time for the regress
How can you be surprised? didn't you see that one coming?
But I should say shut the fuck up!

You just show your ignorance, if there's somewhere to start,
Get you a sense of shame or you are lost forever.
You just show your ignorance, if there's somewhere to start,
Get you a sense of shame or you are lost forever.

How can you be the same when you know that?
(We're all trapped in a plane that is crashing down)
Everyday we get closer to the ground
(But no one is concerned when the alarm sounds)

What happened to the world we're living in?
Where is the progress that I believed in?
What happened to the moral that we built?
Here is the truth now:

Welcome to the decay of the sharp minds that we had now it's time for the regress
How can you be surprised didn't you see that one coming, straight up to your face?

Now feel the shame of what we are
Can't we try to raise the bar
Now feel the shame of what we are
Can't we try to raise the bar
Let's raise the bar!
What the hell is tight?
