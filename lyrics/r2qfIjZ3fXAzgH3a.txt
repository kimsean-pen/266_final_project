She feels she needs to leave
When the fields are all covered in frost
And the dreams begin to breathe
Opening the partly open locks

While the others start to disagree
On returning to rough and moving grounds
And if I should come to be relieved
Would it be without you?

She feels she needs to leave
To avoid a messy aftermath
Alone between lines of anguished needs
Rearranged to allow a newborn path

While the others start to disagree
On returning to rough and moving grounds
And if I should come to be relieved
Would it be without you?
