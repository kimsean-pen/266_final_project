You should know
What you're fighting for
Can't promise you all that perfect life
To get this far
I've seen darker times
Never looking up
Running from the light
Always out of reach
Ignoring every sign

I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me
You take me
They're yours
And if you see tomorrow
I'll give you it all
Take me
Take me
I'm yours

You should know
Cause I can reply to
You deserve more than any truth
The dirt and soil
It's still beneath my nails
Dont know how to win
Only how to fail

I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me
You take me
They're yours
And if you see tomorrow
I'll give you it all
Take me
Take me
I'm yours

(Oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be a better man
Than I am
(Oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be the one who stands
And understands

If you see tomorrow
I'll give you it all
Take me
Take me
I'm yours
I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me
You take me, they're yours
And if you see tomorrow
I'll give you it all
Take me
Take me
I'm yours
Just take me, take me
I'm yours
Just take me, take me
I'm yours
