Passion take the wind and break me from this tie
We're mortals on the earth oh but God's up in the sky
I haven't got a clue, I haven't got a thing
But what I give to you is all that I could bring, oh, oh, oh
I'll give you all my time, that's everything to me
You know my only crime is this flight of fantasy, oh, oh, oh

Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you

Ooh because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you

Passion take the wind and break me from this tie
We're mortals on the earth ooh but God's up in the sky
I haven't got a clue, I haven't got a thing
But what I give to you is all that I could bring, oh, oh, oh

Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you

Ooh because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you, I'll fly for you, oh I'll fly

I'm just an average boy, you're more than an average girl
And when you sing to me the 'Sho be doos', you sing so well
And don't you know that when I'm under you
I'm overjoyed...

Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you
Oh because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do
I'll fly for you, I'll fly for you, I'll fly for you, I'll fly
