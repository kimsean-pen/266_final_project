I love the Black and White
I love the play of light
The way Contini puts his image through a prism

I feel my body chill
Gives me a special thrill
Each time I see that Guido Neo-Realism

I love the dark handsome guys
With their skinny little ties
Dressing mod looking out of sight
I love to watch them as they cruise
With their pointy leather shoes
Wearing shades in the middle of the nights

Whatever Guido does it makes me smile
He is the essence of Italian style
I love the glamorously Latin world that only Guido can portray

Contini's Cinema Italiano
I love his Cinema Italiano
He makes me feel wtih Cinema Italiano
My life is real with Cinema Italiano
He is the king of Cinema Italiano

Those scenes I love to see
From Guido's P.O.V.
There's no one else with his unique director's vision

His angles wide and tight
Each moment feels so right
Defines Italian style by only his decision

I love the speedy little cars
The hip coffee bars
The sleek women in Positano
Guido's the ultimate Uomo Romano

Contini's Cinema Italiano
I love his Cinema Italiano
Guido Guido Guido
Guido Guido Guido
Guido Guido Guido
Guido Guido

Dark handsome guys
Skinny little ties
Shades in the middle of the night
Speedy little cars
Hip coffee bars
Sleek women in Positano
