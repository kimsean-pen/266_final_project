I heard about you
I've heard it all
So many stories
You know from so and so
I should know better
But you know how it goes
Like a moth to a flame
Moth to a flame

Look like an angel
In devil's clothes
A perfect picture
Hanging on burning walls
They say your kiss is deadly
But I still wanna know
Pull me into the flame

We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up

See you're a gamble
I roll the dice
If I don't get you first
I'll flip the quarter twice
I'm standing in the dark
Waiting for your light
Like a moth to a flame
Moth to a flame

The closer I get to you
The deeper I fall
And I'm treading slowly
But I'm still lost in you

We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
(We're burnin' up, we're burnin' up)
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
(Ohh, we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up)
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up

Hmm, I should know better
Hmm, I should know better
Hmm, I should know better, hmm
(Oooh, hey, yeah yeah)

We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
We're burnin' up
Ooh, oh
I'll be cautious
Ooh, oh
(Oooh, yeah)
We're burnin' up

We're burnin' up, baby
We're burnin' up
Hmm, I should know better
(We're burnin' up, baby, yeah)
Hmm, I should know better
