Stand up, everybody look alive
Say come on, come on, come on we're gonna get it now
Hands up if you're ready for a fight
Say come on, come on, come on we're gonna win it now

I don't need you to believe in me
I know how to change my destiny
Sit down but to rewrite our history, rewrite our history, rewrite our history

We can change the whole world, gonna take it over
Gonna start it over, don't you know what we could be
A new beginning, fighting 'til we're winning
Tell me that you're in it, don't you wanna be

A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Don't you wanna be
A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Anybody could be
Anybody could be
Anybody could be

Rip it off, show the symbol on your chest
Say come on and show the world who you really are
It's not enough to be better than the rest
Gotta take it to the top and make yourself a superstar

You don't need them to believe in you
Get your mission on lock and see it through
You've got all the power you need in you
Power you need in you, power you need in you

We can change the whole world, gonna take it over
Gonna start it over, don't you know what we could be
A new beginning, fighting 'til we're winning
Tell me that you're in it, don't you wanna be

A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Don't you wanna be
A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Anybody could be

We can change the whole world, gonna take it over
Gonna start it over, don't you know what we could be
A new beginning, fighting 'til we're winning
Tell me that you're in it, don't you wanna be

A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Don't you wanna be
A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Anybody could be

We can change the whole world, gonna take it over
Gonna start it over, don't you know what we could be
A new beginning, fighting 'til we're winning
Tell me that you're in it, don't you wanna be

A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Don't you wanna be
A superhero, a superhero, a superhero
Anybody could be
A hero
