Yeah, brand new, in it for life
Facts, hm
Real talk no cap, yeah yeah yeah
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

Hm, it's up, I heard that
Yeah, took a nigga bitch, get ya bird back
Yeah, ran of with his pack, get ya work back
Yeah, I'ma hit his block, and serve that
Yeah, I did that, yeah, I did that
Everything I say in my raps, bitch, I live that
If it ain't dead, come around, we gon' kill that
Made it out the jungle by finessin with a lil' cap

Niggas they be cappin'
Ridin' with the 40, nigga try me, get to blastin'
Take a bitch out on a trip to the Aspen
I'ma hit her once, I can't pass her 'cause the ass thick
I just got a pack, I'ma make it do a backflip
Smokin' on my pack, young nigga hustlin' backwards
Hit a lick, I cannot leave a trace, I ain't a tractor
I can't cuff you yet, gotta hit it from the back first
Dunkin' and that pussy talk, she say her back hurt
I don't gotta get it yet, fuckin' wit' me
Young ass nigga got some tricks up my sleeve
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
The young niggas thirsty, they need something to drink

Hm, it's up, I heard that
Yeah, took a nigga bitch, get ya bird back
Yeah, ran of with his pack, get ya work back
Yeah, I'ma hit his block, and serve that
Yeah, I did that, yeah, I did that
Everything I say in my raps, bitch, I live that
If it ain't dead, come around, we gon' kill that
Made it out the jungle by finessin with a lil' cap

Yeah, lil' cap, yeah, lil' cap

Lil' cap, lil' cap
