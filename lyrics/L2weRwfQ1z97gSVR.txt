I think I went a little nuts
At the grocery store
I walked through every aisle
And threw things on the floor
Floor

Well I see that's she's trying to get to me
Well I found that she's a liar, liar
God help me turn the light off
It's in my eyes
Turn on the song

It's for the night time baby

Put on the night song baby
Put it on
Nothing lasts
Forever
Put on the night song baby
Turn it on

Nothing lasts
Forever
I took my short legged woman
To the dance last night
We watched the highway patrol
Take selfies with Nardwuar
Nardwuar
Well I see that's she's trying to get to me
Well I found that she's a liar, liar
God help me turn the light off
It burns my hands
Turn up the song
It's for the night time baby
Turn on the night song baby
Turn it on
Now, nothing lasts
Forever
Turn on the night song baby
Turn it on (Woah-oh-oh)
Nothing lasts
Forever
Put on the night, on the night song

We are the party police
Put your hands up
Put on the night song
Do the robot, do the other dances
And put on the night song
Cause we're the party police
Freeze!
