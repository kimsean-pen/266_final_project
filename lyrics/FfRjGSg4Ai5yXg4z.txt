I need a drink or two or three
To fall asleep, without you
I've had the longest day
I'm as blue as the sky is green

I need a drink or two or three or four
To spend any time alone with me anymore
Everday a chance to change
The devil will find a way
As sure as the sky is grey
I'm gonna die this way

Oh how I wish that I were me
The man that you first met and married
I'm tired of fighting endless
Under the lighting
I can't break the splendor
To with I surrender
