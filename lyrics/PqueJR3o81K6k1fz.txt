The sun comes up
I think about you
The coffee cup
I think about you
I want you so
It's like I'm losing my mind

The morning ends
I think about you
I talk to friends
and think about you
and do they know?
It's like I'm losing my mind

All afternoon doing every little chore
the thought of you stays bright
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor
not going left, not going right

I dim the lights
and think about you
Spend sleepless nights
to think about you
You said you loved me
or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing my mind?

Or am I losing my mind?

Or am I losing
Losing my mind?
