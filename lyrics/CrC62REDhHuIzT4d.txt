I blame it on your heart
I blame your heart for whose is running wild
For lightning in the sky
For never get to sleep at night
I blame it on your hands
Blame both of them for wind just being cold
For no one there to hold
For aching, for breaking, for feeling so alone

Oh I wish one day you will find me here
Hiding behind the sun
With a thousand loaded guns
Oh I wish one day you will find me here
The shadow behind the light is sorted

I'm running through the rooms
I'm caught up in your body labyrinth
I'm captive in your skin
There's no one here to let me go, oh oh
Listen to the rain insinuating you're the one to blame
For lizzards and spiders crawling up against the fence

Oh I wish one day you will find me here
Hiding behind the sun
With a thousand loaded guns
Oh I wish one day you will find me here
The shadow behind the light is sorted

Oh I wish one day you will find me here
Hiding behind the sun
With a thousand loaded guns
Oh I wish one day you will find me here
The shadow behind the light is sorted

Find me here
