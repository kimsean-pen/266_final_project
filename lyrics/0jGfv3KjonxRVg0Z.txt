You tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
You tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets

Dancing to nowhere I'm losing my head and I'm
Dancing to nowhere I'm losing my head and I'm
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed his gun
And the man at the bar that night recall that he needed his gun

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold, I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes I've sold them before

The man said, "The drinking is handled by pouring it right"
The man said, "The drinking is handled by pouring it right"
And it seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
And it seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
Who'd need me then

In raise of much noise and I checked out the time, yeah
Let all my face down in the words of a stranger

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold, I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes I've sold them before
