You had Atlantis
You know that now
What can you see
From Valhalla's heights?

Perceive the glitches
Praise the glaciers
The final remnants
Of our key of greatness

You have the wisdom of the dead
These lesser lights should learn from you

Washed clean by ice
For lust our summers
For souls our winters
Until we die
