people got their opinions
where do they come from?
each day seems like a natural fact
and what we think changes how we act
people got opinions
where do they come from?
distant blood of ruvvies
won't discover money come on
each day seems like a natural fact
and what we think changes how we act
so to change ideas
change is what we do
too much thinking makes me ill
I think I'll have another gin
a few more drinks it'll be alright
each day seems like a natural fact
and what we think changes how we act
each day seems like a natural fact x4
