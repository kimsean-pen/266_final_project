Went walkin' through town just the other day
With nothin' much to do
As the sun came breakin' down through the clouds
I never seen the sky so blue

I saw a Cajun man with a red guitar
Singin' on the side of the street
I threw a handful of change in his beat up case
And said play me a country beat
And it sounded like

Met up with some friends outside of town
We were headed towards the lake
I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep
Felt the wind upon my face

We got to the spot and the sun was hot
Everybody was feelin' fine
So we jumped on in for a midday swim
Then we lost all track of time

It was a perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin' in a perfect day

As the moon came out and the fire burned
Everybody was singin' along
To some ramblin', a little Curtis Lowe
And all those feel good songs

We danced all night without a care
No place we'd rather be
'Cause these are the days we talked about
When we lived so wild and free

It was a perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin' in a perfect day

We were sittin' in the sand as he grabbed my hand
And he leaned in for a kiss
I couldn't help but think with the stars above
It don't get much better than this
It was a perfect day
What I'd give if I could find a way to stay
Lost in this moment now
Ain't worried about tomorrow
When you're busy livin', feels like dreamin'
Slowly driftin' through this perfect day
