Hear the rolling sound of thunder,
as the battle rages on.
We will tear this world asunder,
feel our power.

Through a darkened sky we riding
Pierce the night with bolts of light

We will find you although you are hiding
Under cover

We will break through with

Thunder, with fire,
Realeasing an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We're out of control

From a world you've broken into
From a world unknown to man
We release our wrath upon you
Holy bloodshed

Breaking chains of your religion
Worship none or be destroyed
You cannot defeat our legion
Bleed the world red

We will break through with

Thunder, with fire,
Realeasing an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We're out of control
To conquer this world

Lightning bolts of anger
Raging in your world
We uphold the darkness
Rulers of the moonlight

As you think it's over
Calm has settled in
Thundergods returning
Back to rule this planet again

Future role of generations
Let us rage into awake
They'll be guessing our patience
Run for cover
Hear the rolling sound of thunder
As the battle rages on
We will tear this world asunder
Feel our power

We will break you
With thunder, with fire
Realeasing an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We're out of control

Thunder, with fire
Releasing an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We're out of control
