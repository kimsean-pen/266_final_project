Market in the cool white mornin'
Merchants sell while women buy
Milk, tobacco, soap and matches
Sweep the floor while the dishes dry

Spring whispered in her ear
Like soft Mediterranean wailin'

Sleepy woman by the window
Dreamin' in the morning air
Of the one who takes her sweetness
By a Chinese lamp upstairs

The steam of China tea
You could hear the woman sing
In the soft flames of spring

Spring has swept the scarlet side streets
Winds caress, undress, invite
Upstairs by a China lamp
They softly talk in the cool spring night
