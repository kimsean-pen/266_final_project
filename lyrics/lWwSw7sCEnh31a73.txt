Black Cat
Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Don't believe that he left me alone
And i hope he don't come home
Looking back, the black (past)
Trust him once, lost my map
Trust again to save my bones
And i never made it back

Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Don't believe i made it home
And i hope he don't come home

Never had anything
Never lose and i never win
Lost my only love, never get her back
There's a black cat on my back

Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Don't believe that he left me alone
And i hope he don't come home

Beg for mercy, laying low
Down where the poor dogs go
Lick my wounds, when (i go home)
Death is spiriling down
Death is low

Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Can't believe that he left me alone
And i hope he don't come home

Every day, every hour
Another baby's born
Going to hang my head, (dry and blind)
'til the black cat drags it home

Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Can't believe that he left me alone
And i hope he don't come home

Beg for mercy, i'm laying low
Down where the poor dogs go
Lick my wounds, when i grow old
The sun is down and gone
The sun is down
The sun is down and gone
The sun is down
The sun is down and gone
The sun is down
The sun is down and gone

Black cat

The sun is down and gone

Hope he don't come home
I hope he don't come home
I hope he don't come home
