Son, you're my gaze it's all familiar
I'm not alone
Change, it's in your face
It's in your blood, it never leaves you
But the color sense, mindless seeds
It blunts the road and clips my knees
The way to follow on
Son, but don't

Tripping on some velvet mess
The clouds are warm, my retreat
We're to follow on,
Son, but don't
I'm caught in the headlights
Listen now, thanks to my disease
I'm caught in the headlights
Error lives my mind, it won't be seen
It's killing my wrist like

No, I'll never leave you now
Even though I'm suffering
No, I'll never leave you now
Even though I'm suffering

Son, you're in my way
And I don't care that you're familiar
But it kids you not, it's my disease
Before my ones and for my needs
Then I come around
Lost and still I feel a knot it turns my chest
A restless mind, I can't respect

We're to follow on
Son, but don't
I'm caught in the headlights
Listen now, thanks to my disease
I'm caught in the headlights
Error lives my mind, it won't be seen
It's killing my wrist like

No, I'll never leave you now
Even though I'm suffering
No, I'll never leave you now
Even though I'm suffering
