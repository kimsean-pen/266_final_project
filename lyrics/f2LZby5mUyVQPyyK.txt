I'm sitting here
In my own head thinking
How you could be staring in
Got my number two
And I'm writing you
Contemplating on the paper what I should do
On the fireplace, with the mailman
Should I tell you or should I hold it in
If my heart wasn't in it
Baby you can just forget it
I'd be gone in a New York minute

You never give me attention
I know you don't want bad intentions for us
So I'm writing you
But I always fail to mention
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss
So I'm gonna hold it in

I'm writing you a Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face-to-face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you Dear John

Sometimes I think that I've had enough
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks
You know I'm listening
Some days I'm ready to jet and
Some days I'm willing to forget and
Some days I'm still in love with you
Some days I'm sad and blue, oh

When I don't check myself
I get frustrated with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know that it's not just you
It's some of my negligence too
And I can't go through with mailing this to you

Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better

Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you a Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face-to-face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door

When I don't check myself
I get frustrated with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do

I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it, oooh
I'm writing this letter, baby
I can't go through with it, oh no no no
I can't can't I can't
I can't stay
Mmmm, mm, mm, mm
I'm writing you this letter
I'm writing you Dear John
I'm writing, I'm writing a Dear John letter
I'm writing a Dear John letter
