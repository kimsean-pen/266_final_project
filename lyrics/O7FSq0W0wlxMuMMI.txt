This is not a failure
This is not an end
These are just symptoms of a trajectory descent
Further down the line
You hide from the memories of unresolve
The struggle is lost

All this time of knowing
Letting piece by piece slip away
'Cause when they're all against you, against you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me
Don't you force my hand

When the silence has spoken
In this imminent storm
Taken to the nth degree
Where failure forms
Spiralling deception
Left the mindless drifting away
'Cause when they're out to get, out to get you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me
Don't you force my hand

All this time ends in nothing
These walls of doubt built into our minds
All this time signifying something
A victim without circumstance

All this time of knowing
Letting piece by piece slip away
'Cause when they're all against you, against you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me
Don't you force my hand
