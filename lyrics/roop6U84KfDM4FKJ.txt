I'll meet you there
And won't matter if you won
So get some rest
We don't need most things we want

Kings and crowns fade out in time

We're going down a long way to nowhere
And there's no finish line
Bleeding out searching for something
It was here all the time

I'll meet you there
Yeah I'll meet you anyway
We'll all be there, we'll all meet there my friend
We couldn't care less
About the problems that hold
We'll all be there, we'll all meet there my friend

We're going down a long way to nowhere
And there's no finish line
Bleeding out searching for nothing
It was here all the time

I'm so glad we met, so glad

We're going down a long way to nowhere
And there's no finish line
Bleeding out searching for something
It was here all the time with you

We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out, we all fade out
We're fading out, we're fading out
We're fading out, we all
