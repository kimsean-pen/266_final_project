She used to go
She used to hide and not let me know
Now I wait
While she's in bed and sleeps all day
(Wake up)

She used to dance
She used to cry as she held my hand
Oh no we used to say
We won't ever change change change

I fell in love with my best friend
She fell in love with you instead
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Oh it's me and my misery

I fell in love with my best friend
Now she is sleeping in your bed
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Now it's me and my misery

It's not the same
The way she used to say my name
Now she's strange
It's outta hand 'cause something's changed
Something's changed

She used to dance
She used to cry as she held my hand
Oh no we used to say
We won't ever change change change

I fell in love with my best friend
She fell in love with you instead
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Oh it's me and my misery

I fell in love with my best friend
Now she is sleeping in your bed
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Now it's me and my misery

I loved her madly but she went away
I can't believe that she won't see my pain
Though I'm not with her, I have lost my mind
I love her madly 'til the end of time, no

I fell in love with my best friend
She fell in love with you instead
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Oh it's me and my misery

I fell in love with my best friend
Now she is sleeping in your bed
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Now it's me and my misery

I fell in love with my best friend
Now she is sleeping in your bed
'cause she's a teenage heartbreak queen
Now it's me and my misery
