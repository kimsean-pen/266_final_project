You blew my mind when we were swinging in a dream
You said, "watch me I'll swing so high I'll be stuck up in the trees"
And so ya did
I forgot it was a dream and so ya did

I left you in my mind, and wandered to the creek
Where I startled little children, and the children laughed at me
So I dipped
I went on with the day I shoulda skipped

I try to sleep but then I wake up
When you're gone, I really hate my dreams
All along, I try to live but then I think too much
Because most of the time all the thoughts in my mind get to me

I started dozing off as I walked down a city street
Oh, nobody was looking so I laid down at their feet and you were gone
All the people carried on

I try to sleep but then I wake up
When you're gone, I really hate my dreams
All along, I try to live but then I think too much
Because most of the time all the thoughts in my mind get to me

I try to sleep but then you wake me up
When you're gone, I really hate my dreams
All along, I try to run but then I can't keep up
Because most of the time all the thoughts in my mind get to me
Because most of the time all the thoughts in my mind get to me
