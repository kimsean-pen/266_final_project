White paper and empty places
The head between my shoulders
Wounded and bleeding badly
I can smell your remorse
Stains all over

Been outside and seen it all
You are the master, you know it all
Made yourself a number
And your time is now

Holding tight, wish you were nearer
Lost my voice, don't want to scream no more
It's like a box and I'm trapped inside (trapped inside)
I've been paralyzed
This narrow road ends to a ditch

Been outside and seen it all
You are the master, you know it all
Made yourself a number
And your time is now

You fit in the program
And your blood is fine
The skin is perfect
And your heart is in time
