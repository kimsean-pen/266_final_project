Look in my eyes
What do you see?
Only me
Got nothing to hide
Seek and you'll find
What's on my mind
This happened so fast
Not a part of my plan
So I'm leaving my heart in your hands

-Chorus-
Haven't told you, just how much I love you
Only by dreaming
I show my feelings
Haven't told you, just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too
A love from me to you

Look in my eyes
You know me so well
Can't you tell
(That I'm)Way into deep
I'm going down
So catch me now

It happened so fast
Not a part of my plan
Now I'm leaving my heart in your hands

-Chorus-
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming (only by dreamin')
I show my feelings (i show my feelins)
Haven't told you, just how much I love you baby
Time for revealing
And I will give you you something too
A love from me to you

I feel you
Everyday I breathe you
Every single moment from the start
I see you
Constantly I feel you
You move me so
Not letting go
You smile at me
My heart is yours to keep

-Chorus-
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming
I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too
A love from me to you

Have I told you baby
Oooh I love you bay
I show my feelings
And I will give you something too
A love from me to you
