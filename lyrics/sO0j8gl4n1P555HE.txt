All the hands I've made
Grow in time
Feel my light
Your plastic bones are mine

If you want to be angry
I don't mind
I'll let you go
If you want to be angry
I don't mind
I'll leave you alone

I am sorry
I know I am wrong

So take it all
I want to be out of control
So take it all
I want to be out of control

I am smiling wide
I'm the reason the sky is blue
Careful design
Was poured into me and poured into you

If you want to be angry
I don't mind
I'll let you go
If you want to be angry
I don't mind
I'll leave you alone

I am sorry
I know I am wrong

So take it all
I want to be out of control
So take it all
I want to be out of control

Only you know what to do now
Only you know what to do
Only you know what to do now
Only you know what to do
