You are beautiful, lonely inside
You are innocence personified
And I will drag you down and sell you out
Run away!
I am cold like December snow
I have carved out this soul made of stone
And I will drag you down and sell you out
Embraced by the darkness, I am losing the light!
Encircled by demons, I fight!
What have I become?!

Now that I've betrayed!
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away!
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind!
Is there something left for me to save in the wreckage of my life? My life!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!
Judas in my mind!

Oh, this guilt is a heavy cross
There is blood on the path I walk
And each step I take is haunting me!
Embraced by the darkness, I am losing the light!

Encircled by demons, I fight!
What have I become?!

Now that I've betrayed!
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away!
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind!
Is there something left for me to save in the wreckage of my life? My life!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!

Judas in my mind!
Judas in my mind!

What have I become?!

Now that I've betrayed!
Everyone I've ever loved, I pushed them all away!
And I have been a slave to the Judas in my mind!
Is there something left for me to save in the wreckage of my life? My life!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!

I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
I'm becom-, I'm becom-, I'm becoming!
Judas in! Judas in my mind!
Judas in my mind!
