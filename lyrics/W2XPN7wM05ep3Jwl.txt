I'm moving fast like clouds in the sky
You can see my tears are dry
You're staying there higher in the sky
7 layers of the air

We've never ever moved together yet so beautiful

I'm moving fast like birds in the sky
You can see my eyes turn bright
You are staying there further in the sky
7 layers of time

We've never ever moved together yet so beautiful

I'm proving past and breaking new ground
Slowly my eyes open wide
You're staying there and playing new sounds
7 layers of light

We've never ever moved together yet so beautiful
