Uhh... I'll play this song
Are you sure?
Yeeeah
(Ring, ring, yeah)

Yeah
(Hahaha, Scarlxrd)
Scar! lxrd, huh
Yah, yah, haha
Scar! lxrd! yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)

(Blegh!)
Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind!
T-T-This is real salvation in the flesh
I-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway

Hide your shame, so two-faced with the shit you say
Stay away, everything you do makes me so enraged
Wide awake, I can't fucking sleep or give my mind a break
Fuck!
How can I support myself in such a state?
Why would I wait and assume this shit?
I put my heart and the truth in it
Niggas so blind that they shoot and miss
All of these scars consumed my wrist, yeah
North Face on my coat, yuh
Better go change your tone, yah
What drugs help you cope? Ayy
They don't need to know, yuh
Slipping isn't something that I like
But I be sliding like I'm skating when I rhyme, oh yeah, oh yah
Creeping like a villain in the night
I got to keep myself together this time, oh yeah, oh yah
Pedal to the meddle when I drive
Wrestling The Devil all the time, oh yeah, oh yeah
Jumping up a level at a time
Scar sound-waves can't die, oh yeah, oh yeah

Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind!
T-T-This is real salvation in the flesh
I-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway

These acts of mine, these facts I stay with
These hands of God, these hands I came with
I let them go, these days I regret
These doubtful flaws, I've got no patience

Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind!
