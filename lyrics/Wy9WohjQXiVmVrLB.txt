(Switch back)
(Switch back)
(Switch back)

I've made a choice that I regret
Now, what I see is what I get

(It's too late to look back)
(I've got no way to switch back)
It's too late to look back, ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)

(Switch back)
(Switch back)

Wait, how can it be too
Late? 'Cause I don't want to
Play with such a price to
Pay

It's too late to look back (too)
(Late to) Ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)

A painful picture that I can't forget
Now, what I see is what I get

(It's too late to look back)
(I've got no way to switch back)
It's too late to look back, ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)

(Switch back)
(Switch back)

Wait, how can it be too
Late? 'Cause I don't want to
Play with such a price to
Pay

Chained to what I can't
Reclaim, I'll never be the
Same

(And there's no)
(Way to)

It's too late to look back (too)
(Late to) Ain't
Okay, I got no way to switch back (and there's no)
(Way to)

It's too late to look back (Too)
(Late to) Ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)
(Switch back, switch back)

(It's too late to look back)
(I've got no way to switch back)
(It's too late to look back)
(I've got no way to switch back)

(It's too late to look back)
(I've got no way to switch back)
It's too late to look back, ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)

(And everybody) And
Everybody foolin' with their rick rack, and
It's about time we put them on their back
Meaner and leaner, we take up the slack
Klayton and Celldweller with no way to switch back
Cuttin' you up with razor blade
Chokin' you on them words you say
Hittin' you rip-rap on you made
And the Celldweller is unafraid

(Switch back)
(Switch back)

Wait, how can it be too
Late? 'Cause I don't want to
Play with such a price to
Pay

Chained to what I can't
Reclaim, I'll never be the
Same, won't be the same
Again (be the same)
(Again)

(And there's no)
(Way to)

It's too late to look back (too)
(Late to) ain't
Okay, I got no way to switch back (and there's no)
(Way to)

It's too late to look back (too)
(Late to) ain't
Okay, I got no way to switch
Back

I've got no way to switch back
It's too late to look back
Too late to look back, ain't
Okay, I got no way to (switch back)
