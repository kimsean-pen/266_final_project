Jude's still chasing shadows on the wall
She can't tell that we got taller
Will I be here after all my thoughts are done
Will I be here in the morning

And I'm so scared of getting cold
You can't hold me up taller
Will I be here after all my thoughts are done
Will I be here in the morning

My apologies for the delay
My head don't work in the usual ways
'Cos I'm a fool
I'm a fool
I'm a fool for pain

Yeah-ahhh
Yeah
For pain
Ahhh
Yeah

My brother is wise as a child, you see
All he sees, he loves the same
And I wonder if I should act like him
But there's so much I'd have to change

My apologies for the delay
My head don't work in the usual ways
My apologies for the delay
My head don't work in the usual ways
'Cos I'm a fool
I'm a fool
I'm a fool for pain

Yeah-ahhh
Yeah
For pain
Ahhh

Now I'm still chasing shadows on the wall
And soon you'll see, I'll be taller,
And I'll hold off 'til all my thoughts are done
And I'll be here in the morning
