Utopia - lost in chaos
As the sky turns black
Suicidal legacy
There is no turning back

Retribution answers cold
Moving in for the kill
Deep hideous festering
Bestial epidemic, repulsive need

Control, control

Suicide nation
Mass-appeal, death-addiction
Dead but dreaming
Restrained by phobia, brainwashed into submission
Control, control

Suicide -jaws locked around your spine

"The face of evil is always the face of total need."
-W.S. Burroughs, "Deposition"
Testimony Concerning A Sickness

Retribution answers cold
Moving in for the kill
Deep hideous festering
Bestial epidemic, repulsive need

Control, control

Suicide - jaws locked around your spine
