Write me a letter
A face in the hall
Hiding from someone
Afraid of the fall

And she's waiting for someone
To take her back to where she came from
And she'll wait alone for hours
She won't mind because there's someone

In the story she remembers
She remembers in the letter
And the tears locked up inside her
Make her heart break open wider

And shuts her eyes and takes
The picture from the wall
