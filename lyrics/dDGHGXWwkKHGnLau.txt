And I know, and I know what will happen
If I let you come around
(Don't want to hurt you, never meant to hurt you)
Gonna cross the line just like last time
Leave your heart on the ground
(Don't want to break you)

And I know you want it
I know you want it all
Tonight I need it
But I'm gonna let you down
Don't wanna hurt you
Just like I did before
Remember the empty words
Why do you keep coming back for more?

Not looking for love
Hate to say it but it's time you gave it up
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
Not looking for love
You leave my body cold to the touch
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted

Had a sweet, hot summer
Having you hanging around
(Don't wanna waste your time, never meant to waste your time)
But if you keep on swimming in these waters
You're gonna drown

And I know you want it
I know you want it all
Tonight I need it
But I'm gonna let you down
Don't wanna hurt you
Just like I did before
Remember the empty words
Why do you keep coming back for more?

Not looking for love
Hate to say it but it's time you gave it up
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
Not looking for love
You leave my body cold to the touch
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted

And I know you want it
I know you want it all
Tonight I need it
But I'm gonna let you down
Don't wanna hurt you
Just like I did before
Remember the empty words
Why do you keep coming back for more?

Not looking for love
Hate to say it but it's time you gave it up
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
Not looking for love
You leave my body cold to the touch
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
Just trying to be honest, I'm not what you wanted
