It's a drunken midnight on the streets
Brightly dusted with a neon light
We duck behind the corner store
Smoke your smokes while I keep
A watchful eye
Right here, right now
I hope before the night is through
One fumbled touch will finally hit the spot
You've got everything going for you
So I'll go for you with everything I got
Right here, the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign?

Is there anything I missed?
Is there anything I missed?
Tell me if I'm wrong
But why would we change a thing?

When the morning light fights through the cracks
Cascading across the bed, and you are mine
When your parents start to wake for work
Between the sheets, I'll keep a watchful eye
Right here, the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign?

Is there anything I missed?
Is there anything I missed?
Tell me if I'm wrong
But why would we change a thing?

When we met I was on my back
I swear we spent most afternoons
Somewhere in the act
We were part of something ours
And ours alone
Anywhere was home
We're almost here again

When we met I was on my back
I swear we spent most afternoons
Somewhere in the act
We were part of something ours
And ours alone
Anywhere was home
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
Right here, right now
