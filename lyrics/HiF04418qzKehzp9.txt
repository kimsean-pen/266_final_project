Your eyes stare
Am I humble am I ghost
I'm holding in tight
To something long as I go
Am I humble am I ghost
I found a way
To look towards this day
But it all hooked up
This could only go one way
I'm not alive, I'm not alive without you
I'm not alive, I'm not alive without you

Love is to die, love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance
Love is to die, love is to not die, love is to dance

Love is to dance

Come around, let's go found
There's no words to call
Tonight, you really see nothing of this girl
They work, they don't know the roots behind
'Cause I got a knife to cut out the memories
So carefully, too carefully, it's not necessarily
To be so dark
Got to give in, got to give in
Learn to let go, learn to let go

Got to give in, got to give in
Learn to let go, learn to let go

Love is to die, love is to not die, love is to dance

Love is to dance
Love is to die love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance
Love is to die, why did you not die, why don't you
Why don't you dance and dance
