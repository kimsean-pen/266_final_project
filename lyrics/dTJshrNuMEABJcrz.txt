This could be my last day Try to hide the pain
I always feel it What do you know
What do you see Where will you go
Who will you be

How comes I get so high when i'm so low?
How comes I get so high when i'm so
low? I be asking myself, how do you know

How comes I get so high when I'm so low?
Kissing up on your face from the bedside photo
My mind racing like the cars out in Tokyo
I'm jealous of my lava-lamp, moving in slow-mo
And the medicine is a no go
But trust issues follow
Yes, on my next girl
I'm ready, but
Oh no, oh no
What the fuck is wrong?
I never know
Spirits follow me around
But my friends never show
Learn a lesson and you'll move on
Oops, I mean getting older
Rope around my throat
But at least it's yellow gold
She want to argue about nothing to make her day feel a little larger
I know your true colors
Before anything start I just like to
gamble so I roll da' dice into my [?]

This could be my last day
I been livin
I been livin
Try to hide the pain
Cause I always feel it
I always feel it
What do you know?
What do you see?
Where will you go?
Who will you be?
What do you know?
What do you see?
Where will you go?
Who will you be?

Moving around like a poltergeist up in the night
Staying sharp like a soldier's eye holding a sniper
I'm dreaming about the afterlife where I'll find you
Want to be beside you, to kill a little time too

Get the fuck out my head
Why do I always think about death?
I try to speak about it a little less
But when I do I feel I release so much stress

So where do we go from now?
I'm on a highway to hell
And I ain't thinking bout slowing down
Running round hoping that we make eye contact
We ain't gotta say a word, but you know that
So where do we go from here?
I'm on a new road to heaven, I don't think imma make it there anyway
Hoping that we make eye contact
We ain't gotta say a word, but you know that

This could be my last day
I been livin
I been livin
Try to hide the pain
Cause I always feel it
I always feel it
What do you know?
What do you see?
Where will you go?
Who will you be?
What do you know?
What do you see?
Where will you go?
Who will you be?
