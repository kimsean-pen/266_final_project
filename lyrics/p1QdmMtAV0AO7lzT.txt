Worries turning joys to doubt
Death is all I think about
I've watched my days turn gray
I still think of the future, but in a different way

Torn heart, soul split up in pieces
No thoughts but a death wish
I'm fucking obsessed with no fucking rest
Asendin and Desyrel don't fucking work it feels like hell
I guess I'll rot
Worries turning joys to doubt
Death is all I think about
I've watched my days turn gray
I still think of the future, but in a different way

I know this won't fade away
The problem I can't solve in any way

Imagining the impact
Is this bridge to low?
Will I fall hard enough?
I need to know

Imagining the impact
Is this bridge to low?
If I fall hard enough
Mom needs to know
Why

It's all a tragedy from start to finish
So fucking drown it down with pints and spirits
3 AM and the crowd goes home
I'm venting vomit fucking crying all alone

Worries turning joys to doubt
Death is all I think about
I've watched my days turn gray
I still think of the future, but in a different way

I'm fucking obsessed with no fucking rest
Asendin and Desyrel don't fucking work it feels like hell
