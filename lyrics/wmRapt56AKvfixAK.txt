To say it was a different walk in
A different walk in a different park is what it was
This one was different
You could see it when she walked inside
It wasn't as bad as you might have thought
They don't want to see the light you had get burned away
You must have been different that day
See, I always thought that they's seen you like a charming man
But you don't feed them something then that you mean, boy
And learn to love these days, boy
She see what you mean cause she's seen it
Well, she don't want to know, she's seen the way you'll go
Listen, that stuff it's not wrong cause it's your song
So, lights off
She see what you mean cause she's seen it
Well, she don't want to know, she's seen the way you'll go
Listen, that stuff it's not wrong cause it's your song
So, lights off
They don't want to see the light you had get burned away
You must have been different that day
See, I always thought that they's seen you like a charming man
But you don't feed them something then that you
And learn to love these days, boy
She see what you mean cause she's seen it
Well, she don't want to know, she's seen the way you'll go
Listen, that stuff it's not wrong cause it's your song
So, lights off
She see what you mean cause she's seen it
Well, she don't want to know, she's seen the way you'll go
Listen, that stuff it's not wrong cause it's your song
So, lights off
The falling star you saw that was something coming
These moments are your life, acknowledge them
It's easier the fall if you're closer to the floor, but that's all
The falling star you saw that was something coming
These moments are your life, acknowledge them
It's easier the fall if you're closer to the floor, but that's all
She been there, seen it all
That's not your fault
It's your song playing though
Lights off
