You know, my darling, I can't stand to sleep alone
No sweetheart in the dark to call my own
You're my own, you're my own, I can sing it, I can grow
But the darkness is a stranger
In our lonely, lonely, lonely low

Last night's parties and last night's Horror Show
Smiling and whirling and kissing all I know
Give my soul, give my soul, sing it free across the sea
Lonely spell to conjure you, but conjure hell is all I do

Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mother told me
The dream of love is a two-hearted dream
Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mother told me
The dream of love is a two-hearted dream

They say for every higher high
There must be a low, low, low, low, low
And every sun ascending a lonesome moon
Will grow, grow, grow, grow

Drive my heart, drive my heart
Into the fire of a burning heart's desire
The only spells you'll be seeing
Do you hear me coming in my blue dream?

Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mother told me
The dream of love is a two-hearted dream
Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mother told me
The dream of love is a two-hearted dream

Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
