Better get another coal on the fake fire
Cover on the wet tiles, on the wet tiles

Better run it out of town
That thought will cost you more
Than just a sweet smile, to a sweet smile

And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better

And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better

Then we learn to love better
So the words you leave me on my pillow read better
Cheap card forever

Then we can pull it apart and in time you see
It's going better than ever, it's going better than ever
Hard fought, safeguard in your bedclothes

I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better

And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better

Thought and I thought and I thought of you
I thought we'd be doing the faithful few
Together, together

And I thought that you might feel the same
With your insect skin and the lion's mane
And be new, to be new

And I thought of you, it was crystal clear
I could warn myself or be new dear
And be new, to be new
To be new
