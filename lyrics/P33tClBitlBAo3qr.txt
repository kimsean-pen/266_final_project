Dark thoughts will stand to reason, but not arise
Most keep their evil on the inside
Disaster knows what hit 'em, we'll stand aside
This hollow man is evil
Inside out

Now I've seen hell deep in your eyes
Don't look too close
Inside out
You cast away, bit your tongue
He devoured me
He swallowed you
If he could he'd bleed the whole world dry

Dark thoughts will stand to reason, but not arise
Most keep their evil on the inside
Disaster knows what hit 'em, we'll stand aside
This hollow man is evil
Inside out

Your crooked smile, what's not to like?
Don't get too close
Inside out
You lost it all but you never cared
He lied to you, he fooled us all
If he could he'd bleed the whole world dry

You pushed the plot and missed it
Your brain was fried
The day you made your move
The last of you died

And in the end you've run away
The last we'll see
Inside out
Forgotten words we'll never speak
He stole from you, he stole from us all
If he could he'd bleed the whole world dry

Dark thoughts will stand to reason, but not arise
Most keep their evil on the inside
