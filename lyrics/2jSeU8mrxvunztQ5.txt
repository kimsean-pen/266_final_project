It feels so 80's
Or early 90's
To be political
Where are my friends?

(Get off the internet)
I'll meet u in the street
(Get off the internet)
Destroy the right wing
(Get off the internet)
I'll meet u in the street
(Get off the internet)
Destroy the right wing

This is repetitive
But nothing has changed
And I'm crazy
Where are my friends?

(Get off the internet)
I'll meet u in the street
(Get off the internet)
Destroy the right wing
(Get off the internet)
I'll meet u in the street
(Get off the internet)
Destroy the right wing
