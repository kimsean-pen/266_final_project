Glowing paths to the left and the right
Middle is hidden in between the lights
Unseen voices beseech you to heed
You must choose which way to proceed

Will it be fire?
Will it be frost?
You made the bet
Can you take the loss?

No forethought or hindsight
The world you wanted is a fantasy
Sunrise at twilight
You see exactly what you want to see

Perform your rites and sacraments
Pray to gods who came and went
Mortal man can't understand
Who shakes the hand that shook the hand

Will it be famine?
Will it be flood?
You've got the thirst
Who has the blood?

Without forethought or hindsight
The world you wanted is a fantasy
Sunrise at twilight
You see exactly what you want to see
