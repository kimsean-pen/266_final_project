I am a sniper
Always hit the mark
Paid assassin
Working after dark

Looking through the night
Using infra-red
Target's on you
Aimed at your head

Ten thousand up front, ten thousand when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And you know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you
Back for you

I do the "getting rid of", don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth, don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly, now we're through
It brings me great pleasure to say my next job is you

Don't you know that killing is my business...
And business is good?
Killing is my business...
And business is good!

Killing is my business...
And business is good!
Killing is my business...
And business is good!

Killing is my business...
And business is good!
Killing is my business...
And business is good!

Killing is my business...
And business is good!
Killing is my business...
And business is good!

You'd better believe it
