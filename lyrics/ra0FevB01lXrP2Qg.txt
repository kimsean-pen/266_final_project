Eileen, won't you lean on me
This is no life living here without you
This is no way for me to get alone
Now that I know I'm no good without you
Eileen, Eileen

Eileen, won't you lean on me, please
How much I had baby when I had you
I'm destitute this way
I'm doing time living here without you
Eileen, Eileen, Eileen

Eileen, I'm coming clean
guess no substitute will do
What do I do, baby, to impress you
Now that I'm blown and thrown out the way
Eileen, Eileen

Eileen, you can lean on me
Baby I'm dead in a cruel world without you
Eileen lean on me
Lean on me
Eileen baby won't you lean on me
