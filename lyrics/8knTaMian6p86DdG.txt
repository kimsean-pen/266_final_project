Looking at the stars
Looking at the sun
Light's still the same
When it comes to warm us

Sometimes there's no words
But silence is still talking
We look so stupid first
Then we start to believe in something

Hoooo come with me we gonna burn a sunset
Just take your lighter, sky will be better in red
We will find some love, we will find some light
We will never be alone, 'cause everything will be so bright.

So let's quit fooling around
I'm into you
Taken by the sound
Cause you're the love I found

Hooo i need my loneliness
But i'm lost without you
I'm feeling so fearless
When you give me the proof

That my dream is so true
When you hold me I'm alive
When you hold me I'm alive
And I'm sure when I say
You're the best friend of my life
