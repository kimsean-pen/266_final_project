Well, I'm finding it harder to be a gentleman every day
All the manners that I've been taught have slowly died away
But if I held the door open for you, it would make your day

You think that I care about me and only me
When every single girl needs help climbing up a tree
Well, I know it don't take much to satisfy me

Maybe it's whatever's in my head
That's distracting me
But if I could find emotion
To stimulate devotion
Well, then you'd see

Well, I'm finding it hard to say that I need you twenty times a day
I feel comfortable so, baby, why don't you feel the same?
Have a doctor come and visit us and tell us which one is sane

I never said I wouldn't throw my jacket in the mud for you
But my father gave it to me, so maybe I should carry you
Then you said, "You almost dropped me", so then I did
And I got mud on my shoes
