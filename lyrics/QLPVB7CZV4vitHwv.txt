Don't try and sound right,
Just hope your honest.
Trust you'll end up somewhere
That girl that made you promise she says, try not to care
I don't know if I'm good,
and everyone knows it.
You ever feel you were meant to be alone?
Cause I saw a play,
and a character said that he was destined
to never feel at home
Don't go.
Tonight, I'm looking for salt in a snow globe
Cause what I had is slipping fast.
Dr. Howe, please call back.
I'm not sleeping and, I don't care
I'm singing loud but no one hears
I'll wake up tomorrow and still feel wrong
I'm not sleeping and, I don't care
I'm singing loud but no one hears
I'll wake up tomorrow and still feel wrong for these days
Cause what I had is slipping fast.
Dr. Howe, please call me back.
What good am I to anyone like this?
It's been a hard couple months I'll admit
But after tonight
I'm not so convinced that I'm wrong,
that I'm wrong
I feel at ease with my lows, and I'll take it.
Lord knows I'll take it.
Tonight they're explainable, far from extraneous.
Always expecting,
I seldom discover or turn flaws into questions.
Great questions of the times.
I guess I'm an artist whose confines brought him luck
Choked by second guessing but I know that's not enough.
Don't go.

Don't go. No.
