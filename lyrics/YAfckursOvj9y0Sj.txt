Perfect shapes over my eyes, when I go outside
And the evening bleeding sunlight
When I see you, I'm so happy, I cry
I don't ever want to ever hear the goodbye

Hold me, I'm sinking in

So another summer in my room
Picking up the Jasmine perfumes
When I woke up, I could hear the tern fly
If I said that I was leaving, I lied

Hold me, I'm sinking in
Just beginning again
