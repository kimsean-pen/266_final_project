[3: 41]

The Ancient Queen.
Deadly hate, deadly love.
Dark under the shadow.
Death has been resisted.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury,
the Queen dwells in shadow.

Dark rivers run though me.
Darkness follows everwhere.
Kingdoms falling again and again.

Crawl to thee over again.

The Ancient Queen, the darkest woman.
Stepping through her shadow.
She who sees the soul.
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.

Stepping through her shadow.
Do you see her soul?
Black is her blood.
Keeper of the fury.

Dark under the shadow.
Thy destiny lies with her.
The Ancient Queen,
ruler of the domain.
Keeper of the fury.
In shadow... shadow.
