I'd like to be, together we'll talk
I'd like to be, together we'll walk
I'd like to be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in your eyes

I wanna be, together we dream
I wanna be, together we swim
And I wanna be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in yout eyes

No excuses
I've tried to do my best
Now i cannot run
Follow the road into the lake

I wanna be, together we fly
I wanna be, together we die
I wanna be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in your eyes

No excuses
I've tried to do my best
Now i cannot run
Follow the road into the lake

Look at that smile on her face
Now I cannot stop
To watch her
Sleeping in my hands
