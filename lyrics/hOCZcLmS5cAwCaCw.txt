Command the ear of the entangled
And they will listen, vision blinkered
No more strenght to withstand the inevitable
The now impending judgement

Exonerate the powerless and weak willed

Those with no right to be in awe of surrounding decay
Of colliding frailty and malice
Lost in darkness of regret

Our names are left nowhere in scarred ground we walk over
End the hope
End the veneration

Edge toward the realisation of denial
Still cowering

Exonarete the powerless and weak willed
Because to emerge from refuge
Is to cede we have fallen

End the hope
End the veneration
Annul the monolith to which we gave rise
Total reversion
