Love don't ask me
Love tell me what to do
And I'll do anything you ask me

Love call the shots,
Love be in charge of it
(Right?)
Love be the hope we can find,
Brave together
Uninspired in spite of the fires
The river is dead
Love for my home and my family,
Where I'm from
For fifteen minutes of what?
Fame? Hah, no
I regret nothing yet
But nothing in my life is for free, oh

Love don't ask me
Love tell me what to do
And I'll do anything
You ask me
Love don't ask me
Love tell me what to do
And I'll do anything
You ask me

Love call it off,
Love be ashamed of it
(Right?)
Love better hope we don't find,
Brave together
Weather inspired in
Sight of the fires
The river is red

Love don't ask me
Love tell me what to do
And I'll do anything you ask me
Love don't ask me
Love tell me what to do
And I'll do anything you ask me

And it's strange but it's true
I wouldn't wanna go on without you
Baby, by my side,
We survive for a week or two
Baby, me and you, we could survive

And we could build a fire so bright
I could see the world
Around us clearly for a while
A simple life alone with
You beside me would be paradise

Build a fire so bright
I could see the world
Around me clearly for a while
A simple life alone with
You beside me would be paradise
