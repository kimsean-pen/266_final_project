Peel your skin back to see what you are made of
Too bad you never did have the guts to know where your heart should go
Sit back and twiddle your fingers

Hope that no one else figures out the way that you play the game
Starve for attention
Fhat alone wouldn't you fill up

So you feed on the weak and you drink up their blood
But someday they'll turn on you
I'll watch the world go up in flames
I'll strike a match to help you do the same

The time is now, tick tock, it's ticking away
So now I'm here to rain on your parade
So take a look in the mirror
Who's that? someone in fear of running out of good places to hide

Crawl out from the dark
Feel the light hit your face
It will never be as bright as the spotlight you crave

But watch out before it burns you
I'll watch the world go up in flames
I'll strike a match to help you do the same
The time is now, tick tock, it's ticking away
So now I'm here to rain on your parade

The time is now
Tick tock, tick tock, it's tickin' away
Tick tock, tick tock, it's tickin' away
I'll watch the world go up in flames
I'll strike a match to help you do the same
The time is now
It's ticking away
So now I'm here to rain on your parade
