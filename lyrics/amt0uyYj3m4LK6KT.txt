Sometimes there's a crack in the world
That I can peer through to see it for what it really is
There's an ugly face staring back, demons are everywhere
They draw their hatred from inside of me

There are times at the top of the earth
That I wish I could throw everyone and everything
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites
I'm bathing in the thought of it

Severed dreams of all the weak
Quenching thirst inside of me
And the scream it holds the key
Locking this for all to see

Fly past the trees
Ascend to holy air and breath
Far from the leaves
Transcend these earthly boundaries
Fool fly past the trees
Ascend to hold the air and breath
Far from the leaves
Transcend the fucking boundaries

And is it this desire that you're looking for
Or is it sanity is knocking on your door?
Yeah, give me just a piece and surely you will find
Everything is better on the other side
But can you look within to find what is in store
This life is but a scream that has become your whole.
It's tearing a hole inside
You're buried alive

Sometimes there's a hole in the earth
That I can step through to get away from the twisting of tongues.
It looks a lot like a grave when I'm staring up
Feeling his eye, you're creeping over me

There were times at the top of the earth
That I wished I could throw everyone and everything
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hyporcrites
I'm bathing in the thought of it

I'd like a reason just to help them bleed
Give me a reason, come on give it to me

Give me a reason, fucking give me a reason (ha, ha)
Give me a reason, come on, give it to me

(Fly past the trees)
(Far from the leaves)

(Fly past the trees)
Ascend to holy air and breath
(Far from the leaves)
Transcend the earthly boundaries

And is it this desire that you're looking for
Or is it sanity just knocking at your door?
Yeah give me just a piece and surely you will find
Everything is better on the other side
But can you look within to find what is in store
This life is but a scream that has become your whole
It's tearing a hole inside
You're buried alive
Yeah

There's a crack in the earth, there's a crack in the earth, yeah
I'd like a reason just to help them bleed
Give me a reason come on give it to
Me
