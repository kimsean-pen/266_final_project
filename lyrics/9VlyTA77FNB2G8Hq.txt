When you're lonely
Don't be afraid, I'll keep your heart close to mine
Lay safe in my arms
Lay safe in my arms

When I'm falling
I won't stay down
'Cause I will hold you
Lay safe in my arms
Lay safe in my arms

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...

Sometimes we can relax walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise

And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)

You'll find me
As a song forget me
Try victory
With your head held high

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...

When you feel you've had enough
From this world that's giving up on you
On you...

Sometimes we can relax walking through the fire
And when it all turns to dust
We'll watch the ashes light up and we'll rise
We'll rise

And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)

We'll be fine

And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
We'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
Just give it a try
And I'm not afraid
Give it a try
And I'm not afraid
And we'll be fine
And I'm not afraid
And we'll be fine

And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)
And we'll be fine (And we'll be, And we'll be)
(And we'll be, And we'll be)

And we'll be fine, we'll be fine, yea we'll be fine
And we'll be fine, yea we'll be fine, we'll be fine
