Trying to hold my head up
I've been thinking about this mess we've made
'Cause I shouldn't have to blame myself
Took what was taught as gospel
But I don't have a clue where to go form here
'Cause I'm almost breaking, can't you tell?

I don't even understand why I'm still here
Just need a minute to go through with it
I don't even understand why I'm still here

I gave you my all but you still want more
I thought you were proud but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
You don't decide, just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know

Not trying to play the victim
I just needed to get this off my chest
It feels like my senses have kicked in

I don't even understand why I'm still here
I just need a minute to go through with it
I don't even understand why I'm still here

I gave you my all but you still want more
I thought you were proud but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
You don't decide, just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know

I gave you my all but you still want more
I thought you were proud but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
You don't decide, just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know
Just thought I'd let you know
