I thought I was over you
I'd put out the flame
Said tonight will be different
I wouldn't need to play your games
I walk past your tower block
Saw a flicker in the blinds
I said tonight will be different
And that I'll walk on by

Here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
I'ma sick of trying
I'ma sick of trying
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more

Told myself I was a prisoner
And I'd broken my chains
That I could be anyone
I'd run a thousand miles away
And I imagined America
Somewhere afar
Someplace where the memories
They couldn't cut my heart

But here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
I'ma sick of trying
I'ma sick of trying
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more
Baby could you love me some more

Cause I'm going out my head here, darling
Going out my head here, darling
Going out my head here, darling
Going out my head here, darling

But here I am
Running up the seventh floor
Knocking the eleventh door
Saying what I've said before
Baby could you love me some more
(I'm going out my head here, darling, I'm going out my head here, darling)
Baby could you love me some more
(I'm going out my head here, darling, I'm going out my head here, darling)
I'm going out my head here, darling
I'm going out my head
End
