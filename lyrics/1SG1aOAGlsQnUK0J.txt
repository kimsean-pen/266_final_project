Today I'm sleeping in
I'll wake up with the world on fire
And I'll listen to music instead of the news
'Cause I have been here before
Chasing dreams you can get so tired
Too tired to tell the dreams coming true

I got careless
I pushed you away to live for the day
But tonight I can't bear this
I'm breaking free
But what good is free if I cannot share it
With you
A cloud on the sun in a sky so blue
I was careless
So careless with you

If I could do this again
Every chord, every note, every page
Every song that I sing, I would sing them for you
So I will steady my pen
Write these words from your busted bird cage
And I'll watch the world pass from the bars you broke through

'Cause I got careless
I pushed you away to live for the day
But tonight I can't bear this
I'm breaking free
But what good is free if I cannot share it
With you
A cloud on the sun in a sky so blue
I was careless
So careless with you

When the gold of daylight breaks
Feel the sunshine on my face
Will you take me back
Even after all of my mistakes?

Yeah I got careless
I pushed you away to live for the day
But tonight I can't bear this
I'm breaking free
But what good is free if I cannot share it
With you
A cloud on the sun in a sky so blue
I was careless
So careless with you
