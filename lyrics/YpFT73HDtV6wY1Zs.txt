Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
Nooo one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away, mmm
Ooo baby, if there is anything that you fear (anything)
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
(yeah, mhum, ayeah, you know what?)

Only we know what is talked about baby boy
I don't know how you can be driving me so crazy boy
Baby when you're in town, why don't you come around boy
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me boy

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (your secrets)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Everybody say wooooo (wooooo)
Lemme hear you say woooooo (woooooo)
Lemme hear you say woooooo (woooooo)
I'm saying woo-ooooo (woo-ooooo)
Lemme hear you say I won't tell (I won't tell)
I won't tell (I won't tell) I won't tell (I won't tell)
Ooo, the secrets, break it down
