My shadow disappeared
Been gone for several years
I wait for its return
I'll be here
I'll be waiting
The mirror creeps on me
Melting suddenly
I forget as time goes by
I wish for a new sign

As long as it is gone
I won't be here for long
My shadow disappeared
Come help me, come save me
Now that you're by my side
Don't leave, don't hurt my pride
You've turned into the sign I've wished for

The light kisses my eyelids
As I take a short breath
I'm coming home
The light kisses my eyelids
As I take a short breath
I'm coming home
The light kisses my eyelids
As I take a short breath
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
