Burning on an autumn night
A piece of me has been set alight
Moving like a locomotive
To tear you up and take your wife away
Coming down like Christmas lights
Strung up on these walls for countless nights
Douse my house in gasoline
Strike a match and walk

Away, yeah
Feeding on the fainting models
Hey, yeah
White meat festival, yeah
Hey, yeah
Ocean filled with plastic bottles
Hey, yeah
And tidal waves will wash us all away
Wash us all away

I'm turning in this burning wreck
Shattered windshield, broken back
Crawling on your arms to safety
Before the flames take your life away
Stab me with stiletto heels
Feed me pills and happy meals
Leave me here to bleed out slowly
Smile, spit, and swiftly walk

Away, yeah
Feeding on the fading models
Hey, yeah
White meat festival, yeah
Hey, yeah
Ocean filled with plastic bottles
Hey, yeah
And tidal waves will wash us all away

They left us here to wander
They left us here to stay
Our dreams were torn asunder
Quickly washed away
Stranded in the ocean
Lost our only boat
Abandoned here and broken
Cost us everything we own

Hey, yeah
Feeding on the fading models
Hey, yeah
White meat festival, yeah
Hey, yeah
Ocean filled with plastic bottles
Hey, yeah
And tidal waves will wash us all away
Wash us all away
Wash us all away
Wash us all away
