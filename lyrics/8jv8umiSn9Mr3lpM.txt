Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
(Leave yourself alone)
Can't you see
You're only here
To be torn apart
Based upon
And nothing else

So leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
Tell your wasted time
Tell your wasted time
Tell your wasted time
That I am worse

And I would wish they'd all
Give him a chance
I owe apologies
So tell your wasted time
Tell your wasted time

It's torture
Locked inside the chamber

Cornered by yourself
Cornered by yourself
(Cornered by yourself)
You must admit
That you are the instigator
Hanging on to arguements
And your cornered
By yourself
Cornered by yourself
It's torture
Locked inside the chamber
Lost inside the chamber
Locked inside the chamber
About right I think
