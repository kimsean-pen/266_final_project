Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the morning
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine

You need to pick me up
I'll be there in twenty five
I like to push my luck
So take my hand, let's take a drive
I've been living in the future
Hoping I might see you sooner
I want you, right at shotgun I knew
When a gal won right

Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the morning
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line

I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine

I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
We're in our twenties talking flirty shit
We're making money but we're saving it
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of vip
You won't stay with me, I know
But you can let away with me until you go
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I don't want it

Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the morning
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better, I know better, I know better than to ever call you mine
