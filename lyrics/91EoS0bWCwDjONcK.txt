I wasn't thinking of you
When I decided just how you should be
I wanted that which would make me whole
I wanted something I didn't even know

You are the screen I project in
Diamonds on the moon
I wish we could see through
But you keep stepping on the landmines
I set up for you
I was crawling for love
You were begging for more
But all we do is...

And I did swear to you
That you would never be alone
And I would feel
What you want me to
Even if for that I must be gone
Billions of screens and projectors

Diamonds on the moon
I wish we could see through
But you keep stepping on the landmines
I set up for you
I was crawling for love
You were begging for more
But all we do is...

I win, You loose
I win, You win
I loose, You win
I win, You loose
I win, You win
I loose, You win
You win, I loose
You win, I win
You loose, I win
You win, I loose
You win, I win
You loose, I win
You win, I loose
You win, I win
You loose, I win
You win, I loose
You win, I win

I just wanted you to know
I was trying to find in you
A little piece of me
But I have all the peace I was looking for

Diamonds on the moon
I wish you could see through
But you keep stepping on the landmines
I set up for you
I was crawling for love
Begging for more
But all we do is

No way I was wrong
No way I was wrong
No way I was wrong
No way I was wrong
