It's run down
The back of my head
The back of my mind
About a hundred thousand times
And I can't
Seem to shake it
Seem to shake it
Addiction's tying me down

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
I've been through this patch before

I'm lost and alone in my head
And I can't make sense of myself
I need to find a simple way
To make this pain just disappear
I know I'll never feel
Safe in my own skin

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

No matter how long I'm gone for
It's at the back of my mind
Another sleepless night
Somebody get me home

I'm so far down
And there's nothing anyone can say to me
I'm so down, I'm so down

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
