It may happen in your life,
that you find a word that can describe
all the rooms that I have lived in,
all the lives that I've walked through
Every face, every dream, every view
Amigoless, otra vez
but something in that freedom
feels like happiness
I was always so embarrassed about what I wrote,
but deep inside there was always a little hope
that someone's gonna find my notes
You promised me you'd show me where you live,
but boy was I disappointed once you did
My heart just got more crowded than my bed,
as we decided to be just friends instead
Dear diary, you won't believe
the desire vs. destiny...
In every place, every me every you
