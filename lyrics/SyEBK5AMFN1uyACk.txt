You tell me things aren't fair
Like i was unaware
So who told you, you could change your mind
And run that whenever, stars aligned
Well its not true you would never follow through
No its not true, you never wanted to

And since you came
Its never been the same
So i know its not an accident
We're faced down with our branches spent

Well... something else is out there (out there)
Something else is out there (out there)
For me

I just can't be bothered
I just can't be bothered
No i... no i dont wanna know oh
I dont wanna know oh oh

Tonight we pull the plug
Sweep you underneath the rug
You compare to where im all the time
Just leave your parachute behind

Let me know where you fall
Tell me when u hear the call
Know when you fall
You wouldn't try it on

And since you came
It's been an open flame
No we??? to where im wanted just
And leave behind what matters most

Cause i dont need a reason
Nothing comes from nothing baby
I dont wanna know-oh
I dont wanna know-oh
