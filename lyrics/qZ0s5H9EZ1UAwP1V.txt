These cold barrer shores
are a prison without doors
your singing brings hope near,
cause hope doesn't live here
It's a starry wide sky,
your song echoes in the night
I join it with my fute
and hope you will come and sing it too

Now listen to my call and sing for things
unknown and in the end
sing your melody for the memory of my unfulfilled dreams

I am like you but my wings are broken
In this dismal land I am wandering alone
Now listen to my call
I'm like a wounded bird away from home
Show me a way to leave this place
Now answer to my call

You gave me a key, now I look at the wide sea
I finally know how
I can find my own way out!

Now listen to my call and sing for things unknown
and in the end
sing your melody for the memory of my unfulfillrd dreams

I am like you but my wings are broken
In this dismal land I am wandering alone
Now listen to my call
I'm like a wounded bird away from home
Show me a way to leave this place

The caged bird sings for freedom,
hoping with a tear that springs,
to fly and leave behind the prison and feel the wing under this wings

I am like you, In this dismal land
I am wandering alone
Now listen to my call
I'm like a wounded bird away from home
Show me a way to leave this place
Now answer to my call
