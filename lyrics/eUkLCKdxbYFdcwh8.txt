But there's not a bit of truth in what you hear
Just a whole lot of jealousy out there smearin'
My good name all over the place
Just to get you thinkin' that I'm two-faced

But I would never go south
I was never dreamin' of anybody else
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but, baby, the truth is

I ain't never gonna give you up
I ain't never gonna let you down, baby
I ain't never gonna give you up

I wanna be right there for you so don't
Believe another word 'cause all of those low girls
Only wanna put the split between us
They keep getting off on all the fuss

But I will always treat you
Just the way I always promised I'd do
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but, baby, the truth is

I ain't never gonna give you up
