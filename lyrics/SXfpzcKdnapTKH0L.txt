His embrace: a fortress
It fuels me and places
a skeleton of trust
right beneath us
bone by bone
stone by stone

If you ask yourself patiently and carefully:
who is it?
who is it?

Who is it - that never lets you down?
Who is it - that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are
they're going around
now they're handing it over
they're handing it over
handing it over

Who is it - that never lets you down?
Who is it - that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are
they're going around
now -- they're handing it over
handing it over

He demands a closeness
we all have earned a lightness
carry my joy on the left
carry my pain on the right

If you ask yourself
now patiently
and carefully:
who is it?

Who is it - that never lets you down?
Who is it - that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are
they're going around
and I'm handing it over
handing it over
handing

Who is it - that never lets you down?
Who is it - that gave you back your crown?
and the ornaments are
they're going around
now I'm handing it over
handing it over
