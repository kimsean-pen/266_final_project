You don't know how hard I wish it works out for you
I'm sure you'll make it through
And you don't know any time I reached out for you
I'm sure you've seen it all before

Baby, I'm here at the end of your sleeve
Baby, I know what your body needs
So, when it gets too cold just call
And I'll drop it home

Shine on, shine on through the dark
I'm a label on your heart
I'm a symbol of our love

Shine on, shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on

You don't know any time I [?] for you
And I think it's true
All I've shown any time I reached out for you
I know that'll be soon, that'll be soon, girl

Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on

Shine on, shine on through the dark
I'm a label on your heart
I'm a symbol of our love

Shine on, shine on through the dark
I'm a label on your heart
I'm a symbol of our love

Shine on
Baby, I'm here, baby, I know
Shine on
Body's needs, when it gets too cold
Shine on
Baby, I'm here, sleeping for warmth
Everything's cold, be so warm.
