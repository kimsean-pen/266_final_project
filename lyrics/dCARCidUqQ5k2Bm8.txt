Welcome! To mh kingdom of hearts
Feed my ego with lust
Slide my fingers inside and spread you like warpaint on my skin
And now you're welcome
By the grace of my hands
Take in my wonderland
Where the streets painted red
Fill me with your poison in my skin and now you're mine

Cover me with your youth and beauty
Your death stings a rose in bloom now faded red
Cover me with your youth

Bow down
I'm the Vasilissa
The queen
The queen of hearts
Bow down
Kiss the rings agapa me
The queen
The queen of hearts

The faithful grab the holes in their chest
Spill the blood of my blood
I stain the rouge on my face
Bathe me in your crimson, the story of your life ends now

Cover me with your youth and beauty
Your death stings a rose in bloom now faded red
Cover me with your youth

Bow down
I'm the Vasilissa
The queen
The queen of hearts
Bow down
Kiss the rings agapa me
The queen
The queen of hearts

Your life flows circles around
We are one in this blood sea
Let's paint this town red
Your heartbeat muffled in my hands
I am you and you are me
Let's paint this town red

Cover me
Cover me
Cover me with your youth

Bow down
I'm the Vasilissa
The queen
The queen of hearts
Bow down
Kiss the rings agapa me
The queen
The queen of hearts
