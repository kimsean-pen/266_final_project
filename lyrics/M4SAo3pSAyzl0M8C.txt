This heart is for the wrecking
But leave it up to me
This heart is for the wrecking
But leave it up to me
Leave it up to me

These arms won't last forever
So I can't promise you we will
Can't promise you we will
These arms won't last forever
So I can't promise you we will
I can't promise you

Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
And weren't we the beautiful ones
I promise we were
I promise we were

Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
Weren't we beautiful once
For now we see in all directions
For now we see in all directions
For now we see in all directions
(Weren't we beautiful once)
For now we see in all directions
(Weren't we beautiful once)
