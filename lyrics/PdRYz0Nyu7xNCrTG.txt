It has always been in the back of my mind
Dreaming about going through the corners of time
I always wanted to fly
In strange machines

I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And feel it with my hands
Touch the world war ii and cleopatra
Flying...

Could it be that my dream would come true
Building a machine that would actually do
What i want it to do

Russian revelution let's do that in one day
Beethoven and gerswin i think that would be okay
More than anything i wanna fly
In strange machines

I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And see it with my eyes
Watch jesus rise if he ever did
Flying...
I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And touch it with my hands
Touch the renaissance and shaka khan
Flying...
