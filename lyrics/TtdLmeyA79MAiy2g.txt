You go ahead
There's something I forgot
Walk slow and I'll catch up
Let's hear the stars do their talking

And I used to love caves
Stumble out into that big sky
Remember that bright hollow moon?
Showed our insides on our outsides

This town closes down same time everyday
Put out the smoke in your mind
Let's put all these words away
Lets put all these words away

Now I think alike birds
See I'm far from St. Paul
And I go running when the night aches
Hear her every time she calls

Did I hear something break
Was that your heart or my heart
Like when the Earth shakes
Then the silence that follows

This town closes down same time everyday
Put out the smoke in your mind
Let's put all these words away
Lets put all these words away
Lets put all these words away

Let's put all these words away
Lets put all these words away
Lets put all these words away

Let's put all these words away
Lets put all these words away
Lets put all these words away
