If you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Off of the strip

In the outskirts
In the fringes
In the corner Out
of the grip

If you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Off of the strip

In the outskirts
In the fringes
In the corner Out
of the grip

When they ask me "What are you looking at?"
I always answer "Nothing much" (not much)
I think they know that
I'm looking at them I think they think
I must be out of touch

But I'm only
In the outskirts
And in the fringes
On the edge
And off the avenue
And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you

I think that somehow
Somewhere inside of us
We must be similar
If not the same So

I continue
To be wanting you
Left of center
Against the grain
If you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Off of the strip

In the outskirts
In the fringes
In the corner Out
of the grip

When they ask me "What are you looking at?"
I always answer "Nothing much" (not much)
I think they know that
I'm looking at them I think they think
I must be out of touch

But I'm only In the outskirts
And in the fringes
On the edge And off the avenue
And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you

And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you

And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you
Wondering about you
Wondering about you

And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you

And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center
Wondering about you

Wondering about you
