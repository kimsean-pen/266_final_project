Feels like I'm just getting to know you
The conversation just got going
It's been the perfect night
Everything's just right
I can see the sun is starting to set
And we haven't even started yet
Blame it on the moon
For showing up so soon
Caught up in a whirlwind
That I don't want to ever end

Something 'bout this moment
I just wanna hold it
Never let it out of my sight
Something 'bout this feeling
I just wanna keep it
Last thing I wanna do tonight
Is have to say goodbye

Let's rewind and start all over
Sing the song a little slower
Try to memorize
The way we feel tonight
Everybody knows you can't stop time
That doesn't mean you're gonna stop me from trying
I just want to stay
Right here with you, right here with you
Caught up in whirlwind
And all I need is you and me
Right here together

Something 'bout this moment
I just wanna hold it
Never let it out of my sight
Something 'bout this feeling
I just wanna keep it
Last thing I wanna do tonight
Is have to say goodbye

Pretty soon tomorrow's gonna come around
But, it's not here yet, so we won't let it bring us down
Oh bring it down

Something 'bout this moment
I just wanna hold it
Never let it out of my sight
Something 'bout this feeling
I just wanna keep it
Last thing I wanna do tonight
Last thing I wanna do tonight
Is have to say goodbye
Goodbye

Something 'bout this moment
Something 'bout this feeling
