Trapped in time and I don't know what to do
These friends of mine, I can see right through
You don't gotta tell me how I don't gotta move
'Cuz I'm sittin' back here sharin' in the groove

Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)
Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)
Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)

I walk through the hallways inside my mind
I chase the back beat from behind
Big dude in the doorway was blockin' my way
He reached to grab me and this is what he said

Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)
Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)
Me no want no nice guy
(Me no want no nice guy)

This is the end, my only friend, the end
Indians lying on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts in the young child's fragile mind
Careful with that axe, Eugene
Mother
Careful with that axe, Eugene
