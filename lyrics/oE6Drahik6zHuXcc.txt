You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail right around all the seven oceans
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
She's as sweet, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee
You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granites
Knights in armor bent on chivalry
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
(She's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee
You can't stop us on the road to freedom
You can't stop us 'cause our eyes can see
Men with insight, men in granite
Knights in armor intent on chivalry
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
She's an angel of the first degree
(She's an angel)
She's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee
Oh, you know she's alright, oh, she's alright with me
(She's an angel)
But you know, you know, you know
She's alright, she's alright with me
(She's an angel)
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, she's alright, alright with me

She's all, she's alright, she's alright, she's alright with me
(She's an angel)
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright, she's alright
(She's an angel)
You can take all the tea in China
Put it in a big brown bag for me
Sail it right around all the seven oceans
Drop it, smack dab in the middle of the deep blue sea
Because she's as sweet as tupelo honey, yes she is
She's an angel of the first degree
(She's an angel)
Oh, she's as sweet as tupelo honey
Just like honey, baby, from the bee

Just like the real thing from, from the bee
You know, she's alright, oh, she's alright, she's alright with me
