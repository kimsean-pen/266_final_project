In another life, in another place
Maybe you'd have found what brings some to believe
On a different road, in a perfect space
Maybe all the hurt you've known would fail to be

Never mind the pain
Cause love can only heal
If only you could trade the dark for light
It might reveal
That there's a place inside
Don't be afraid to feel
Cause love can only heal

Did it let you go when you lost your way
Did it throw you to the wind and watch you break
Does it haunt you now, are you ever safe
From the empty space inside that you can't take

Never mind the pain
Cause love can only heal
If only you could trade the dark for light
It might reveal
That there's a place inside
Don't be afraid to feel
Cause love can only heal

Never mind the pain
Cause love can only heal
If only you could trade the dark for light
It might reveal
That there's a place inside
Don't be afraid to feel
Cause love can only
Heal

Love

Cause love can only heal
