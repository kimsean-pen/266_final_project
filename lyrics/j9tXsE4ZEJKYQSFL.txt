I closed my eyes opened up my eyes
That made me close my eyes so then I opened
My eyes
Like living in a dream

As long as I stay closed like that
Secretive to stay intact
Well that is not fun
That's why I couldn't trust anyone at all

I got high
I got low
I got high

I was bright as the sun
Then saskatchewan
Then I laid low like a tide
Then bay of fundy high
I was living in extremes
And everything that that means
I got high
I got low
I got high
I got low

Get not high
Get not low
I can't tell or be told where to go

Get not high
Get not low
I can't tell or be told where to go

Get not high
Get not low
I can't tell or be told where to go
