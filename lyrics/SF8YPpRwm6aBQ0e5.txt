I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Got you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Got you lookin' at it, put you in a trance, aye
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me

Aye, I'm dropping licks like Mariah
My verses are icy
Somehow they on fire
I'm not good at science
I'm like Eminem but I got a vagina, aye
I cannot fake it
It's not made in China
No need for ghostwriter
And, yeah, you talking shit while your girl on the street and she passing out all of my fliers
Ooh, these females inspired
She listen to me 'cause my music describe her
I know that the hustle's required
I'm all for this hip-hop
I never get tired
I keep dropping bars and I only get tighter
You watching me rap like, "I like her, I like her"
So put some good green on my rider
I'm all the way up
I can only get higher
What are you thinking?
The glasses are clinking
The haters are blinking like "fuck"
My swagger's immaculate
Crisp like a bag of chips
Look at you falling in love
I came way too far to be average
I'm calling the shots and the factors
My confidence makes me a savage, yeah

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Got you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Got you lookin' at it, put you in a trance, yeah
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me
