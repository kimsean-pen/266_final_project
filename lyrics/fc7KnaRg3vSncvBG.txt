Let's make out, let's make out
Or are you too shy?
Or are you too shy?
Let's make out, let's make out
Are we just too shy?
Are you too shy?

Two steps and I'll follow
And tip down to the hallway
Or meet me by the car
'Cause it's not parked very far
We're spending time
And we're wasting our youth
We're stuck in a kissing booth
So tell me two steps and I'll follow
If you give me two steps, I'll follow

Let's make out, let's make out
Like Frenchie in the park
Let's make out, let's make out
Queen Naomi in the dark

Say, let's make out
So let's make out
Are we too shy?
Are we too shy?
Let's make out, let's make out
Turn your lips to me
Lights out
