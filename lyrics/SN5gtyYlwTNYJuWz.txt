I am, not made for working overtime
And you know
Don't even like the nine to five
I wish all those lazy days were everyday
And you know
Wouldn't want it any other way
Although some might say
I throw life away
I just ain't got time to save
I might be insane
And I may complain
don't believe no pain no gain

I'm busy, busy, busy
Doing nothin' at all
I'm stressin' over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doing nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doing nothin' at all

Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I dream
Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I dream

I am, always almost there in five
And it's, always the night before deadlines
You know, don't bother calling before noon
Even when, you say later its still too soon
Although some might say
I throw life away
I just ain't got time to save
I might be insane
And I may complain
don't believe no pain no gain

I'm busy, busy, busy
Doing nothin' at all
I'm stressin' over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doing nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doing nothin' at all

Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I dream
Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work

I wanna make money while I dream
You may, not approve of my lifestyle
And while, you working I'll be living life
So you, can call me lazy if you like
Don't care, this is the story of my life
Cause I'm busy, busy, busy

Doing nothin' at all
I'm stressin' over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doing nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doing nothin' at all

Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I dream
Don't wanna work, work, work
I wanna make money while I sleep
Dont wanna work, work, work
Don't wanna work
