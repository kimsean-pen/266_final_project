How much is riding on it?
How much is saying I quit?
We've all been here some day
Yours might be a den to sleep in
Mine is just a way of being
I'm not here to pass on a judgment of passion
I'd like just to say to keep up
Keep it up until the day you've got what you want
I see that we are reared in a similar way
Try to figure it out
See your hopes become my hopes
Is there no hope?
