How many ways can you kill a man?
That's all we understand
Wanna walk through the garden with you
The twisted olive trees and the beautiful view

Surprised by the joy of this
Surprised I'm alive by kiss
It's a one step at a time, my love
Say, hello to the world again
You surprised by the joy of this
I can't describe this feeling
Surprised I'm alive by kiss
I'll say hello to the world again

Someone filming you wherever you go
There's no privacy at all
I wanna walk through the garden with you
Those twisted trees, the beautiful view

Surprised by the joy of this
Goodbye to the loneliness
I'm surprised by the joy of this
Say, hello to the world again
You surprised by the joy of this
Surprised I'm alive by kiss
It's a one step at a time, my love
I'll say hello to the world again

A natural rebel, here I am
But some of you won't understand
Yes, it's one step at a time, my love
I wanna give you all I got

I'm surprised by the joy I feel
I can't believe I'm alive, I guess
I'm surprised by the joy of this
Surprised I'm alive I guess
It's one beat at a time, my love
I'll say hello to the world again

'Cause I'm not playing
And this is no lie
This is need saying
I wanna live
I wanna die

Yeah
Yeah

Surprised by the joy of this
Surprised by the joy of this
One bit at a time, my love
I'll say hello to the world again
One bit at a time, my girl
I'll say hello to the world again

I'm surprised by the joy
Surprised by the joy
I'm surprised by the joy
Surprised by the joy
Surprised by the joy
Surprised by the joy
Surprised by the joy
Yeah, (surprised by the joy)
Come on, come on, come on, come on (surprised by the joy)
Surprised, I'm surprised (surprised by the joy)
I'm surprised
I'm surprised
So surprised
So surprised
