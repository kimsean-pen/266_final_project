Did the bull crush me
Or do I still give a fuck
Is my heart ripped out
Or just shriveled up
Add water and it's back like a brine shrimp
Rob, pimp, fuck, steal, murder, limp by, scrimp
Welcome to your life kid
Rock bottom shit hole
Grab a shovel
Dig down
Try to hit coal
Santa's in the North Pole doing fentanyl
No more good little boys
So he meant to kill himself
But he couldn't find a vein with the hot steel
He couldn't find himself at all
Bitch he's not real

Does it feel fucked up?
(Does it feel fucked up?)

Does it feel fucked up?
(Does it feel fucked up?)

I'd be real dumb if I seem super
Every day we're digging out our souls with an ice cream scooper
Visine might clean our tears
But I fear you'd be worse off if your sight's clear
Don't like the view here
All my pyros go fill your eye droppers up with some nitro
Glycerin, discipline, steady with the hand
Wanna have your mind blown
Ready for a bang
Eyes wide open let me know what you hear
Might be a slight ringing in your ears

It's check in time
How does it feel?
(How does it feel)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

Feels alright
Feels alright
Feels alright

Pretty nice huh?
We can go on for days like that
