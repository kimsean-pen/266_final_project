The day after I had counted down all of your friends down until
There were none, were none, were none, were none
A hummingbird crashed right in front of me and I understood all you did for us.
You gave, and gave, and gave, and gave
Ohhh, every night I ask myself
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I?
If you never knew how much
If you never felt all of my love
I pray now you do, you do, you do, you do
Ohhh, every night I ask myself
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I?
Patricia, every night I'll ask myself
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I giving enough?
Am I?
Patricia, every night I'll ask myself
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I loving enough?
Am I?
