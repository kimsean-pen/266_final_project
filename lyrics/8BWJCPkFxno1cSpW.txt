We are just the monkeys who fell out of the trees
We are blisters on the earth
And we are not the flowers, we're the strangling weeds in the meadow
And love is just our way of looking out for ourselves
When we don't want to live alone
So step into the vacuum, tear off your clothes and be born again

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just animal reflexes no one looking on
Forget about fashion, forget about the law
Pretend that you're alone now

I wonder what I'd do if I could wake up every morning with a clean slate
I'd burn through the cities and tear through the towns because there's no deals to make
So break out of the cages, the delicate structures we cling to all our lives
Because we are just the monkeys who fell out of the trees
When we were trying to fly

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just primal desire, no right and no wrong
Forget about the future, forget about blame
Pretend that you're alone now

She's not waiting for tomorrow
And she has no love in her eyes

Oh no, I want to come down right now
Pull over, I want to get out right now

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just animal reflexes, no one looking on
Forget about religion, forget about shame
Pretend that you're alone now
No numbers in your phone now, there's nothing going on
Just primal desire, no right and no wrong
Forget about fashion, forget about fame
Pretend that you're alone now
