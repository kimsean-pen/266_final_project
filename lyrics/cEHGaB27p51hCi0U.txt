Days swiftly come and go
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions astir
The sun is gone the nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall

Did you think that I would cry, on the phone?
Do you know what it feels like, being alone?
I'll find someone new

Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart
Is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love

Did you think that I would cry, on the phone?
Do you know what it feels like, being alone?
I'll find someone new

Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart
Is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

...
Bury me
You thought your problems were gone

Carry me away, away, away
Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart
Is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
Swing, swing, swing, from the tangles of my heart
Is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart
Is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
