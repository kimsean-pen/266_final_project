Bad love, mediocre sex
Didn't care who's coming next
Nights spent rolling out for danger
Days spent waking up with strangers
Leave
You're not a stranger to me

Drinking, drug and rock and roll
Appliances you couldn't hold
Simple models, movie stars
Waitresses and girls from Mars
Weren't you
They just weren't you

She said I love you so
Maybe it's easy, it's easy
How could I ever know
Things ain't been that easy, not easy for me
But when you know, you know
This one I'll never let, never let go

How to know which lies to keep
Talking to someone else asleep
You wear a mask for long enough
You just forget to take it off
Not you
You could see right through

Around you I'm just myself
And maybe it's easy, it's easy
When I found you, I found myself
You made it so easy, so easy for me
But when you know, you know
This one I'll never let, never let go

I built a kingdom up on the hill
If you hadn't found me, I'd be there still
Up on that hill
Your tank rolled right through
Love's a revolution, revolution for two

She said I love you so
Maybe it's easy, it's easy
How could I ever know
She hates the same people as, people as me
But when you know, you know
This one I'll never let, never let go
