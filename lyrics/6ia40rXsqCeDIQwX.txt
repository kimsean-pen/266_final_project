A day of great tribulation is upon us
A time of deception, conflict and unrest
I will not cower in fear and submission
I will hold my ground and resist

It all starts in the mind
From the beginning of days
To the last and final end
Uncertainty bleeds from within
Open wounds stitched with precision
Mind and body conditioned to obey
They call us sons and daughters
Only sheep led to the slaughter
So many times
So many lies
I am disconnected from a system I've rejected

No allegiance
Defiant I withstand
This resistance
I reject what you demand
And alone I stand

Rank, file and number
We are gears in the machine
Unseen to the eye
The shackles are on the inside
Illusion of security
Rejection of this supremacy
Confusion lead us to submission
Disconnection from a system I've rejected

No allegiance
Defiant I withstand
This resistance
I reject what you demand
And alone I stand

There is great tribulation
Upon us all
Deception, conflict, and unrest
Upon us all (upon us all)
I will hold my ground
I will, I will resist

No allegiance (no allegiance)
I reject what you demand (what you demand)
And alone I stand
