I was dancing for a while
See I was trying to perfect the style
Out on that dancefloor
Ooh, boy did I sweat
Shaking to get noticed has not worked for me yet
But I'll keep trying

See I was swinging
My blonde hair 'round
See I was trying to get my feet off the ground
And I rose steady
To the roof of my room
I may not be a great dancer
But I might be a good one soon

Yeah I'll keep trying
Dancing for yourself ain't bad when you're dying to find
That sweet step
That will help to free your mind
