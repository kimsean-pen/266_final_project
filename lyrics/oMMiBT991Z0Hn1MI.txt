Oh how things have changed
Feels like I don't know you
You're in a whole different place
And I've strayed from who it was that you knew
We're drifting apart we're parallel sinking ships
You're anxiously reaching out but I'm losing my grip

You were tryna make it work
You were sleeping in my shirt
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle

I was hoping that you'd care
I was distant I was scared
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle

You're still on my mind somehow
You're fit and you're shades of blue
There's no way to go back now
Couldn't get back even if we wanted to
Couldn't get back even if we wanted

You were tryna make it work
You were sleeping in my shirt
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle

I was hoping that you'd care
I was distant I was scared
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle

Sometimes things don't come full circle
Sometimes things don't come full circle

You were tryna make it work
You were sleeping in my shirt
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle

I was hoping that you'd care
I was distant I was scared
Arcadia
Sometimes things don't come full circle
Sometimes things don't come full circle
