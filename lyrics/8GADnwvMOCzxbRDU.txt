Fake, fiction, make believe
Bring out the worst in you
Bring out the best in me
And so
I've gotta learn to let you go
It's fake, fiction, make believe
You wouldn't share the truth
I was too blind to see
And so
I've gotta learn to let you
Learn to let you go

First up with the worst luck
Impulsive calls
Chew me up and spit me out
Each time I fall
Why can't you just be real with me

It's all, it's all
It's all, it's all just

Fake, fiction, make believe
Bring out the worst in you
Bring out the best in me
And so
I've gotta learn to let you go
It's fake, fiction, make believe
You wouldn't share the truth
I was too blind to see
And so
I've gotta learn to let you
Learn to let you go

I know, I know
It'll never be the same
I am, I am
Certainly ashamed
The tell tale in your eyes
When you wear that crooked smile
That crooked smile
That crooked smile

Fake, fiction, make believe
Bring out the worst in you
Bring out the best in me
And so
I've gotta learn to let you go

Fake, fiction, make believe
Bring out the worst in you
Bring out the best in me
And so
I've gotta learn to let you go
It's fake, fiction, make believe
You wouldn't share the truth
I was too blind to see
And so
I've gotta learn to let you
Learn to let you go
