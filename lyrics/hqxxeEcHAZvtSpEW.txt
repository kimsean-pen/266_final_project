Have I been facing the wrong way, baby?
I gotta turn it around
I gotta foot in the door, just maybe
I'm tired of kidding myself

Is this just a dream, am I freaking out?
Don't let me go, don't leave me out
It's not a dream

Think I'm doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
It's what I'm trying to tell myself

Don't take this the wrong way, baby
I've gotta slow it all down
I'm sick of taking the shortcut, maybe
There ain't no easy way out

Is this just a dream, 'cause I'm freaking out
Don't let me go, don't leave me out
I'm not going away, I'm not burning out
Leave me alone, or I'll shut you out
I'm not freaking out

'Cause I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
It's what I'm trying to tell myself

'Cause I've been doing alright by myself
(Don't even think about it)
I've been doing alright by myself
(You wouldn't like me)
I've been doing alright by myself
(Don't wanna live without it)
It's what I'm trying to tell myself
(But will it find me?)

'Cause I've been doing alright by myself
(Don't even think about it)
I've been doing alright by myself
(You wouldn't like me)
I've been doing alright by myself
(Don't wanna live without it)
It's what I'm trying to tell myself
(But will it find me?)

It's what I'm trying to tell myself
(But will it find me?)
It's what I'm trying to tell myself
