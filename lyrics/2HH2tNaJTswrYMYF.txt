Amelle: Are you ready, Heidi?
Heidi: Uh hum
Amelle: Keisha?
Keisha: Yeah, Amelle?
Amelle: Oh yeah! Let's go!

You're messed up from your chromosomes to your enzymes
Remember the time when you took my ride?
I had to get it from the impound
My favorite rims were gone
And later when I asked you bout it you just said "yeah"

But then at least you didn't crash
If you had some cash
Left from selling my rims in the car
Parked behind the bar

Chorus
And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

You messed up like when I went to Tokyo for promotion
And got back had a bail for two G's
Or when you fell asleep
Calling me overseas
Asking bout my goal for the cash machine
And you just said "yeah"

But you tried to keep the house key
But then your new party friends went
And called for some stripper
and then I just said (fine)

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

Keisha: Ladies

I want it, I hate it, I need it
I want it, want it, want it
I hate it, I want it, I need it(x2)

But you tried to keep the house key
But then your new party friends went
And called for some stripper
and then I just said
(you're gonna make it up to me you know you are)

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway
