i don't ask very much in life
don't be afraid to
lose control on the floor tonight
with you i want to
i want to twist and shout
i want to twist now
i'm too tired to scream and yell and fight
no i don't want to
lose your love tonight
tonight i want to
i want to twist and shout
i want to twist
you better be good, you better let it go
i want to twist and shout
i want to twist
