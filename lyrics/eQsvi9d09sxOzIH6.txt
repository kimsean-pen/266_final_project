Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die
Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die

Look into my eyes
Crystal clear
Born underground
But my roots are in the air (roots in the air)
Look into my eyes
Crystal clear
Born underground
But my roots are in the air (roots in the air)

I got my roots over the ground
'Cause my mind is a castle moving around
I got my limbs up in the sky
'Cause my heart is a bird ready to fly

This is my liberty, no chains
My creativy through my veins
So come and catch me in the rain
Come and catch me
This is my liberty, no chains
My creativy through my veins
So come and catch me in the rain
Come and catch me

Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die
Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die

Look into my eyes
Crystal clear
Born underground
But my roots are in the air (roots in the air)
Look into my eyes
Crystal clear
Born underground
But my roots are in the air (roots in the air)

I got my roots over the ground
'Cause my mind is a castle moving around
I got my limbs up in the sky
'Cause my heart is a bird ready to fly

This is my liberty, no chains
My creativy through my veins
So come and catch me in the rain
Come and catch me
This is my liberty, no chains
My creativy through my veins
So come and catch me in the rain
Come and catch me

Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die
Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die

Up in the sky where my roots go fly
Close to the rain where my roots don't die
