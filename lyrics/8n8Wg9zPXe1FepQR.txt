Tell me about my potential
And if you were me what you would do
You love the sound of your own voice
Is this conversation an interview?

Jump down from your high horse
Let's talk truth
Try something other than low-hanging fruit
Pour out the champagne
While I sing myself the blues
This one's for you

Everyone around me
Thinks I'm going to fail
But they can go to hell
They can go to
Hello, I'm no one to you
And before I wish you well
Go to hell

There's more than two dimensions
But you only see a point of view
You spend your nights doing spoonfuls
Keep your nose out of the things I do

Jump down from your high horse
Let's talk truth
Try something other than low-hanging fruit
Pour out the champagne
While I sing myself the blues
This one's for you

Everyone around me
Thinks I'm going to fail
But they can go to hell
They can go to
Hello, I'm no one to you
And before I wish you well
Go to hell

Go to hell

It's too late for words
I can hear your eyes
Roll backwards loud and clear
On this little Earth
Life's too short to waste it
On somebody else's fears

Everyone around me
Thinks I'm going to fail
But they can go to hell
They can go to
Hello, I'm no one to you
And before I wish you well
Go to hell
