Sarah settle down,
keep your helmet on
walk through streets of gold
with cigarettes you hand rolled
i don't know you
and I don't owe you a thing

but I smile so hard it hurts
and just when things get worse
you say you've woken from a dream
abandoned by your mother
oh could this be?

satan, settle down!
keep your trousers on
you can warm the globe,
but leave my wretched soul alone
I don't know you!
and I don't owe you a thing

but the children lose their minds
in such uncertain times
I am awoke from a dream
surrounded by my lovers
oh, woe is me!

and a hundred thousand times a day
the yellow lights turn red
and a hundred thousand miles away
i'm turnin' myself in
oh christ, i am!

the children lose their minds
in such uncertain times
