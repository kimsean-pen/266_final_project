I took a worn out strand of your cellophane hair and stretched it sideways
and though my mind slipped though between the sea with me
my brain stopped working from the cold
I sort of strayed from what we know
so I'll be like you and I'll do what's right
I'll win a love I don't deserve out on the ice tonite
Teach me the bluest song you know
The moon ain't comin' up
and I swear to God tonite it feels like snow
glad we got your hands warm so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
whe world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
maybe catch a new wave
feels right
so we ride whales and drag race time
and knock the fires from the traces of trilobyte hives
you sleep like God inside her womb
and you see clearly too
the silicon wasteland they left inside my mind
glad we got your hands warm
so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
the world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
maybe catch a new wave
we've lost the road now
inject the charms
and we care for all of ours, we stand in rows now
transfer alarms
just like the Inuit with the promise song
come down and see
Your solvents frozen here on the petal rung
is all we have to see
enlarged inside as we espy
the warming sea.
Your breath diffused and never realized
aside from where tthe panicked hide
and I
just a subtle lift
provider on the other side
