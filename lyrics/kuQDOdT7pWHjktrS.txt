The writing's on the wall
Your crimson touch is goin no where
I'll hang on every word you said
And sink my teeth into this nightmare

Woah oh oh oh ...
I'm screaming out
Can you hear me?

I bleed for you
Forever I will lie awake
I would Die For You
I see the truth
I've given you my heart to break
I would Die For You

I feel your body crawl
Pale flesh for my devotion
True pain was all you ever meant

Love would be our last emotion
Woah oh oh oh...
I'm screaming out
Can you hear me?
I bleed for you
Forever I will lie awake
I would Die For You
I see the truth
I've given you my heart to break

I would Die For You
With every breath I feel you there
Forbidden love is falling

Your eyes sing despair
I bleed for you
Forever I will lie awake
I see the truth
I've given you my heart to break
I would Die For You
I bleed for you
Forever I will lie awake
I would Die For You
I see the truth
I've given you my heart to break
I would Die For You
