Hey, can you hear me? Can you see?
There's a storm on the edge of the sky
Does it matter, well, it does to me
And I can tell you why

You know when there's thunder there should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool

It's always a mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery, just like you and me
Always a mystery

We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no one sees
There is only the dark

Just imagine, will you try
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine

It's always a mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery, just like you and me
Always a mystery

It's always a mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery, just like you and me
It's always a mystery, not what you want to see
It's always a mystery, just like you and me

Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Just like you and me
