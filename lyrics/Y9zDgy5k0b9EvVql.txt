Felt love last night for the first time in a long time
Feels like coming home to stay
Like falling in the sea when it's too hot in the sun
Made things so much worse today

I know you said you'll miss me
But I know that you won't
Cos time is like a wave that washes all the pain away
When you come down

I know I said I'll see you
When it gets to New Year
But now that all the rain's stopped falling
All I think is getting out of here

Felt love last night for the first time in a long time
Feels like I never went away
Like drifting back to sleep when I'm aching and I'm tired
Made me feel so much worse today

I know you said you'll miss me
But I know that you won't
Cos time is like a wave that washes all the pain away
When you come down

I know I said I'll see you
When it gets to New Year
But now that all the rain's stopped falling
All I think is getting out of here

I know I've been welcome but tell me how far
Ceremonial notes sound the gaps in my heart beat now
Never been good enough for you or for me
I've buried my pride, I've buried my key

I know I've been welcome but tell me how far
Ceremonial notes sound the gaps in my heart beat now
Never been good enough for you or for me
I've buried my pride, I've buried my key

I know you said you'll miss me
But I know that you won't
Cos time is like a wave that washes all the pain away
When you come down

I know I said I'll see you
When it gets to New Year
But now that all the rain's stopped falling
All I think is getting out of here
