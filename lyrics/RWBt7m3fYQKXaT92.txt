Oh, oh

Last year's old news
I'm breaking out my six-string
And playing from my heart
It's not deja vu
'Cause it's another summer
That's how this chapter starts

I'm gonna run so fast 'til I can't breathe
Come along and follow me
Let's make some noise we never did before

It's a brand new day
Don't you see me
Changing up my way
So completely
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day

And I'm feelin' good
And I'm feelin' good

So drama free
I'm all about the music
I just wanna sing
Watch me live out my dreams
I'm gonna rock that stage and give my everything

I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move
Come along, get in the groove
Let's shine so bright, more than we did before

It's a brand new day
Don't you see me
Changing up my way
So completely
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day

And I'm feelin' good

(What you gonna do? What you gonna do?)
I'm gonna laugh through the summer with you
(Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be?)
You'll just have to watch me carefully
(Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?)
Anywhere my heart wants me to go

I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna play
I'm gonna try my games in everything

'Cause It's a brand new day
Don't you see me
Changing up my way
So completely
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
Changing up my way
Changing up my way
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day

And I'm feelin' good
Feelin' good
And I'm feelin' good
