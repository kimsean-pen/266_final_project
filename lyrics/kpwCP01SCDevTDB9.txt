A friend, you have my late names
I wanna call you I speak on each day
A friend, I can't say till when
The bond digs a start and I'll ponder the end

A friend, can give in, can slide
Will wander and wander make distance in love
A friend, reminds me to sweat
For stepping on apexes rightly they did

And then you call me friend
And we meet again
And our hearts expand to think about life, without you and me
Our little chapter
Our little chapter

A friend, can't start again
Our teeth holding onto our ears and our limbs
A friend, gets misunderstood
Is high with the kindest and breaks with the rules

A friend, climbed on a wire
To relight my torch when I had lost the fire
A friend, gets lost in a night
When hearts a poking and love picks a fight

And then you call me friend
And we meet again
And I expand to think about life without you and me
Our little chapter
Our little chapter

And then you call me friend
And we meet again
And our hearts expand to think about life without you and me
Our little chapter
Our little chapter
Our little chapter
Our little chapter

And the mind keeps sipping from the things we let it
Our mind keeps sipping from the things we let it
Our mind keeps sipping from the things we let it
Our mind keeps sipping from the things we let it
