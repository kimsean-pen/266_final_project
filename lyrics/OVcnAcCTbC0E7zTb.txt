Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

You sittin' over there
Starin' into space
While people are dancin'
Dancin' all over the place

You shouldn't worry
About the things you can't control
Come on girl while the night is young
Why don't you make yourself race go

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me

Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time you and me
Sittin' there witcha mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you could be

Why don't you live
Live the life you got
Come on girl, hit it
While the feelin' is gettin' hot and hot

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me

Baby girl, I've been watchin' you
I can wipe away that frown
Oh, you and I can get together
We can tear the house down
We can tear the house down
We can tear the whole house down

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
You better enjoy yourself
You got to enjoy yourself, say it again

Get down, get down
Get on down
Get down, get down
Get on down

Get down, get down
Just get on down
Get down, get down
Just get on down

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, you can do it
Hey, hey
Get on down

Get down, get down
Get down now
Get down, get down
Just get on down

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Just, just, just get on down

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
