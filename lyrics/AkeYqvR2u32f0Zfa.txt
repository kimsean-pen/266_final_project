Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long until I am gone

Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I am gone

Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to asagods
As long as the raven flies

Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to asagods
As long as the raven flies
[Incomprehensible] raven flies, flies
