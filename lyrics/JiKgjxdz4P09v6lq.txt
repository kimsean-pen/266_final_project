Oh no, oh no well
There's no light at the end of the tunnel
Oh no, don't you know?
There ain't no gold at the end of the rainbow
Oh no, oh no well
There's no light at the end of the tunnel
There ain't no gold
If you want to be creepy
That you better be clumsy
If you want to be misty
That you better start hassling
Oh no,
I know how you feel
You want at all, but it ain't be easy
Well than, see what
Straight to the top
But you might get quizy
Glitters you see
That might not be gold but sure it's shining
Come on
See . logo
Straight to the top
If you want to be creepy
That you better be clumsy
If you want to be misty
That you better start hassling
Honey,
So sweet, so sweet
Honey,
So sweet, so sweet
If you want to be creepy
That you better be clumsy
If you want to be misty
That you better start hassling
