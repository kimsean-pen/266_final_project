On the ground with my world
Upside down, I got a vision of your face
And I must get me out
For so many memories we've yet to make
God, don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again
Forever love, say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so, I can hold you in my soul
If I go I'll know
When you smile with those eyes
Baby it's like you place a finger on my heart
And your lips next to mine
Make me think that maybe heaven's where you are
God, don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again
Forever love, say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so, I can hold you in my soul
And if I go I'll know
La la la la la
La la
La la la la la
Forever love, say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so, I can hold you in my soul
And If I go I'll know
Forever love, say it love
Digame, Digame
Tell me so, I can hold you in my soul
And if I go I'll know
