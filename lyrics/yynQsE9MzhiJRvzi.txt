Hahaha
Yeah, you are now listening to
The Wonder Girls

He is mine
I'm the only thing on his mind
He thinks about me all the time
He got my love on rewind

Nobody treats him like I do
There's no party if im not in the booth
My song keeps his heart in tune like
Bada dadada dadumdum
He loves me, and I love him too
He plays me all the night through
He keeps me spinning and grinning, I'm winning him over from you singing
Lalalalalala

Everyday (Lalalalalala)
He sings with me (Lalalalalala)
He knows me, he holds me, from intro to fade

(1, 2, 3, 4)
Cuz the DJ is mine, and girl you're wasting your time
He only drops to my music, he loves the way I do it all night
The DJ is mine

(My baby, my, my baby, baby) The DJ is mine
(My baby, my, my baby, baby)
He only drops to my music, he loves the way I do it all night
The DJ is mine

Girl please, don't you even try
My baby, keeps me by his side
Even though you keep giving him the eyes
He don't even notice

Everyday (Lalalalalala)
He sings with me (Lalalalalala)
He knows me, he holds me, from intro to fade

(1, 2, 3, 4)
Cuz the DJ is mine, and girl you're wasting your time
He only drops to my music, he love the way I do it all night
(1, 2, 3, 4)

Its me he falling in love with, yeah, I got his head gone (head gone)
He cant even answer the phone my music keeps turning him on
Ah on and on and, Ah, Ah on and on and on

He say, she say, I say I own the DJ
Stay at on top of the charts, I am the air play
Flyer then airplanes

In case you didn't, let, let me reiterate
Let me re-, let me re-, let me reiterate
