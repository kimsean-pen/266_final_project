You could raise the dead with those terribly troublesome eyes
Maybe you'll always be bad
Maybe you'll always be the same

Are you alone, locked inside that prison in your head?
You walk through the crowd
Lost to the sound
Invisible to every passing eye

This waking life is not what it seems to be
No time to talk
No air the breathe
Reminisce the scent of a single flower
What butchers cleave
The wolves devour
But if you consume it you will surely die
When you're buried with your tenderness
You'll take it to your solitary grave

Are you alone, locked inside that prison in your head?
You walk through the crowd
Lost in the sound
Invisible to every passing eye
Invisible to every passing eye
