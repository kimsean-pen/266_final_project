You let me in
'Cause after all
It seemed like the right thing to do

I closed my eyes
And let you fall
I wonder what you could possibly know
About breaking down that I don't

It's been awhile
Since I begged for
Anything but now I want more

So lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to
Anyway

I hear you say
It's not the same
I'm sorry
It's something I just can't explain

So shut your mouth
And hold me close
We both know
It's better than being alone

I don't mind
Killing time
As long as I can't see it in your eyes

If wanting you's so wrong then I'm wrong
I'll admit it
Time after time you'll realize
You don't mean it
