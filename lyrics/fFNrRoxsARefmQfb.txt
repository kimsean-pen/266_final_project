When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl

And I could be proud that I'm his girl
Cause I know that I'm good all by myself
See I don't need hiss love, I really want him, right?
And he can feel good that he's my guy
Cause he knows he don't mean he's just mine
I don't wanna own him or control him
I just want want our souls to be aligned

So When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick he picked me up
For a walk around, he's gonna put back down again

I'm the one he loves and trust
He goes out on the town and I don't get jealous
It's all about affection of possession with us
And I do exactly what I want, when I'm with him, and when I'm not
He's not domineering, just endearing, what we got
So if you love someone let them be free
i know I don't want no one, suffocating me
Don't settle for ownership, make it deep
If you love someone, you should feel good to let them breathe

So when you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl
When you see me walking around with me
I'm not just another chick, I'm his girl
