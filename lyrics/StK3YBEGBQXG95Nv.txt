Wanting to understand
To understand a hand that's not my hand
In a moment to be defined
All clear lines of all that, that could mean
And I'm wanting eyes
That wont justify or despise all they see
And a silence inside
To help me decide and hide in me
But oh,
I get so tired of waiting
I get so tired of waiting
I get so tired of waiting
When these skies won't fall
Wanting a chance
Just a chance that cannot be missed
Because in seconds that pass
Never there, it's just another kiss
And I'm wanting a heart
And hearts that won't just beat on their own
Because every beat without purpose or thought
You know.
Makes me feel more alone

And I'm so tired of wating
I get so tired of waiting
Waiting
When the skies won't fall
