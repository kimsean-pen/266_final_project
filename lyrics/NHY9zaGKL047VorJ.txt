I got some demons on me, they been feedin' on me
When I sold prescriptions, and my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives, momma called the Reverend
I know she prayin' for me, but I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo, kickin' doors my MO...
I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale, I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies, I know they waitin' on me
Sellin' dope from out ya house, I know you prayin' for me
I know you used to trust me, I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her, damn, I miss you momma

Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me
