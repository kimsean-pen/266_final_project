And even if the winding turns your roads
Even if your heart leaves you alone
Even if the breaking hits your bones
And even if the rain comes pouring down
Even if your scream loses its sound
Even if your wings don't leave the ground

And I'll be here, all for you
And I'll be here, all for you

And I'll never break your heart
On my love
Follow you through the dark
On my love
Even if I do, I don't
Even if I could, I won't
Let you lose who you are
Won't let you fall apart
On my love

And even if the years turn old and grey
Even if your legs don't work the same
And even if your mind forgets my name
And even if the worst takes us through hell
Even if you lose what you once held
Even if you wait but there's no help

And I'll be here, all for you
And I'll be here, all for you

And I'll never break your heart
On my love
Follow you through the dark
On my love
Even if I do, I don't
Even if I could, I won't
Let you lose who you are
Won't let you fall apart
On my love

You will always be my home
I can never let you go
You will always be my home
I can never let you go

I'll never break your heart
On my love
Follow you through the dark
On my love

And I'll never break your heart
On my love
Follow you through the dark
On my love
Even if I do, I don't
Even if I could, I won't
Let you lose who you are
Won't let you fall apart
On my love

On my love (On my love)
On my love (On my love)
On my love (On my love)
On my love (On my love)
