The way you're lookin' at me is like we both understand
I didn't see you lookin' at the other man
Caught in a moment
Feel it in the air tonight

Keep it coming, don't stop
(C'mon, c'mon)
Let me see that body rock
(C'mon, c'mon)
Love it when that bass drops
(C'mon, c'mon)
(C'mon, c'mon)

I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?

Take what you whisper to me
Like I got gold in my hands
The way you're wearing my sheets
You know I got it bad
Caught in a moment
Feel it in the air tonight

Keep it coming, don't stop
(C'mon, c'mon)
Let me see that body rock
(C'mon, c'mon)
Love it when that bass drops
(C'mon, c'mon)
(C'mon, c'mon)

I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?

(I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe
I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe)
I feel your vibe, feel your vibe
(I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe)

The way you're lookin' at me is like we both understand
I didn't see you lookin' at the other man

I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe
Can you show me what it's like?
I can feel your vibe when we cross that line
Can you show me what it's like?

Ooh
(I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe
I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe)
I feel your vibe, feel your vibe, feel your vibe
(I can feel your vibe
Feel your vibe
Feel your, feel your vibe)
