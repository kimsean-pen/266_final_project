Could it be a new day?
fear in me so deep
you push me out, i feel far
the absence, close to me
the other side i crawl
you push me out, i fall
Heal my wounds with everything
away you complicate me
sick of cycles, drop to zero
a while just like last times
my least favorite re-run
sick of cycles, i bounce in gray
Escape familiar home
memories remains alone
reality trapped inside
the wicked descend
Testing higher mentality
i conquer myself through this
a furious path to walk
new space exists beyond
in silence i dwell displeased
remain with the seed of unfulfilment
Heal my wounds with everything
away you complicate me
sick of cycles, drop to zero
a while just like last times
my least favorite re-run
sick of cycles, i bounce in gray
Escape familiar home
memories remains alone
reality trapped inside
the wicked descend - i hide
Heal my wounds with everything
away you complicate me
sick of cycles, drop to zero
a while just like last times
my least favorite re-run
sick of cycles, i bounce in gray
Escape familiar home
memories remains alone
reality trapped inside
the wicked descend - i hide
Escape familiar home
memories remains alone
reality trapped inside
the wicked descend - i hide
