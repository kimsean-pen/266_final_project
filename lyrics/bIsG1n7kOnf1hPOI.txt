Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes
The sun is shining so I head for the park
With a bottle of Tequila and a new pack of cigarettes

I got a cousin and she got a friend
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
At his apartment I knocked on the door
He wouldn't come out until he got paid
Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out, you know that they'll never let me through

'Cos, it's no fun being an illegal alien
No, it's no fun being an illegal alien

Down at the office had to fill out the forms
A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose
Up to the counter to see what they think
They said "it doesn't count man, it ain't written in ink"
I don't trust anybody, least not around here

'Cos it's no fun being an illegal alien
I tell ya, it's no fun being an illegal alien
No no no no no, it's no fun being an illegal alien
I mean it when I tell ya that it's no fun being an illegal alien
An illegal alien, ok

Consideration for your fellow man
Would not hurt anybody
It sure fits in with my plan
Over the border, there lies the promised land
Where everything comes easy
You just hold out your hand

Keep your suspicions, I've seen that look before
But I ain't done nothing wrong now, is that such a suprise
But I've got a sister who'd be willing to oblige
She will do anything now to help me get to the outside

So don't tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out, you know that they'll never let me through

Because it's no fun being an illegal alien
I tell ya, it's no fun being an illegal alien
And it's getting me down
It's no fun being an illegal alien
No no no no no, it's no fun being an illegal alien
Yeah yeah yeah, it's not much fun being an illegal alien
I tell ya that it's no fun being an illegal alien
I tell ya it's no fun being an illegal alien
No no no, it's not much fun being an illegal alien
No no no, it's not bloody much fun being an illegal alien
It's no fun being an illegal alien, and that's what I am
