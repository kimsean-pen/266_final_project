It wasn't enough
It wasn't enough
It wasn't enough

I would try to believe
In the things I can not see
But my faith is shaken now
Like it's never been before
When I call and you don't come
I don't know what I should do
Should I call?
Should I even count on you?

I've given all I can
It wasn't enough
To keep you in my hands
Should I give up?
I try to understand
Was it ever enough?
I don't understand

So here I am once again
With my back against the wall
Afraid to show you, afraid to tell you
That I don't know you like I did
I've never been so alone
I've never felt so insecure
And now I don't know where I'm going
In my life I'm not so sure

I've given all I can
It wasn't enough
To keep you in my hands
Should I give up?
I try to understand
Was it ever enough?
I don't understand

Giving up tonight
I won't let go, won't let go of you
Giving up tonight
I wanna show you, wanna show you
Giving up tonight
I won't let go, won't let go of you
Giving up tonight
Am I giving up, giving up?
I don't wanna give this up, I won't

I've given all I can
It wasn't enough
To keep you in my hands
Should I give up?
I try to understand
Was it ever enough?
I don't understand

Everything you want from me
I've fought so hard for everything
Everything you want from me
I've tried so hard, can never be
Anything you want from me
Anything you want from me
Anything you want from me, I've given up
