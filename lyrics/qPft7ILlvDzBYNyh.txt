Why should I be ashamed
To talk about the God that I know is real
Or about how sick I think it is when babies are killed
Or the fact: evolution is just stupid and wrong
I didn't come from a monkey but you believe what you want
I believe that Jesus died and He is risen again
I believe that He will burn this world down in the end
I don't care what you think about me or what I say
I mean every word, why should I be ashamed

When everything is falling around me
In spite of all the pain that surrounds
I stand here with my fist raised high
When everything falls, when everything falls

The music doesn't end
We fight for love
We fight for those who come out
We don't fight for the money
Or the girls or the crowd
It's the fans and the lights, the guitars and the mics
Don't need any pennies
But we'll be there tonight
But when the music fades and is stripped away
We stand alone at the end of the stage
I hope you remember every word that I say
That Jesus alone is the only way

When everything is falling around me
In spite of all the pain that surrounds
I stand here with my fist raised high
When everything falls, when everything falls

Step up and get knocked down
Were going crazy with the rock sound
We As Human's here now
Bringing psycho back

Step up and get knocked down
Were going crazy with the rock sound
We As Human's here now
Bringing psycho back

When everything is falling around me
In spite of all the pain that surrounds
I stand here with my fist raised high
When everything falls, when everything falls

Step up and get knocked down
We're bringing psycho back
Step up and get knocked down
