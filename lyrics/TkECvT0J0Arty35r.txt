Catman's coming, better look out
Catman's coming, running about
Catman's coming, looking for a girl
Better hide your sister, man

C is for the crazy hairdo that he wears around
A is for the arms that he'll sneak around your waist
T is for the taste on the lips belong to you, yeah man

M is for the mean things that this mean man does
A is for all the hearts that he has ever broke
N is for the names on the list you may be on

Catman

Catman's looking for a woman all day long
Better watch out
Better watch out
You better watch out because you're gonna get kissed
You better watch out because he is in your midst

Catman

You better watch out because of Mr. catman
