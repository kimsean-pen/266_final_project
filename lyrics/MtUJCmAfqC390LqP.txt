It's not enough is it? It's not enough
What do you want, what do you want?
You want my blood? Do you want my sweat?
What the fuck you want? What the fuck y'all niggas want?

Lace front, time to show 'em bitches always talkin' shit
'Bout they pissed, bitch, go fix your wig
I ain't comin' in the game to play no victim
I tell bitches suck dick before I play the victim
Who me? Yes you, who you think I'm talking to?
Don't think 'cause I'm like that, I won't get dark
Bitch bark, but I bite, let's see who rides tonight
I let her eat the pussy then I fuck her up on site
If you really want problems I'll be Dennis The Menace
Serena Williams hittin' 'em with the racket 'til I bend it
You want sex? I sell it
You want beef? Then leg it
How you gon' run up your gums and not come see the dentist?

You lil' bitch, always talking 'bout a couple comments
You lil' bitch, always fucking with my fucking money
Lil' bitch, I'ma show you how to pay me homage
Lil' bitch, Don Dodda comin' and they runnin' like a bitch

You know I'm the shit, you know I write them hits
You know I always keep a rummy on me, I'm lit
You ain't with the shits, boy you talking shit
Until I hit the goons and tell em hit em with the stick
Bitch I'm with the clique, pull up and they tip
Bitches say their pussy lit but I heard it stink
Bars trappin' with the clique, they be on that heroin
One minute they love you but they don't wanna see you win

You lil' bitch, always talking 'bout a couple comments
You lil' bitch, always fucking with my fucking money
Lil' bitch, I'ma show you how to pay me homage
Lil' bitch, Don Dodda comin' and they runnin' like a bitch
