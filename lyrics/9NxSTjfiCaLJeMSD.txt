Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo... hoo... witchy woman
See how high she flies...
Woo... hoo... witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye...

She held me spellbound in the night
(woo... hoo...)
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
(woo... hoo...)
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo... hoo... witchy woman
See how high she flies...
Woo... hoo... witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye...
(aaah aaah aaah) Aaah
(aaah aaah)
Aaah (aaah aaah aaah)
(aaah aaah aaah) Aaah
(aaah aaah)
Aaah... (aaah aaah aaah)
Well I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother she's been sleeping in the Devil's bed
There's some rumors going round someone's underground
She can rock you in the night time 'til your skin turns red

Woo... hoo... witchy woman
See how high she flies...
Woo... hoo... witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye...
