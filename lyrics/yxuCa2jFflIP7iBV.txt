When you're still beside me
I can see much further
And I own imagine, I can wait much longer
Would you be, be my third eye
Please be my third eye
I wanna see 3rd eye
Please don't let me blind
I wanna share my tonight

I can feel your heartbeat
When my mind is clear
I can see your visions
There's no time to fear

Would you please be my third eye
Third eye
Please be my third eye (x2)

Would you be, be my third eye
Please be my third eye
I wanna see 3rd eye
Please don't let me blind
I wanna share my tonight
