I was walkin' in the park
Dreamin' of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns
Then I heard the children singin'
They were runnin' through the rainbows
They were singin' a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you, you

Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green
When I am king, dilly dilly
You will be queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love

Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love

Lavender dreams dilly, dilly, lavenders true
When you miss me dilly dilly, I did miss you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love
For your love, for your love, for your love
