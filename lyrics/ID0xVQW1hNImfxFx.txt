Who the man at the laundry mat
With the money pack for the hard flex
That's nonsense
Murderous venomous Benjamins
Balance my conscious
Chakras stay polished
All while I'm up late
Cause silence gold
As my lunch date
Boy kick back on a monday
Bet I beat up then heat it up
Then feed it dust then poof gone
Seen enough to see ya bluff
I leave it up to who God
Me man preach CSPAN
Leave 3 grams
For the loudest fan
Need He-Man to meet Christ
Mix it up
That's a hard fight

I shine don't close your eyes
24 leave you sore wanting more at the core
Bitch I'm out here changing lives
I woke the soul of a bad hoe to start a cult to tote my casual
Nonchalant kickback flow of mind your own bag or get bashful

Ride around got a brand new whip
Tag along bring the friends you wit
Hit a lick gon' head whip bricks
Get a lighter flick
Watch old movie flick
Suck the tit
That's the whole tiddy
Got demons riding in coupe wit me
Shotgun boof ride wit me
Catch the sidecar if you fuck wit me

Riding around lowkey so sauced
Riding around '06 cobalt
Suck on my cock leave ya bitch pissed off
Matter fact came on boutta catch lift off
Head so big call a nigga Neutron
Left that bih folded like a futon
Team so big act like a nuisance
No cream still clean hoe what are you on
