Moving in and out of the shadow
It's no easy mission
Holding on to how I picture you

Showing only bits and pieces
Till the light betrayed you and your empty allocution

Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility
Searching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of it
Searching your eyes for humility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace
I'm still searching, searching

Showing all the bits and pieces
Till the tide betrayed you and your empty allocution
Float the Piper by and down the river
Carcass crippled underneath the pounding waves of adoration

Pied Piper, float on down the river
Bloated carcass crippled me, the weight of adoration
I'm moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you
