I was living on the Westside
When you brought me South
At first you didn't like the look of me
Your borders were closed
Although you said I'm bad company
We stayed in touch
You made it hard work for me
Working for your love

But now
Well, we can settle down
We'll start a family
'Cos you're my best friend
And you're so good to me
Well, we can settle down
We'll start a family
'Cos you're my best friend
And this is love song number 23

You were living in the city
You had the world at your feet
Yeah, you had a part-time job
Pleased to be living free
You made it hard work for me
I had to work for your love

And now
Well, we can settle down
And start a family
'Cos you're my best friend
And you're so good to me
Well, we can settle down
Start a family
'Cos you're my best friend
And this is love song number 23

Westside

Yeah, we can settle down
We'll start a family
'Cos you're my best friend
And you're so good to me (so good, so good, so good)
And you're so good to me (so good, so good, so good)
'Cos you're my best friend (so good, so good, so good)
Start a family (so good, so good, so good)
'Cos you're so good to me (so good, so good, so good)
And this is love song number 23
