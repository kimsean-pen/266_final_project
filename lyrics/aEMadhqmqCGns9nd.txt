Wait a minute before you tell me anything,
how was your day?
Cause I've been missing

You by my side, yeah

Did I awake you out of your dreams?
I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep
You calm me down
There's something 'bout the sound of your voice

I-I-I-I'm never never

Never as far away as it may seem, oh

Soon we'll be together

We'll pick up right where we left off

Paris, London, Tokyo
There's just one thing that I gotta do

Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone
Hello, tuck you in every night)

And I can hardly take another goodbye
Baby, won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on

Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone, woah

Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you)

Yes, I may meet a million pretty girls that know my name
But don't you worry
Cause you have my heart

It ain't easy to keep on moving city to city
Just get up and go

The show must go on so I need you to be strong

I-I-I-I'm never never

Never as far away as it may seem

No never

Soon we'll be together

We'll pick up right where we left off

Paris, London, Tokyo
There's just one thing that I gotta do

Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone
Hello, tuck you in every night)

And I can hardly take another goodbye
Baby, won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on

Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone, woah

Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide

Oh
Wherever the wind blows me
Yes you're still the one and only girl on my mind

No, there ain't no one better

(Worldwide)

So always remember

Always remember, girl you're mine

Paris, London, Tokyo
