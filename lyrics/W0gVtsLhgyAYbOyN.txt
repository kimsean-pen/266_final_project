Here comes the time where you fill your life [?]
Absolutely anything that I ask from you
Pop the car and spend the dollar and wear those boots
You better love [?] and I want from you

You coulda been happy
You coulda been healthy
You coulda been free
You coulda been skinny
You coulda had money
You coulda been funny
It's not what you are
Join the club

You say things like 'We don't care, we want everyone'
I saw a crowd of people gather in a club
Spend the time to become one of us
If you could spend you life away [?]

You coulda been happy
You coulda been healthy
You coulda been free
You coulda been skinny
You coulda had money
You coulda been funny
It's not what you are
Join the club

You coulda been happy

Join the club

It's just too hard
Join the club

Join the club

It's just too hard
