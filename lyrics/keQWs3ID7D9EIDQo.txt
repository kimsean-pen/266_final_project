I close my eyes and count to ten
The seconds turn to years and slowly
I've been recognizing everything
Through an adolescent mind
It's so dark here
It's so dark here
And for the first time I feel alive
But you're not here

Life, it changes
Wake me up and bring me home
Let me stay here forever

I can't see a thing
I'm lying in my bed, I can't stop thinking
It's driving me insane
Never got to say goodbye
It's still dark here
It's still dark here
And for the first time I feel alive
But you're not here

Life, it changes
Wake me up and bring me home
Let me stay here forever

I'll live on and carry your name
And be what you always thought I could be
I hope we meet at the end
But I'll never forgive the world for taking my best friend

I can't see a thing
I can't feel a thing
