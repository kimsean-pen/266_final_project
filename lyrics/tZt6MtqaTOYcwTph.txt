Another night of rioting in England as police clash with youths in several cities.
You went to the stores that you had applied for a job at?
Yeah, I went across, like, I went to Clapham, yeah, to go where I handed out a CV,
I was like, yeah, you didn't want to reply back to my e-mail? Well I was like, yeah,
this is payback isn't it! Payback, man!
And what about you? Any bad feelings at all? Have you ever thought about it at night
when you've been sleeping in your bed?
No, 'cause I'm watching my plasma that I just got. Seems like Christmas came early
(came early). Payback in't it.
Heavy is the hand pressing down again again,

Something free something in chains we all came to play the game,
Will tomorrow come for the man stuck in the line,
There's a rumour circling, London's burning from within.
EHYY, London's burning,

And it doesn't matter at all, we try,
EHYY, London's burning,
Everything is nothing there's no future in sight,
EHYY (Ooohum), London's burning,
No it doesn't matter at how hard we try,
EHYY (Ooohum), London's burning,
Everything is nothing, everything is nothing.
My analogy isn't nothing on the streets,

No one cared and no one looked,
'Til she threw the judge's book,
Now who's the one to blame when the children always seem,
Dancing on their broken dreams, while London's burning from within
EHYY, London's burning,

And it doesn't matter at all, we try,
EHYY, London's burning,
Everything is nothing there's no future in sight,
EHYY (Ooohum), London's burning,
No it doesn't matter at how hard we try,
EHYY, London's burning,
Everything is nothing, everything is nothing.
Good morning, I've come straight from a meeting of the government's COBRA committee.

This is criminality, pure and simple and it has to be defeated.
Streets are burning up from end to end.

Err, yeah, this is payback in't it. Payback man.

Climb each other, fall again
This is criminality, pure and simple and it has to be defeated.

Streets are burning up from end to end.

Err, yeah, this is payback in't it. Payback man.
End to end.
EHYY, London's burning,
And it doesn't matter at all, we try,
EHYY, London's burning,
Everything is nothing there's no future in sight,
EHYY (Ooohum), London's burning,
No it doesn't matter at how hard we try,
EHYY (Ooohum), London's burning,
Everything is nothing, everything is nothing.
Everything is nothing, everything is nothing.
