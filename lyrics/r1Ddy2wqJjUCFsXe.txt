I was told I'll be so old
Before I found someone to be hold
And if I found one, she gonna stray
You'll never find a way to hold the weight

Take me to a place
Where we both don't have to face
The things we faked
There'll be nothing on my mind
Nothing on my mind

I was told I'm not in control
But I'll sit and wait for it to unfold
'Cause when you're looking you'll never find
All that you're looking for will find you blind

Take me to a place
Where we both don't have to face
The things we faked
There'll be nothing on my mind
Nothing on my mind
