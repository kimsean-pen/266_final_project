Put me up on a pedestal
I've got nowhere to go but down
You expect the impossible
And it's too much to carry around

Well you tell me I'm beautiful
It feels empty and I don't know why
But it seems that you're searching me
For something you're not gonna find

I'm not your anchor
So don't hold on
I'm not the answer
You've got me wrong
I'm not your savior
Save your energy
To find out who you are
Who you are without me

Wide awake lying next to you
Being careful to get the words right
See it hurts me to tell you this
But it kills me to keep it inside

And I'm in love with the present tense
Making plans is overrated to me
And I don't speak in guarantees
Or at least not the kind that you need

I'm not your anchor
So don't hold on
I'm not the answer
You've got me wrong
I'm not your savior
Save your energy
To find out who you are
Who you are without me

Well I still believe in
Happy endings
But this just isn't
Where I wanna spend mine
I'll be leaving
Now I've said it

I'm not your anchor
So don't hold on
I'm not the answer
You've got me wrong
I'm not your savior
Save your energy
To find out who you are
Who you are without me

I'm not a mirror
Look inside yourself
I'm not a hero
You know too well
I'm not your savior
Save your energy
To find out who you are
Who you are without me
