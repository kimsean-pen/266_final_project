Well I'm headed south but kinda west
Up around the bend and I have one more breath
Uh, standing tall in the rows of corn
That's Cora Pearl at ten in the 'morn

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga in the Languedoc
(Um chagga lagga in the Languedoc)

Black coal night in Wallonia sticks
Saw your red light burn for like twenty clicks, uh, uh
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga in Wallonia sticks
(Um chagga lagga in Wallonia sticks)

But I'll keep on driving
Don't get mixed up in shit
You could get used to it

Yeah, I lost my way in the Tramontane
'Cause that crazy stuff got in my brain
So I walked the marsh at Bouche De Rhone
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
And all night long I heard you moan
(Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Um chagga lagga at Bouche De Rhone
(Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
But I'll just keep on walking
It's starting to hit me
They're coming to get me

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga in Bouche De Rhone
(Um chagga lagga at Bouche De Rhone)
Um chagga lagga at the gravy station
(Um chagga lagga at the gravy station)
Um chagga lagga in San Antone
(Um chagga lagga in San Antone)

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
(Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
