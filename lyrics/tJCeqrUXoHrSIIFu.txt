Too Much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure

Too much pressure, this pressure got to stop
Too much pressure, it's getting to my head
Too much pressure, they're giving me hard times
Too much pressure, my man made me sad
Too much pressure, him try to make me look small
Too much pressure, end up with no money
Too much pressure, my car fail its MOT
Too much pressure, I said my car fail its MOT

Too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure
Too Much pressure, Him fumble up a woman
Too much pressure, my life's so hard
Too much pressure, and all them certain kind of people
Too much pressure, them having it easy
Too much pressure, them having it easy
Too much pressure, them sail through life
Too much pressure, them have no joy
Too much pressure, them have no joy
It's too much pressure, it's too much pressure

This pressure got to stop
This pressure got to stop
This pressure got to stop
It's got to stop, it's got to stop...

Too much pressure, oh lord oh lord
Too much pressure, oh what me a go do
Too much pressure, it's too much pressure
Too much pressure, it's too much pressure
Too much pressure, oh lord oh lord
Too much pressure, somebody help me
Too much pressure, it's too much pressure
Too much pressure, it's too much pressure
This pressure got to stop...
