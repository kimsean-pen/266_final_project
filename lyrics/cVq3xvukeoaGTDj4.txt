To all my friends who are just like me
Another cog in the big machine
Another victim of the industry
It just don't mean nothing to me
To all the lost who have had enough
To everybody that has given up
Life is tough, are you tough enough?
It just don't mean nothing to me

Got a belly full of that pesticide
Yeah, ain't it cool? We were born to die
Hallelujah! Chica chica ride
Gonna fool ya with them white lines

To all my friends who've had enough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
To all my friends who've had it rough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
We'll pick you up

To all my friends who are just like me
Another face, another nobody
Lies are cheap but the truth ain't free
It just don't mean nothing to me
To all the ones who aren't good enough
To everybody that don't measure up
Life is rough, are you rough enough?
It just don't mean nothing to me

Got a belly full of that pesticide
Yeah, ain't it cool? We were born to die
Hallelujah! Chica chica ride
Gonna fool ya with them white lines

To all my friends who've had enough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
To all my friends who've had it rough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
We'll pick you up

Smoke em if ya got em
'Cause we're not to be forgotten
A broke future don't mean our hearts gotta turn rotten
Our backs tied to a land slide got us crawling
Callin' out to the lost and the fallen

To all my friends who've had enough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up

To all my friends who've had enough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
To all my friends who've had it rough
If you should fall, we'll pick you up
We'll pick you up
We'll pick you up
