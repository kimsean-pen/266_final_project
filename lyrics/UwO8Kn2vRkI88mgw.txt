what i don't know i don't like
what i don't like i don't want
what i don't want i waste

i hypnotize with alibis and fingers made of lead
i sympathize with frozen eyes turned inwards in my head
i realize to my demise it's better left unsaid
that columns crash down endlessly and i will end up dead

i theorize i'm on the rise
but all i do is fall
i victimize my love of life
i've seen and done it all

ready steady stop
hurry up and wait
the tick-tick-ticking of the clock
delineates your fate

what i don't see i don't know
what i don't know i don't want
what i don't want i don't need
what i don't need i don't feel
what i don't feel i don't say
what i don't say i don't do
what i don't do i don't like
what i don't like i waste

ready steady go
finish up your plate
before you even realize
it's gonna be too late

i don't know what i see
i don't want what i know
i don't need what i want
i don't feel what i need
i don't say what i feel
i don't do what i say
i don't like what i do
i just like to waste
