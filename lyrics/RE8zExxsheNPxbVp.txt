It was in the lobby when I set my sights on you
I should have kissed you in the elevator
But I was too scared to
It was in the morning when I made up my mind
I want you staplegunned right to my side all of the time

Do I have to spell it out for you
or scream it in your face
Oh the chemistry between us could destroy this place
Do I have to spell it out for you
or whisper in your ear
Oh just stop right there
I think that weve got something here

We were all alone when I finally made a pass at you
It didnt work, and no it never does
but you know how I do
We were on the phone when I made up my mind
I want you staplegunned right to my side all of the time

Do I have to spell it out for you
or scream it in your face
Oh the chemistry between us could destroy this place
Do I have to spell it out for you
or whisper in your ear
Oh just stop right there
I think that weve got something here

Do I have to spell it out for you
or scream it in your face
Oh the chemistry between us could destroy this place
Do I have to spell it out for you
or whisper in your ear
Oh just stop right there
I think that weve got something here
