Frightened by a dream
You're not the only one
Running like the wind
Thoughts can come undone
Dancing behind masks
Just sort of pantomime
But images reveal whatever
Lonely hearts can hide

Lady, lady, lady, lady
Don't walk this lonely avenue
Lady, lady, lady, lady
Let me touch that part of you
You want me to
Lady, lady, lady, lady
I know it's in your heart to stay
Lady, lady, lady, lady
When will I ever

Hear you say I love you

Time like silence stares
With no apology
Move towards the stars
And be my only one
Reach into the light
And feel love's gravity

That pulls you to my side
Where you should always be

Lady, lady, lady, lady
Don't walk this lonely avenue

Oh, lady, lady, lady, lady
Let me touch that part of you
You want me to
Lady, lady, lady, lady
I know it's in your heart to stay
