My journey's over,
I'm standing on the edge,
And close my eyes to this world of lies.

My will is broken,
It's the end of all my dreams.
My soul yearns for the valley of the queens.

My rose has withered,
It will never bloom again.
The soil is dry, time has come to die.

My faith has left me,
They have stolen all my dreams,
Oh lay me down, in the valley of the queens.

My search has ended,
My name is carved in stone
On the temple wall beyond Osiris' hall.

No holy sunrays
Will light my tomb of dreams.
I won't return from the valley of... the queens
