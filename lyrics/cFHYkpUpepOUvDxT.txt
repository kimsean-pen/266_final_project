Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you?
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
You ease my troubles, that's what you do

On the morning sun in all its glory
It greets the day with hope and comfort too
And you fill my life with laughter
You can make it better
You ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine, like the sun
At the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One

And to say, Have I told you lately that I love you?
And have I told you there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
And it shines as the sun
At the end of the day
We will give thanks and pray to the One

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Fill my live with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
