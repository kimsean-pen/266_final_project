I see houses
Rows and rows of red bricks
I see black cars
Some blood-stained exit

I get this feeling that I
I've been here before
How many lives will I waste?
How many tears must I taste
Before my freedom?
Before my freedom?

I see mountains
Blood-red sunsets
I see a billion stars
Love death and in between

I get this feeling that I
I've been here before
How many lives will I waste?
How many tears must I taste
Before my freedom?
Before my freedom?

I won't be late, I won't be late
I won't be late, I won't be late

I get this feeling that I
I've been here before
How many lives will I waste?
How many tears must I taste
Before my freedom?

I get this feeling that I
I've been in here before
How many lives will I waste?
How many tears must I taste
Before my freedom?

It's just this murder
Trouble and strife
Turning me into another guy
It's just murder
Trouble and strife
Turning me into another guy
It's just murder
Trouble and strife
Turning me into another guy

Don't be late, don't be late
Don't be late, don't be late
When I call
When I call
When I call
When I call you up
