Fluid links, filled from auto programmed patterns,
Electromagnetical pulses running motion thoughts through these schematical paths
We think, proceed and progress regardless of understanding such phenomenon

Concur to this stratagem, a theorem is born,
Born from a slight despite, the majority has served foresight
The logical state of the axiom

Whatever's needed, whatever's claimed
We follow the rules of mathematical evolution
Wreathed life's existence
We'll never cease to increase this progression
Enforcing vastness and power of human boundaries

Beyond those portals
As conquerors, we search interconnections through those dimensions.
