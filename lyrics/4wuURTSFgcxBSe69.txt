All your friends are gone x4

It climbs in slowly behind
If you trust your neighbors
they'd never suspect what you're like
Welcome them into your life
No one has to know
Playback, delete and rewind
It's getting closer than you thought
it'd get Just get inside
It's moving faster than you'd ever planned
You'll be relieved when

when you open up
and let yourself seem vulnerable
and the morning sun
will make our bodies comfortable
in taking off your clothes
everything hidden is suddenly exposed

Nobody wants to hear another
story about how you couldn't write right
It climbs in slowly behind
No one has to know
Playback, delete and rewind
Each one is louder than the one before
And the people you care for
At ten times the expense
Of all that you spent
You'll be relieved when

when you open up
you let yourself seem vulnerable
and the morning sun
will make our bodies comfortable
in taking off your clothes
everything hidden is suddenly exposed

you keep it on the inside
cause that's the safest place
cause that's the safest place to hide

All of your friends are gone
And you were barely holding on
we were wrong and
they fooled us once again
We are the loneliest of men
we're the loneliest
and all your friends are gone
nobody hears you
all your friends were wrong
nobody cares
and all your friends are gone
nobody's here with you
and all your friends were wrong
nobody cares
