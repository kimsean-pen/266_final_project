So you've come to say you're very sorry
"It won't happen again - forgive me?"
Time will not heal these wounds
And I'm bleeding because of you

Was everything we had just a joke?
I've run out of patience, tears and hope
Love does not conquer all
And I'm screaming because of you

Too late for apologies

In the shadow of the light from a black sun
Frigid statue standing icy blue and numb
Where are the frost giants I've begged for protection?
I'm freezing

Cold winter winds that chill my heart with sleet & snow
Not from the North come to this glacial abode
But from your dimension cryogenic limbo
I'm freezing
I'm frozen
It's too late
