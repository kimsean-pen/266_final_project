Had my heart beat under neath your stone cold
fingers on me, can't believe i called this love
Tide my dreams up so they couldn't run
Away when you said
That i wasn't good enough

I woke up today i must've been in a coma
But i never gave up and now i say that its over
I can see the future in a panoramic view
Never knew the sky was this shade of blue
Imma take a picture and send it back to you
This is what it looks like
This is what it looks like
Out from under you

Is it messed up if i wanna thank you for holding me down
Some how you made me strong
I won't go back but im gonna use everything that we had
To get where i belong

I woke up today and looked myself in the mirror
Said its to get up no nothings ever been clearer

I can see the future in panoramic view
Never knew the sky was this shade of blue
Imma take a picture and send it back to you
This is what it looks like
This is what it looks like
Out from under youuuuuuu
Under youuuuu
Under youuu
This is what it looks like
This is what it looks like

I can see the future in panoramic view
This is what it looks like

I can see the future in a panoramic view
Never knew the sky was this shade of blue
Imma take a picture and send it back to you
This is what it looks like
This is what it looks like
Out from under youuuuu
Under youuu
Under youuu
This is what it looks like, this is what it looks like
Out from under you
