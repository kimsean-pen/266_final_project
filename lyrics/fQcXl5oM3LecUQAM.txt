Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side
I wanna feel alive, I wanna feel alive all the time

Every one disappears some day
You've worn out your morning clothes
Weak-stitched with plume to holes
Nothing will hold you close
Everyone, have you thought about balance?

The idea of your lake
Standing verse stabbing
I think about it everyday
There's only so much strength that could withhold the weight

Let's all dissolve in a blanket
Fade away like smoke off cigarettes
Wonder what it's like on the other side
I wanna feel alive, if I close my eyes will it reverse the light?
Focus on one thing at a time

Please unwind, please unwind
I want to feel alive, all the time
I want to feel alive, all the time

I must have lost my train of thought
My head derailed before I could even walk
A thought I never knew I thought
A thought I never knew I thought
Broadcast the crawl

Reflective monologue in a situation that doesn't help you
Raw perspective on the story, how one became two
My diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move
I still miss you, I still miss you

You place your hand on the glass, try to get through
A mirror is only a mirror if you look in too
My diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move
I still miss you, I still miss you, I still miss you
