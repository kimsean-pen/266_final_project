There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Sussudio
Oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same

Sususudio
Oh oh

Oh if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere

She's all I need, all my life

I feel so good if I just say the word
Sususudio, just say the word
Oh Sususudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My love has just begun

Sususudio
Oh oh
Ooh give me a chance, give me a sign

I'll show her anytime
Sussudio
Oh oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Sususudio
Just say the word, oh
Sususudio

Ah, she's all I need all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Sususudio
I just say the word, oh
Sussudio
I just say the word, oh
Sususudio
I'll say the word, oh
Sussudio oh oh oh
Just say the word
Just say the word
Just say the word
Sususudio
Just say the word
Sususudio
Say the word, oh
Just say the word
