She hears a moan at the top of the stairs
But she don't move or fret just minds her business
"I swear these walls have been talking to me" she says
"Cause all I hear the devils wishes"
She feels his breath down her skin and bones

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness
Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness again

By her hair he drags her in the the streets
He's free of other's eyes there are no glances
She cries for help with a gun to her cheek
But no one comes nobody listens
Her blood runs red all through the street

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness
Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness
You're lost in darkness again

I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness
Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out again
No one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness
Crying out in vain
No one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness
You're lost in darkness again
