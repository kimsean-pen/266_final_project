Every time I look at you
You always look so beautiful
Driving on the road again the Chevy's packed
And it is dusk
And I will take some photographs
So I can dream of you

Can't say I've felt such twisting
In my heart this way
we pitch a tent & have one sleeping bag
To stay awake
The fire's burning, softly singing songs
So close to you

Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my life

Can't take away those times we stayed up and we talked all night
Chain smoking cigarettes and three bottles of red wine
Falling asleep together holding your body, close to mine

Oh, And in the morning your eyes open so innocent
The sun is blazing we are sweating you look lovely
Nothing else matters anymore 'cause your in my arms again

Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life

Oh, I never want to be without you
So, just stay with me, I will love you endlessly
Oh, darlin' darlin' Oh... darlin', darlin'
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my life

Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
