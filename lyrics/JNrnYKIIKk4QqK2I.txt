Face me
Face me entirely
Tell me
Tell me what's wrong here
Is it the bridge of my hair
Or the back of my skin
Is it the pole of my hips
That you couldn't fold in
Is it the bridge between worlds
That makes you feel alone

Well I wish that I had known
You're alone
Well I wish that I had known

Face me
Face me entirely
Tell me
Tell me what's wrong here
Is it the bridge of my hair
Or the back of my skin
Is it the pole of my hips
That you couldn't fold in
Is it the bridge between worlds
That makes you feel alone

Well I wish that I had known
You're alone
Well I wish that I had known

Is it the bridge of my hair
Or the back of my skin
Is it the pole of my hips
That you couldn't fold in
Is it the bridge between worlds
That makes you feel alone

Well I wish that I had known
You're alone
Well I wish that I had known
