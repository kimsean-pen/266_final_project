Baby does he do it for ya
When he's finished, does he step back and adore ya

I just gotta know cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it

Ooh no nooo
Baby just go with it
Cause when your with me I can't explain it
It's just different
We can take it slow
Or act like your my girl let's skip the physics

He's so replaceable
Your worth the chase, your good enough

It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine China

Favorite
Your my favorite
It's like all the girls around me, don't have faces
And they say it goes, Life if just a game but I'm not playing
Oh woah

He's so replaceable
Your worth the chase, your good enough

It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine China

It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine China

Took me awhile to find your love
Ain't no amount of time in this world
Give me a lot of time and just love me
Daily baby, daily in your soul
Are you ready?
I know your heart been telling you, you been wrong for me
But I'm not, noo
It's alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable, a collectible
Just like fine China
