I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I'll confess, I'll confess
I'm better off with you instead
Alone with you
Losing breath, losing breath
When I'm not at my best
But you know how I get
And what I do

Alone with you
And only you
Alone with you
And only you

Laying in the fading light
Dreaming of being in your company
Wanna say I feel alright
But heaven never felt so far from me
Will you tell me when you get home?
Cause honey I would always choose you alone
Come lay your head down

I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I'll confess, I'll confess
I'm better off with you instead
Alone with you
Losing breath, losing breath
When I'm not at my best
But you know how I get
And what I do

Alone with you
And only you
Alone with you
And only you

Ouu, Ouu Oohuuu
