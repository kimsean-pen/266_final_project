So, turn off the light
'Cause it's night of the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you

Freeze your blood
And then stab it into, into

Stab your blood into me
And blend
I eat my own blood
And get filled up get filled up

I get filled up on me
And end
So, turn off the light
'Cause it's night on the sun

You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you
Turn off the light
'Cause it's night on the sun

You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you

Freeze your blood
And then stab it into, into
Stab your blood into me
And end

I eat my own blood

And get filled up, I get filled up
I get filled up on me

And end

Freeze your blood
And then stab it into me
Freeze your blood
And then stab it into me

Freeze your blood
And then stab it into, into me
And blend
Turn off the light

'Cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you
Well, there's one thing
To know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground
And that's alright, that's alright
Well, there's one thing
To know about this globe
It's bound and it's willing to explode
And that's alright, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
Well, there's one thing
To know about this town
Not a person doesn't
Want me underground
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright
There's one thing
To know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground
And that's okay
That's alright, that's alright
There's one thing
To know about this earth
We're put here just to make more dirt
And that's okay
That's alright, that's alright
Well, there's one thing
To know about this globe
It's bound and it's willing to explode
And that's okay
That's alright, that's alright
There's one thing
To know about this town
It's five hundred miles underground
And that's okay
That's alright, that's alright
