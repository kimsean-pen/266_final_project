I told you
I'm thinking of you
And your twisted heart
Make a new start
Lift up your weary head
There's only now
Share a word or six
The past has gone
Lift up your weary head
Make a new start
What do I tell you?
There's only now?
And your twisted heart?
Make a new start
The day is gone
The past is night
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
