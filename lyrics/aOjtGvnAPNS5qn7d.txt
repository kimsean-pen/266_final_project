I haven't slept for days and more to come
Is this real, I really can't feel none
Oh I miss you, oh I miss you so
Is this where we let go?

Are you coming back to this town any time soon?
No one cares to know me the way you do
And I miss you, oh I miss you oh so much

I wake up feeling worse every day
Work work work, oh when will it end?
This society suffocates me
So please just be honest with me

Do I even want you? (Do I even want you?)
You don't even see it
You don't see anything through
Do I even want you? (Do I even want you?)
No you don't see me, you don't see anything through
I miss you though I miss you oh so much

There is no one like you who cares to see me through
And are you coming back to this town any time soon?
No one cares to see me the way you did
I miss you, oh I miss you oh so much
Oh, I miss you, oh I miss you every day
