You set your sight so high you cannot start
People talk about you and they pull you apart

You need to be there, you need to make it right

The road is winding and the montains are rough
The world is calling and it can be so tough

You need to be there, you need to make it right

With the love that you give
With the love that you give

You need to be there
You need to be there

With the love that you give
With the love that you give

So many problems you don't know where to start
Someone mislead you and they've broken your heart

You need to be there, you need to make it right

With the love that you give
With the love that you give
