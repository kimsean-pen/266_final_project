Black flies on the windowsill
That we are, that we are, that we are to know
Winter stole summer's thrill
& the river's cracked & cold
See, the sky is no man's land
A darkened plume to stay

Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place
No man is an island
Of this I know

But can't you see, or
Or maybe you were the ocean
When I was just a stone

Black flies on the windowsill
That we are, that we are, that we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
& every story must grow old
Still, I'll be a traveller
A gypsy's reins to face

But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place
No man is an island
Of this I know

But can't you see, or
Or maybe you were the ocean
When I was just a stone

No man is an island
Of this I know
But can't you see, or

Or maybe you were the ocean

When I was just a stone

So here we are
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna beg your pardon
& I don't wanna ask you why
But if I was to go my own way
Would I have to pass you by?
I don't wanna beg your pardon
& I don't wanna ask you why
But if I was to go my own way
Would I have to pass you by?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
