I am the sun, you know you need me
And you might get burned if you take too much
Don't get addicted cause, I'm gonna fade you like that rush
Is that blood on me or blush?
So what
You know I'm not a saint but I can make you pray
So get down on your knees, give me a reason I should stay
Trapped inside this madness, I know you wanna have this
So I can take advantage

Savage, savage
When you touch me you take me to heaven
When you hold me my body's a weapon
If you think that you can save me, break me down, and tame me
Here's your chance to do some damage, savage

I am the type I know you drown in
You're on the rise, be careful who you trust
Don't get it twisted cause, I could be really into us
Or I can leave you just because, because
You know I'm not a saint but I can make you pray
So get down on your knees, give me a reason I should stay
Trapped inside this madness, I know you wanna have this
So I can take advantage

Savage, savage
When you touch me you take me to heaven
When you hold me my body is a weapon
If you think that you can save me, break me down, and tame me
Here's your chance to do some damage, savage, savage, savage
