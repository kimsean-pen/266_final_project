Paint my face in your magazines
Make it look whiter than it seems
Paint me over with your dreams
Shove away my ethnicity
Burn every notion that I
May have a flame inside to fight
Say just what is on my mind
That offending your might

Cause this life
Is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel
So powerless
What are you gonna do
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today
Weatherworn, looking all the rage
They took her passion and her gaze
And made a poster
Now it's moccasins we sport
We take the culture and contort
Perhaps only to distort
What we are hiding

Cause this life
Is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel
So powerless
What are you gonna do
But say what you want
Say what you want
Say, say...

Hey you the one, the one and outside
Are you gonna get in, get in
Hey you the one that don't fit in
How ya how ya gonna get in
Hey you the one outside
Are you ever gonna get in with your
Broken tooth, broken jaw, broken mojo

Yeah this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are you gonna do?

Cause this life
Is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel
So powerless
What are you gonna do

Cause this life
Is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel
So powerless
What are you gonna do

Say what you want (life is too short)
Say what you want
Say what you want (just for you)
Say what you want
Say what you want to (feel powerless)
Say what you want to say
Say, say (gonna do)
Life is too short
Just for you
Feel, powerless
Gonna do
