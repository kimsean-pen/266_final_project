You'll make it through the day
See things another way and behold

Listen to Wednesday's Song
This night you go home alone
How the sane go upright
How you look another night
You're back under my hat
And even knowing that you're a whore

Nothing ever meant more
Than switching rooms through a door
Out into another one
Frames flash inward

And you know
I have seen the world enough
I've drowned in my throughts alot
Deep in rains that swirl above
I canceled heaven I concede

Another word to say
When everything's O.K. you go down
And pulling up the slack
And never coming back
An alarm

Ringing to set the sun
No one ever becomes
What others thought they should've been
Inside they're what they can see

You know I do miss this girl
To show I am in a swirl of sun
Being what I've got
The joy
I canceled heaven I concede
Everything that I belive
I canceled heaven I concede
