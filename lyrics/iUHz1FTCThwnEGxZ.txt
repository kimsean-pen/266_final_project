(John Maldara / David White)

You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

And don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And, please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

'Cause, you don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down
'Cause I'll never stay

I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So, just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way that I want
To say and do whatever I please

And, don't tell me what to do, yeah
Don't, don't you tell me what to say
And, please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So, just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way that I want
To say and do whatever I please
