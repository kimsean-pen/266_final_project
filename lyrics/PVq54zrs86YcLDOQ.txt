'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby (wooh)

Looks like you've been starving
You got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right

I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

Let me take you under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two, and it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby (wooh)

So you want some more
Well, I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right

Hope you got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

Let me take you under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two, and it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu (go ahead)

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Sweet potato pie
It'll change your mind
Got you runnin' back for seconds
Every single night

I'm the one they say can change your life (take-off)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (blast)
She say she want a Migo night, now I ask her, "What's the price?" (hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like (offset)

I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime make you blind
In her spine, and my diamonds change the climate

Girl, sweet tooth (sweet), no tooth fairy (no)
Whip cream (whip), no dairy (milk)
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready" (hot)
But no horses, no carriage (go ahead)

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby (wooh)

Under candle light (wooh)
Bon appétit, baby (wooh)
