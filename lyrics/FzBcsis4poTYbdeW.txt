I brought you light
But you'd rather live in the dark
We always fight
Don't even know what is the cause
Still asking why
Fuck it babe, what is the point
You're feeding me lies
And I'm tired of playing the part

You broke me down
I'm nothing but marrow and bone
Rot to the core
Chewed up and spit on the floor
I'm leaving now
Can't take this shit anymore
And if you're holding me down
Then why am I outta control

It's our oldest deadliest impulse
The need to protect our own at the expense of any other living thing
And we give that impulse such a nice name, don't we? Love

You brought me light
But I'd rather live in the dark
It's my own fault
That everything's falling apart
I know it's been hard
I'm sorry for what I have done
But baby please don't leave
Cause then I won't have anyone
You gave me love
But I just threw it away
I promise that I'm gonna change
Cause baby I need you to stay
I'm feeling hollowed out
Tired of living this way
You have my heart
So baby, please don't walk away

Why can't you see
The heart on my sleeve
You're tearing me apart babe, losing my sleep
Why can't you see
You're everything I need
I'm losing my mind babe, I can't compete

I brought you light
But you'd rather live in the dark
We always fight
Don't even know what is the cause
Still asking why
Fuck it babe, what is the point
You're feeding me lies
And I'm tired of playing the part

You broke me down
I'm nothing but marrow and bone
Rot to the core
Chewed up and spit on the floor
I'm leaving now
Can't take this shit anymore
And if you're holding me down
Then why am I outta control?

You brought me light
But I'd rather live in the dark
It's my own fault
That everything's falling apart
I know it been hard
I'm sorry for what i have done
But baby please don't leave
Cause then I won't have anyone
You gave me love
But I just threw it away
I promise that I'm gonna change
Cause baby I need you to stay
I'm feeling hollowed out
Tired of living this way
You have my heart
So baby, please don't walk away
