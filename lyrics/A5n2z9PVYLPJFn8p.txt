Fire!

I know I suffer
From guilt of past romances
Now that it's over
All fade to blackness
I built these fences
I hold myself in darkness
Prepare the weapon
This battle ends when I give in

I lose my head
I lose my mind
(I lose my mind)
Time passes by
Fall out of sight
And I can't look back

I'm losing my fight
Blinded by this light
All truth is gone, gone, gone
Can you treat my mind
I am trapped inside
Like a martyr I'm gone, gone, gone

The silents kills me
My inner guilt is striking
It's so addicting
Just like the guilt inside me
I'm feeling anger
My hopes gone through the sky
I can no longer
His word cuts me down to size

I lose my head
I lose my mind
(I lose my mind)
Time passes by
Fall out of sight
And I can't look back

I'm losing my fight
Blinded by this light
All truth is gone, gone, gone
Can you treat my mind
I am trapped inside
Like a martyr I'm gone, gone,
Gone, gone, gone

I'm losing my fight
Blinded by this light
The truth is gone, gone, gone

I'm alright
Said my goodbyes
The passed is gone, gone, gone
I'm alright
Said my goodbyes
The passed is gone, gone, gone
I'm alright
Said my goodbyes
The passed is gone, gone, gone

I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
