Gallantly rise
Strike spears of light
Inside my eyes
Over the fields
Where we believed
Our love had died

Still
Still
Be still

Rose of white
Blushing with life
Don't pass me by
Whisper the needs
Quiet release
Fever in me

Head cases full
Rise out of you
Breaking in two
Let there be light
Golden inside
Dark was the night

Still
Still
Be still
