Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo Run and tell them (?)
Pushing on my pride
I want your touch
Pressing on my hide

Tell me, animal
Call it what you want (?)
Push me in a ball
Tearing at the walls

Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo????
Put it on my brow
Taste like a storm
Let it come, it come

Tell me, animal
Call it what you want (?)
Push me in a ball
Tearing at the walls

Woo-oo-oo Woo-oo-oo-ooooo Run and tell them (?)
Pushing on my pride

Tell me, animal
Call it what you want (?)
Push me in a ball
Tearing at the walls

(Run and tell them (?))
