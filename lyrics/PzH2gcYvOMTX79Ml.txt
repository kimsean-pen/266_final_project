Last night I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing, feet were pacing
Lord, help me please tell me what I have gotten into

Ran my 3 miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out, it's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually

I'm on an emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
But I can't get off

This emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
Oh, I can't get off

Yesterday I told myself I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day, truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being taken for a constant ride on your

Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off

Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off

So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know that you'll never keep
Round and round it goes

Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off
