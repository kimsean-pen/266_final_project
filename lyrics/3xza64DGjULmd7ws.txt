Raised in between doll-shaped smoke
Insects in every corner of our rotten house
I hid in the walls of my room
Tasting clean air through a window crack

In these childhood dreams where imagination was key
I drove the needle through my skin
Weaving a delicate net to embrace me
And hold me to sleep where no one could see
Where no one could hear me breathe

Your empty house won't comfort me
Don't make me pity you
Don't make me pity you in the end
Don't make me pity you
Don't make me pity you in the end

I won't forget the years when disappointment was key
Blood runs thick in the veins of guilt
Drowning your promises made never embrace me
And hold me to sleep where no one could see
Where no one could hear me breathe

Your shallow heart doesn't soothe me
Your false love won't break me
Don't make me pity you
Don't me pity you in the end
Don't make me pity you
Don't me pity you in the end

This drunken body I've left behind
And the problems that are no longer mine
I resided under your broken feathers
For too long, scraps of pictures in a box
Is what remains of those childhood dreams
You'll never know the person I've become
