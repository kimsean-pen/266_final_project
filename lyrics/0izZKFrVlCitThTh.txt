I don t need to clear my walls
At least not for you
I don t need to hear the truth
Never from you
I won t be what you want, never, never
I won t be what you want, never, never
Won t feel what you got, never, never
I m so proud to be so loud
When the rain comes, it will not wash you clean
And when the suffer mean
Not till you, not till you get what I mean
I m ready now, for the flames,
For the things it sounds fun, I want some
When you talk about, I would rather... as you run
From the sun
Cause you don t understand
You just can t understand
I won t take ...with you, or ride the truth
Break my side, bend the rules
All locked by few
I won t be what you want, never, never
I won t be what you want, never, never

I m so proud to be so loud
When the rain comes, it will not wash you clean
And when the suffer mean
Not till you, not till you get what I mean
I m ready now, for the flames,
For the things it sounds fun, I want some
When you talk about, I would rather... as you run
From the sun
Cause you don t understand
You just can t understand
Treat your wings, we re going
They re the prize, forever be told
It s alright, it s alright,
You re so good ... here we are
Together in cold
It s alright, it s alright, it s alright
Never, never, never
I m ready now, for the flames,
For the things it sounds fun, I want some
When you talk about, I would rather... as you run
From the sun
Cause you don t understand
You just can t understand.
