In this house of suffering
I gotta let some joy in
I hear that freedom will win
Oh where oh where can Jah love be now
My dear, it's here in the underground
Inside the hearts of your own children
In this house of suffering
I spiritualogic grin, in
One way grace is my friend
To conquer doom and sin
And all the nations lying
While all our people crying
And they stop at nothing!...nothing!...nothing!
In this house of suffering
Don't want but just one thing
Got to have my origin
In this house of suffering.
