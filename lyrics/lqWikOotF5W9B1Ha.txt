And at night they come,
When protectors are gone
Not in waves,
But in shadows
Prancing on the wall,
Creeping up the bed

It's there they thrive and nest within
Dear frightened little boy,
It's time to rise above all of their noise
Ghosts are merely shadows,
You are flesh and bone
The grudge does not have regrets when there is no past to forget
Our denial it speaks in tongues,
There's monsters among us
And at dawn they'll go with the last shred of hope
Someday it'll change, or so they say
Just bide your time and try to stay alive
Revenge will come with the rising sun
Dear shattered little girl,
This is not the end of your world
It's the beginning of the rest of your life where you do, or you die
It's not a trial but a test,
Just a broken mirror to reflect
Our denial it speaks in tongues,
There's monsters among us
I ask from within my heart, where did our failures start
If we must imagine ourselves as someone, somewhere else
And what does the future hold, if we're running low on health and hope
Our denial it speaks in tongues,
There's monsters among us
Dusk lives within us, darkness won't give up
Dusk in us
