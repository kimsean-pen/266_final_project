Complicated
Frustrated
Underestimated
Can't sleep, mind racing
Hard to stay concentrated
Foreign towns, missing home
Please don't forget about me
Tell the story, all the glory
Fuck what they say about me
Some days I feel
So out of place with these fake people in my face
I cannot relate, yeah
Sometimes I feel
Like I create, and they just take everything that I make
Turnaround and then hate
Maybe i was living off expectations
Or I was born in the wrong generation
That's probably it
Meanwhile I'm crushing weed overseas
Hopefully tonight we'll find more
Long days on tour
Backstage getting boring
But step on stage and they roaring

I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I feel alive for the very first time
I don't wanna die
But, I don't wanna hide
Or keep shit inside
I will not cry, so
I will deal with it how I deal with it
I am 13 hours clean and still counting
Save me from these day dreams about it
On the full moon night swims with tattoos
I cannot stand these fucking rules
I been sailing too long in cold water
Restrain me from these pills and more doctors
And erase me from this page and start over

I want to start over

See, I fell in love with a very bad habit
I was alive for the very first time
You said goodbye,
but I was trying to say something ain't right inside of me
I want to run away
I want to run away, run away
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay, I dont want to stay here
I wish you could relate
I wish you'd point at a star and leave it up to fate
We are who we are so don't judge me
Just 'cause its hard to smile
Read between white lines
See what's in my mind
