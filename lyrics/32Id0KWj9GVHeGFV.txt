The bridge holds back the sky
Can't hold back what's inside
And the train above me
Sounds like the music in my head

My thoughts are undecided
I think it so I hide it
And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast

I wish that I was stronger
Could keep my head for longer
I sit and watch my fear
But it won't disappear

I can dream myself away
Lose myself for days
And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast

All I know
All I know
All I know
Is here and now

All I know
All I know
All I know
Is here and now

And the train rushes past
Like a day gone too fast
And the train rushes past
Like a life gone too fast
