When I look back,
I see trails of myself.
Coulda been you,
Coulda been someone else.
All that I know is
I'm leaving that person behind.

I'm clean.
I've washed it all away.
I'm so clean.
You made me this way.
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams,
Cuz I know that you want me clean.

You gave me a taste of a life I could lead.
You gave me a face for the fools to believe.
Now I'm changing,
Becoming one of you.

I'm clean.
I've washed it all away.
I'm so clean.
You made me this way.
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams,
Cuz I know that you want me clean.

This life.
Oh, it's a dirty life,
But I can show you another way.
Don't you wanna be like me?
Don't you wanna be clean?

Now, I'm the darkness that hides in the light,
And it's laughable watching you put up a fight.
The door's always open, it's only a matter of time.

I'm clean.
I'm so clean.
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams,
Cuz I know that you want me clean.

I'm clean.
I've washed it all away.
I'm so clean.
You made me this way.
Now I'm ready to be
The face that never screams,
Cuz I know that you want me clean.
Cuz I know that you want me clean.
