Is this the final scene in our tragic play
Only curtains remain to fall
There's no reason left to stay in this place
We move backwards against the wall
Conversation's over, communication's down
The monologue is taking over

I'm still broken
I took you in with arms wide open
My colour fades to gray
There's nothing left to say
Now it's all dead

Are these the final cries of our aching souls
(Aching souls)
How come yours don't make a sound
With broken wings we're falling faster as we go
(As we go)
But somehow we don't touch the ground
You had me torn to pieces
You got inside my head
But I'll be here until it's over

I'm still broken
I took you in with arms wide open
My colour fades to gray
There's nothing left to say
Now it's all dead
(It's all dead)
(I'm still broken)

I'm still hoping
That we can find the words once spoken
My senses bow to break
How long have we to wait
'Til it's all dead
(Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead)

I will find you, you will find me
How can we live?
If it's all dead
I will not cry
I will not break
I will not fall
Still it's all too late

I will find you, you will find me
How can we live?
If it's all dead

I'm still broken
I took you in with arms wide open
My colour fades to gray
There's nothing left to say
Now it's all dead
(It's all dead)
(I'm still broken)
I'm still hoping
That we can find the words once spoken
My senses bow to break
How long have we to wait
'Til it's all dead
