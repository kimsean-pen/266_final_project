Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Dreaming of these places
I may never see
Maybe if we get there
Things will be much easier
and I won't be nothing anymore
Well babe when we're together
There's always such nice weather
Guess we don't need these places anyway
We'll strum on any pick? or guitar
We'll drink away and sing our dad a song
How magically simple our life could be
Yea-yeah
ohohohoh
oooooh
Driving to Tahiti
and take off your bikini
Jump in something warmer
Fall asleep together
Well maybe when it's all done
We can grow our hair long
I won't be nothing anymore
Well babe when we're together
There's always such nice weather
Guess we don't need this places anyway
Driving to hawaii
surfing down the street
driving to hawaii
surfing down the street
