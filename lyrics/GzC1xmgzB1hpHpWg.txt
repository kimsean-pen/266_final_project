Yes, this love's not good enough
Is time to let it go
Our weary hearts just fall apart
I feel it in my bones

And God knows
That it's hard to find the one
But in time
All the flowers turn to face the sun

So silently just walk with me
Like any other day
No sad goodbyes, no tears, no lies
Just go our separate ways

And God knows
That it's hard to find the one
But in time, all the flowers
Yes in time
All the flowers turn to face the sun

And God knows
That it's hard to find the one
But in time
All the flowers turn to face the sun
