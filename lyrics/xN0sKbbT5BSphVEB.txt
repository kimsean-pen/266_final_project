Standing in the queue of a school canteen
Guys on the corner they were laughing at me
But I don't mind if they see it all
You know I gotta come clean, I gotta come clean
Ooh I got a crush on you

My mind don't need it but my body do
A little bit of loving and attention from you
Although we're only strangers
They don't need to know
I gotta come clean, I gotta come clean
Ooh, I got a crush on you

I wanna get serious right away
1-2, I got a crush on you
What you doing' today or any other day?
1-2, I got a crush on you
Just one looks an I go insane
1-2, I got a crush on you, it's true

Your daddy never comes to get you
'Cos he lives so far away
But his I-talian chauffeur shows up every day
But I'll get you in the corner, I'll really let you know
I gotta come clean, I gotta come clean
Ooh, I got a crush on you

I wanna get serious right away
1-2, I got a crush on you
What you doing' today or any other day?
1-2, I got a crush on you
Just one looks and I go insane
1-2, I got a crush on you, it's true

1-2, I got a crush on you
1-2, I got a crush on you
1-2, I got a crush on you
I said "1-2, I got a crush on you"

Why should I get a crush on you?
Why should I get a crush on you?
Why should I get a crush on you?
Why should I
