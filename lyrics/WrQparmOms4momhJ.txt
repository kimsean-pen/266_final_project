Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and scent of Aragon
Faith is difficult and nuture is all?
Signed on the path from Aragon

Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
Its wings broken so like wisdom
Grey steel holes
Open behind me
Dark pink scars
Run along beside me

Endless pointless
Gaping chasm
Ill-chosen, disappointing
With litte meaning
Snow-white ferocity
Your image did deceive me

Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
Its wings broken so like wisdom
Grey steel holes
Open behind me
Dark pink scars
Run along beside me

Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and spears of Aragon
Faith is difficult and nurture is all?
Signed on my path from arrogance

Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and scent of Aragon
Faith is difficult and murder them all
Signed on the path from Aragon
