Once I dreamed
That love would come
And sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by
I'm still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears

All alone, no one cares
So much to give to you all out there
Take me now in your arms
Let me rest, safe from harm
Ohh, I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me?

Here they come, here come the tears
(Here they come, here come the tears)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Here they come, here come the tears)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Here they come, here come the tears)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Here they come, here come the tears)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Here they come, here come the tears)
(Aaa aaa aaa)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Aaa aaa aaa)
(Here they come, here come the tears)
(Aaa aaa aaa)
Here they come, here come the tears
(Aaa aaa aaa)
(Here they come, here come the tears)
Hear come the tears aaa
Hear come the tears aaa
Hear come the tears
