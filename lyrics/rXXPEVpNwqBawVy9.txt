Solitude
I consign my energy so
Gratitude
May come fill my soul

Certitudes
No theories of reason can
Dedicate the rules
Of this mystic world

As I call on the winds
On the heart of the trees
On the waves of the seas

I will welcome the love that I feel
Banish the shadows and fears
Break through the circles of hate
That poison the hearts
Moonlight is bright on ritual night

Sacrifice
All my ego and self-focus
Purify
Intentions of my soul

Paralyzed
By a world that wants us all
To push aside
The true heart inside

As I call on the winds
On the heart of the trees
On the waves of the seas

I will welcome the love that I feel
Banish the shadows and fears
Break through the circles of hate
That poison the hearts
Moonlight is bright on ritual night

Some might pray to the gods
Some be loading their guns
I confess that my only wish
Is love to protect those I care for

I will welcome the love that I feel
Banish the shadows and fears
Break through the circles of hate
That poison the hearts
Moonlight is bright on ritual night

Sun will set and moon will rise, eternal cycle of life
Men must choose for good on which side to stand
As the Earth won't spare us when the end will come
