Oh oh and I,
I put a wish in,
made it my mission
to end the conflict.
But oh,
I put a wish in,
hoping you'd listen.
Be my accomplice
But ohhh

Relax, its only dreaming facts,
giving way to feelings.
No one ever stays long,
its over when you wake up.
So I knew that it was
in the picture perfect world.
We can be more than before.
I said it was,
I made it stronger.

From the beginning,
my head was spinning,
the perfect star.
Oh a church,
a place to fit in,
a new religion,
I found your heart
But oh oh.

Relax, its only dreaming facts
giving way to feelings.
No one ever stays long,
its over when you wake up.
So I knew that it was
in the picture perfect world.
We can be more than before.
I said it was,
I made it stronger.
In the picture perfect world.
We can be more than before.
I said it was,
I made it stronger.

Don't get mad,
you did your best
and now it's
all in the past to stay.

So I knew that it was
in the picture perfect world.
We can be more than before.
I said it was,
I made it stronger

In the picture perfect world.
We can be more than before.
I said it was,
I made it stronger.
