Want a girl to hold my hand
When the plane lands
When the cracks appear in the plan
And the rocks turn into sand
Better call my new French girlfiend

Make a call international
All around the world
Money fame liberate and free
Alain, Rene, Vanessa and me
Ahh...

Better call my new French Girlfriend

That's
The price
Of success
Want a girl to hold my hand
When the plane lands
