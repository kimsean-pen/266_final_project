Now your gone

I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone

I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Are you ready?

Now you're gone

I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me

I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy, now you're gone

Ready for takeoff
Ready for takeoff
Ready, ready, ready, ready...
Ready for takeoff

Now you're gone

I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

There empty place in my heart
It won't alarm me, it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll be crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone

I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here, now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone
