I've been over drinking,
I wonder what you do
Tell me what you're thinking,
What's your point of view.
Do you remember in December,
Never on our own
Better yet together, we were walking through the snow
I've been reminiscing, baby,
I'm missing what we could be
Will he know the things you like, will he touch your body like me?
I just wanna know if I should keep your number

I just wanna know if I should keep your number

I just wanna know if I should... Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Don't like the situation,
The way you act so cool
Can't you just admit it,
That you're hurting too
I just wanna lay with your body again I know
Every curve like the back of my hand
Try to stay connected, but you don't pick up the phone
So I just wanna know if I should keep your number

I just wanna know if I should keep your number

I just wanna know if I should... Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
I've been reminiscing, baby, I'm missing what we could be
Will he know the things you like, will he touch your body like me?
If this is what you want for us,
Then I'll find a way to get through
But there ain't nobody better, ain't nobody better, better than you
Yeah, I just wanna know if I should...

I just wanna know if I should keep your number I just wanna know

I just wanna know I just wanna know if I
should keep it, Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
Nah I just wanna know I just wanna know if I should...
