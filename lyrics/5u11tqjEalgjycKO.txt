It's the beginning of the end, so you might as well set fire to your friends
But it ain't alpha and omega, it's just Nintendo and Sega
I'm a rear gun kid, here to flip your lid
I'm a stone cold fox, spreading a bubonic pox
I'm a zodiac killer, I'm a three dollar biller
I'm a rooftop sniper, shooting roadmen in diapers

A shotgun is a good substitute for mouthwash
Drunk controllers eat their lunch at their desktops

Why stop working if you enjoy what you do?
Jesus turned the other cheek, and I'll strike that one too
A million little pieces will never be enough for you
But the honorable blood we've spilled should be blue

I'm an American nightmare hiding in a Mexican salad bar
Last night I dreamt I went to Woostock, but I only saw Sha-Na-Na
Your daddy is a traitor, and your momma has thread in her hair
You best get to where you're going, or else you'll never get there
You best get to where you're going, or else you'll never get there

Why stop working if you enjoy what you do?
Jesus turned the other cheek, and I'll strike that one too
A million little pieces will never be enough for you
But the honorable blood we've spilled should be blue

A shotgun is a good substitute for mouthwash
Drunk controllers eat their lunch at their desktops

Why stop working if you enjoy what you do? (Why stop? Why stop?)
Jesus turned the other cheek, and I'll strike that one too
A million little pieces will never be enough for you
But the honorable blood we've spilled should be blue
