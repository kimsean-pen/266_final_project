The surface of the water is serene
But what goes on below?
Hungry current sucking at your feet
It won't let go

Tossed 'til we capsized
Battered and brused
Say it's the last time
We know the truth

Don't know what you got until it's gone
Don't know what is right until it's wrong
Heaven could fall and angels swarm
But hell is ours to face
Ah-oh
True love is violent
Ah-oh
True love is violent, violent

Stirring in the sugar cubes of salt
Pollute to purify
Drowning in my body, mind, and thoughts
My mouth is dry

Tossed 'til we capsized
Battered and brused
Say it's the last time
We know the truth

Don't know what you got until it's gone
Don't know what is right until it's wrong
Heaven could fall and angels swarm
But hell is ours to face
Ah-oh
True love is violent
Ah-oh
True love is violent, violent

After the storm
After the rain
I'm juvenile
I'm born again
(Ahh-ahh)

Don't know what you got until it's gone
Don't know what is right until it's wrong
Heaven could fall and angels swarm
But hell is ours to face
Ah-oh
True love is violent
Ah-oh
True love is violent, violent
