Past where the river bends.
Past where the silo stands.
Past where they paint the houses.
Past where they paint the houses.

Take away, something that you know.
The reason, that you're always there.
Use it, 'til you're through.
But remember, when the time comes,
You got to let go.

Past where the river bends.
Past where the silo stands.
Past where they paint the houses.
Past where they paint the houses.
