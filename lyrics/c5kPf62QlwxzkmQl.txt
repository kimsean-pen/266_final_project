Tears fill up my eyes
I'm washed away with sorrow
And somewhere in my mind
I know there's no tomorrow

Oh, I see you're leaving soon
I guess you've had your fill
But if I can't change your mind
Then no one will

And all throughout the years
I never strayed from you, my dear
But you suspect I'm somewhere else
You're feeling sorry for yourself

Leaving with a broken heart
I love you even still
But if I can't change your mind
Then no one will
If I can't change your mind

Even though my heart keeps breaking
Don't you know that I'll be waiting here for you
Then when you return
When will you return

I hope you see I'm dedicated
Look how long that I have waited
If you come back then you will find
A different person if you change your mind

How can I explain away
Something that I haven't done?
And if you can't trust me now
You'll never trust in anyone

With all the crazy doubts you've got
I love you even still
But if I can't change your mind
Then no one will
If I can't change your mind

Someday you'll see I've been true
I'll stay that way until
But if I can't change your mind
Then no one will
If I can't change your mind

If I can't change your mind
If I can't change your mind
