Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out

Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancing around the lies we tell
Dancing around big eyes as well, oh
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities
You'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins
Of a palace within my dreams
And you know
We're on each other's team

I'm kinda over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities
You'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins
Of a palace within my dreams
And you know
We're on each other's team

I'm kinda over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kinda older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

We live in cities
You'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins
Of a palace within my dreams
And you know
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know
