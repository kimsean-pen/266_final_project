There's a million combinations and this is one
There's a million combinations and I am one
There's a million ways to win or lose
There's a million ways to cheat
There's a million ways to show yourself
There's a million constellations and this is one
There's a million destinations and this is one
There's a million ways to show your hand
There's a million ways to lose
There's a million ways to prove yourself
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
Don't listen to your heart
Just listen to your head
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
If you want to stay alive
Just listen to your head
There are endless wrong directions along the way
And endless conversations we did not say
I don't think that it's heaven
And I don't think that it's hell
We're all halfway to nowhere
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
Don't listen to your heart
Just listen to your head
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
If you want to stay alive
Just listen to your head
And if you want to go back
Well, you can never go back
And if you want to stay alive
Just listen to your head
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
Don't listen to your heart
Just listen to your head
If you want to stay alive
Then you got to play dead
If you want to stay alive
Just listen to your head
And if you want to go back
Well, you can never go back
And if you want to stay alive
Just listen to your head
