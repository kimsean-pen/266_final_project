People laugh each time they see us walking by and their whispering just make
you feel like you wanna cry. Keep on walking by my side don't look behind. You
know I love you, so don't you pay 'em no mind.

People say our love ain't gonna last too long. And they point at us, just like
we've been only carry on, keep on looking in my eyes and we'll be fine. You see
I love you, so don't you pay 'em no mind.

Stay with me and let 'em see, let 'em know that you love me, that you love me, if
it's true who cares what they do? Cause I don't need anyone but you. Just you
and me, we're gonna make it all alone. Let them laugh at us, we're gonna build
a world all our own, Keep on then, keep on holdin' on to me, they'll learn in
time. I really love you, so don't you pay em' no mind. You know I love you, you
know I can't be without you
