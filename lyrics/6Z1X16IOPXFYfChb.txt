It was you that took my soul
And threw it in a fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire

Now I'm pure, now I'm clean
I feel cured and surreal
In you

There is no denying
How I have been changed
You won't hear me crying
Now misery is strange

I can dream, I can fly
Now it seems I get by
With you

Good goodbye again
Good goodbye again

I was always looking, looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
And pull it out and run

Now I'm caught on your arm
All my thoughts are entwined
In you

Good goodbye again
Good goodbye again

If you see me walking
To the golden gates
The turn arounds stop talking
Stop and hesitate

I'll be waiting up there
Weave my fate in the air
For you

Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
