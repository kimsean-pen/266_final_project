You oughta know, know

If you wanted diamonds
Why you settle for a rock?
Man, I hope that girl's
Got a great personality, yeah

If you want a fight, boy
Shouldn't you be heading up?
Yeah, I hope that girl's
Got a real vision of family

All the different qualities
All you couldn't get from me, me, me, me

You oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
I've got the bruises from the letting go
You said you only needed time to breathe
A little time alone so who the hell is she?

I don't need the lies
And I'm not the type of girl to fight

But you oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
And I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma
At your karma, throw 'em at your karma
Oh, I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma

I saw you yesterday
You were walking with her holding hands, yeah
Man, I hope you choke
On some really hot coffee

And you said we should wait
That we shouldn't see anyone else, oh
Man, I hope that girl
Only sees the things she wants to see

That your personality
That she's not as dumb as me, me, me, me

You oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
I've got the bruises from the letting go
You said you only needed time to breathe
A little time alone so who the hell is she?

I don't need the lies
And I'm not the type of girl to fight

But you oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
And I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma
At your karma, throw 'em at your karma
Oh, I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma

What goes up now, what goes up?
It's gonna come down, down, down
It's gonna come down, down, down
What goes up now, what goes up?
It's gonna come down, down, down
It's gonna come down, down, down

You oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
I've got the bruises from the letting go
You said you only needed time to breathe
A little time alone so who the hell is she?

I don't need the lies
And I'm not the type of girl to fight

But, you oughta know
I've got the pieces of the heart you broke
And I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma
At your karma, throw 'em at your karma
Oh, I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma

I'm gonna throw 'em at your karma
Throw 'em at your karma
