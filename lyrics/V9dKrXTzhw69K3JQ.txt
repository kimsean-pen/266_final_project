I heard my song on the radio and I changed the station
I got diamonds framed in yellow gold
I shouldn't be complaining
The sun is up outside, but in my head it keeps on raining
Tomorrow never satisfies me quite like yesterday
Try not to care, I can't relax
I cut off my hair, spent a few stacks
Stare in the mirror, but who's staring back?
Somebody looking for something that they never had

I can take it all for granted
Can't please everybody on the planet
Even love all over, I don't need to kiss and tell
Now it's time for me to learn to love myself

I need to, I need to love myself
I need to, I need to love myself
I need to, I need to love myself
I need to love myself before I love anyone else, yeah

No matter how hard I try or what I do
I just can never fuckin' impress you
So why am I letting what you say get me down?
I spent my whole life thinking I was wrong
And nobody likes me and it's all my fault
But I'm done with that shit, I finally figured out

I don't need to be the same as everyone else
I just need to motherfuckin' love myself

I need to, I need to love myself
I need to, I need to love myself
I need to, I need to love myself
I need to love myself before I love anyone else
I need to and I don't need your help
I need to (I need to) just fuckin' love myself
I need to before I love anyone else
I need to (Love myself) just fuckin' love myself, oh, no

Love myself
Love myself

You don't have to trust me, I already trust myself
Nobody can judge me the way that I judge myself
Life can get ugly when it turns upside down
You don't gotta love me as long as I love myself

I need to love myself
I need to, I need to, I need to love myself
I need to, I need to love myself
I need to love myself before I love anyone else
I need to and I don't need your help
I need to (Love myself), I need to just fuckin' love myself
I need to before I love anyone else
I need to (Love myself) just fuckin' love myself, oh, no
