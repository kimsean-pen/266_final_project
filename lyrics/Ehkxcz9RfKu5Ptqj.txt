Like a thief in the night
I'm coming for your heart
I'm coming for your heart
This time it's anything goes
I guess I'm just a selfish ghost

I know you're scared
Because somebody told you i was up to no good But i'll be here
Waiting for the chance to take you out this neighborhood
There's a whole wide world for us to see
The only thing you gotta do is follow me

Like a thief in the night
I'm coming for your heart
I'm coming for your heart
This time it's anything goes
I guess I'm just a selfish ghost
I guess I'm just a selfish ghost
