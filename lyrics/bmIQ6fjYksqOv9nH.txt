I've been all pinched up since Saturday
I've run my self dry of excellence
Sixteen long years
Inhale the bullshit in

Whatever I said on Saturday
Whatever I did, I'd do it all again
Nineteen marks up walls
Each year, one short fall

Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down

What is this for, ex-parking lot?
The dreamers go by, they never stop
Twenty plus five in
Let the youth cave in

Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down

Tiny voices
Make things harder
Tiny voices
Make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
