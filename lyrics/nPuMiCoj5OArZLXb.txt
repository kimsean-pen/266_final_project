There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing
There's no such thing as illusion

To walk around in [?]
I'm running down a mountain
Tears of gold running down my head
To wake up from a nightmare
To your warm and familiar face
I will love again, be as simple
As your hand wrapped around my waist

After all I thought I wanted
Ripped in two, [?]
After all [?]
To lose but walk away

And after all the crying is all less
You won't come free
You know the status quo in nature
The strong eat the weak

Tonight the expectations
Were lost along the way
After all I ever needed
Was your arm around my waist

There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing
There's no such thing as illusion

Don't tell me that it's fleeting
Don't tell me it's a honeymoon
Don't tell me that this feeling
Comes and goes, yeah I know what they say
This ain't no new [?] ever
There's no returning if it breaks
Just don't go when I get the shakes

After all I thought I wanted
Ripped in two, [?]
After all I ever needed
Was your arm around my waist

There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing as illusion
There's no such thing
There's no such thing as illusion
