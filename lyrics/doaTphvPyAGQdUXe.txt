Running with the wolf pack
Feel like I'm never coming back
And every time there's sunshine
I'm blind, yeah

I am everybody
And everyone that I know is me
Everyone that I know
Won't see

I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer, yeah

I'm another number
And you know the numbers must agree
But every time the wind blows
I can't fly, why?

We take away tomorrow
And never see the end of today
Lock it up and send it away
Forever

I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer
'Cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer

Running with the wolf pack
Feel like I'm never coming back
But maybe that was sunshine
That I saw

I've heard about a rainbow
I've heard it makes you crazy
I think I'm going crazy
Crazy 'cause I see

I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer
'Cause dreams are what we are

I could have been a dreamer
I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer
'Cause dreamers never die, no
Dreamer

I could have been a dreamer, dreamer
I could have been a dreamer, dreamer
I could have been a dreamer, dreamer
I could have been a dreamer, dreamer
