Big shot, tell you what
Tell me what goes on round here
Go on and get me in the corner
Smoke my cigarettes and drink my beer
Tell me that this world is no place for the weak
Then you can look me in the eye
And tell me if you see a trace of fear

You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder

Okay, what you say
Tell me what they're wearing this year
Go on and laugh at me causeyou don't see
That I got something going on right here
Say I'm just a dreamer
Say I'm just a kid
Well ace, shut your face
Maybe you will see or hear

You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder

Big shot, thanks a lot
Gotta go it's getting late
I got a date with my tailor now
Thanks for putting me so straight
Tell me how they run the crime on every street
(la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
But check your watch and wallet now
Before I go and your too late
(uh, huh-huh)

You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder

Yeah.
