You bring with you the purest blue
The brightest blue
Maybe you should take a lesson from
the moon on how to handle eyes on you
Eyes on you
But you don't call me baby anymore
No you don't call me baby anymore
No you don't call me baby anymore
No you don't call me baby anymore

Sugar and spice
I should have taken your advice
And found the words to tell you live
I tell you why
I kiss you all the time
Fall more in love each time you sigh
I'll kiss you 'til I die, til I die

The brightest stars burn out the fastest
But maybe we could still have lost it all
Oh, we could out last it all
Oh, we could out last it all
Yeah, we could out last it all
Yeah, we could out last it all
Aw, we could out last it all
Aw, we could out last it all
Yeah, we could out last it all
We could out last it all
