I hear the spirits whisper
All around me in the night
My existence makes them sing
Actively seeking my company

They will come
I can hear them again
Occult presence in this world
Channeled through my soul

There is no such thing as fear
Only fascination and love
Empathy for the lingering dead
I've chosen this way

You can hear them if you will
Death is just the beginning
This living body is nothing but a vessel
Already dedicated to death
