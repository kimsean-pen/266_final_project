God, bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No!

God, bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No!

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding lights
God, bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

God, save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands?
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our fathers
The sins of our young
No!

God, save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands?
The sins of our sons
The sins of our fathers
The sins of our young
No!

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding lights
God, save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go

Lift me up, let me go (God, bless us everyone)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought

It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No!

God, bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No!

God, bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
