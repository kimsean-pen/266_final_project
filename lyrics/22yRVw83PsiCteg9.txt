Ghost, ghost
I know you live within me
Feel as you fly
In thunder clouds above the city
Into one that I
Loved with all that was left within me
Until we tore in two
Now wings and rings
And there're so many waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottle-rocket
1929
With wings that rings around a socket
Right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever
She won't ever die
And she goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
where no one can escape
(de de de de de)
And one day in New York City baby
A girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building
fourteen stories high
And when her spirit left her body
How it split the sun!
I know that she will live forever
All goes on and on and on and
She goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
where no one can escape
(de de de de de)
