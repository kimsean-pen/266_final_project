Most of the time
I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path
I can read the signs
Stay right with it

When the road unwinds
I can handle whatever
I stumble upon
I don't even notice
She's gone
Most of the time

Most of the time

It's well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn't change it if i could
I can't make it all match up
I can hold my own

I can deal with the situation
Right down to the bone

I can survive

And i can endure
And i don't even think
About her

Most of the time
Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion
'till it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion
No matter how thick
I can smile in the face
Of mankind.
Don't even remember
What her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time
She ain't even in my mind
I wouldn't know her if i saw her
She's that far behind
Most of the time
I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if i was ever with her
Most of the time
I'm halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don't cheat on myself
I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings
That are buried inside
I don't compromise
And i don't pretend
I don't even care
If i ever see her again
Most of the time
