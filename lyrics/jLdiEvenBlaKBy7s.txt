I let you on my skin
I let you hold me when I was lonely
Waiting for us to leave
You kept me dreaming
The skies unforgiving

You liked those velvet lips
It felt so good underwater
You kissed my fingertips
It felt so good

You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
My homeless heart is still hoping
My homeless heart is still holding
You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
My homeless heart is still hoping
My homeless heart is still holding you

I used to say my man
"You called me baby, how could you leave me"
Why did you take my hand
I couldn't break through, nothing could hold you

You liked those velvet lips
And it felt so good underwater
You kissed my fingertips
It felt so good

You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
My homeless heart is still hoping
My homeless heart is still holding
You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
My homeless heart is still hoping
My homeless heart is still holding

You, oh-oh-oh-oooh
You, oh-oh-oh-oooh
You, oh-oh-oh-oooh
You, oh-oh-oh-oooh
I miss my lover
That endless summer

You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
My homeless heart is still hoping
My homeless heart is still holding
You let me go my honeymoon heartbreak
(Still holding you)
Cut me off my honeymoon heartbreak
(Still holding you)
My homeless heart
(Still holding you)
My homeless heart
