Are we alone
Are we safe to glow
I've walked for lightyears
Just to be right here with one of my own

I feel their hands
Smother me again
Ten thousand faces tell me where my place is
You call it living

I feel so alien in the place that I call home
There's something radiant, led me into your soul

And in my dreams
We speak with light
You dance in fire expose the stardust
In my dreams
You shine with love
We are not of the world around us

And we're stealing the air
Catching our breath
Touching the sky
Whispering warm
Kiss the unknown
Infinite night
I can see beyond this place
Don't let me wake
Why can't we stay
In my dreams
In my dreams

Are you afraid
If we turned around
Along the way colours will bleed out
And all that we see now
Will all fade away

I feel so alien in the place that I call home
But something radiant pulls me into your soul

And in my dreams
We speak with light
You dance in fire expose the stardust
In my dreams
You shine with love
We are not of the world around us

And we're stealing the air
Catching our breath
Touching the sky
Whispering warm
Kiss the unknown
Infinite night

I can see beyond this place
Don't let me wake
Why can't we stay
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams

And in my dreams
We speak with light
You dance in fire expose the stardust
And in my dreams
You shine with love
We are not of the world around us

And we're stealing the air
Catching our breath
Touching the sky
Whispering warm
Kiss the unknown
Infinite night

I can see beyond this place
Don't let me wake
Why can't we stay
In my dreams
(I feel so alien)
In my dreams
(In the place that I call home)
In my dreams
(You're so radiant)
In my dreams
(I feel so alien in the place that I call home)
(You're so radiant)
