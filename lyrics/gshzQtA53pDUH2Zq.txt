Spit me your best lies
Tell me why you hide your indulgences
You think your paths will be easier
As you feel the weigth of fault
You're throwing in the sea of selfishness
That brings you only fear and uncontrol
I can not see reason to maim yourself so much
Someones care, someones not

You always say we are dying
In this anguish and boring
But I want you understand
We are dying anyway
In the happiest days, in the borest days
Inconstancy is a mistake
And here there's no any space to mistakes
Mercy of nobody helps you so don't be afraid
Of hope and better days

After all
What can we catch
To save ourselves?
