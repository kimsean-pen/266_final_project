I know you've been needing time to set aside
But you've found the party each and every night
See it in your eyes
You're running out of time
I see you fade
But you can't take the ticking
Oh girl
You're chasing thrills unknown through most the world
Why do you stay up all night
Cause you heard
It's the way to be
I can stay only if I'm ready now
As long as you're willing
Seven nights up all night
Seven nights feel alright
Cause seven nights is a good time
Until the stars are all gone
I don't wanna chase the fame
And have everybody know my name
I'm a lone man now look at me
Just one girl won't forget me
It's always been a longshot
Said it's always been a longshot
Ohh
You've been there more too but girl we'll tough it
There's always one more situation to compare
Do you really love it
Do you really love it
It's always been a long shot
