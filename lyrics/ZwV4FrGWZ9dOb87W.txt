Go, go, go,
It's time to make a move and we both know,
It's time to step it up a notch,
I'm ready to lose touch,
Baby boy,
Go, go, go.

This is the crossing at the main intersection,
Up is where we go from here,
Finest selection,
This could take us anywhere,
I don't want protection,
Life is better of the line, I, I...

I'm ready for the lift up,
Keep steady beat,
'Cus I'm ready for the big jump,
Keep up with me,
If you lose me then you know, you're just a bit too slow,
I only go up, up.
I'm ready to be in control and the ground isn't good enough for me,
I know where to find what I want and I'm gonna keep on,
Keep on, up, up

No turns now,
We're going straight,
You better hold on tight,
'Cus if you fall you're on your own,
'Cus I'm gonna go on,
No, no, no turns now.

This is the final call for all destinations,
This is were you're in or out,
No hesitation, this is not the time for doubts,
Make your decision,
Are you on or off the line, ine, ine...?

I'm ready for the lift up, keep steady beat,
'Cus I'm ready for the big jump, keep up with me,
If you lose me then you know, you're just a bit too slow,
I only go up, up.
I'm ready to be in control and the ground isn't good enough for me,
I know where to find what I want and I'm gonna keep on,
Keep on, up, up
