It's hard for me to pass the time
I watch it all through blue and white
The pain and doubt that I'll survive
Kept on the inside

Obstacles are all I see
The stress follows me through my dreams
To lay draped in eternal sleep
Kept on the inside

The hand of God's not on my side
I asked for the help and felt denied
Instead she handed me the knife
I kept i inside

Here it comes again
My trip my pain
No guilt to blame
No tears no shame
