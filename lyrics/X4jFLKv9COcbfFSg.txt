See your face at night, touch you black and white
You're a silver screen, visual balladry
Wanna move in the dark, play the part
Put your star in me, visual balladry

Holding you, I'm touching a star
Turn into Marilyn, leaning out of your big car
Holding you, I'm touching a star
Stay the night, if you're thinking you know
Think you know what you're good for

See your face at night, in forever light
You're a silver beam, visual balladry
Wanna move in the dark, play the part
Put your star in me, visual balladry

Holding you, I'm touching a star
Turn into Marilyn, leaning out of your big car
Holding you, I'm touching a star
Stay the night, if you're thinking you know
Think you know what you're good for
