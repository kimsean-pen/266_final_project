All of us now
Dent as we fall
Too amorous-like
We call out
Why are we so alone?
Even with company
If not then what
will we stay?
We're in the streetlight
All of us now
Breathe in like smoke
To know what it's like
Breathe in to choke
Every nine days
A smaller house
Try to escape forever
Why are we so alone?
Even with company
We are afraid
For each day
A striking distance
Why are we so alone?
Even with company
If not then what
Will we stay
We're in the streetlight
Why are we so alone?
Even with company
We ought to pray
For each day
A striking distance
