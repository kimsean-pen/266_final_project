I wish I could see you
I wish we could talk
I wish I could be you
I wish we could love
Cutting me open
Cutting me off
Off of your body
Out of your blood

Cause you're in my flesh

I think I'm crazy
I think it's the times
I wish you could save me
I wish you could hide
Under my skin
My eyes
Into your womb
Out of your mind

Cause your in my flesh
