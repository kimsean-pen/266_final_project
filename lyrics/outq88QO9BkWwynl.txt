My baby is a freak like me and she knows just what I like
She carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find
She won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls
If they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love

My queen got machine gun hips, better duck once they go off
Takes aim, no intentions to miss, oh-my, so help us all
And it's close to a flight in the midst of neon lights
And my neighbors, they greet me with bags under their eyes
And they know why

My baby is a freak like me and she knows just what I like
She carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find
She won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls
If they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love

Oh, concubine, what are you made of?
No resource on this earth is that soft
I swear by God you are an angel
Ironic how you help me raise hell

I let it go, surrender control
As she takes me for a ride
Hands in the air, we offer our souls
It's easy when she's on my mind
