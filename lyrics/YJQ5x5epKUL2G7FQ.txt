When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

I looked at you, lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm gonna love you boy you are so fine
Angel of mine

How you changed my world, you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
You came into my life sent from above
When I lost all hope you showed me love
I'm checkin' for you boy you're right on time
Angel of mine

Nothing means more to me than what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind
Angel of mine

...
What you mean to me, you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life sent from above
(Sent from above)
When I lost all hope, you showed me love

(Boy you showed me love)
I'm checkin' for you, boy you're right on time
(Right on time)
Angel of mine
(Angel of mine)
I'll never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new
Every breath that I take, the love that we make

I only share it with you
(You, you, you, you)
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you

Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

You came into my life sent from above
(Came into my life)
When I lost all hope you showed me love
(Boy you showed me love)
I'm checkin' for you, boy you're right on time
(But boy your right on time)
Angel of mine
(Angel of mine, oh mine)
How you changed my world, you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
I looked at you, lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm checkin' for you, boy you're right on time
Angel of mine
