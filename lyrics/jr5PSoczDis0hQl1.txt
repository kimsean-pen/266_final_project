Her mouth is an open grave
Eternal curse waiting for them
This time it will be ultimate
It cannot and will not be undone

Once their homes desecrated
Invaded silently from the inside
They saw not their seeds in bloom
Hope had faded with all life decayed

Who will inherit these thousands of tombs
For the dead will always remember
Eyes blindfolded, necks cracked
Souls devoured and spirits slain

Feeding the mindless horrors
Motherless children are waiting in the void
And when the cycle turns and Saturn storms
The hex will go wild

Death will be a servant under the spell
Diseases shall obey the higher voice
Life for a life, soul for a soul
This curse will be eternal
