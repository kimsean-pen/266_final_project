This is a war we live
And the sides are drawn, sides are drawn
And we're all wrapped up in fatigues
And they wear us out, wear us out
There is a storm at sea

If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)
If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(Eyes glare from your enemy sights make me go blind)

Blinds divide the sunlight into thin strips the size of a blade
In this trench that we dig for ourselves fourscore and fade
Glare with the enemy heat of the bodies in the bed
There's no retreat

This is our war we live in
We're up in arms, up in arms
With our heads pressed against the wall
And it's wearing thin, wearing thin
These are the screams
(We swallow)

If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)
If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(Eyes glare from your enemy sights make me go blind)

This is a war administer the pill
(Keep fighting)
Before the cell divides
(Keep marching)
We'll both go down like toy soldiers
(This is a war)

Threats and picket lines are forming around our beds
And the land mines in our chests will all go off in time
If we trip each other into this, do you think we'll find a way out?
We've synthesized a compound to treat this conscience

It's, one part loss, one part no sleep, one part the gun shot we heard
One part the screams mistaken for laughter, one part everything after
One part love, one part stepping out of the driving rain
One part parting ways in the cold apartment
Don't look back just keep running down the stairs

Do you hear the footsteps?
Can you hear the voices in the traffic?
Communiques in the attic?
They say, after time, all this will heal
We will rebuild and these broken arms will
(Mend themselves in our embrace)
