I'm gonna make a change, for once in my life

It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference

Gonna make it right...

As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind

I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul

They follow each other on the wind ya' know

'Cause they got no where to go

That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

Nanana nanana nana
(O oh...)

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize

There are some with no home

Not a nickel to loan
Could it be, really mean

Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred (scarred), somebody's broken heart (heart)
And a washed out dream
(Washed out dream)

They follow the pattern of the wind ya see

'Cause they got no place to be that's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (change his ways)
And no message could have been any clearer (Ooh ooh)
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change (Come on!)

You got to get it right, when you got the time
'Cause when you close your (You can't), then you close your
(Your) mind!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer (Ooh ooh)
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change
Stand up!
Stand up! (Make a change!)
Stand up!
Stand up!
Left, yourself now!
():
Man in the mirror!
(Ooh!)
(Ooh!) Ah aaah
(Ooh!) ah aaah
Make that change! (Stand up! Stand up!)
You know!
You Know!
You Know! (Man in the mirror!)
You Know!
Change!
Make that change.
