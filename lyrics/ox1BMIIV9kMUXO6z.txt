Avoid the truth while we live a moment from death
Content with corruption
Accept the deception
There's nothing left on this planet but misery
Regress any progress
Violence in a vortex

With my final breath my lungs will fill with fire (fire)
When there's nothing left the earth will sing in silence (silence)

Eyes to the sky while we wait to face the light
In time we are frozen
Blinded by destruction
Theres's nothing left on this planet but misery
Regress any progress
Violence in a vortex

With my final breath my lungs will fill with fire (fire)
When there's nothing left the earth will sing in silence (silence)

(We have no choice)
(We have no choice)
Fire consume the masses
Respect for life collapses
We have no choice but to rest in the ashes, burn

Burn

(With my final breath my lungs will fill with fire)

With my final breath my lungs will fill with fire (fire)
When there's nothing left the earth will sing in silence (silence)
