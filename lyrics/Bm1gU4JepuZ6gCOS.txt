I didn't like my ears so I chopped 'em off
I didn't like my nose so I chopped it off
I didn't like my hair so I chopped it off
I never liked my body so I chopped it off, 'cmon

I didn't like my head so I chopped it off
I didn't like my legs so I chopped 'em off
One finger at a time, I chopped 'em off
I didn't like my tummy so I chopped it off, huh

Hands off my body
Hands off my body

I didn't like my dick so I chopped it off
I didn't like my pussy so I chopped it off
I hate my tits so I chopped 'em off
I didn't like my arse so I chopped it off

Hands off my body
Hands off my body

I didn't like my fat so I chopped it off
I didn't like my skinny so I chopped it off
I didn't like my heart so I chopped it off
It's all black and rotten so I chopped it off

Hands off my body
Hands off my body

I didn't like my tongue, I never did
It said nothing but anxious shit
I didn't like my tongue, I didn't like my tongue
I didn't like my tongue so I... AYE
