Descending through the bleeding skyline
All draped in angel white
United nations made of fallen men
come witness who we are
In times of human absolution
Deceiving chaos and confusion
It's time to wipe it clean

One chance to live
your choice to die
In a perfect state of denial
You destroy and defile
This is the end

We've watched you since the dawn of time
And with every moment gone by
A million suns fade and die
This is the end

Forever and a day we're watching
Exalted ancient halls
Rarely intervening but today
it's time to show you what you are

And for your wicked contribution
There can be only one solution
Now take your final bow

One chance to live
your choice to die
In a perfect state of denial
You destroy and defile
This is the end

We've watched you since the dawn of time
And with every moment gone by
A million suns fade and die
This is the end
