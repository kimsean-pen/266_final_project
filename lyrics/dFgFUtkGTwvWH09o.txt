Had a pretty little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad
Had a pretty little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got,
you can't lose some little girl that you ain't never had

Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad
Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got,
you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
Ain't that the truth boys (instrumental)
(Repeat 2)

Had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people ain't that bad
My own fault, people ain't that bad
Well you know you can't spend what you ain't got,
you can't lose some blues you ain't never had
(instrumental) Have mercy!

Sweet little home, got burned down, people ain't that bad
Yeah you know I had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people ain't that bad
Whoa you know you can't spend what you ain't got,
you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
