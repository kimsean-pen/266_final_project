I've seen you darling, seen you hanging round town
You in a short skirt, shining eyes of deep brown
You had a dirty look, you caught me on your hook
Turn up the thermostat, I want to see you sweat

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

I walked right over, said, "Hi, how ya doin'?"
You smiled at me and girl, you tore right through me
I said, come on let's dance, we've got to take our chance
You whispered in my ear, you wanna get out of here

Can you feel it? Rockin' the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhere-ness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no I tell you somethin'

You know I love ya, I just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat, hard to beat

Let's spend the night, spend the night together
Heart beating so fast, as you take my shirt off
This girl, I saw round town, well now she's going down
Stuck on a losing streak, I think you've turned it round

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

Read all about it, have you heard the latest?
Boy in a band dates a Hollywood actress
But baby, you and me, we came up from the street
No time to hesitate, we've got to push our weight

Can you feel it? Rocking the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhere-ness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no I tell you somethin'

You know I love ya, I just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat, hard to beat

Goodness
No, I've never known a night like this can't believe it
You're so hard to beat, hard to beat

Drive me crazy, my beautiful baby
Let's spend the whole day right here together
You know I love ya, I just wanna touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat, hard to beat
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
When I'm sitting at home sitting on the bus I'm thinking about us
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
