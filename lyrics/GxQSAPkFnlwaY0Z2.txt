Denim jean jacket, pink chucks
And a mini skirt
Be your bad habit
Throw me up against the wall first
I take advantage of you
You take advantage of me
Drink up this bottle of yeah
And paint your body on me

Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Tag me
Tag me
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it

Put your name on it put you put your name on it

Cotton candy, lollipop
Sticky like a post-it
You don't need to drum my heart
You already own it
I take advantage of you
You take advantage of me

Drink up this bottle of yeah
And paint your body on me

Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Tag me
Tag me
Put your name on it put you put your name on it

Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it

You treat me like concrete under your feet
I'll be your canvas incomplete
Your baby doll, your ally-wall
Heart in graffiti
Tag me
Tag me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me

Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me

Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Put your name on it put you put your name on it
Tag me
