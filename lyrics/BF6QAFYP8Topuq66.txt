you don't even have a hearing
but i tell you just in case anyway
if i leave this place and you are left here
always stay chimerical
it's not just the winters that cause frost
or gloomy blurry autumns that make you lost
my womb is not as gloomy as this bed
it's more like a tomb when you're on earth
the good ones make no child
you don't even have the force of seeing
but i show just in case anyway
without fantasy you'll go down the drain
always stay utopian
and i wish you hot summers of excess
and irrational springtime fondness
until then make my womb your favorite bed
i can't handle the thought that you'll get hurt
