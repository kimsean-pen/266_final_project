I don't wanna be in jail no more
Please don't put me in chains
I don't have the patience anymore
I can't stay in my lane

Then I saw you
And I said "throw away the keys"
Yeah, I saw you
And I said "throw away the keys"

Looking through the turquoise in your eyes
Walking on the matrix vein [?]
Why you gotta get your nail salon?
So profound and profane

Clawing out my escape
With so much decorativity [?]
Clawing out my escape
With so much decorativity [?]

Yeah, we'll keep swerving
Until you pull me over

I don't wanna be in jail no more
Please don't put me in chains
When I'm feeling down, so sad and hurt
It's so hard to behave

Then I saw you
And I said "throw away the keys"
Yeah, I saw you
And I said "throw away the keys"

Yeah, we'll keep swerving
Until you pull me over
