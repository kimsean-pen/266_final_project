Lights have faded - Euphoria is dead
Past and present - Exalt of the weird
Chimerias petrified - Eclipse and suspicion
Deafened stream - Babylon fell

Distraction and envy, Babylon fell
Festal perishing, Babylon fell

Dreams drift in the frozen wind
And mysteries are reborn
We rose from sand and stone
To follow the light's allure

Tears drift in the shadows sleep
Turn innocence into excess
Fragments of a dying world
And destiny lies beneath

Sceptres of bombast - Tracks into myth
Fetish and feud - Dance of recesses
Fierce laughter - Banned into stone
Eyes of guilt - Covered by sand
