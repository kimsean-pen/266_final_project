I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunlight and the shadows of her eyes
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I'd never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we had to spend
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answers to the easy way she opened every door to my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
