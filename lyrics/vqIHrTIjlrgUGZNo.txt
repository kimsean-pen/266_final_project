Hey, could you stand another drink
I'm better when I don't think,
seems to get me through
Say, do you wanna spin another line,
like we had a good time
Not that I need proof

Swell, we're living in a hotel someone's ringing my bell
In a room without a view
Hey, heard you read another book,
should I take another look
Who am I without you?
