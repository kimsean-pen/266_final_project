5 o'clock
I'm fallin' off
The early morning
Late night missin' you
Call your phone
(Call your phone)
But you talkin' slow
(Talkin' slow)
Your body yearns
(Body yearns)
On the low
(On the low)
Free your soul
(Free your soul)
But imma sit up & talk back
(Talk back)
Then I retry
(Retry)
Sittin' still
(Sittin' still)
To get to you
But it's me I was lookin' for
It's me I was lookin' for
But now that I can see
I can find you
Follow everything's right beside you
Now that I can breathe
I can sigh too
Swallow up the sins that hide you
Now that I can see
I can find you
Follow everything's right beside you
Now that I can breathe
I can sigh too
Swallow up the sins that hide you
(Hide you)
(Hide you)
On the edge where we [?]
My reflection & you play
Will you please meet to say
There's somethin' missin'
(Somethin' missin')
When I face this dark nightset
When you get wrapped up in my bed
I can see to see that there's somethin' missin'
(Somethin' missin')
Anywhere you go, I'll go too
When you fall, I'll fall on you
Just don't leave me to same
Cause you're always on my mind
Now that I can see
I can find you
Follow everything's right beside you
Now that I can breathe
I can sigh too
Swallow up the sins that hide you x6
