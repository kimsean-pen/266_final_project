I'm your life crashing pilot
board the most loving defect
guard down, enter absence:

what medicine could bring the end
to means drenched in abstinence?
I cannot accept cannot eject what I've let in
I grab the thorns and turn the world red
blood on my hands, your tired eyes stare

you should run far from here

every killer has their motives
I keep mine locked up in black boxes
all the keys dissolved in my gut with the rest that you'll never see

all I feel I've ignored to keep things safe for you
now all I feel I've explored
now nothings safe for you

so pure
so infantile
cut my hands clearing tears off your smile

goodbye, now we live
