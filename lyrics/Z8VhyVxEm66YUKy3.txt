The lights in the harbor
Well, they don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you?
How did I fail?
I'm like a lost ship
Always to sail

The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, how I wish I could sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, I wish you were mine again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
Sea of heartbreak
