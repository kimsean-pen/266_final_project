Paintings they fall
off the walls
when you come Traipsing in with your horse
Your six string guitar is a mess
silver bullets Hanging off your dress

Now I remember that I meant to be
to replace Your history
Who let that girl into this room
so innocent yet Doomed

Chorus:
Who shot the Poison Arrow

Here she comes,
yeh shes playing hard to get
There she goes
a promise you can never forget

Mirrors, they black out and freeze
when you pull Me in too too deep
Everytime I handcuff you
I know I come closer to The truth

Now I remember what I meant to say
to count All my blessings today
Who let that girl into this room
so innocent Yet doomed

Chorus:
Who shot the Poison Arrow

Here she comes,
yeh shes playing hard to get
There she goes
a promise you can never forget
