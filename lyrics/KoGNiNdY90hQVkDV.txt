All we want is to feel that feeling again
Just a drop of a lips and we're moving a quip
There are some things that gotta be quick, yeah
All we want is to feel that feeling again
We didn't reach a high that was always inside
And was coasted in the place it would hide

We're moving fear or we're moving desire
Now I know how you feel
I'm a pilgrim, you're trying to
All the lovers that loved before us
And pretend to see through
Where the body goes the mind follows soon after

Cause all we want is to know the vivid moment
Yeah, how we feel now is felt by the Ancients
Yeah, all we want is to know the vivid moment
Just surrender your limb to my every whim
Now where lovers, we got willing

We're moving fear or we're moving desire
Now I know how you feel
I'm a pilgrim, you're trying to
All the lovers that loved before us
And pretend to see through
Where the body goes the mind follows soon after
We can make it out, we can make it out of this
The other end of the thread

We're moving fear or we're moving desire
Now I know how you feel
I'm a pilgrim, you're trying to
All the lovers that loved before us
And pretend to see through
Where the body goes the mind follows soon after
