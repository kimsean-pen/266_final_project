The healing power of nothing always felt so wrong
Healing power was something we could both feed on
Nothing works anymore
Feels like it's run its course
Healing's not gonna take me

And I go "do do do, do do do do do do do"...

The day I met you, I knew you'd gonna break me up
The pinkest grapefruit you're squeezin' in my papercut
A thing to hang on your wall, just like a animal
Ten pounds of hair makes it heavy

And I go "do do do, do do do do do do do"...

This house is raining all the time
Your healing power of sunshine
Miss Yesterday is a friend of mine
You healed me with your sunshine
