Got me lyin' lyin' for your love
Got me lyin' lyin' for your love
Am I losing losing myself
When I'm lyin' lyin' for your love?

I was in chains, I was in fire
I was in deep, I was a liar
Dyin' dyin' for your love
I was insane, I was so blinded
Nothing remains, I didn't mind it
Lyin' lyin' for your love
For your love
(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)

In the silence, silence we drown
Sometimes violence, she makes no sound
Just a shadow in the darkness
In the darkness, device
In the silence, silence

I was in chains, I was in fire
I was in deep, I was a liar
Dyin' dyin' for your love
I was insane, I was so blinded
Nothing remains, I didn't mind it
Lyin' lyin' for your love
For your love
(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

I was in chains, I was in fire
I was in deep, I was a liar
Dyin' dyin' for your love, oh
I was insane, I was so blinded
Nothing remains, I didn't mind it
Lyin' lyin' for your love
For your love
(For your love)
(For your love)
(For your love)
