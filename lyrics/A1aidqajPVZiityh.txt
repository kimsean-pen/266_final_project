You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
You used to lift me up
Now you get me down

If I
Was to walk away
From you my love
Could I laugh again?
If I
Walk away from you
And leave my love

Could I laugh again?
Again, again...
You're killing me again
Am I still in your head?

You used to light me up
Now you shut me down
If I
Was to walk away
From you my love
Could I laugh again?

If I
Walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?

I'm losing you again
Like eating me inside
I used to lift you up
Now I get you down
Without your love
You're tearing me apart
With you close by
You're crushing me inside
Without your love
You're tearing me apart

Without your love

I'm dazed in madness
Can't lose this sadness
I can't lose this sadness
Can't lose this sadness
You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
Without your love
(you used to lift me up)
You're crushing me inside
(now you get me down)
With you close by
I'm dazed in madness
Can't lose this sadness
It's riping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why
It's riping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
It's tearing me apart
