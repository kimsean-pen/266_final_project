You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far too long 'cause I never gave up the fight
Until now
It's gonna hit you hard till you see stars
It's gonna put through you a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even but getting what you deserve
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one page I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be your just-for-fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is... DONE.
Done.

You crossed the line too many times
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite, don't be surprised when I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my
Mama always told me that I should play nice

She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one page I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be part of your fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is... DONE.
(Done) With your selfish ways
(Done) And all the games you play

I'm through with you and everything you say
(Fiddle Solo)
Mama told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice

Mama always told me that I should play nice
But she didn't know you when she gave me that advice

(I'm through) I'm through (With you) With you
You're one page I'd like to burn
Scatter in the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be your just-for-fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is... DONE.
All I wanna be is... DONE.
UGH!
Hey eh eh eh oh oh!
I wanna be done (So done)
So done (So done)
So done
