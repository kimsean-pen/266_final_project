check your pulse
its proof that you're not listening to
the call your life's been issuing you
the rhythm of a line of idle days

scared of the world outside you should go explore
pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
the great indoors

lamplight makes the shadows play
and posters take the walls away
the TV is your window pane
the view wont let you down

so put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

scared of the world outside you should go explore
pull all the shades and wander the great indoors

though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two

so go unlock the door
and find what you are here for
leave the great indoors
Please leave the great indoors

check your pulse
its proof that you're not listening to
the call your life's been issuing you
the rhythm of a line of idle days
