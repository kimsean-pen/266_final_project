In a serious way to start the day
I wake up in unknowing
I wonder what haunts this house
Woe is me
Depression in passionate phrase
The tiger in me is untamed
So hate me but don't go away
I wake up in pain

The connection is tenuous at best
And weighing on my chest
The best times have all come and gone (Come on, come on)
Tell me where I have gone wrong

Go back to a past life
I had you up all night
You like me right
Help me turn my systems on
Go back to a past life
And heal me with your light

In the way that I hold on to a feeling too long
I hold on to you and in song
I feel you growing tighter
I wonder if you're all but gone
I love you but I notice something wrong
The past is not only a place
I give you your time and your space
So you can have all to my name
I wake up in pain

There's times when I'm cold and I'm afraid
There's times when I can't stay
Help me back from where I've gone
Tell me where have I gone wrong

Go back to a past life
I had you up all night
You like me right
Help me turn my systems on
Go back to a past life
And heal me with your light
