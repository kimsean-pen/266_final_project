Call off the search
I've found her
I was in need of an angel
I don't need to look no further
Call off the search
Put down your torches
And hush your cries
I think I've found the one
To whet my appetite
And dry my weeping eyes
She's more than a woman
No less than a queen
She treats me like a man
If you know what I mean
She's there when I need her
And there when I don't
She don't ask me for nothing
But I give her anything she wants
(Anything)
I give her anything she wants
(Anything)
Anything
(Anything)
Oh I give her anything
Let the curtain fall, the show is over
Played my part, wore my mask
But I don't need it any longer
Let the highwayman come take my money
The clothes off my back
Cuz she don't love the things I have
She loves me for all that I'm not
And all that I am
She's more than a woman
No less than a queen
She treats me like a man
If you know what I mean
She's there when I need her
And there when I don't
She don't ask me for nothing but I give her anything she want
(Anything)
I give her anything she wants
(Anything)
Anything
(Anything)
Oh I give her anything
