It's hitting me bad
And you drove me crazy
It's 36 steps to the front door, baby
Step 29, gonna see what you done
But it's too late, too late
The chains are gonna come
You bought my love
You say you need my desire
You got a million dollars, but you still can't buy it
Step 29 in the interspeed, gone
But it's too late, too late
Change, you're gonna come
Love is blind, but now I see
I don't love you no more
I got 20/20

Got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning, hear my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning in my bottle
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number
Got your number, got your number, number, number
5-3-4, double 6-4-7

Don't need it anymore
I delete it and forget it
I got pictures of us, worth a thousand words
But can you see, see, I have a no any hurt?
A lot of people say that one's a lonely number
But I'm skipping to the beat, and I'm the only drummer
Floor to the floor, and I'm a perfect ten
I'm gonna shake it up, shake it up, shake it, shake it up
Love is blind, but now I see
I don't love you no more
I got 20/20

Got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning, hear my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning in my bottle
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number
Got your number, got your number, number, number
Don't want a ring, ring
Don't got a ring, ring
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
Don't want a ring, ring
Don't got a ring, ring
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
Don't want a ring, ring (got your number, I got your number)
Don't got a ring, ring
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
(Got your number, I got your number)
Got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning, hear my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaking from the spell I was under
See my lightning in my bottle
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number
Got all four exits and all four laws
From the north and the south, the east, and the west
I'm in 1-2-3-4 directions
There were 21 tears rolling down your cheeks
And I'mma get where I'm going on my own two feet
I got all four exits and talk is cheap
So baby?
Got your number
