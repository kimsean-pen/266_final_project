Suburbia, 1 am, you're walking home again
shopping bags and broken glass
I hate going through the underpass
I wish there was some other way around
but you got beaten up by the playground and it's no use
we'll have to go through the deserted shopping centre
pedestrian walkways I think they were meant to
make things better
but it's just emptier, and scary at nighttime.
Hatfield at that time.

This is the place I live
Where is everyone? Are we the only ones?
This is the place I live
And so does everyone, so does everyone.

Hatfield 1980
I'm seeing my first knife, my first ambulance ride
I hold your hand the whole way, crying.
Get home the next day, police have already been.
Well you can imagine the scene.

And if I'm going home, I better change my clothes,
I better change my clothes.
And if I'm going home, I better change my clothes,
I better change my clothes.

This is the place I live
where is everyone, are we the only ones?
This is the place I live
And so does everyone, so does everyone.

And when I'm looking back, I look for everyone
And when I fall down, I fall for anyone
When I'm looking back, I look for everyone
And when I fall down, I fall for anyone.
