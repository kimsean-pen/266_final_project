We're summoning spirits
Tearing the labels
Clearing than vodka
Don't bottle it up
Don't bottle it up

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (oh no no no no no no no no no)

You say it's your thing to be honest
Like it's kinda this token of pride
Well to be honest you're kind of a goddess
But being with you kinda kills me inside
You want me to explain it, well
It's sort of this look in your eye
Like you're cooking an egg
On the hood of your car
'Cause you looked at it hard
But my heart is the egg
And you're watching it fry
I'm not gonna cry
I'm not gonna lie
I am gonna cry
But not right here
Give me like a minute let me get up all my feelings while I pop my beer
Shit is getting muddy and I'm seeking out the buddy
At the bottom of the bottle
But it's not quite clear
What you expect from me
When you're disrespecting me?

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh shit)
Oh no (oh no no no no no no no no no)

Wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
Well, that's your prerogative sheesh
But if she wanna see what we got
When the saga repeats, nada, capisce
I'm not a complete wretch
I fetch
I sit a bit
But I'm not gonna stay
But if you wanna see me
You can see my feets
And my cute little cheeks
When I'm walking away

You can see me sitting on the dock in the bay
You can see me licking on my crotch like a stray
But if you're gonna see me like a prop in a play
Gotta say, I'll be skippin' what you got for the day
Maybe you'll be thinking that I'm hot in the head
Or sick of picking on my chicken pox in the bed
You can think what you like
I think I'll take a hike

Oh no (Oh no)
Oh shit (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh no)
Oh shit (Oh shit)
It's just one small complaint
I know I am not saint
Oh no (Oh no)
Oh shit (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh no)
Oh shit

I think we're old enough to know what we ain't
We're summoning spirits
(Spit it out, spit it out, spit that shit out)
Tearing the labels
(Get it off, get it off, get that shit off)
Clearer than vodka
(Sit 'em up, sit 'em up, put 'em down, put 'em down, put that shit down)

Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
(Another one)
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
(Another one, another, another one)
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
(Another one, another, another one)
(Another one, another one)
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
