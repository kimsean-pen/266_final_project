I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you

Can't you see my darlin'
That the harder I try
The more we grow apart
Please believe me

The sweeter the kiss
The colder turn your arms
And the colder turns your heart
And baby more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you

I've seen my heart my darling
The closer I get
The more you're out of love
Don't you feel it

The colder your touch
The more it turns me on
And the faster beats my heart
And baby more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And more I love you

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you
