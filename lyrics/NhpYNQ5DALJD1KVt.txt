I just want a lover like any other
What do I get?
I only want a friend who will stay to the end
What do I get?

What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?

I'm in distress, I need a caress
What do I get?
I'm not on the make, I just need a break
What do I get?

What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?

I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you things seem to turn out right
I wish, they'd only happen to me instead

What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?

I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you things seem to turn out right
I wish, they'd only happen to me instead

What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?

I just want a lover like any other
What do I get?
I only want a friend who will love to the end
What do I get?

What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?
What do I get?
Oh oh, what do I get?

Well, let me tell you now

(What do I get?)
(What do I get?)
(What do I get?)
I get no love
(What do I get?)
No sleep at nights

(What do I get?)
Nothing that's nice
(What do I get?)
Nothing at all
At all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
'Cause I don't get you
