Everytime we say goodbye
I feel like a fool
Baby, baby what can I do?

Everytime I close my eyes
I see you
Baby, baby, what do I have to do?

In your smile
Across the room
Baby, baby I feel good

Everytime you drive away
I know you won't be true
Baby, baby what can I do?

A part of me goes there with you
Heavy hearted and blue

In your arms, too late at night
Under the canopy of the stars

Everytime we say goodbye
I feel like a fool
Baby, baby what can we do?

Everytime I close my eyes
I see you
Baby, baby, what do I have to do?

There's no time to make it right
The balance tips towards the muse

Everytime we say goodbye
I feel like a fool
Baby, baby what can we do?

Everytime I close my eyes
My eyes, I see you
What do I have to do?

There's no time to make it right
My love goes towards the fool
