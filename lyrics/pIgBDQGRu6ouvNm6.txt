Always in the shower
Where everything matters up here
I don't know why
I'm looking out the window today
Why does it matter?
Why does it matter to you?
Why does it matter?
Why does it matter to you?
Always and forever
I'll bring flowers for you
Don't go inside
Or lose your mind
Woo!
La la la la la la
I know it's hard sometimes
I know it's hard sometimes
I know it's hard sometimes
Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
