Buried in the mail before the early morning
Under the frost that's forming, his words are calling
Even though alarm bells ring without a warning
All of the clocks keep ticking, and time keeps flowing

Everyone that I hold dearly
I try to keep 'em close
'Cause some of them get bitten by the rabbit down the hole
Once they walk past through the grass they're never coming home

Easy to label, yet so hard to nail
Maybe they've lost their way, but found their savior
Living in a fabled life's a fairytale
Except our thoughts are fragile, our minds are frail

And everyone that you hold dearly
You try to keep them close
'Cause some of them get bitten by the rabbit down the hole
And once you walk past through the grass you're never coming home

Good God, what have I done?
Mother nature's lonely son
Mother nature's lonely son
Chase that rabbit down the hole

Wander through the open door that leads to nowhere
Who's gonna
Take away my pain? Take away my pain?
Before you know you're trapped inside the spider's web
You're screaming
There is no escape! There is no escape!

The invitation's written clearly
You're the one he chose
Until the day you're bitten by the rabbit down the hole
Follow his procession deep into the ground below

Good God, what have I done?
Mother nature's lonely son
Mother nature's lonely son
Chase that rabbit down the hole

I'll drown or I will burn
Down the path of no return
Down the path of no return
Chase that rabbit down the hole

I never thought I'd see her suffer
I gave her all I could
And everything I had to offer
Was never understood
How many days until her mind has left the world for good?

Good God, what have I done?
Mother nature's lonely son
Mother nature's lonely son
Chase that rabbit down the hole

I'll drown or I will burn
Down the path of no return
Down the path of no return
Chase that rabbit down the hole

One of these days you'll break away
One of these days you'll break away
One of these days you'll break away
(Chase that rabbit down the hole)
One of these days you'll fade away
