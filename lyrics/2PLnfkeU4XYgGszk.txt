Aye, ayi, yeah
Aye, ayi, yeah

Tonight the summer heat is burning into me
Wah-oh-oh, wah-oh-oh
The rhythm of the beat will set my body free
Wah-oh-oh, wah-oh-oh
And everyone's moving, everyone's grooving
I wanna now tell you why

Oh wae oh, don't wanna hit the floor
Oh wae oh, will let you anymore
Oh wae oh, I saw the signs you knew
I just wanna dance, just wanna dance here with you

Aye, ayi, yeah, so dance, dance
Aye, ayi, yeah, come on dance with me, girl
Aye, ayi, yeah, so dance, dance
Aye, ayi, yeah, come on dance with me, girl

You see her over there, the girls are hey, hey
Wah-oh-oh, wah-oh-oh
But I don't even care, I'll only look your way
Wah-oh-oh, wah-oh-oh
And everyone's moving, everyone's grooving
I wanna now tell you why

Oh wae oh, don't wanna hit the floor
Oh wae oh, will let you anymore
Oh wae oh, I saw the signs you knew
I just wanna dance, just wanna dance here with you

Aye, ayi, yeah, so dance, dance
Aye, ayi, yeah, come and dance with me, girl
Aye, ayi, yeah, so dance, dance
Aye, ayi, yeah, come on dance with me, girl

Gozando, disfrutando, lo dicho estar contigo

Mirala, ella no es timida bailandoa mi lado viva la vida

And everyone's moving, everyone's grooving
