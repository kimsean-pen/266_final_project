I spun out of control
But I'm gonna make it better
I'm gonna ask for help
And I'll get it when I need it
Felt like I was stuck in a hole
I thought it wouldn't last forever
The calendar crumbled
I was washed like old graffiti
I know you won't believe me

But it's true
When I had nothing to do
I spent a weekend in my bed
One week could turn into two

I can't keep crying anymore
Pick myself up off the floor
You've heard it all before
I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me
If I [?]
I lost myself but I found more
I know you've heard it all before
I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me

If I told you so
I got to just let it go
Too much time spent all alone
Watching history repeating
Since I been out on my own
I learnt there's no place like home
So better be humble
Now I practice what I'm preaching
I know you won't believe me

But it's true

I can't keep crying anymore
Pick myself up off the floor
You've heard it all before
I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me
If I [?]
I lost myself but I found more
I know you've heard it all before
I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me

I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me
I know you won't believe me
I know
