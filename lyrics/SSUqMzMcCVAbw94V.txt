There is a stillness
to the thrashing of despair
there is a calm
in the rush of your stare
and I'm now beyond care
experience been gained
and we're back to back

and strain to strain
there is a stillness
breathes in you and me
music calls without answer
where the darkness lies heavy
and the beast has no master
and the spirit no name
and the angels are hushing
and they dance in soft shame

this hysterical house
could collapse in the night
and the hinges will buckle
liars choke on their spite
but the darkness has a hunger
it offers you
blood for wild blood

and you're beyond wondering
why you're still not good enough
there is a glory
in the pitch of your desire
and a calm in my gaze
as my fear retires
our pulses exchange
we are face to face
finally higher

and wire to wire
wahh oh
wire to wire
wire to wire

signal to satellite
bullet to beast
frequency is higher
wire
a bottomless illusion
and for whose blood?
to which new fever do we go?
wire to wire
