I know I'm being irrational
Right now a little bit flamable
So you better watch
Watch out

I know I'm dressing so casual
In my bed laying diagonal
Cause I'm all alone now
Right now

In three words
My heart hurts
So why do I feel it in my whole body?
All over
It's the worst
Feeling down has just become a hobby

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet, right to your face
But when you leave just let me cry
Get it all out baby

I'll be alright just gotta play
Alanis all night and thoughout the day

I'll pick myself up but not today
Today I am a mess just let me cry
Get it all out baby

Boy you're not even emotional
Out of every night, uncontrollable
How do you do it?
How?

Why are you post everything you do?
Is it cause you want me to know that you
You doing better
Better than me

In three words
My heart hurts
So why do I feel it in my whole body?
All over
It's the worst
Feeling down has just become a hobby

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet, right to your face
But when you leave just let me cry
Get it all out baby

I'll be alright just gotta play
Alanis all night and thoughout the day

I'll pick myself up but not today
Today I am a mess just let me cry
Get it all out baby

All night

Just let me kick, let me scream
Just let me kick, let me scream in my pillow
Just let me get, get you out (let me get you out)
Just let me get, get you out of my system

I'll stand on my feet, but not today
I'll hit delete, throw it all away
I'll be so sweet, right to your face
But when you leave just let me cry
Get it all out baby

I'll be alright just gotta play
Alanis all night and thoughout the day

I'll pick myself up but not today
Today I am a mess just let me cry
Get it all out baby
