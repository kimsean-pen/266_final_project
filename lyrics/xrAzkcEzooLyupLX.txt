Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Dream I'm in the saltwater

Timing's gone all bad
Broken faith and a broken way
You couldn't lose me if you tried
'Cos I'll be rollin' to your side, baby

Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Broken faith and a broken way

You couldn't lose me if you tried
