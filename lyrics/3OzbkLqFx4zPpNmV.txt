The days have turned away from me
The lights no longer shine on my head
And people turn away from me
No more do they look to me with respect
Well, i know now
It was the first time
That was fun
Now from life i've resigned
When i feel i've got problems
How wrong i am
I'm awaiting life as another man
Don't crowd me
There's riddles in the shadows
They're thrown the way that i'd expect
And people never seem to know
What they least suspect is coming next
Well it seems like my time's elapsed
And i've stabbed life in the back
I'm searching for what it means
To never be anything, anything
And i know now
It's the first time that was fun
Now from life i've resigned
When i feel i've got problems
How wrong i am
I'm awaiting life as another man
