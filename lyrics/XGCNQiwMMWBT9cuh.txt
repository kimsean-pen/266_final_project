Get up out my face

Stay inside your lane
She said I'd die for you (oh no, oh no)

I remember, last December
None of these bitches was fucking with me
Now I'm the center
Shit getting better
Every last one of them fucking for free
I never met her
But I got cheddar
You won't believe what she been telling me
Shawty gon' front front like she been feeling me
Shit they been talking, has been killing me

Like
Baby don't play no games
We don't hang like that (like-)
Tell me what is you saying
With my name like that (like-)
Said I'm not in your lane
How you change like that? (like-)
If I lose all this fame
We gon' change right back (right)

These hoes came so quick
Ain't on shit, these hoes just ain't on shit
If I shoot my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I swear ain't gon' brick
But you can't get in my head (oh no)
You can't get in my bed (no no)
Know you heard what I said (I know, hoe)
Know you heard what I said

I ain't got the time for you (oh no, oh no)
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you (oh no, oh no)
Bitch I'm getting paid
She said "I'd ride for you" (no no, no no)
Stay inside your lane
She said I'd die for you (oh no, oh no)
Baby, I'm okay

I ain't got the time for you (oh no, oh no)
Get up out my face
I ain't got a dime for you (oh no, oh no)
Bitch I'm getting paid
She said "I'd ride for you" (no no, no no)
Stay inside your lane
She said I'd die for you (yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Baby, I'm okay, I'm okay
