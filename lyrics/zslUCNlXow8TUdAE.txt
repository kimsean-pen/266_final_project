Can you patch my jeans Peggy Ann
Just a little stitch to mend the hole
He has torn if you can
Maybe I got too set in my ways

He says she reminds him of me
When we first met
In those early days

The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come
Between Rebecca's

Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn

With the gales my little boat was tossed
How was I to know that you'd sent her
With a lantern
To bring me in
"Are you positive this is a friend?"
The captain grimaced,

"Those are cliffs of rock ahead if I'm not mistaken"

The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come
Between Rebecca's
Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped

The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come
Between Rebecca's
Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
