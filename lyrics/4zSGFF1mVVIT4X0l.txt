You are drunk and you are surely
In Latino lover mode
We all know what's on your agenda
We've broken the code
I've got no right to lay claim to her frame
She's not my possession
You cunt
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Octoped you've got six hands too many
And you can't keep them to yourself
You're too fat and too old to marry
So they left you on the shelf
I've got no right to lay claim to her frame
But you soiled my obsession
You cunt
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Ow!
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
Get your hands off my woman, motherfucker
