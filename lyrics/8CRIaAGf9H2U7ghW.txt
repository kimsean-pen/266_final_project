I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me

This straight jacket chokes me of addiction
This tightrope is swaying in the wind
And it's a long way down
No way out of this so I
Oh, it's a long way down
When the tension gives out
Cause that's when I snap
And that's how I'm feeling now

Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me

This dissonant blurs the line to fuck with my symmetry
I'm one twisted butterfly
Will never be quite good enough
And I'm holding on so I don't come undone
But I feel like giving up

Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me

All eyes on me
But that's not reality
Cause my mind plays tricks on me
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
Crawling up the walls
Caving as they are caving in
Claustrophobic in my own skin
From holding it all in

Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Woah I, I think I'd rather be
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
