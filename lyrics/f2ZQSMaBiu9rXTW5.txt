A thousand faces
A thousand places
And a hundred cases
Forcing me to break
My mind is racing
I keep on chasing
All these dreams
That will never end
But here we are
Still fighting
Creating
Circles and squares
And here we are
Still writing
Rewriting
The story that never ends
And here we are
Still writing
Rewriting
The story that never ends
