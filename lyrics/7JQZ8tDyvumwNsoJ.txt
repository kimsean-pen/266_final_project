In the grace of your love I writhe in pain
In 666 ways I love you and I hope you feel the same
I'm for you
I'm for you
I'm killing myself for your love and again all is lost
In 777 ways I love you 'til my death do us part
I'm for you - and I'm dying for your love
I'm for you - and my heaven is wherever you are
I'm for you - and I'm dying for your love
I'm for you - and my heaven is wherever you are
(Repeat)
In 666 ways I love you and my heaven is wherever you are
I'm here for you - I am here for you
I'm here for you - I am here for you
I'm here for you - I am here for you
I'm here for you - I am here for you
