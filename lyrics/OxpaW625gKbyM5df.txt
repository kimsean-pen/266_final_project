If pain was a color to paint on you
Your heart would be the color blue
Be a painting, hung up there 'til your body met your head
Which were made of silver

You are the one they call Jesus Christ
Who didn't know no rock and roll
Just a mission made of guns that they give boys in Vietnam
But they always told him

There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all

So
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

They said
Every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the policemen don't understand

Oh, you boys, all you boys
Think you're so American
Girls, all you girls
They're so American

He may not be born of this land
But he was born of this world
He was born of all the mothers
And the colors of our brothers
And the love that we sent him

You are the one they call Jesus Christ
You may not know no rock and roll
There may not be a heaven or a place in which to send you
But you know in the end

There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all

So
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

They say
Every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the policemen don't understand

Boys, all you boys
Think you're so American
Girls, all you girls
Yeah, you're so American

There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all

Man, oh, man
Think you're so American
Man, oh, man
Yeah, you're so American

Man, oh, man
You think you're so American
Man, oh, man
Yeah, you're so American

There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first and took them all
