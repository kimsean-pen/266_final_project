We remember, no surrender
Heroes of our century

3 men stood strong, and they held out for long
Going into the fight, to their death that awaits
Crazy or brave, will it end in the grave?
As they're giving their lives
As their honor dictates

Far, far from home, to a war
Fought on foreign soil and
Far, far from known, tell their tale,
Their forgotten story
Cobras fumantes, eterna é sua vitória.

Rise from the blood of your heroes
You, were the ones who refused to surrender
The 3, rather died than to flee,
Know that your memory,
Will be sung for a century

3 took the blow, while impressing their foe
Throwing dice, with their lives
As they're paying the price
Sent to raise hell, hear the toll of the bell
It is calling for you as the Wehrmacht devised

Sent over seas to be cast into fire
Fought for a purpose with pride and desire
Blood of the brave they would give to inspire
Cobras fumantes, your memory lives!
