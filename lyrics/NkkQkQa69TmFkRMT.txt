Every time you look at me
It seems like you see straight through me
I don't know what to say
So I turn away

Every time you turn me down
I tell myself it's the last time
That I wait for a change
Cause you always turn away

I want to stay in your arms
But you just try to escape
I want to give you my love
But you act just like you want to run away

I have tried to tell myself
That it might be all in my head
But time and again
You keep turning away

You're standing right in front of me
I try to touch but I can't reach
I hold you in my arms
But we're still worlds apart

I want to stay in your arms
And you kind of want to escape
I want to give you my love
And you kind of just want to run away

Some places are not meant for staying in
I wish that I could give myself away
I want to stay but I've got to run away

There are things in my head that I can't say
There are things in my head that I never would say
