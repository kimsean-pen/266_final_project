We're numbers in the dark
Numbers I'm trying to forget
I'm following sparks
I'm following your silhouette
We all want more
So who am I to judge
I feel that my heart is locked
Heart is locked

Falling into Vertigo
Let's take it slow
Falling into Vertigo
Let's do it slow

I'm alone but I'm with you
You know that I'm never satisfied
I'm tired of the rules
I'm tired of the words that I write
We all want more
But do you know what you really want?
I feel that my heart is lost
Heart is lost

We're falling into Vertigo
Let's take it slow
Falling into Vertigo
Let's do it slow

We're falling into Vertigo
We're falling into Vertigo

And maybe we can spin forever after all
And maybe I can find a way and try to break our fall
We're spinning round and round and round and round again
We're spinning round and round and round again

We're falling into Vertigo
Let's take it slow
Falling into Vertigo
Let's do it slow

Falling, falling, falling
Into Vertigo
Into Vertigo
