Well fortune favors not the young
Spoken words and songs unsung
Right?

I never learn from my mistakes
I guess I don't have what it takes
Right?

I wish that I was strong
That I could walk away

All this time I've lost
I feel the cost we paid

So save today
The secrets that you prayed for
And wait
'Cause we deserve it so much more

So save
The secrets that you prayed for
Awake
I'll see you on the other side

A tortured soul have I become
It keeps me safe and leaves me numb
Right?

Cause in this dream I'm wide awake
The one I love I did forsake
Right?

I wish that I was wrong
That you'll come home again

All this time I've lost
I'll never find again

So save today
The secrets that you prayed for
And wait
'Cause we deserve it so much more

So save
The secrets that you prayed for
Awake
I'll see you on the other side

Say you can help me now
Say you can help me now
Say you can help me now
Say you can help me now

So save today
The secrets that you prayed for
And wait
'Cause we deserve it so much more

So save
The secrets that you prayed for
Awake
I'll see you on the other side

So save today
The secrets that you prayed for
And wait
'Cause we deserve it so much more

So save
The secrets that you prayed for
Awake
I'll see you on the other side...
