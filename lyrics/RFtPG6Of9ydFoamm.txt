It's hard to know in a generation
Though it sounds
Hard to hear what you're trying to say when
Words are far too loud

I don't like that sound
Can't stop but nothing changes

You don't even say
I don't even talk about it
You don't really say
I don't even talk about it
You don't really say
I don't even talk about it
You don't really say
I don't even talk about it, no

It's hard to move in a generation
Though it sounds
Hard to hear what you're trying to say when
Words are far too loud

I don't like that sound
Can't try but nothing changes

You don't really seem to care and
I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care and
I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care and
I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care and
I don't even talk about it, no

You're falling, you're gone...

You don't really seem to care and
I don't even talk about it... now
