My mind go bust when I think of you
My body stumbling down the avenue
I get so wet when I look at you
Your face in my mind down the avenue

Can't work
Can't eat
Can't sleep at night
I've been living in a daze like I'm on a high
My friends be worried said I've lost my mind
And they're probably right
But I don't care about that

Take me out tonight
We'll go
Chase the morning light

I wanna know how you feel
I wanna know how you feel
Oh

On ecstasy and weed
I can give you what you need
If you just let me
If you just let me
Oh

When I sober up
We'll have a moment of clarity
I know it won't be you and me
Oh

So I'mma hide my feelings
Won't show you how I feel
Won't show you how I feel
Oh

Good thing you look at me that way
Started thinking it might be a chance yeah
We'll elope run off and get married

I'm drunk on your love

We'll get a house in the country
Have kids and live 'til a hundred
Then fall asleep in your arms yeah

I'm drunk on your love

Take me out tonight
We'll go
Chase the morning light

I wanna know how you feel
I wanna know how you feel oh

On ecstasy and weed
I can give what you need
If you just let me
If you just let me

When I sober up
We'll have a moment of clarity
I know it won't be you and me oh

So I'mma hide my feelings
Won't show you how I feel
Won't show you how I feel
Oh
