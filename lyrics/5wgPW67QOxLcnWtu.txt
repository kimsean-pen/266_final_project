What you gonna do when the last show is over?
What you gonna do when you can't touch base?
And what you gonna do when the applause's all over?
And you can't turn your back on what you face

And who you gonna be when the lights are all fading?
And who you gonna be when the band comes off?
And who you gonna be when your heart is still aching?
And you can't shrug it off with just a laugh

Encore, encore
The last song is over
More, more
The crowd's on its feet
Sure, sure
Adulation is so pleasing
Encore, encore
And what you gonna say to the last person leaving?
What you gonna say when that light is turned off?
What you gonna do if you stop believing
That you can't seem to find what might been lost?

And how you gonna feel if friends follow fortune?
How you gonna feel if the music dies?
How you gonna live with the soul sadly sighing
Into the wind that is our life

Encore, encore
The last song is over
More, more
The crowd's on its feet
Sure, sure
That adulation is so pleasing
Encore, encore
