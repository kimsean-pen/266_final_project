We may not have all the answers
Oh... I know that we can change
some of the things that are beyond our control
And the vision of us may be blurry
But use your heart to see
Just follow the beat, the rhythm will lead you right back to me
Sometimes its a game of give and take
Its easy to break but hold on and wait

Have a little faith
I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall

Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
Love love love, casualty, love
Love love love, casualty, love
Love love love love casualty

A casualty of love
The battle of us will be simple
Escape without being hurt
Cuz' love is our shield,

keeps us concealed
From what could get even worse
So baby let me be your soldier
Don't be overtaken by pride

Just close your eyes, take my hand
Promise to keep us alive
Sometimes its a game of give and take

Its easy to break but hold on and wait
Have a little faith
I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when

you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
All is fair in love and war
Knock me down and I'll get back up wanting more

Through the fire and rain
it makes me numb from the pain
That's the price, that's the price, I'll pay
I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find
you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll - I'll stand up tall and baby if I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
Love love love love
Love love love love
Love love love love
I'll be your casualty (casualty, casualty, casualty...)
Casualty of love
A casualty of love
a casualty of love
a casualty of love...
