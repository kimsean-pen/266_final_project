In a purple robe
Throne of needles
Sailing to the sun
Reaching higher
Sleeping on a bed
Of broken bottles
Passing night and day
Wasting hours

Rings on the water caressing your hair
Touch of a mother so gently aware
Let the journey entice you to stay
Draped in water seduced to immerse

Lying on the grass
By the river
Captured by the moon
Barely breathing
Dreaming while awake
Moving slowly
Waiting for a change
Never coming

Can you see the danger within my eyes
Everyone's a stranger wearing disguise

Rings on the water caressing your hair
Touch of a mother so gently aware
Let the journey allure you to stay
Draped in water seduce you to immerse
