In the folds of mythology
Never died, never born
Demented god, a monstrosity
Oh, you block the sun

Octopus, the point of no return
You're the hunger, the one
There you wait, for moon and man to fall
From the wall of the world

Guardian of Nyx
Epic in the abyss
At the Earthfall
There's a mountain of skulls
You swallow the Earth
Astorolus
Astorolus

Guardian of Nyx
Epic in the abyss
At the Earthfall
There's a mountain of skulls
You swallow the Earth
Astorolus
Astorolus

Spearhead, beak and tusk
Your arms, like silver in dusk
Into the depths we are thrust
Astorolus
Astorolus
You will swallow us
Great octopus.
