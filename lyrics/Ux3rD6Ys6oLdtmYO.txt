Open your eyes
To the millions of lies
That they tell you every day

Open your mind
To the clever disguise
That the advertisements say

How do they know
What's good for you?

Wake up, wake up, whoa-oh
Wake up, wake up, whoa-ooh
A shot to the head
They're better off dead
Will you wake up, wake up, whoa-oh

Destroy all the land
And kill what you can
Just to make the profits rise

They sell you from birth
For all that you're worth
The money spreads like lies

And how do they know
What's good for you?

Wake up, wake up, whoa-oh
Wake up, wake up, whoa-ooh
A shot to the head
They're better off dead
Will you wake up, wake up, whoa-oh

Don't wanna hate you
Don't wanna blame it all on you
I'm out of options
If you don't look I'll force you to
If you don't look I'll force you to
If you don't look I'll force you to

Wake up, wake up, whoa-oh
Wake up, wake up, whoa-ooh
A shot to the head
Just so you can be fed
Will you wake up, wake up, whoa-oh

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
