And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death
Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow,
A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing

Stare into my Kodak Rome
Jackhammer ice eyes
I never thought you'd see the asphalt
Crack, crack, crack like a black eggshell

Don't ever say I never warned you from the start
Don't ever say I never warned you from the start
You're not a shovel and I'm not your dirt

Is there any way to unswallow my pride
Can I fuck myself down?
Why die, when you can kill the father?
Dad is missing an 'e'

No Macbeth confessed Oedipus no longer present tense
No Macbeth confessed Oedipus no longer present tense

No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no
No reason

High and overneath
High and overneath

I won't regret letting you live even if you forgot what you never saved me from
So I say whatever or for never

For, for, for, for, fallen for never
For, for, for, for, fallen for never
For, for, for, for, fallen for never
Whatever

The Rape of Persephone was choreographed by all the wrong Greeks
The Rape of Persephone was a marketing scheme
Rape rape rape per so phony
Rape rape rape per so phony
Rape rape rape per so phony
Rape rape rape per so phony

High and overneath
High and overneath

Overneath, overneath, overblown, unbeloved
Cannot be low
From the top of my lungs to the bottom of my heart I scream
at the chasm in between and the path of misery

Overneath, overneath, overblown, unbeloved
Cannot be low
From the top of my lungs to the bottom of my heart I scream
at the chasm in between and the path of misery

High and overneath
High and overneath

No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no, no reason
No, no, no, no
No reason
