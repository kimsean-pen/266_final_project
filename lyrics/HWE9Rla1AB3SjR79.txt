I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissin' not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was gon' die
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana

(And I'm gonna tell everybody)
'Cause you cheated (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
And mistreated (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
I don't need you (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
So ya leavin' (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
I don't need it (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
Don't believe it (and I'm gonna tell everybody)
Ya deceived me (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)

Damn

Sittin' up in my room
I'm lighting candles
Handlin' my handle thinking why
How could I let this situation get the best of me?
When I gave the best of me
It's just crazy how one minute we connect
I was baby, ya lady sweet sadie
Holdin' hands was your favorite
Now I, I ain't got no sad song to sing
You's dead wrong to me, 'cause I was so committed but
Since we separated, I knew you would never find
Find another chick like me that's why I stay up on ya mind
I know it's hard for you to hear, but I ain't got the time
I moved on, I moved on, I don't want you now

I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissin' not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was gon' die
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana

(And I'm gonna tell everybody)
'Cause you cheated (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
And mistreated (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
I don't need you (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
So ya leavin' (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
I don't need it (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
Don't believe it (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)
Ya deceived me (and I'm gonna tell everybody now)

I ain't trippin' I'm just saying
Look at what'cha missin' out on now
Yep it's all out now, I'm goin' all out now
And I ain't gon' cry about it
Grab my keys to that Bentley GT
Call all my girlfriends and ride

You ain't got nothin' on me (Christina's goin' out to party)
You ain't got nothin' on me
You ain't got nothin' on me
Really this thing ain't nothin'

You ain't got nothin' on me (run and go tell everybody)
You ain't got nothin' on me
You ain't got nothin' on me, really this thing ain't nothin'

I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissin' not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was gon' die
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana

I don't wanna say I still loved you
It hurts me everyday thinkin' about
Who you were kissin' not me
Oh nana nana nana (not me)
Oh nana nana nana
I'mma speak the truth
I ain't gon' lie
I let you go with all the tears I cried
Thought we was gon' die
Oh nana nana nana
Oh nana nana nana
