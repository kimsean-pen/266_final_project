And the caravan is on its way
I can hear the merry gypsy play
Mama, mama look at Emma Rose
She's a-playin' with the radio
La, la, la, la...

And the caravan has all my friends
It will stay with me until the end
Gypsy Robin and sweet Emma Rose
Tell me everything I need to know
La, la, la, la...

Turn up your radio and let a-me hear the song
Switch on your electric light
Then we can get down to what is really wrong
I long to hold you tight so I can feel you

Sweet lady of the night I shall reveal you
If you want
Turn it up, turn it up, little bit higher, radio
Turn it up, burn it up, so you know, radio
La, la, la, la...

And the caravan is painted red and white
That means ev'rybody's staying overnight
Yeah, the barefoot gypsy player
'Round the campfire sing and play
And the woman tells us of her ways
La, la, la, la...

Turn up your radio and let-a me hear the song
Switch on your electric light
Then we can get down to what is really wrong
I long just to hold you tight so baby I can feel you

Sweet lady of the night I shall reveal you
If you want
Turn it up, turn it up, little bit higher, radio
Turn it up, that's enough, so you know it's got soul
Radio, radio turn it up, hmm

La, la, la, la...
(La) la, la, la...
(La) La, la, la...
(La) la, la, la...

(La) la, la, la...
(La) la, la, la...
(La) la, la, la...
(La) la, la, la...
