I heard the song, it was all around
Everyone's quitting, everyone's breaking down
I called your house on the telephone
Nobody answered, but I know you're home

All in all, it's nature's poetry
I can't understand the way it flows
I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low
No, I don't wanna know

I pushed a button just to find my way
I got directions but I'm still lost today
I see her smiling, but her eyes were dead
Nobody's crying, that's what paper said

All in all, it's nature's poetry
I can't understand the way it goes
I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low
No, I don't wanna know

All in all, it's nature's poetry
Can't understand the way it flows
So I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low
No, I don't wanna know

No, I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
Cuz everything I know makes me feel so low
No, I don't wanna know
