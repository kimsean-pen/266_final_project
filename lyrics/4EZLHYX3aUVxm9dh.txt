You're a smart blonde with the eyes of a panther
With your cosmic skin and a celestial dancer
You should know this by now
Your energy is loud
I'll be nukkun ya drekkly (see you soon)
When I see you in the crowd

Kulila miranyi (listen, can you hear it?)
Kulila mira-warninyi (listen, they shout with pride)
Mickey, look up from the paranoid place
We're spinning in 'n' outer space
Anangu to Istanbul

Millennial Monroe
Decorate the world with your love
Millennial Monroe
Ya got it, babe, you're more than enough
We're not gonna live
We're not gonna live forever
Happy 2000 and whatever (Forever)
Happy 2000 and whatever, whatever (Forever)
Happy 2000 and whatever

You're the beauty of lunar-lit feathers
Like an opal with eight billion edges
You should know this by now
Your spirit is aglow
I'll be nukkun ya drekkly (see you soon)
When I see you at our show

Kulila miranyi (listen, can you hear it?)
Kulila mira-warninyi (listen, they shout with pride)
Mickey, look up from the paranoid place
We're spinning in 'n' outer space
Anangu to Istanbul
Millennial Monroe
Decorate the world with your love
Millennial Monroe
Ya got it, babe, you're more than enough
We're not gonna live
We're not gonna live forever
Happy 2000 and whatever (Forever)
Happy 2000 and whatever, whatever (Forever)
Happy 2000 and whatever

We're not gonna live
We're not gonna live forever
(We're not gonna live forever)
Happy 2000 and whatever
