Awakening

I'll end my journey here
Because time and tide it waits for no man
There's something strange in me
I see the things that should not be
It's all a mindless game
Trapped inside the walls I built
Try to pull them down
But something stops me

Then the feeling comes alive
I can't hold it any more
Enemy... Is it you

End of the line, walking alone
In this world of my own
Demons of guilt, battle to win
This is my awakening

There's no turning back
There's nothing to awaken me
Insanity my friend
I can feel your gripping hand
To roam the earth alive
But feel as if you're dead and dreaming
Try to break away, but nothing helps me
