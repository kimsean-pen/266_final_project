Maybe I'm a bad scene
Blame it on the TV
And maybe it was just because my grandma raised me
Tell me what all this is
Yeah tell me what honest is
You need a body cast for all my broken promises

Told you not to hold your breath
You're turning blue the way I make you

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

I'm not a basic dude
But I'm just a waste of you
I know its hard to face the music that I play to you
Like I'm dropping a bomb
Go cry to your momma
Life is such a comedy so just spare me the drama

Told you not to hold your breath
You're turning blue the way I make you

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

And don't come crying over spilt perfume
It smells like shit to you
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Say you're dying that's a typical you
I've got nothing to prove
Told you not to hold your breath
You're turning blue the way I make you

Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
I'm making you
Sweat
