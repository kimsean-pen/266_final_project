sorry I walked away when you told me what you were scared of the night that you turned 12
trying not to cry in front of your older brother
he knows where I live, he's not interested
I can't have nice things,
like a boy who stays who stays around
when I needed him the most on your walk
hold your head up high and when you watch me fall
please look back for the last time
