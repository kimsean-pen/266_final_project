Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can.
I just got my head down,
And I'm a little bit scared tonight.
I need to run just far enough,
So I can smile again, smile again,
So I can smile again.
Take me by the hand,
Take me by the hand.
But don't you get too close now,
'cause I'm a little bit scared of life.
I need someone to try and bring,
Me back to innocence, innocence,
Me back to innocence.

Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
'cause I'm a little bit scared,
I'm a little bit scared tonight.

Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can,
A stranger walks beside you,
And we're just lovers for the night.
And when the sun comes up you wake and just
And leave it there, leave it there,
Yeah we can leave it there.
Take me by the hand,
Take me by the hand,
But please don't want to know me,
'cause I'm a little bit scared of life.
And from the bull is all you need
To know, so play pretend, play pretend,
Oh won't you play pretend?

Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can.
Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can.

Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Heads up, show down,
Come home with me.
Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can.
Catch me if you can,
Catch me if you can.
I' a little bit scared,
I'm a little bit scared tonight.
