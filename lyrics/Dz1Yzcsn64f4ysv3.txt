Ten and two, she lies awake,
The moon lights up her room like day,
Another night she spends alone,
Without his touch, her skin so cold.

The blood that's running through her veins,
With every beat there's no escape,
Lost in everything she trust,
Still can't seem to get enough.

Even though the world she loves,
It won't ever be the way it was,
And his heart of stone left hers breaking.

Every night she cries and dies a little more each time,
Say you love me (you love me),
Nothing left inside,
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.

Memories they take her back,
Every moment fades to black,
Every kiss and every taste,
She wishes time would ease the pain.

Even though the world she loves,
It wont ever be the way it was,
And her heart is weak, her hands are shaking.

Every night she cries,
And dies a little more each time,
Say you love me (you love me),
Nothing left inside,
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.

And every night she cries.

I don't know if I'll ever make this right,
Cause I am just so broken by the bitterness of loneliness,
And I'm so scared of this.
I don't know if ill ever make this right,
Cause I am just so broken by the bitterness of loneliness,
And I'm so scared.

Even though the world she loves,
It won't ever be the way it was,
And his heart of stone left hers breaking.every night she cries,
And dies a little more each time,
Say you love me (you love me),
Nothing left inside,
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.

(Every night she cries,
Every night she cries,
The silence will set her free)
