How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes it is
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my
life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did seems I'd done them before
But you brighten up all of my days
With you sweet love in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you
I want to stop and thank you

How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes it is
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed somebody to tell my ups and downs
And there you were
Your sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop and thank you
I want to stop and thank you

How sweet it is to be loved
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed somebody to tell my ups and downs
And there you were
Your sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I wanna stop and thank you

How sweet it is to be loved
How sweet it is to be loved by you

How sweet it is to be loved
How sweet it is to be loved by you.
