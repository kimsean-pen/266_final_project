They have unleashed the bloody flock
Fierce, black hounds are getting mad
I hear the beast behind my back
And stench comes from its maw
The baying of berserks with each right paw upraised
They're painted red in blood

The march of curs to trample their own truth
To chase all crows of white
No breath for those who dare to disagree
One path, one past, one trust

Loyal dogs, unfailing tool
They do what they have been trained to
With the eidolons the minds are full
The evil ghosts of old
The evil ghosts of old
Insanity turns back at last
As soon as their food is done
And dog will raven dog
The claws crush bones
The claws crush bones
Claws crush bones
Claws crush bones
Claws crush bones
Claws crush bones

The one who disobeys
He learns a cruel lesson of bones and stones
Your dissidence objected
And it's a basic skill to earn

Sit, stay, roll over
Sit, stay, roll over
Sit, stay, roll over
Sit, stay

The march of curs to trample their own truth
To chase all crows of white
No breath for those who dare to disagree
One path, one past, one trust

One path
One past
One trust
One path
One past
One trust
One path
One past
One trust

It's no one's path
It's no one's past
It's no one's trust
It's not my path
It's not my past
It's not my trust

Devouring meat of those
Right paws upraised
The flock has gone
They fressed themselves
Devouring meat of those
Right paws upraised
The flock has gone
They fressed themselves
They fressed themselves
They fressed themselves
