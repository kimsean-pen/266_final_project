I'm a hanging happy sock tonight
My hotel's on the Katong Line
Can't focus an in vitro mind
If only I could think but the belt's too tight

Can't reach a cotton ball to dry
The little teardrop underneath my right eye
I can use my Louis Vuitton tie!
If only I could think but the belt's too tight

I'm peaceful 'cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites. 'Cause I'm the man to be

I couldn't get a hold of my big sister when I tried
To call her just to tell her that I missed her
I called and cried to room service instead
I'm driking Malin+Goetz under the bed

I can't move. I can't talk
I can't sleep. I can't walk
I can't move. I can't talk
I can't sleep. I can't walk

Can't leave me up a crick all night
Erin Brockovich is not my wife
I'm such a baby I could totally cry
My hands are so sticky and the belt's too tight

I'm peaceful 'cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites. 'Cause I'm the man to be

I'm peaceful 'cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites. 'Cause I'm the man to be

I'll be the one in the lobby in the collared
Fuck me shirt. The green one
I'll be the one in the lobby in the green collared
Fuck me shirt. The green one

Take just a little sample of a sample
Of wet sage and rusting honeysuckle for example
I'm not afraid to die a little tiny bit
I just don't want it to hurt coming out of it

I can't move. I can't talk
I can't sleep. I can't walk
I can't move. I can't talk
I can't sleep. I can't walk

Mama's on the spectrum
Daddy's on the borderline
I'm from fucking Delhi
Not fucking over the Rhine

I'm peaceful 'cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites. 'Cause I'm the man to be

I'm peaceful 'cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites. 'Cause I'm the man to be

I'll be the one in the lobby in the collared
Fuck me shirt. The green one
I'll be the one in the lobby in the green collared
Fuck me shirt. The green one

I can't even look at the reviews anymore
I score an 8.6 on a fucking par 4
Hanging like a rag doll from the door
'Cause I'm the man to be
