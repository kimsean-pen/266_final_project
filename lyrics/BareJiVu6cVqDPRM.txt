Enemy
Familiar friend
My beginning and my end
Knowing truth
Whispering lies
And it hurts again
What I fear
And what I try
The words I say, and what I hide
All the pain
I want it to end
But I want it again

And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is breaking me again

Still the same
Pursuing pain
Is it worth all I have gained
We both know
How this will end
But I do it again

And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

It's nothing (it's everything)
It's nothing (it's everything)
It's nothing (it's everything)
It's nothing (it's everything)

And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

It's breaking me
It's breaking me

I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart
