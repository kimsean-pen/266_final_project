One second burns for a billion years
And time is relative
And light is physical
We feel your body
We feel your feelings
We see the eye of god shine through the citadel
And space is empty behind the universe
The past and future were simultaneous.
Inside your body we feel your emptiness
The light we breathe in is your unconsciousness
And your body disappears,
Burning backwards through the years
And in your hands time was made
And through breathing
You'll erase it
But we can see forever.
Before love and hate
And we will fall right through the wall of the place where we were made
Right into the open mouth of the great annihilator
