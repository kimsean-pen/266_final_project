This is revolution, a generation rising to become the solution
Torn down by every word. Silenced, no voice to be heard
So you think this is fair? Hung by their words like a noose
Cross the line if you dare
They said we'd never make it out alive
They said we'd never make it out alive
They said we'd never make it out alive
They said
They said we'd never make it out alive but I broke the mold and I survived
Hate is a cancer. We are the problem, love is the answer

Go!
If we're the troubled youth they claim that we are
Condemned to sink to the depths of a world ripped apart
I'd rather spend my life believing there's hope
Than be obsessed with how to tie the end of my rope

They said we'd never make it out alive
They said we'd never make it out alive
They said we'd never make it out alive
They said

They said we'd never make it out alive but I broke the mold and I survived
Hate is a cancer. We are the problem, love is the answer

They said we'd never make it out alive but I broke the mold and I survived
Hate is a cancer. We are the problem, love is the answer

Higher and higher until we fall
Deeper and deeper into this hole
Shame me, you blame me, you're victimless
Judge me, do nothing like all the rest

Higher and higher until we fall
Deeper and deeper into this hole
Shame me, you blame me, you're victimless
Judge me, do nothing like all the rest

I'd rather spend my life believing there's hope
Than be obsessed with how to tie the end of my rope
