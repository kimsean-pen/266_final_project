Ooh, ooh

I got ten fingers to the sky
My back to the wall, my white flag high
Her lips, just like a gun
She's got silver bullets on her tongue
He's deep under her spell
I'm screamin' out, but it just won't help

I think I'm cursed
I had him first

Adeline, have mercy
You don't wanna break my heart
Take what's mine, don't hurt me
Steal my money, steal my car
Don't take my man, don't take my man
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh

She stole my man, took him from me
She's got crimson eyes, a screamin' body
Face is young, she must taste sweet
She drops those panties to her knees
Walkin' on my happy home
She won't give up until I'm gone

I think I'm cursed
I had him first

Adeline, have mercy
You don't wanna break my heart
Take what's mine, don't hurt me
Steal my money, steal my car
Don't take my man, don't take my man
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh

Put the gun down, put the gun down
Put your finger on the trigger now
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Put the gun down, put the gun down
I'ma set fire to the whole damn house
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Whoa, Adeline

Adeline, have mercy
You don't wanna break my heart
Take what's mine, don't hurt me
Steal my money, steal my car
Don't take my man, don't take my man
I said, don't take my man 'cause you know you can
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
Ooh, ooh
Put the gun down
