Dear Lord this is a prayer
Just let me know if you're really there
Dear Lord come gain control
Oh Lord come save my soul

Give me dignity restore my sanity
Oh Lord come rescue me
Dear Lord my vanity is killing me
Oh Lord it's killing me, it's killing me

If you give your soul to heaven
And your soul begins to bleed
Remember all the sevens
Don't turn up when you need

If you do believe in glory
Then please believe a fact
Give your soul to heaven
You won't get it back

I'm down deep and I need your help
There's no one to turn to and I can't help myself
Dear Lord hear this call
Oh Lord save my fall

I'm scared I doubt
Dear Lord help me out
I despair my Lord my prayer my Lord
Care my Lord

Dear Lord take the time
I believe your story now you believe mine
Oh Lord I'm on my knees
Oh Lord please please beware

My Lord oh care my Lord
Give me dignity
Restore my sanity
My vanity is killing me

If you give your soul to heaven
And your soul begins to bleed
Remember all the sevens
Don't turn up when you need

If you do believe in glory
Then please believe a fact
Give your soul to heaven
You won't get it back
