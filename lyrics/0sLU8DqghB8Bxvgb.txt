Yeah, Mustang take me
Mustang Ford, take me far away

Been driving for days now
I been driving to take the pain away

Gotta get some love now
Love back in my veins, gotta kill this pain

Drove down to the shoreline
Hey shoreline take me far away

There was a sign by the roadside
Back by the road is where my body's layin'

Hallucinogen headlamps
My sane scape's disrupted in a pickup truck

Drive

Hallucinogen headlamps
My sane scape's disrupted in a pickup truck

The radio still plays
Among the mangled metal frays
Petroleum spirit daze

Been drivin' for days now, oh yeah
There was a sign by the roadside, oh yeah

Gotta get some love now
Love back in my veins, gotta quit this pain

Do you satisfy my soul
(Yeah, such a shame)
I got clean out of control
(Soul ride, train train)
Held ransom, rock 'n' roll
