I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right

I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right
I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, to that light

Blowin' all this cash on the things that never last
I don't want it, you can have it
Countin' up this bag while I'm smokin' out the bag
With my brother, yo roll another
Eyes bloodshed, marijuana
Starin' at the eyes of my karma
I'm bumpin' Michael Jackson and Nirvana
I'm tryna find my way to Madonna

I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right
I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right

Now I see the signs, that's why I'm pressin' decline
When you call me, ain't tryna hear it (hello?)
I turn to the guy that you said I couldn't ride
Like it's magic, I'm disappearin'
Head lookin' down at my karma
I've been doin' things how I wanna
Focused on the fam and mi casa
What you talkin' 'bout? What you follow?

I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right
I said I found a way, to that light
Ah, fuck the money, I found the li-ight
I said I found a way, to that light
To that light, I got it right
