"baby please, it's the way you speak
forming words so easily
and i think of the way you think
it keeps me from falling asleep
in that grave i call a bed
until you called me up and said

"i haven't stopped crying
my father's been drinking
i need a place to stay
i don't want to be here
he's saying the words that
he promised he would never say

that liquid he consumes
makes him speak the truth"

and i said no, its not that at all
its that bottles of lies for a troubled heart
its standing on the edge of a mountain top
screaming anything he wants
like, "look at me, because i exist"

i remember the way you shook
its a shame that we're not soul mates
because if i didn't know better
i'd say this feels pretty good
how could i be scared?
when i stretch and feel that you're there
so shut your mouth
because these words will speak themselves
i can feel them in these blankets
and they're surrounding your figure
embraced in the quilts
and i cant help but think
you're my missing puzzle piece

i wake up in the hallway, i'm looking for sunlight
with rays that will cure me of the pain that keeps my lungs tight
ignoring the voices and feelings that tell me
to get out of this house
i cant make them stop
i'm just like my mom

and you said no, these demons will fall
you're so precious to us all
and i said i cant do this alone
i still need you to hold
so don't let go, because i'm afraid"
