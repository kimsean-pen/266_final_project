I see it all through my window it seems
Never failing like millions of bees
All that is wrong
No time to be won
Only to do
What can be done

Peak hour
Peak hour
Peak hour

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day
One hour at night
Sees crowds of people
Home in full flight

Peak hour
Peak hour
Peak hour

It makes me want to run out and tell them
They've got time
Take a step back out and look in
I found out I've got time

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day
One hour at night
Sees crowds of people
Home in full flight

Peak hour
Peak hour
Peak hour
