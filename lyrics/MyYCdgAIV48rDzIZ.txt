I picked up and I went away
I left West Philly I saw things clearly
You stay back in our old room
With all of my stuff and the garden's in bloom
I feel different today
Move across the country fall in love again
You are angry at me
And I get it you have every right to be
I broke a promise
But see unconditional love only exists in movies
Your love for me was a remedy
A bright white light you followed idly
And for better or worse you have never met anyone like me before
Between heaven and earth there's death and rebirth
And a plane where we couldn't breathe
So we cut our losses and take a deep breath
Accept what is left and bet it on someone else
And in the light of morning remember
It would never have worked out
Anyway
Anyway
