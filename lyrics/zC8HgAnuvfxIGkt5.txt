There's no difference between you and I
We share the same sunshine from the same sky
When it rains, it
Rains on both you and I
Gotta sink or swim, now it's do or die

It goes

Toe tag
Shot in the chest

Bodybag
Even when I'm on my last breath

'Til we get reciprocity, how can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV, I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more, he held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Ohh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
Struck down
Struck down

There's no difference between you and I
Same space and time, that we occupy
We all just looking for a piece of the pie
We went blind, going eye for an eye

It goes

I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
Try to burn me down
Get this whole place lit
I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
They said they want war, this is it

Let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
