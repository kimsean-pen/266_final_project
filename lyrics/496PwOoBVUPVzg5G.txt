I'm just gonna stay home smoke weed
Wouldn't it be nice
To not have to care
About anything
Or anyone, It's not that I don't like you
Anymore, I think that I'm just having trouble
Feeling successful in my own life
Maybe we could take some time
To think

So I'll cut all my fingers
Off at the bone 'cause
Its easier than trying to be okay
With the parts of me that I don't like

It's not as glamorous as you thought it'd be
It's not as easy as everyone made it seem
Why did it ever feel like a good idea to be alone?

So what's it gonna take
For these feelings to disappear?
What else can I do
To make my anxieties go away?
How else can I try
To get by without ending it all?

When there's nowhere you can run
I promise I'll still be the one
You can call when you can't sleep

And someday we'll look back and say
Why were we ever so afraid
To say
How we feel?
