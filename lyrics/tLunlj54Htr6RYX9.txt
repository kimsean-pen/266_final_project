Lying in my bed of silence
Know you're gonna come tonight
Thinking of the consequences
Asking why

Wonder if I think about you
Want to know if I still care
You're the one who wants it over
But we're here

This love's incomplete
It never will be
But it hurts me to breathe
All I care for

Tonight, you make me feel the fireworks
Tonight, we're gonna let this fire burn
Fire burn, fire burn
Let this fire burn

Look into my eyes and tell me
Who you really wanna be
Enemies, friends or lovers
Who are we

Said you're staying with another
But you're always coming back
Tired of being undercover
Losing track

This love's incomplete
It never will be
But it helps me to breathe
All I care for

Tonight, you make me feel the fireworks
Tonight, we're gonna let this fire burn
Fire burn, fire burn
Let this fire burn

This isn't right (This isn't right)
But you're safe for tonight (Safe for tonight)
Out of sight (Out of sight)
Holding me tight (Holding me tight)

Tonight, you make me feel the fireworks
Tonight, we're gonna let this fire burn
Fire burn, fire burn
Let this fire burn

Fire burn, fire burn
Let this fire burn
