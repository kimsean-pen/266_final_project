Nothing makes sense to me anymore
I'm learning to resist
Becoming more than you ever were

I can't explain

Your side
I won't see your side

I can't explain
What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your
I can't explain
What's come over me (come over me)
I can't explain
Why it's so hard for me, so hard to see your side

I won't see your
Your side
