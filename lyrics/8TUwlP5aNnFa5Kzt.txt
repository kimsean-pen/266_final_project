So long to the
the days you grow sad of
And you
try to find
Not much for you to hold
The more
That you hold the
The more you feel alone
And wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
no more

So long to the
the days you come to know
So you had to
to get there on your own
to wait
to grow old
You're waiting
to grow old

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
no more

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
no more
