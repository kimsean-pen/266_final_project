The night is young and I'm free
To go wherever I need
Are you the one who stole my mind
But it's too late to run away

Her eyes are hypnotizing
She makes me move like I'm a freak
You better run she said to me

You make me so crazy
Your love is all that can save me
Right before I start to lose control

You make me so crazy
You're the one who can save me
Now you're running through my veins
I get high from your love

Your love is like my new drug
(Your love is like my new drug)
That I should take to get high
(That I should take to get high)
But promise me you'll never stop

You make me so crazy
Your love is all that can save me
Right before I start to lose control

You make me so crazy
You're the one who can save me
Now you're running through my veins

You make me so crazy
Your love is all that can save me
Right before I start to lose control

You make me so crazy
You're the one who can save me
Now you're running through my veins
I get high from your love

You make me so crazy
From your love
(Make me so crazy)
From your love
From your love
(Make me so crazy)

You make me so crazy
Your love is all that can save me
Right before I start to lose control

You make me so crazy
You're the one who can save me
Now you're running through my veins
I get high from your love
