She lay beside me
Like a branch from, a tender willow tree
I was as still
As still as a river could be
When a rococo zephyr (rococo)
Swept over
Her and me (rococo)

She watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple light
Light watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple she
I did some kind of dance
Jaunty as a bee
I tried to look my best
A finch in wild mint vest
A fiercer force had wrenched her
From where she used to be
I caught and caressed the length of her
A tender willow branch floatin' on me

Well maybe this was all
Was all that meant to be
Maybe this is all
Is all that meant to be
A rococo zephyr (rococo)
Crept up
And stepped over
Her and me (rococo)

Well I used to be sort of blind
Now I can sort of see

Yeah I used to be sort of blind
Now I can sort of see
