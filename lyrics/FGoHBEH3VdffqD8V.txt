Periodic tableware
Psychotropic science fare

But who will save the sane?
Some beings
Just can't change
Now crawl on by
With a fake tear in your eye
And think
Isn't he strange?

Pseudogasmic chemistry
Necromorphic apathy

But who will save the sane?...

Physical laws unapplied
Hamper my quest

Unsurreal world
Of unfailed hiv tests
Der ubermensch warning
Of pi (techno junkies)
3.141592653...
Come on boy
Tell me, tell me

Tentative ambulance
Date bound for g ward
Beartrap psychiatrist bait
Chew my paw off
Unmercilessly we will take you
Away to slumber
But only if you can recite
Avogadro's number

Now crawl on by
With a fake tear in your eye
And think
Wasn't he strange?
