Vibrates the field and now the wave plate sun descending.
Flight toward the new day to through black sun rise tomorrow.
Refracts the wave plate school and now high priestess sending.
Into the field and climb the waveform to the theme.

Vibrates the field and now the wave plate sun descending.
Flight toward the new day to through black sun rise tomorrow.
On the elliptic flight the high priestess is sending.
Into the field dissolves the waveform to the theme.

Look out to onto red bled sun the hierophant is seeding.
Accretes the ground nerve skein and sections cross in grace.
Refracts the wave plate field and now high priestess sending.
Into the field and climb the waveform to the theme.

Ascends the swan toward sun in breath drawn life deliverance.
Latitudinal ground elliptic motion sets unveil.
Approach the grid substrate the sunglows beam to freedom.
Winds grieve the codex shines and walks toward the grey.

Striates into the sky on outward spires reaching.
Under orbic vermilion sun migration on the wings.
Summit upholds the canopied skies of a new day.
Into the field and climbs the waveform to the theme.

Anchorite beacon to sentient ground.
Platform witnessed to diffuse tomorrow - screen.

The platform witnessed to diffuse tomorrow - screen.

Alternates grid on the outer of a newborn theme.
Choric to the worship - walk toward the horizon.
Alternates grid on the outer of a newborn theme.
And pass into the orbitarm - out from source to freedom.

Arise to sky and set free - release toward horizon.
Arise to sky and set free - release toward horizon.
To sun glides the albatross - set onto the skein of freedom.
To sun glides the albatross - set onto the skein of freedom.

Alternates grid on the outer of a newborn theme.
A choric to the windship - out from the source to freedom.
