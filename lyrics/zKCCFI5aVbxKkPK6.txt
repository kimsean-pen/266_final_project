Doesn't anybody feel that all these killers should be killed
And all these healers should be
healed so all these beggars can be filled
And now tell me why am I to lie if I'm holding firm and feel the right
To lie beside this dog of mine
and let that perverted thought really run through my mind
Through my mind

Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh

I'd scrape my toes across the floor
this day's the same as those before
And though inside I'm feeling giddy
Always wrong for never giving myself an uninvaded door
So now I'll take a little glue,
I'll put together a new glittered room for you

So I can start sitting so pretty
instead of sitting here not seein' clear
Just sitting here not fittin' here, no things ain't fittin' here

Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh
Ahh ooo ahh

Now I'll just lay my head down beside this God of mine
And let that perverted thought burn a hole in my mind
Oh and if I can't lay my head beside this God of mine
Oh then maybe the hunter's dog called God could be my friend in time
