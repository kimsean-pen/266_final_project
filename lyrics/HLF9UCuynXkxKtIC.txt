Who will keep, keep me in this evening
Even though they are not here with me
I could be a great star
Still I'm far from happy

Finally, filled the world around me
Fighting through, fighting through the whiskey
I could be a great star
still I'm far from happy

Out of these shadows comes the light
Shadows comes the light

You will keep, keep me in this evening
Even though you are not here with me

I could be a great star
Still I'm far from happy

I could be a great star
I could be a great star
I could be a great star
I could be a great star

Out of these shadows
Comes the light

Out of these shadows
Comes the light

Shadows comes the light
