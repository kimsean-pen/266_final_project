For all my debts I have to pay
Remains for me now to explain
For every tortured soul to pray
A murderer till my last day
Bells are ringing, my day has come
For me and all my greedy sons
For every cruelty to alone
Eternal flames, my home

No release
From the sins he made
Repentance now
For him comes too late
His only wish
To turn back time
And never get into his crime
Reign with heart instead of blood

Revenge is written in their eyes
To end my reign and stop my lies
To spill my blood over my throne
And burn down all I've ever owned
Isis, Osiris, all the gods
There's no excuse for my own faults
No one to blame instead of me
Sentence already signed

No release
From the sins he made
Repentance now
For him comes too late
His only wish
To turn back time
And never get into his crime
Reign with heart instead of blood

No release
From the sins he made
Repentance now
For him comes too late
His only wish
To turn back time
And never get into his crime
Reign with heart instead of blood

His only wish
To turn back time
And never get into his crime
Reign with heart instead of blood
