I see you

You're on the edge of your seat
Ain't you got some place to be
Was hoping this suspense will kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come and give me your expert opinion, ah, fuck it

I settle down in the dump
Heard the crowd screaming, "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Said: "What the fuck have I done?"
They said: "We just want your blood
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you
Know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done
My name's still on your tongue

But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you trying to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I go, this is how I thrive
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down? Oh

Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but
Don't say it's coming from love now
I see those arms in akimbo
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
And don't set that taser to stun
'Cause what doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell
Yeah, you better run like hell

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know
Nothing's stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done
My name's still on your tongue

So tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you trying to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I go, this is how I thrive

Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now, that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us (No)
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons

So tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you trying to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I go, this is how I thrive
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?

Tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
This is how I go, this is how I thrive
