Baby can you cross the line?
Maybe it could be worse for you and me
There's something wrong in this love
Don't worry nobody knows the line we've got

Make the world of us
We go up through the night
It's one of my favorites in the world
Just Baby hold me now

I Guess you wanna do too
(I like it, like)
Feel this way that i like

Tell me give me a simple lie
I guess we runnin away overzone
I bet you are running away
Overzone overzone

But when u need my love
Oh i bet i bet
I am begging you I am begging you

Baby can u cross the line?
Maybe it could be worse for u and me
Let's keep the distance from the gossip thing
Don't worry nobody knows the line we've got
(We go we go)

Make the world of us
We go up through the night
It's one of my favorites in the world
Just Baby hold me now

I Guess you wanna do too
(I like it, like)
Feel this way that i like

Tell me give me a simple lie
I guess we runnin away overzone
I bet you are running away
Overzone overzone

But when u need my love
Oh i bet i bet

Look at the ppl ooh - they don't care 'bout us
I know that we never been failed
Just focus on us
It can be a dangerous game
But it's worth it babe
Show me the zone you've got
Oh there's no one for us

Over-

Over-

Yeah we yeah we in here

Tell me give me a simple lie
I guess we runnin away overzone
I bet you are running away
Overzone overzone

But when u need my love

I bet you are running away
Overzone overzone

But when u need my love
Oh i bet i bet
