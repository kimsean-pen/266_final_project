I don't wanna think, don't wanna see your face
You're haunting my dreams, every breath that I take
I've tried letting go, but you keep reaching out
I've fallen so hard, some things you can't erase.

And now, I'm here without you
I'm gonna live without you
now that you're gone, I've got to carry on
I can't look back.
The best part of me broke when we said goodbye

You use to say that we were cut just the same
Two lost souls, wander around until that day
I don't have regrets, at least I tried not to
I wanna forget, at least I tried hard to
Now I'm here without you
I'm gonna live without you
now that you're gone, I've got to carry on
I can't look back.
The best part of me broke when we said goodbye

I tried so hard, I've washed away those tears
I've broken free, I've brushed aside my fears
I've closed the door and I'm happier this way
You'll always be the day I fell in love

And now, I'm here without you
I'm gotta live without you
now that you're gone, I've got to carry on
I can't look back.
The best part of me broke when we said goodbye

and I'm here to say goodbye.
