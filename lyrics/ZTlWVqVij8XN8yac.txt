wake up early, mad at you
go to school
but where are you?

shoulda told me,
shoulda known
now you're gone
i'm alone

your mother told me last night on the phone
why'd you do it? now I'm alone
woulda helped you, woulda done anything
taken you with me or bought you a ring

now you're gone and i'm alone
now you're gone and i'm alone

shoulda told me,
shoulda known
now you're gone
i'm alone

i'm alone
