Well, I'm frozen
Like a soldier
Don't know where it stays all over the place
Time froze
Like an ocean
Don't know the taste of a never ending ache
No, no, no, no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go

No, no, no, no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go, oh, I'll go

It's really not bad, not worse than you thought
He'll never come back as the man that you dropped
He'll never come back as the man that you loved

It's not that bad, not worse than you thought
He'll always come back as the man you dropped
He'll never come back as the man you loved

I told her
I told her
I told her
I'll go

I told her
I told her
I told her
No, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go
No, no, no, no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go, oh, I'll go

I told her
I told her
I'll go

I told her
I told her
I'll go
