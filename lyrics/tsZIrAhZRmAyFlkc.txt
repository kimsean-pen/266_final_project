It's only been an hour
Since he locked her in the tower
The time has come
He must be undone by the morning

Many times before
The tyrant's opened up the door
Someone cries
Still we close our eyes, not again

Meet me when the sun is in the western sky
The fighting must begin before another someone dies
Crossbows in the firelight
Greensleeves waving
Mad men raving
Through the shattered night, yeah

Flames are getting higher
Make it leap unto the spire
Drawbridge down
Cut it to the ground
We shall dance around the fire

No more night
We have seen the light
Let it shine on bright
Hang him higher, higher

Drawbridge down
Cut it to the ground
We shall dance around, around the fire
No, the fire

No more night
We have seen the light
Let it shine on bright
Hang him higher, higher
Put a man on the fire

Drawbridge down
Cut it to the ground
We're going to dance around the fire
The fire, the fire
