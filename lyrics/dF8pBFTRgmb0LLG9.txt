She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
She smokes so self-contently
Makes me sick
But she's so pretty that I can't resist
She likes to suffer, she's has nothing to do
Can't hate the chick 'cause she's got no sense
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
She went through me like a pavement saw
And I feel stupid 'cause I was so stupid about it
