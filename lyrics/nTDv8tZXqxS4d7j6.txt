Offer your trust to a friend who is not what he says
And you know when you're dry, what you're thinkin'
Trout in the brook, you're about to get hooked
To a greedy false un-Catholic knave

The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why

I took the locomotive to Kreutzberg
Passed through the scenery
And passengers got on that train, too
And they really surprised me when they said

"The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why"

I've got some friends
But I got some enemies too
And yes, I got some people in between
People just like you

The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
