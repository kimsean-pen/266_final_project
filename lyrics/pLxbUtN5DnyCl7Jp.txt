I'm in way too deep like a poser
And falling for the dream's just the ground getting closer
I guess it's how our lives get painted in scars
With everything riding on a joker
With the paradise syndrome strap on for spurs
Regret is the skin you shed just to make it this far

I need you to find me, I can no longer breathe
I want you to touch me, just to know I still feel, oh

Like a miracle you change me, raise me
Brighter than the sun till I'm ready to be me
And your love is the reason, yeah
Like a miracle you wake me, make me
Brighter than the sun when it used to blind me
I know your love is the reason
Love never goes out of season

I got nothing to call a solution
Not a penny to my name, just riding the motion
Yet like a child I still reach for the stars
But if this darkened hole is my conclusion
And the mother of pearl world is just a notion
I lose for playing out my part in this farce

I need you to find me, I can no longer breathe
And I want you to touch me, just to know I still feel, oh

Like a miracle...

Just remember when it's time speak your mind
Speak your mind, you gotta show them how
Show them how you wanna live your life
Just one life, one life, all in the now

Oooh
Like a miracle...
