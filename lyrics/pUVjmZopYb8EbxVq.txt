Turn around to watch all the same
You know, you're simply a game
I see you've messed up your laughing head
I'll take you again and again
When you wake you're still in a dream
Not real though I love you unclean
I'm telling you you're a sick mind
You come back so fine, so fine

Know your smile is colder than ice
That will back you up real nice
But killing's hardly a weapon for you
Your wasted space is mine to

Turn around to watch all the same
You know, you're simply a game
I see you've messed up your laughing head
I'll take you again and again
