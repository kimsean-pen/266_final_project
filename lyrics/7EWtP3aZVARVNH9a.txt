Does anyone know at all where they're trying to go?
And what if I don't care at all? Cause I don't mind letting it go, no no
Cause everything we know is just something we're taught
And everything we hate is just something we bought along the line
And every time, I find myself asking why.
I'm staying here, waiting up, why am I waiting?
Weighing up everything that I've been breaking
I never let it hold me back, now I can barely hold it back
And now I'm staying here, waiting up, why can't I shake it?
Weighing up everything that I've been chasing
Slipping right through my hands,
Now I'm just gonna let it, I'm just gonna let it land
So where do I get off now, without getting too far?
And how do you come back down, when you don't even know where you are?
Cause everything we know is just something we're taught
And everything we hate is just something we bought along the line
And every time, I find myself asking why
I'm staying here, waiting up, why am I waiting?
Weighing up everything that I've been breaking
I never let it hold me back, now I can barely hold it back
And now I'm staying here, waiting up, why can't I shake it?
Weighing up everything that I've been chasing
Slipping right through my hands,
Now I'm just gonna let it, I'm just gonna let it land
So keep your mind open
But always keep your mouth shut
And hide it if you're broken
But always keep your chin up
It don't matter where I'm falling
Cause I can't get my mind right
I need to pull it together if there's no one to catch me
I'm staying here, waiting up, why am I waiting?
Weighing up everything that I've been breaking
I never let it hold me back, now I can barely hold it back
I'm staying here, waiting up, why can't I shake it?
Weighing up everything that I've been chasing
Slipping right through my hands,
Now I'm just gonna let it, I'm just gonna let it land
Now I'm just gonna let it, I'm just gonna let it land
Now I'm just gonna let it, I'm just gonna let it land
