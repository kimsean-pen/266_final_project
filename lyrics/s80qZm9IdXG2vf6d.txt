It feels so dangerous
I don't know where you are
You can't control my every move
Although you try so hard
Accept it, leave it
Your wisdom doesn't make me wise
Accept it, leave it
Your tears don't make me cry

Drifting apart
Lay me to waste
I know your fears
I feel your pain
Running away
Through a spinning maze
Running away
To a safe escape

No compliance
Your boundaries suffocate
My lungs are filled
With poison in your cage
Bruises and stains
No power left to stand
You held me down
Help me rise again

It feels so dangerous
I don't know where you are
You can't control my every move
Although you try so hard
Accept it, leave it
Your wisdom doesn't make me wise
Accept it, leave it
Your tears don't make me cry

No compliance
Your boundaries suffocate
My lungs are filled
With poison in your cage
Bruises and stains
No power left to stand
You held me down
Help me rise again
