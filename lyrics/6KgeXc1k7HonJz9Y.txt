Strange house, face down
On this once familiar couch
Why the hell does it feel like im sinking?
I've never felt so lonely when you're with me
Face it, baby, all these problems are nothing new
Everything we built is now vacant
But i don't wanna be the first to leave it!

You could be the one that i dream of
But you're making it impossible to sleep
Well I'm awake now, wide awake so
Put some worth in your words, can't live on promises
I was just a wide eyed dreamer
Believe in love, believe in us
Believe but I can't - believe in us
Believe in us, believe in us yeahhhh

Breathless questions
To you remember when we met?
I could barely keep my fingers off of it
But now my hands are buried in my own pockets
Lazy lately watching paint dry on these walls
Where's the guy that really used to get me?
Once upon a love you were the best thing, oh!

You could be the one that i dream of
But you're making it impossible to sleep
Well I'm awake now, wide awake so
Put some worth in your words, can't live on promises
I was just a wide eyed dreamer
Believe in love, believe in us
Believe but I can't - believe in us
Believe in us, believe in us yeahhhh

Tell me one more time that you wanna do this!
If it's worth the fight then you've gotta prove it!
This is overtime and you're about to lose this, lose this, lose this!

You could be the one that i dream of
But you're making it impossible to sleep
Well I'm awake now, wide awake so
Put some worth in your words, can't live on promises
I was just a wide eyed dreamer (just a dreamer)
Believe in love, believe in us
Believe but I can't - believe in us
Believe in us, believe in us yeahhhh

You could be the one that i dream of
But you're making it impossible to sleep
Well I'm awake now, wide awake so
Put some worth in your words, can't live on promises
I was just a wide eyed dreamer
Believe in us, believe in love
Believe but I can't - believe in us
Believe in us, believe in us yeahhhh
