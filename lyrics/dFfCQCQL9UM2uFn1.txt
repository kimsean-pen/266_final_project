The open road, the path of greatness
It's at your fingers
Go be the one that keeps on fighting
Go be the stranger
Just put your foot in front' the other
Crow like the rooster
Be all and all, together something
Fear is a danger
I say

Spill on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face

The windows are
The perfect picture
They're always changin'
Go on, get lost
Jump in the waters
When they are raging
I say

Spill on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone

Spill on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone
