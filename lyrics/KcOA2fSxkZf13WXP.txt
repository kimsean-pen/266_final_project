You been over it
You told them
Blaming me for all the things undone
So-called perfect one
Lies to everyone
It's been a long run
But I need to move on
Well, baby, if I am wrong
Why you still reaching me out on the phone
I been tryna move on
And you said you were better alone
Well, baby, you can't stand to see
That you ain't doing no better than me
Didn't you move on?
Then move on
Guess time
Just show me that
The best thing you did was
Leaving me
Thank God
I now have eyes to see
What everyone been telling me
It took time
But I'm over it
It's never late
Too late
To recover
You were the sweetest
But behind my back you got to be the bitterest
Trying to remember when I thought you could be different
I had you so overrated
Then you celebrated
Then got me frustrated
If that's what you wanted
My time I ain't wastin
Well, baby, If I am wrong
Why you still reaching me out on the phone
I been tryna move on
And You said you were better alone
Well, baby, you can't stand to see
That you ain't doing no better than me
Didn't you move on?
Then move on
Guess time
Just show me that
The best thing you did was
Leaving me
Thank God
I now have eyes to see
What everyone been telling me
It took time
But I'm over it
It's never late
Too late
To recover
Well, baby, If I am wrong
Why you still reaching me out on the phone
I been tryna move on
And You said you were better alone
Well, baby, you can't stand to see
That you ain't doing no better than me
Didn't you move on?
Then move on
Guess time
Just show me that
The best thing you did was
Leaving me
Thank God
I now have eyes to see
What everyone been telling me
It took time
But I'm over it
It's never late
Too late
To recover
It took time
But I'm over it
It's never late
Too late
To recover
Guess time
Just show me that
The best thing you did was
Leaving me
Thank God
I now have eyes to see
What everyone been telling me
It took time
But I'm over it
It's never late
Too late
