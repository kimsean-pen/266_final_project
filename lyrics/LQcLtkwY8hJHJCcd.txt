Last night I watched a memory
Fall from the sky like a star
A flash of modern history
So distant that I forgot

I disappeared
Hid my name
No one even noticed
For days
The surface
I'm sinking under
What's at the bottom that
I can discover?

I'm falling off the deep end
Tearing at the seams again
Tell me that it's obvious
And I've just hit the lowest low

When you collapse, all the colors change
Like a hexagon storm
Look for my reflection and can't see my face
I killed my past, just to be reborn

Lay all my mistakes
Beside each other.
Throw them away
The surface
I'm sinking under
What's at the bottom
That I can discover?

I'm falling off the deep end
Tearing at the seams again
Tell me that it's obvious
And I've just hit the lowest low
