Substance, out of reach
And take you with it, it's harden
We had hoped to put it out first
And yet it's all that we are left with

Words you never said
Do we really mean them
Someone give them to me now
Words that I can say,
But you never hear them
Someone's standing by the door
The common man wouldn't give up his throne
The common man wouldn't give up his throne

You're changing the dark, but you don't even know it
It's mine to discard, too ashamed to deserve it
And you will forget and I will remember
Everything changes, you don't know I exist

Words you never said
Do we really mean them
Someone give them to me now
Words that I can say,
But you never hear them
Someone's standing by the door
The common man wouldn't give up his throne
The common man wouldn't give uW his throne

And you will forget, and I will remember
And you will forget, and I will remember
And you will forget, and I will remember
And you will forget, and I will remember
