Just forgive me started on the simple things
And before your body fixed the broken wings of
Everything that carries you forward now
Patching up the holes remaining in your word now
I start to question what is real or not
I pick apart of my every thought
Dig in to a dark place
Bury the thought of your face
It's alright, it's alright
Tell me you need me
Telling you that it's
Alright, it's alright
But your no good for me
Pretty little thing
Attention only when in need
But you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand up on your feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My attention is ending

Whatever helps you sleep at night
Is certainly beside me
Cause I've been searching for the answers, On this older bed and rows you built
Desperate to see
Just forgive me started on the simple things (simple things)
And before your body fixed the broken wings of
Every single promise that you flew my way
Picking up the nursing that you may come back
It's alright, it's alright
Tell me you need me
Telling you that it's
Alright, it's alright
But your no good for me
Pretty little thing
Intention only when in need
But you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand up on your feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My intention is ending

What if our words where rotting in (rotting in)
And every broken breath we take
I hear your call your crying out
I scream your name
Pretty little thing
Intention only when in need

Pretty little thing
Intention only when in need
But you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand up on your feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My intention is ending

My intention is ending

Oh oh oh
