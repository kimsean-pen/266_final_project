The winter days are closing again
They bring a chill into my heart
Morning frost surrounds your hazel eyes
As gentle ivy clings to bark

Angel, penetrate my heart
Angel, take you in my arms

Restless nights of dreaming endlessly
Fever burns me to the core
Your kind of torment creeps on up to me
As the sea breeze slides onto the shore.
