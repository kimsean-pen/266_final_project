Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
I'ma do my thang, 'cause I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma,I'ma,I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma,I'ma,I'ma do my, I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang

Bang bang, I'ma shoot 'em down, baby
Look at me, I'm high up off the ground, baby
Oh shit, pass that shit around, baby
That shit true, but I don't hear a sound

I'm a Southern belle, crazier than hell
Getting wild up in here, getting live up in here
Burning up, up in here, turnt up, up in here
We tear the roof up, now we up out of here

We do it, we do it, we don't give a fuck
Only thing we think about is turnin' up, turnin' up
We do it, we do it, we do it all the way live
So, everybody, hands to the sky, 'cause

Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
'Cause I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma,I'ma, I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma,I'ma, I'ma do my, I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang

Bang, bitch! You think I'm strange, bitch?
It's bananas, like a fucking 'rangutan, bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, I got it all arranged, bitch
Mind your business, stay in your lane, bitch

Oh yeah, I'm a Southern belle
I told ya'll once before I get crazier than hell
Get wild up in here, get live up in here
Turnt up, up in here, burning up, up in here

We do it, we do it, we don't give a fuck
Only thing we think about is turnin' up, turnin' up
We do it, we do it, we do it all the way live
So, everybody, hands to the sky, 'cause

Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
I'ma do my thang, 'cause I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma do my, I'ma do my thang
