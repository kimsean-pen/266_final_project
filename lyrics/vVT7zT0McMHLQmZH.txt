Gently down the stream
Sk level
Row, row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Niggas sleepin' on me must be sippin' on the lean
Greaze
She knows I be the boss of life
Still Roll Deep
She knows, she knows, she knows
She knows

I, wake up, brush my teeth, choose an outfit
Big racks in my account, I get paid
Everyday smoke the loudest
I get packs in by the ounce I just blaze
And I got tings from back in the day
Still ringing me down I'm on stage
But I want no stress
Bruddah tryna control S coming around to get saved
I don't wanna war let's make peace
Good energies make the stacks increase
Girls in the North, West, South and the East
Big batty make the mandem say jheeze
I'm not a gentleman I'm an African man
That's what I said to the priest
So you know I stay smoking trees
And the buds in the zip pack looking obese

I just came back from Mars in my new spaceship
It was a perfect landing (Perfect!)
What d'you mean, what d'you mean
I'm a king she's a queen
Man you know what's happening (ice)
Nowadays they call me ginger bread man 'cah they just can't catch him
All the ladies love man, I love them too,
We got an understanding

Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
City on lock from the left to the right
Bare girls, how am I meant to decide

She weren't feelin' the old me, I bet she's feelin' my new shit
I told her we gotta keep it true, told her we gotta move as a unit
I had to chat to Cupid, said, "little man you know I ain't stupid"
Told you that it's more than music, paps outside tryna get an exclusive
Instead of looking for the top boy,
Must've been looking for me but who's asking
I clocked the game I'm still barrin',
Please don't speak to me when I'm dancing
Everyday they pray that I fall off,
I'm popping up like "what's gwaning?"
They say a girl is a gun
See a man walking with his wife and I disarm him
The way I stepped in there in with the Sk Air, fam serious tekkers
Brand new vest, same old leathers,
She knows we are the real Goodfellas
We can be cool, yeah we can ride out,
Please just don't get jealous
Start texting me crazy I gotta take desperate measures

I just came back from Mars in my new spaceship,
It was a perfect landing
What d'you mean, what d'you mean,
I'm a king she's a queen
Man you know what's happening (ice)
Nowadays they call me ginger bread man 'cah they just can't catch him
All the ladies love man, I love them too
We got an understanding

Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
City on lock from the left to the right
Bare girls how am I meant to decide
