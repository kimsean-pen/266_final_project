Your fingertips are such a kink
your fingertips run faster than a Benzy
So let's race it to the back seat
let's race it to the back seat

Red velvet, blue jeans,
rough denim, soft skin. A manufactured luxury
that makes me thirsty seven days a week
it feels like our bodies were stitched together by design
But oh! how did your touch became so tailored to mine?

I know, I know, I know, I know this is mutual
I know, I know, I know, I know...

Your skins is high couture
perfectly confectioned to me

It's my size, my colour It's my size my size, my colour.
