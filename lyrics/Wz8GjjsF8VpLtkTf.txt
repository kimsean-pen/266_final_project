I never learned from my mistakes
Until I'm too late to do anything, mmm
A screen glows in a dark room
Laptop talk of a change that never came
Oh no, no, no

So console me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting, for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you get just what you give
Gettin' high with your best friends

I'm just reading about flaws that I didn't know I had
Watching ads for things I didn't know I need
Oh no, no, no
Pour a drink just to stop the shakes
Blowing smoke until my eyes bleed

Oh, console me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting, for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you get just what you give
Gettin' high with your best friends

Sometimes you gotta leave that city to love that city
And start all over again
But it doesn't look so pretty to get your hands dirty
And start all over again
You gotta leave that city to love
that city, or else you might get trapped
Oh, you might get trapped
Just like all of my...

Just like all of my...

Oh, just like all of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting, for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you get just what you give
Gettin' high with your best friends
