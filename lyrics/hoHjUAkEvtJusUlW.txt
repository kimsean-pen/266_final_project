A love like this is bliss
A thunderstorm so complicated
Like a flower pressed against my wrist
You're a memory I can't resist

No one else haunts me late at night
Stay with me for all the time
Shades of blue spill from my Escher heart
In this never ending work of art

So many scenes, so many threats
We move so fast hanging on the edge
You're the ghost heavy on my wrist
A recurring dream I can't resist

No one else haunts me late at night
Stay with me for all the time
Shades of blue spill from my Escher heart
In this never ending work of art
Shades of blue spill from my Escher heart

Love like this is bliss
A love like this is bliss
Like a flower pressed against my wrist

No one else haunts me late at night
Stay with me for all the time
Shades of blue spill from my Escher heart
In this never ending work of art
Shades of blue spill from my Escher heart
