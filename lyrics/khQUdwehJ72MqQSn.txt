You say what I can never say
And I keep doing what you would never do
You play these games you love to play
But I'm not your pawn, I'm not easily moved
You want so much of what I haven't got

I don't feel like you
And you don't feel like me
Whoever said that love comes with sympathy?
I'm nothing like you
And you're nothing like me
I don't believe in love and symmetry
I don't believe in love and symmetry

My dark words
And your pretty little words
Sounds like it's you and me against the world
My heart
Is singing to your heart
We found something no one else has got

I don't feel like you
And you don't feel like me
Whoever said that love comes with sympathy?
I'm nothing like you
And you're nothing like me
I don't believe in love and symmetry
I don't believe in love and symmetry

But I believe in you and me
Love and symmetry
Love and symmetry
Love and symmetry
I don't believe
Love and symmetry
Love and symmetry
Love and symmetry
I don't believe
We found something no one else has got

I don't feel like you
And you don't feel like me
Whoever said that love comes with sympathy?
I'm nothing like you
And you're nothing like me
I don't believe in love and symmetry
I don't believe in love and symmetry
But I believe in you and me
