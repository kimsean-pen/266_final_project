Rolled over from last night's dreams
Happiness isn't from a
Drink me up in your thoughts
Just like I do with you
Are you left thirsty too?

Uh oh oh
I am erratic (oh oh)
Can't break the habit
My current status
You are insomniatic

My train is off the track it seems
Delirious from my loss of
Sleep deprived I greet the day
Won't be easy to do
Are you this restless too?

Uh oh oh
I am erratic (oh oh)
Can't break the habit
My current status
You are insomniatic

One by one the days grow longer and longer
And I in my own sweet pain grow stronger
I must admit I must admit I must admit
It's a good insane
I must admit I must admit
Hear me admit

Uh oh oh
I am erratic (oh oh)
Can't break the habit
My current status
You are insomniatic
