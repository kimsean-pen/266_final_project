i said i wanted to break my friends
but my dependency won't let me away
i'd like to think that i can work it out some
but i want to be put into the ground

today i needed a break
my friends are up in mountains and i'm drowning in lakes
i swallowed water right in front of her face
just to show that she had nothing to say

i felt lighter
i impressed her

but my emotions ran unopposed
i felt just like brian jones
i've never felt that lost before
i just don't feel incredible

but me, well of course i liked you
have time for me, i don't expect you to
i see me become a recluse
it's very easy to seclude

i saw water
i felt better

i woke up feeling embarrassed from
when i drowned in my swimming pool
you thought it was an accident
but i just can't get along with you
