I've never been closer
I've tried to understand
That certain feeling
Carved by another's hand
But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this
Leave no track
Don't look back

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation
Trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away
Leave no trace
Hide your face

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

Step by step
Day by day
Every second counts
I can't break away

Keep us from temptation (x3)
Lead us not in temptation

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation
Trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away
Leave no trace
Hide your face

Trying to find it
Temptation
You've got to get up behind it
Put your dime in the hot slot
Temptation
But it's a million to one shot
Temptation
you think that you're right
Temptation
Your gonna face it tonite now
Temptation
Give me a breakdown
Because it's time for a shakedown
temptation (x10)
then repeat last verse
eg.
Trying to find it
get up behind it
dime in the hot slot
million to one shot
think that you're right
Your gonna face it tonite now
Give me a breakdown
it's time for a shakedown
