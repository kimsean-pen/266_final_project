I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, oh, but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, oh, and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I will, will never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

But, oh, honey, I wish you shelter
From the storm, a cozy fire to, to keep you warm
Oh, but most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

Ooh, ooh, but most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
