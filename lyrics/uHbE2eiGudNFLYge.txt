Buckle your seatbelt, pour up a refill, let's cut the brake light off
Pick out your racer,
straight with no chaser, blow up the bass like bomb
Start up the engine, I got revenge in the back of my blue eyes
Don't see my rifle, I got the title, this competition's mine
Uh, mix up the gasoline and start it
Rolling through the metal party
Got a Lamborghini body
Uh, lace and latex, I'm Ferrari
I can hear the streets is calling
Finger on the throttle roaring
Now I keep running all the red lights
And I won't stop till I see daylight
Got bitches blinded by the headlights
Hey! Hey! Burn rubber
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
The double white lines, I'm out of my mind, oil and Tanqueray
Hop out the Porsche, tie up my corset, nothing but lingerie
This make-up right now, how much you got now, please land it all on me
And if you choose it, maybe you'll lose it, you gotta wait and see
Uh, mix up the gasoline and start it
Rolling through the metal party
Got a Lamborghini body
Uh, lace and latex, I'm Ferrari
I can hear the streets is calling
Finger on the throttle roaring
Now I keep running all the red lights
And I won't stop till I see daylight
Got bitches blinded by the headlights
Hey! Hey! Burn rubber
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
Uh, mix up the gasoline and start it
Rolling through the metal party
Got a Lamborghini body
Uh, driving crazy and I'm carrying
A red-lighted American
An ignited Aquarian
Now I keep running all the red lights
And I won't stop till I see daylight
Got bitches blinded by the headlights
Hey! Hey! Burn rubber
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, burn rubber
