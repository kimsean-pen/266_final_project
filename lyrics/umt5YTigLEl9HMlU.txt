I will collapse, so lets make this moment last
I am alone, no not because I'm lost, because I'm found
And I like the way it sounds when I'm at home
Don't say that I can't do it on my own

Then you did collide and broke through the other side
Straight through the heart, you're the ember to my flame
When it gets dark, and I love the way it feels when I'm with you
And I cannot find the words, no

Two-hundred thirty faces to my place,
Oh I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down, no need for walls now
When I'm with you, I'm at home

Two-hundred thirty faces to my place,
Oh I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down, no need for walls now
When I'm with you, I feel like I'm right at home

Two-hundred thirty faces to my place,
Oh I should not be alone
I'll burn this house down, no need for walls now
When I'm with you, I'm at home, home, home,

I'm at home, home, home
I'm at home
