Gonna take a freight train
Down at the station
And I don't care where it goes
Gonna climb a mountain
The highest mountain, Lord
Gonna jump off, and nobody gonna know

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna find me
A hole in the wall
I'm gonna crawl inside and die
'Cause my lady
A mean ol' woman, Lord
She never told me goodbye

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me

I'm gonna take a southbound
Down to Georgia, now
I ain't never coming back
I'm gonna buy me a ticket, Lord
And go as far as I can
Till that train run out of track

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
Can't you see, whoa, can't you see
What that woman, she been doin' to me
