Our sun is set, our day is done
I'm left here wondering
Is this the end? My final words to you
Day turned to night
Now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true? Are we really through?

You were the wind beneath my wings
Taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings
How could this ever die?

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life
Taught me to be free
Now, I'm a stranger in your eyes
Walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you in my heart, you are the one
And you always will be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn
But after darkness comes the light
When I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright?

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
Missing you in my heart, you are the one
And you always will be

And you always will be
And you always will be
And you always will be, my little one you are
And you always will be
