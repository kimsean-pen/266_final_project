Did the best
That I could
Said I'd die for you
And I would
But I've drowned
all those feelings in the flood

Need to Know If you're there
If you're listening to my Prayers,
To my tears
Feel like raindrops
through the mud

but how was I to know
that a year ago
I'd need to read between the lines
And every lie
and thats why...

Everytime I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
And everytime I close my eyes I'm not alone
And everytime I cry I'm right back where you wanted
I try to drown you out so,
Down goes another one
(Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
(Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
(Down goes another one)

Living fast
Dying young
But I'm living with what you've done
Now I face accusations
I won't run
(No)

I'm starting to remember things that you said,
I'm unravelling what they meant
But the world moves on
You're just another one

And how can I go on?
Coz when I'm in the sun
I see your shadow on the ground...
But you're never there,
When I turn around

Everytime I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
Everytime I close my eyes I'm not alone
And everytime I cry I'm right back where you wanted
I try to drown you out so,
Down goes another one

(Guitar Solo)

And how can I go on?
Coz when I'm in the sun
I see your shadow on the ground...
(Shadow on the ground)
But you're never there,
When I turn around.

Coz Everytime I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
(My dreams are haunted)
Everytime I close my eyes I'm not alone
And everytime I cry I'm right back where you wanted
I try to drown you out so,
Down goes another one
(Hey!)
Down goes another one
(Hey!)
Down goes another one

Down goes another one

Down goes another one

Down goes another one

(Down goes another one)

Down goes another one
