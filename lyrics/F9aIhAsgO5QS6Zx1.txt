Yeah I get it, you're an outcast
Always under attack
Always coming in last

Bringing up the past
No one owes you anything
I think you need a shotgun blast

A kick in the ass
So paranoid
Watch your back

Oh my, here we go
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower

Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I'm still laughing like hell
You think that by cryin' to me

Lookin' so sorry, that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well then, take your medicine

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here, to explain

That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight?

For yourself

I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality
If there's an afterlife, then it'll set you free
But I'm not gonna part the seas
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy

You think that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry, that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well then, take your medicine

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here to explain

That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight?

For yourself

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here to explain that the darkest hour never comes in the night

You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up and fight?

I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here to explain that the darkest hour never comes in the night

You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight?
For yourself

When you gonna wake up and fight?
For yourself
But when you gonna wake up and fight?
For yourself
When you gonna wake up and fight?

For yourself...
