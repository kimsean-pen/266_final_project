I was the one,
Who would always
Jump in first
Didn't think twice
To look behind
Got such a good feeling,
Just from playing
In the dirt
Once,
When I was little

We could build a rocket,
Fly to the moon
Leave Tuesday morning,
And be back for noon
There wasn't nothing,
Nothing that we couldn't do
Once, when I was little umm
Once, when I was little

Yeah I could dream more then
Yeah I believed more then
That the world
Could only get better
Yeah I was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life could
Only show me good times
Once, when I was little
Umm ohh lalala

There was a time
When I trusted everyone
Yes I did
There was no place
That I would not go oh no
Spend a day on the hillside
Next to the holly mo
Oh once, when I was little
Yea once, when I, I was little

Yeah I could dream more then
Yeah I believe more then
That this world
Could only get better
Yeah I was free more then
I could pretend more then
That this life could
Only show me good times
Once, when I was little

Used to feel so strong
Even when they tell me,
Tell me I was wrong
That I can't live
In a magic world
Cause it's time
For me to grow up
That I got to be
Like the rest of them
When I know
There acting up ohh

I could believe more
Then yes I could
I could pretend more then
That this life could
Only get better
I could believe more
Then yes I could
I could pretend more then

That this world could
Only show me good times
Once, when I was little
When I was little

So here comes the next one,
The next in line
Stay as young you can,
For the longest time
Cause those days flew by
Like a breeze
Just passing through
Once, when I was little
