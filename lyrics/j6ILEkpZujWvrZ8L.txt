A computer is an educational device,
it's in fact a direct reflection of
your own imagination, your own intelligence
And once you're given the freedom in which to
create things and see the immediate response on the screen
Then it becomes a very enjoyable experience,
you go on to involve yourself in many other things

It seems to be a very fantastic and
hypnotic field, once you start you just can't stop
It's something you can't explain

To the question of,
what is all this micro computer and
computer business is going to do to our society
The case is that we are humans and we are much
adaptable to our environment than the computer is to it's own

If you look at society as simply the collective contribution of
millions of human beings,
who carrying themselves certain power and influence and emotion
And every time you turn the switch off,
of one of those persons, you dampen the globe
It's the fundamental question of whether the society is going to find
a way to make itself as rich and as powerful,
and if you will as beautiful, as it potentially it can be

Go on like adventures, you gotta be people, and all of this
It's sort like, an adventure, a big adventure
It's fun
