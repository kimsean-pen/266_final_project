I've never had a feeling so right
Like I have with you
Can't explain the things you do
But boy when you
Tell me softly you love me too

It's like I know we were meant to be
So for eternity
You will have a part of me
And all I need
Is for you to stay right here with me, yeah

Time goes by but we stand still (know it does, I know does)
Love you for eternity, I will (I will)
I know that we were meant to be (we were meant to be, my love)
That's how I feel when you're with me

You are the reason that my heart beats
And no, I never thought I would ever fall so deep
But now I see
That the love that we share
Is oh-so-sweet

What if I told you that I believe (believe)
That you were my soul, my destiny (my destiny, yeah)
What if I was to say
In every way
Deep in my heart is where you'll be (time)

Time goes by but we stand still (i'm still right here)
Love you for eternity, I will (I'll never go)
I know that we were meant to be (we were meant to be)
That's how I feel when you're with me (how I feel, when you're with me)

Time goes by but we stand still (oh time, oh time)
Love you for eternity, I will (eternity I will)
I know that we were meant to be (we were meant, baby love)
That's how I feel when you're with me

As you hold me close, so tenderly
And watch you fall to sleep
I see in you the one (you the one)
Who now completes
The half of me I used to be (me I used to be)

Time goes by but we stand still (yeah-ey-ee-ey-yeah)
Love you for eternity, I will (eternity I will)
I know that we were meant to be (were meant to be)
That's how I feel when you're with me (feel when you're, when you're with me baby)

Time goes by but we stand still (but we always stand still, babe)
Love you for eternity, I will (stand still babe, and I know)
I know that we were meant to be (yes we were)
That's how I feel when you're with me

Time goes by but we stand still
Love you forever, yes I will
I know we're meant to be
That's how I feel baby
