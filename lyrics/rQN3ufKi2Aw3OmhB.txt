There's been some hard feelings here
'Bout some words that were said
Hard feelings and what is more
There was a bloody purple nose
And some bloody purple clothes
That were messing up the lobby floor
It's just apartment house rules, so all you 'partment house fools
Remember, one man's ceiling is another man's floor
One man's ceiling is another man's floor
There's been some strange goin's on
And some folks have come and gone
Like the elevator man, he don't work no more
I heard a racket in the hall
I thought I heard a fall
But I never opened up my door
It's just apartment house sense
It's like apartment house rents
Remember, one man's ceiling is another man's floor
One man's ceiling is another man's floor
There's an alley in the back of my building
Where some people congregate in shame
I was walking with my dogs
The night was black with smog
When I thought I heard somebody call my name

Remember, one man's ceiling is another man's floor
One man's ceiling
