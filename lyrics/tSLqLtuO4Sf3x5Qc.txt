Ladies and gentlemen
Today is a day for mourning and remembering
They had a hunger to explore
The universe and discover its truths
And they had that special grace
That special spirit that says
"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy"
The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger
Honored us by the manner
In which they lived their lives
We will never forget them
As they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye
And slipped the surly bonds of earth
To touch the face of God
