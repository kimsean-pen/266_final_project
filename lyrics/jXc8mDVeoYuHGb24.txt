Voodoo spell
Ocean mouth
Like a whale swallows you whole
Dentless, merciless, dentless
Merciless dictator
She slays the necks of giraffes
Merciless dictator
She sleeps on pillows
Made of zebra skin
Oh squawking talking blasted pigeon
Parrot portuguese black icky tongue
And purple cloud
Dry like painted desert flowers

Poison her tears are poison
Her tears are poison her tears are
Poison her tears are poison
Her tears are poison her tears are

Watch out for the snakes
Watch out for the velvet cross
Watch out for the panthers leaping from
Her spit
