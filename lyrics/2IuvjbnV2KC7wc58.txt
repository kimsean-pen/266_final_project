I must be doing this all wrong
Should be happy but I'm searching for the voice I lost
Guess I'm just human after all
I guess I'm just human after all

I woke up with the same dark feeling
Head on the ground and my thoughts on the ceiling
Another dream where the light is burning out
I don't know what to chase
My hope is erased
I look at myself and I don't know my own face
I just got fixed and I'm already breaking down

How do I feel when my wounds aren't healing?
Why do I stop when I start believing?

I must be doing this all wrong
Should be happy but I'm searching for the reasons why
Puts my head in overdrive
I thought I had this figured out
I should scream but I'm still searching for the voice I lost
I guess I'm just human after all
I guess I'm just human after all

You're no good so get up and change it
The way you feel is a little outdated
You'll never change if you'd rather hear the lie
I don't know what to say
I'm never okay
I try to dig deep and there's nothing but pain
I'm singing my songs but the words just don't relate
(I'm singing my songs but the words just don't relate)

It's time to live when my wounds aren't healing
Why do I stop when I start believing?

I must be doing this all wrong
Should be happy but I'm searching for the reasons why
Puts my head in overdrive
I thought I had this figured out
I should scream but I'm still searching for the voice I lost
I guess I'm just human after all

There's not an ounce of hope inside of me
I wanna die before I fade away

I must be doing this all wrong
Should be happy but I'm searching for the reasons why
Puts my head in overdrive
I thought I had this figured out
I should scream but I'm still searching for the voice I lost
I guess I'm just human after all
I guess I'm just human after all
I guess I'm just human after all
