To the top, to the top

You come from pride in show
In that little town you know
You said you wanted more
So your mama said let's go

Sarah smiles in denial
Sarah, Sarah you got no way to go

To the top, to the top
(There's a rich man with a spray tan
In a new suit he wants you
Thinks you could be great again
He'll broker the deal too
If you can abandon your standards and soul
He'll buy you a lawyer and chopper you up to the top)

You run from door to door
Until they tell you they want more
You sing their stupid song
And you smile because it's a chore

Sarah smiles in denial
Sarah, Sarah you got no way to go

To the top, to the top
(There's a rich man with a spray tan
In a new suit he wants you
Thinks you could be great again
He'll broker the deal too
If you can abandon your standards and soul
He'll buy you a lawyer and chopper you up to the top)

Privilege, power, darkest hour
Vision, malice, a crook, a coward
Privilege, power, darkest hour
Vision, malice, a crook, a coward
Fashion forward, fucks you over
Trap you, abuse you, for a small fee he owns you
Fashion forward, fucks you over
Trap you, abuse you, for a small fee he owns you

And I know you've got a thing for the big bright lights
And you dream about palm trees kissing you goodnight
And I know you've got a thing for the big bright lights (Sarah smiles in denial)
And you dream about palm trees kissing you goodnight
And I know you've got a thing for the big bright lights (To the top)
And you dream about palm trees kissing you goodnight
And I know you've got a thing for the big bright lights (To the top)
And you dream about palm trees kissing you goodnight

Kissing you goodnight
Good fucking night
