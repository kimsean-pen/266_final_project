They're the people that turn me on,
that's why I never bother.
I don't even care how mean they are.
So I don't ever take your calls,
'cause I don't ever want them.

Slow come on
Tell me you're scared
What you've done
Tell me you're scared
Dusk to dawn

It's a body that won't turn on,
So I don't ever bother.
Baby's got the blankest stare.
So I don't ever take your calls,
'cause I don't ever want them.

Does it turn you on?
Does it turn you on?
To feel the knife roll over slowly?
Does it turn you on?
Does it turn you on?
To feel the nails roll over slow?

Slow come on,
Yeah come on, come on, come on, come on
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Let me in, let me in, let me in.

Why am I so cruel?
Why am I so mean?
