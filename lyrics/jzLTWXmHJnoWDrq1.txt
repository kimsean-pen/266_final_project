Blowing over like wind
Electrifying the place
Knowing that all I want is to see your face
Your body's on my mind
And I can't seem to erase
Your footsteps pit patterned all over my heartstrings

But I don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while, oh-oh
I don't believe in love at-at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie

Your footwork's second to none
Prancing over my barriers
Knocking over all my insecurities
Watching you glide across the floor
Does something to me
I can't help but feel the way I do, I'm falling

But I don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while, oh-oh
I don't believe in love at-at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie

I don't know how-
But fell through into my life-
And made it all better
So stay a while
So stay a while
Just stay a while

But I don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while
I don't believe in love at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie
