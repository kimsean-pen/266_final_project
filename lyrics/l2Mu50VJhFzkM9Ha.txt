You say you're going but you don't know how long for
You say it's work but I'm not sure
You say you love me, then you walk right out the door
I'm left here wanting more

Of course, there's lots of things I could be getting on with
I'm never short of things to do
This afternoon I made a papier mache fish, mum
I made it just for you

Please, don't go
Stay here with me
It's not my fault
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three

My social calendar is busier than yours
I've been out making lots of friends
You can't play with friends, 'cause you're always off on tour
I hope one day you meet them

Please, don't go
Stay here with me
It's not my fault
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three
I'm only three

When things feel black and white
We'll do some colouring in
When you want to play
When you want to play with me

When things feel black and white
We'll do some colouring in
When you want to play
When you want to play with me

Please, don't go (Please, don't go)
Stay here with me (Here with me)
It's not my fault (Yeah)
I'm only three (Yeah)
I'm only three (Yeah)
I'm only three (Yeah)
I'm only three (Yeah)
I'm only three (Yeah)
I'm only three
