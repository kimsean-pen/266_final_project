Hey, love is everything, and without it I'm nothing (Nothing, nothing)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Nobody knows the pain I feel
Nobody knows but it's for real
I can feel it (yeah yeah) I do
Nobody knows that I miss you
Nobody knows but it's the truth
I can feel it (yeah yeah) I do

You cannot pretend that I don't even matter
You and I know better
You've been away from me for too long
It's time for you to come on home
No one can say what is right for me
They don't have to live my life
I need for you to come on over
I'll be waiting

I am nothing without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
Nothing, without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone

No one can see inside of me
No one can see how much I care
I need you (yeah yeah) I do
Nobody see the tears I cry
No one is there to dry my eyes
I need you (yeah yeah) I do

You cannot pretend that I don't even matter
You and I know better
You've been away from me for too long
It's time for you to come on home
No one can say what is right for me
They don't have to live my life
I need for you to come on over
I'll be waiting,

I am nothing without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
Nothing, without you baby (Without you here with me)
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
(I just can be without ya) Nothing,
(Can't sleep without ya) No one,
(Can't live without you) I'm so alone

I don't care what they say about you
They don't know how I feel for you
Don't care what they say about me
They don't know and they can't see

I am nothing, without you baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
And it's driving me, yeah yeah (Nothing, no one, I'm so alone)
(Nothing, without you baby) You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy (Nothing, it's driving me crazy)
I want you in my life, I do (Nothing, no one)
You showed me what your love can do (I'm so alone)
And for that I'm so, so thankful for you (Nothing, without you baby)
So thankful for you (Nothing, it's driving me crazy)
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone

Nothing without you, baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone

Need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Don't you leave me baby, baby
Don't you leave me, never leave me, never leave me
Need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Don't you leave me baby, baby
Don't you leave me, never leave me, never leave me
