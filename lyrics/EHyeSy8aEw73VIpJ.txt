Harlem River talk to me
Tell me what you think about
Harlem river I'm in love love love love
Harlem River talk to me
Where' we headed now
Harlem River I'm in love love love love
All because of you
In my pearl and my diamond shoe
I climbed a cloud
now i stole the moon
Harlem River
all because of you
And Harlem River swallow me
Put your hands around my neck
And Harlem River I can't breathe
They've got the lights down now
And Harlem River give me wings
Put my head up in the clouds
And Harlem River all because
Oh I'm nowhere now
Harlem River
The music's true
And in my pearl and diamond shoes
I climbed a cloud
and now i stole the moon
Harlem River
All because of you
And i don't know
I don't know
Just where I'm going
'cause i've never been
And I don't know
I don't know
Just where I'm going
Or where i've been
oh Harlem River
Like a diamond
Rattle
That easy rattle
Flow like that Harlem River
Rattle
That easy rattle
flow like that Harlem River
I ran for you
i ran for you
I ran for you
i ran for you
