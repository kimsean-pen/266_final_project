We're gonna shake the ground tonight
I lose myself under the lights, oh
I put my hands up to the sky
I feel it come alive

Everybody get golden
Everybody get golden
and put your hands up to the sky
Everybody get golden
just for tonight
Everybody get golden
so we can go until we shine

Now it's as good as it can get
Silver hills and silhouettes, oh
You press your hands against my chest
This isn't over yet

Everybody get golden
Everybody get golden
and put your hands up to the sky
Everybody get golden
just for tonight
Everybody get golden
so we can go until we shine

Just for tonight
and put your hands up to the sky
Just for tonight
so we can go until we shine

Everybody get golden
Everybody get golden
and put your hands up to the sky
Everybody get golden
just for tonight
Everybody get golden
so we can go until we shine

I feel it come alive
so we can go until we shine
I feel it come alive
so we can go until we shine
