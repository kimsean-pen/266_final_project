This is the way it's supposed to be
Push me on a car through the duty free
Hanging out a plane all across the land
Singing 'round a fire with the greatest bands
Then he comes along
He's going wrong like the hydrogen bomb
That white stuff
That white stuff
That white stuff
This is the way it's supposed to be
Push me on a car through the duty free
Hanging out a plane all across the land
Tellin' everybody we're the the greatest band
Come along if you wanna, don't ever stop
With the dolphin and your auntie and a prom queen cup
Come along if you wanna find out what to do
See what life is like in 2022
But then he comes along
He's going wrong like the hydrogen bomb
That white stuff
That white stuff
That white stuff
