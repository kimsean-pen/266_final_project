Lonely is the sound when the truth hits the ground
I lost all my friends that day
I lost all my friends
We were sitting 'round and I remember the sky
We could hardly feel that change, drinking our wine

I lost all my friends that day
I couldn't find a thing to say
We all went our ways and now we're out there on own
I lost all intents that day, saying things I wouldn't say
We all went our ways
And now we're out there on own

Years on the road, white-painted rose
Windscreen wipers on, silent radio
A few magnetic waves moving right through my bones
Waiting for the blood to come back to my toes

I lost all my friends that day,
I couldn't find a thing to say
We all went our ways and now we're out there on own
I lost all intents that day, saying things I wouldn't say
We all went our ways
And now we're out there on own

I lost all my friends that day
And I lost all my friends
I lost all my friends that day
And I lost all my friends
I lost all my friends that day
And I lost all my friends
I lost all my friends that day
And I lost all my friends

I lost all my friends that day
I couldn't find a thing to say
We all went our ways and now we're out there on own
I lost all intents that day, saying things I wouldn't say
We all went our ways
And now we're out there on own
