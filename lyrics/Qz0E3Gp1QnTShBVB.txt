I grant you a sign
With my bare hands
From the underworld
I drove you around
With no remorse
And now I'm dead to you

You saw my head spin
With your own eyes
I'm not immortal
It's broken you down
And torn you apart
And now I'm dead

Find me
Take me
To the void, to the crooked nest
To nekrohaven

The bestial screams
A life devoted
To the occult
The flickering lights
My dream came true
And now I'm dead

Find me
Take me
To the void, to the crooked nest
To nekrohaven

Now all men weep
In my bare hands
'cause the lion
No longer roars
And now I'm dead

Find me
Take me
To the void, to the crooked nest
To nekrohaven
