We're all out of catastrophes
And night would never end
In your sleep you called me Natalie
It was the nicest thing you said

We're all out of catastrophes
I just stayed in bed
You said I live for tragedy
So I threw the keys at your head

It began to follow me
So I found that old motel
I've been planning escape strategies
So I knew the way there well

I know I'm going to hell
I know I'm going to hell

Ooh, all out of catastrophes
All out of catastrophes
All out of catastrophes
All out of catastrophes
