Over and over, baby
Making me play this game
If true love waits, it's a big mistake
No need to feel ashamed

When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
I don't care if we get caught
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop,
I don't care what you've been taught
I say "baby", you say "bump it"
All you wanna hear is Gabriel's trumpet
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
All gonna drop
All gonna drop

If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
Sure, I know it's apocalypse
But can't it wait til I kiss your lips?
If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you

Baby...

You make me feel so helplesss
I meet you after school
I'm so tired of kissing,
Shooting and missing
Making me feel a fool

When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
I don't care if we get caught
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop,
I don't care what you've been taught
I say "baby", you say "bump it"
All you wanna hear is Gabriel's trumpet
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
All gonna drop
All gonna drop

You never wanna give me some
You're gettin' off on kingdom come
Well, if the Lord take you tonight
C'mon girl, you best treat me right
But I don't believe in happenstance
So you're gonna give me your last dance

If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
Rock with you
When I rock with you
Rock with you

If half of what they say is true
Rock with you
When I rock with you
When I rock with you

When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
I don't care if we get caught
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop,
I don't care what you've been taught
I say "baby", you say "bump it"
All you wanna hear is Gabriel's trumpet
When the clock says stop,
We're all gonna drop
All gonna drop
All gonna drop
