Dear Enemy
All that makeup that you wear
Will never hide
There's a devil under there
Dear Enemy
Are you really that insane?
To think that you
Are the only one in pain

How could you do this to me?
Tell me did ya feel good? Did ya get relief?
You know you're a super creep
Cause the things you do won't let you sleep
Got no friends only enemies
Now you got one more cause you're dead to me

Dear Enemy
Dead to me

Dear Enemy
All the words that you have said
Are like a cancer
That grows inside my head
Dear Enemy
I don't need to keep you down
Just keep it up
You'll run yourself into the ground

How could you do this to me?
Tell me did ya feel good? Did ya get relief?
You know you're a super creep
Cause the things you do won't let you sleep
Got no friends only enemies
Now you got one more cause you're dead to me

Dear Enemy
Dead to me
