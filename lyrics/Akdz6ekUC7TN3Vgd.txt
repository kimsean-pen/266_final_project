as we sit in the station
hoping we can go
out into the desert
the glaciers and the snow
on another planet
a million miles away
something stirs in a spaceship
something here to stay

our other half is missing
its floating up in space
the people there, they're looking
for another place
and now they've found it
but we were unaware
we did'nt know they'd be hostile
we did'nt really care

now they've got our weapons
now they've got control
they want to take our heart and
they want to take our soul
now they're coming for us
better make an escape
gotta take some action
before it gets too late

see them getting desperate
see their logic fade
see them panic and whisper
see their edges fray
and now their planet burns up
into thin air
we knew we'd kill them anyway
we did'nt really care
