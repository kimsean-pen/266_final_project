If you ain't made it now you'll never gonna make it
17 people in the dark tonight
You see some familiar faces behind the cellular lights

Child town in the winter?
Used to drink more than your man could
Waiting for the light
Waiting for the light
Waiting for the light

Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

All the things I steel in the car
Let it freeze, let them crack
You slept through the day and the night and the day
You're never coming back
You're never coming back
You're never coming back

Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive
