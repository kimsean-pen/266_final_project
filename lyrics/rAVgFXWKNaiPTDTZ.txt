Remember that feel of my hands
Running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life
Spending cash on shit that we can't afford
No this ain't the end
No I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade
I'll be your timekeeper
'Cause I want you more, more, more
Oh baby
Oh baby
More, more, more
Oh baby
Oh baby

Show you that first date at the ramen place
When I picked you up late
We were happy that day
You told me about your family
How they hate all your decisions
But you never felt it heavy, and you still had vision
Show you that first night when we just had sex
When your eyes rolled back to the back of your head
But now you're so damn mean is
It a cultural thing?
Guess that you forgot that night
When you called me a dream, heavy

And you cannot even tell me what's the reason
But you're addicted to a loneliness, that feeling
(Those flowers didn't help, huh?)
You say it's in your head, you blame the seasons
(Shit I hate this cold too)
But your addicted to a sadness to that feeling
(Whatever, just stay on your phone)

Remember that feel of my hands
Running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life
Spending cash on shit that we can't afford
No this ain't the end
No I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade
I'll be your timekeeper
'Cause I want you more, more, more
Oh baby
Oh baby
More, more, more
Oh baby
Oh baby

Show you that first fight at Hodges Bend
When we talked it all out, sealed it up in a kiss
But then you had another drink
Said you could not feel it
Until you threw that glass at me
When you saw I looked at him (Fuck)
Jealousy is quite a bitch,
And you thought that I was joking when I offered the hitch
I don't need all the memories to know we're A-team
And if you can't see that, then fucking leave babe

And you cannot even tell me what's the reason
(Goodbye RK)
But you're addicted to a loneliness, that feeling
(Guess I'll see you another day)
You say it's in your head, you blame the seasons
(And to RB, too)
But you're addicted to a sadness to that feeling
(Just keep that focus on you)

Remember that feel of my hands
Running through your hair on your bedroom floor
Caught in the thrill of a life
Spending cash on shit that we can't afford
No this ain't the end
No I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor
And if you forget, the memories fade
I'll be your timekeeper
'Cause I want you more, more, more
Oh baby, I want you more
