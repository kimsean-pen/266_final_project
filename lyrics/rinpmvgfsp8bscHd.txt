No tears are falling,
I'm hoping slow fall down
It's sleeping traffic, as close them on the ground
Pick up cellphone, and in my voice it's pulling down

It pulses down somewhere
God knows we're fall a sound
Ask me what I wanna be
Ask me what I wanna do
I'm knocked down
So really I am on

Been out of flame, beating at the wind
I feel so alone, why don't you just stay here
Brings more than summer skies are letting go
And to your ...asking what you wanna be
I ask you what you wanna do
You're all I do
So baby you're not ...
You're my ... yeah, yeah
Baby you're my ...
