Got jumped by a bottle of scotch
I was lying there till the sun came up
Open my eyes dustin' myself off
No one's around the shops are still shut
See my silhouette in the reflection of the window
Tryna make out if im lookin wounded at all
Started walkin' away from the night
And into the day to set my shit right

In a backseat starin' at the city lights
In a taxi, man I hate the city life
Take me back home I don't care about a fare
I just wanna go cause I fuckin' hate it here
In a backseat starin' at the city lights
In a taxi, man I hate the city life
Take me back home I don't care about a fare
I just wanna go cause I fuckin' hate it here

Got myself a coffee shot
But the caffeine made me edgy as fuck
I thought this place looked nice last night
But I was just lookin' straight through the smog
Way too many people and too much shit goin' on
But it all seems alright, at first sight

In a backseat starin' at the city lights
In a taxi, man I hate the city life
Take me back home I don't care about a fare
I just wanna go cause I fuckin' hate it here
In a backseat starin' at the city lights
In a taxi, man I hate the city life
Take me back home I don't care about a fare
I just wanna go cause I fuckin' hate it here
