I wrote a pretty pretty song
'Bout a pretty pretty girl last night
And I feel pretty damn lucky to get a chance and hold her tight
And I wonder is this heaven?
'Cause she's softer than satin
And I only have one thing on my mind
So hear me when I say that she's

All
And then she is so much more
My baby, she's all
And feels better than sex on drugs

I'ma take a wild guess and say she only gets free rides
And she's gon' need it, believe it
'Cause she's always outta breath
From running right across my mind
And I wonder where she's off to
'Cause I can't live without you
And I only have one thing on my mind
So hear me when I say that she's

All
And then she is so much more
My baby, she's all
And feels better than sex on drugs

That's right, she's all mine
And she ain't never gon' leave me
That's right, she's all mine
And God bless her for being with me
That's right, she's all mine
And she ain't never gon' leave me
That's right, she's all mine
And God bless her, God bless her for me
