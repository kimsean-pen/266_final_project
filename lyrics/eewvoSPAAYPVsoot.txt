Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

You walk and talk like you're new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend you're money-you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right so you can get the right reaction
It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone-nobody's on it (on it)
Where are your friends now, baby
All of the ones supposed to be there for

You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down, falling down (down)
When you're falling down

What's outta when you look in the mirror
The truth is blurry, but the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed-your smiles so elastic
You give me roses but they're all just made of plastic
It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone-nobody's on it (on it)
Where are your friends now, baby (baby)
All of the ones supposed to be there for

You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera 'cause they're all about to trash ya
Smile for the camera (camera, camera)
Smile for the camera
Who's gonna catch ya

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah, you (you)
Ah ah (you)
Ah ah

You (You) (ah ah) (falling down)
When you're falling down
You (You) (ah ah) (falling down)
When you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You (You) (falling down) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down

Smile for the camera, everybody's looking at you (falling down)
Smile for the camera 'cause they're all about to trash ya
