So love, so tell me when you wanna get under
I wanna feel it with you
So love, so tell me what you want when you want more
I wanna know what you say
Get down for the afternoon
Stay here
I'm ready
so come give me what you are
I wanne live it with you
One thing left on your body I can undress
Lay back lay back
Still you know I get lost in you
I can make you undress
let go let it go
See the lust don't break on us when you're putting on a show
One touch and my body goes slow
You know what you're doing
but man you're making me move
You're killing me with your eyes just like before
You know you got me
By the kiss of the lion I'm on fire man
I'm ready so come give me what you are
I wanne live it with you
One thing left on your body I can undress
Lay back lay back
Time I can show for love, wow
I can make you undress
Let go let it go
See the lust don't break on us when you're putting on a show
One thing left on your body I can undress
Lay back lay back
Time I can show for love wow
I can make you undress
Let go let it go
See the lust don't break on us when you're putting on a show
