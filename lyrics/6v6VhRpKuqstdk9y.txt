Cruelty is the better part of your honesty
And when you're so direct its just for yourself to protect
And if I started crying, would you start crying?
Now I started crying - why are you not crying?
Sometimes--when I--see a world inside
Sometimes--when I--I try--I really try
And hope's just another rope to hang myself with
To tie me down till something real comes around
And if I started crying would you start crying?
And if I started crying why are you not crying?
