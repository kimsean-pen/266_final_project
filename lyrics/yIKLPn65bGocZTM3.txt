inject your life in me, tap the vein so silently
speak the words that make me cry, say our love will never die
skip the days to live the nights, burn the candles, kill the lights
soul inside reveals the need, shows the world our love will bleed

my meaning of life, my dark affliction
she's better than fiction, she's my addiction

and this addiction cuts like a knife, it loves to watch me bleed
