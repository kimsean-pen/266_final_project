Don't stop, even if I'm wasted
I just want to feed the wreck in me
Cuz I don't want to loose
Fall apart to the pieces and rot and decay
I'm gone higher than ever
You just want to live inside of me
Cuz I know what you need when the grip
Pulls the trigger and you're forced to say
Don't let me go

I just want a heartburn
Tie me to the stake and start the flames up
I just want a heartburn
Let it out on me
Cuz I know that you hate me

On top, do you deserve it?
To hold my neck arrest between your knees
Cuz i know we collide to flow
Under ice and internal heat
Analyzed for my behavior
Know how the height
Will lead to vertigo cries in me
Cuz I know it's not right of me

I just want a heartburn
Tie me to the stake and start the flames up
I just want a heartburn
Let it out on me
Cuz I know that you hate me
