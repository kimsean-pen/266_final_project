Every now and then we all want somethin'
Even if there's no way of gettin' it.
If I stomp my feet quick that maybe be the way around it
Could I get myself around it.

Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
So give me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot

Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say well that's just life
I'll drown you out when I open my mouth
And make my way around it.

I always make my way around it.
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
Give me what I want

Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want.
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what I want

It's not what you want.
I'm not about to take no
For answer; NO, if I tell
You I can't I'm still gonna go.
I did it all by myself and I found

I found my way around it
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
Give me what I want
'Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what i want

That's not what you want.
It's not too lovely
It could start to get ugly

It really bugs me, if
If I don't get my way!
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got.
So give me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot.
So give me what I want
I always get what I want.
You don't wanna see me when
I don't get what I want
It's not what you want.
If I don't get what I want
It's not what you want.
