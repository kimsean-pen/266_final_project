K-hole at the Dalí
Seeing the unknown
Well it might have been a molly
'Cause my mind's being blown
Take the escalator to the next floor
Such a strong sedator, now I can't find the door

You turn around and you don't know where you've been
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

Like the minis at the Louvre
Spinning down the aisle
And the paintings of the Louvre
Now i'm feeling very smart

Like a 3-D picture, stereo's gone
It's a total light picture, kaleidoscope

You turn around and you don't know where you've been
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

And the k-hole at the Dalí
Seeing the unknown
Well it might have been a molly
'Cause my mind's being blown

You turn around and you don't know where you've been
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin
