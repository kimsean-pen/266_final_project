Following a lead of all my debts
I sense violence and know you're still a threat
If I'm using my hands, can you cut them off
You're a light turned on and I'm a moth
I got hit in the face, Your song is a wall
You turn around and drive into another black hole
There's a bed on my arm and you're the puddle beneath
Stop messing me up please stop melting
Don't tell, it's not evil
I'm looking through, a different view, still
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
Write it down, what you are reading
It turns to text, it loses it's meaning
I can feel myself beginning to shift
What should I hold, I can't resist
Does it make you sad, that it's my fault
I'm sad myself, I ruined it all
What's the science of which is true
I don't know anyone else like you
Don't tell, it's not evil
I'm looking through a different view, still
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
You are the reason
You are the reason
You are the reason my heart broke behind my back
