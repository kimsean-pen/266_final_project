Into the night I go day for night ...
I know what you talk about in your sleep wrap yourself around me
Not just a passer by I'm gonna stay awhile,
I like your peep show magnetized I saw you in the window,
I've been watching you don't know what else to do,
Trust me I'm sensitive intensitive I'll never let you go,
No need to be afraid release yourself to me I got that heart-ache,
Hubble bubble you know my trouble I saw you on your own no need to be alone,
let me levitate relax resonate turn off the lights,
Day for night ...
I saw your eyes on fire the desire won't release you,
I go where you go to I have to follow you,
So put your honey where your mouth is look behind you,
Relax and let me hypnotize I'd like to touch mmmm,
Standing in the shadows I've had my fill of it,
Too close to the light just for the thrill of it,
Hubble buble you know my trouble turn out the lights,
Day for night...
