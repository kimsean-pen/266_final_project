I hit the ground running
Running all the way from yourself
She stole my heart faster
Than a bullet down hurting him
She took the case and then grab the wind
She talked me in the finn she talked me in a silly way
My hands are shaking my knees are so weak
The rush I crave the longest you seek away
Away... away from today,
Away from today,
Away from today...
I open my eyes and roll to the side
And the surprising of the morning is the sun
She took to the wrong and left me alone
Before a heartbeat begun
So I drove through the night
And? the light
A hundred last days I thought a lost my way
She drifted away
But my hands are staying
My tears are black
Watch me as I turn my back and go, Away...
Away from today,
Away from today,
Away from today...
Away from today,
Away from today,
Away from today...
