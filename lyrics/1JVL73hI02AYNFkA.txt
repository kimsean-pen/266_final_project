Im so glad I got you hooked up on my drugs,
Everybody sings to the music,
Ha,
Are you feeling well now you've caught this bug,
Everyboydy dance to the music,
I think last time i took an overdose,
Come on dance to the music,
Hey, well It made me realise that I came too close.
Now im gonna dance to the music, music, music, yeah come on.

It can seem to have no relevance,
Bet you wish you'd danced to the music,
What you'll want to do is kill yourself,
So you dont dance to the music,

I can look at you and hear you scream,
Come on dance to the music,
And you'll tell me that your needle's clean,
Ahh.
Come on dance, dance

Come on now, dance to the music,
You know I need it, need it, need it,

Come on now, dance to the music,
Ow, I need it, need it, need it,
Yeah

Come on now, dance to the music.
