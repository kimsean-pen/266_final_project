in the school we talk about relations
how could you be so smart?
in the school we talk about newspaper
how could you be so dumb?

and we write sometimes
just to pass the time

hey mom
don't you worry about my spiritual part
i swear that i'll be fine by the end of night
one day these demons will disapear
and all these lies
they're never meant to be here

in the school we talk about newspaper
how could you be so dumb and grown up?
in the school we talk about relation
how could you be so smart?

we adapt a lot
just to pass the time

hey mom
don't you worry about my spiritual part
i swear that i'll be fine by the end of night
one day these demons will disapear
and all these lies
they're never meant to be here
