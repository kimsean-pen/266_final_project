Verse 1:

'Ye (Kanye) woulda said youre so "Amazing"
So how could you be so "Heartless" girl?
"Live Your Life",
(Take T.I.)-M-E
"Day 'N Nite" just like Kid Cudi
You'll think of me you will

Drake would say that
You're the "Best he Ever Had"
Rumors come and go
But you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go it follows
Can't understand I still love you
(watch the blogs talk about this one)
Chorus:

Soon as I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down-down-down
Cause you're a famous girl
For breaking hearts

You're famous girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
(x3)

Should've known you'd break my heart (heart)
Heart (heart)
Heart

Verse 2:

Keri would've said my love "Knocks Her Down"
Keyshia would've told me I was "Sent From Heaven"
Sorry B I don't wear no "Halo"
You were first to play the game though
Sorry I "Bust The Windows" out your car

I might have cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"
But I meant it in "Forever"
We were 'posed to be together
And I can't let you go

Chorus:

Soon as you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn I let you down
Down (down)
Down (down)
Guess I'm famous girl for breaking hearts

I'm famous girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl) (x3)

Didn't know I'd break your heart (x2)

(x2)

Hook:

Many hearts we should've left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure I wish time was frozen
Seems we lost our way
Now I hope you're happy being famous girl

Chorus:

Your famous girl (girl girl)
Should've known that you would break my heart (You're famous girl girl girl)
Should have known you would leave me lonely (You're famous girl girl girl) yeah
Shoul've known that you would break my heart (That you would break my heart heart heart)
But then again I'm famous girl (I'm famous girl girl girl)
I've broken my share of hearts (I'm famous girl girl girl) (yeah yeah yeah yeah)(I'm famous girl girl girl)
Should've known from the start that we would break apart
Didn't know I'd break your heart (That I would break your heart) (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
