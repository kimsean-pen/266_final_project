Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave
Based on a lie?
Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?
We know what will survive
Who will stop wasting the time?
Who will stop putting quarters upon on our eyes?
Who will not place himself higher than we
For a senator's prize?

We wander out wild-eyed
Kinda drunk and kinda high
We know what for and why
That's a (product), that's a (brand), that's a (lifestyle)

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
Yeah, the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood

Who could look up from the numbers and say
"Something ain't right"?
Who could disrupt the abundance and pray
Not for weight but for light?
How could we risk the empire
As the apprentice descends into seasons of idol
When our old white Lincoln encrypted and high
Sputters down from the sky
Red-eyed in July, weeping glycol?

We shout out loud, megaphone
Kinda zoned but listening in
We browse our own episodes
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
And the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood

That's a (product), that's a (brand), that's a (lifestyle)
That's a (product), that's a (brand), that's a (lifestyle)

When the predator dips out from the haze
Who knows the prize?
When the words mercy and justice are raised
Members only apply
When will we count all the signs?
When will we finally not let fear weaponize?
When will the courage to breathe and let breathe
Assure the land will survive?

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
Yeah, the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood

That's a (product), that's a (brand), that's a (lifestyle)
That's a (product), that's a (brand), that's a (lifestyle)
