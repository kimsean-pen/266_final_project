Remember when I didn't need you?
Well, I need you now
To hold my head
Up high, say it's all better child
Remember when

Some days I feel like a saint
I'm so alive
Some days I can't make any moves
It's like I have no spine
Can't do anything right
Now when midnight comes I've run out of time to
Make some kind of difference
But I realize
I constantly overlook the impact I've made
Maybe I'm looking to change my own face
To make you proud
I wanna make you proud
When you're looking down on me

My mind's wide open like starry skies
I ask God questions and wonder why
The hell that you're not here?
I wanna disappear
With you now

But I'm a selfish broken heart
And how I've got this far
Coping with the thought of holding you a minute longer in my arms
It's beyond me, I set you free
But I feel so guilty 'cause I take every sunrise for granted
Sometimes I forget your voice I can't stand it
You're a long from moving on

Brother, dub a free world
Take wing over the coast of
A better day
I'm stuck in my dark days
But I can be stronger than you remember
We're coming up on December
But I'm not cold

My mind's wide open like starry skies
I ask God questions and wonder why
The hell that you're not here?
I wanna disappear
With you now

But I'm a selfish broken heart
I wanna see what you see
I wanna be where you are
I wasn't ready, I wanna see you one more time, I never got to say goodbye

My mind's wide open like starry skies
I ask God questions and wonder why
The hell that you're not here?
I wanna disappear
With you now

Remember when, I didn't need you?
Well, I need you now
To hold my head
Up high, say it's all better child
Remember when, I was alone and
Crying out?
You will be missed
But I know that you're all better now

Remember when, I didn't need you?
Well, I need you now
To hold my head
Up high, say it's all better child
Remember when, I was alone and
Crying out?
You will be missed
But I know that you're all better now

Remember when, I didn't need you?
Well, I need you now
To hold my head
Up high, say it's all better child
Remember when, I was alone and
Crying out?
You will be missed
But I know that you're all better now

Remember when, I didn't need you?
Well, I need you now
To hold my head
Up high, say it's all better child
Remember when, I was alone and
Crying out?
You will be missed
But I know that you're all better now
