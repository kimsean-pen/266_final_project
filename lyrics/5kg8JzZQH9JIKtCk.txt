Tonight they're calling out your name
A light across the river
They're coming for you
Let me in and I'll explain

So dark outside here
I'm afraid I'll disappear
I know you're in there
I sense your fear

Surrender
I know you are hiding here
Come, my dear
You can hide in the night while I'm waiting here, all alone

When you're sleeping, I'm out here watching at your window
Can't you see me?
You and I, we are the same

So cold outside here
I'm afraid you'll disappear
I know you are in there
Just let me in

Surrender
I know you are hiding here
Come, my dear
You can hide in the night while I'm waiting here, all alone

Surrender, and we can disappear
Come, my dear
By the end of the night we'll be far from here, all alone

Now I know where you're hiding, and I want you to notice
The river is rising
I want you to know this

Surrender
I know you are hiding here
Come, my dear
You can hide in the night while I'm waiting here, all alone
Surrender, and we can disappear
Come, my dear
By the end of the night we'll be far from here, all alone
