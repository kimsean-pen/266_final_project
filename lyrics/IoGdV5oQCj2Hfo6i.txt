Down by the railroad tracks, I will enjoy you
Can't feel a single thing that won't fade away
We'll laugh like we always do when we hear the whistle
So high and satisfied, let's sleep for a spell

Pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent

Down at the carpet shop, you want to cut me
The patterns are laughing out, I know it's not fair
Go ahead, roll me up in your detachment
I'm here to decorate your fear for awhile

Pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent

You want to hold on to me
I want to hold out on you
That's what you'll tell yourself
As I fade away into your isolation

Pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again, silent
