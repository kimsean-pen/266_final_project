She's waiting, praying, that he don't drive tonight
She's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
His been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

Round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
She's all cried out on the kitchen floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' outta control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

He's in a hotel room with the TV on
Gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
Knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
He'd quit if he could
But one down, two down, three down, four
Can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore

Oh, round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
He's passed out on the bathroom floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

This ain't a game
Nobody wins
Yeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins
Again and again, again and again, again and again

So, round and around and around they go
Will this end? Nobody knows
Can't live like this anymore
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles
Yeah, spinnin' bottles
Spinnin' bottles
