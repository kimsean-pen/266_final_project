Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis

So far apart, I check that the coast was clear
I feel like a postcard, I wish you were here
A subway through the dark, carriage through the park
Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home with you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis

A thousand miles feels like a million years
Like hundreds of postcards that say I wish you were here
Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by
Dirt bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home with you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis
I left my heart in Metropolis

Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis
I left my heart in Metropolis
I left my heart in Metropolis
I left my heart in Metropolis

Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis
