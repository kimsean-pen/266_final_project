Some dreams
Are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words but
Seasons change

It feels
Like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
But time just runs away (time runs away)
No more day by day
You dream again and scenes remain
But seasons change

(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
Don't you know I need you baby

(Seasons change)
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change)
People change
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today

Forever
Seems so far away
There's time for love and for play
You dream about today (about today)
Feelings slips away
The winds that blow they go away
and seasons change

(I want you)
Don't hide your feelings from inside
(I need you)
I got to have your love now baby

(Seasons change)
(Feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change)
People change

(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
I got to have your love now baby

(Seasons change)
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change)
People change
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today
Just to have you here today

Ahh
(Seasons change)
(Feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change)
Seasons change
(People change)
People change

(Seasons change)
Seasons change
(Feelings change)
Feelings change
(Seasons change)
Change of season
(Season's change)
People change
Ahhhh
(Seasons change)
(Feelings change)
Oooooo
