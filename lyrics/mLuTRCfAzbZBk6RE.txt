In the wind, in the yoke
My ride will go
Central, remote
Any further and I'll know

Pressing matters bear

Through trials and time
I keep my feet right
In line for flight
So we never recognize

Pressing matters bear
An able wear and tear on you
Tear on you

Remind, remind
Remind, remind

Tear on you, wear on you
