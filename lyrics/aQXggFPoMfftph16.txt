I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down x2
You've been all up in my face
Out of line and out of place
Blurring views, distorting facts, every time I turn my back
I'll make you know your position
Don't talk, just shut up and listen
No way out, now you can't play dumb
Get up get up and come get some
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down
I feel the hate that you breed
It's the fix that feeds your greed
Set your bait, set your trap
Take a seat and watch me snap
I'll shake the ground that you stand on
I'll still be here when you're long gone
This moment is mine you can't have it
It's my to turn burn and reach havoc.
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down
DOWN!
Down, down I'll take you
down, down I'll take you
down, down I'll take you
DOWN!
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you down
I've had enough, I'm taking you down
Taking you
DOWN!
