You... You...
I know you want me, I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me, Let's remove the space between me and you

Now rock your body, Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me
Cause I already know what you wanna do
And here's the situation, Been to every nation

Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, Given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude
But tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know

That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
You're so damn pretty, If I had a type then baby it would be you
I know you're ready, If I never lied then baby, You'd be the truth

And here's the situation, Been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, Given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude
But tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
(huh)
(Luda)
Tonight I'm gonna do, Everything that I want with chu
Everything That you need, Everything that you want
I wanna honey, I wanna start with you
From the window to the wall
Gotta give you my all
Winter and the Summertime
When I get you on the springs
I'mma make you fall
You got that body
That make me wanna, Get up on the floor Just to see you dance
And I love the way You Shake that ass
Turn around, And let me see them pants
You're stuck with me, I'm stuck with you
Let's find something to do
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you, Ohh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
That tonight I'm loving you
