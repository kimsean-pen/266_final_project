How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end

The only thing that counts
Is the prosperity of today

Most important to us

Is that our bills get paid
Our good intentions
Have always been delayed
How can we let this happen and

Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
When we will stand
In front of heaven's gate
It will be too late!
Try to unlearn all that you've learnt

try to listen to your heart
No, we can't understand the universe

By just using our mind
We are so afraid

Of all the things unknown
A must we appease
Is the lust to get laid
Nothing really matters

Just devouring our prey
Our good intentions have always been delayed
Our generous acts have always come too late
When we will stand
In front of heaven's gate
It will be too late!

We are so afraid
Of all the things unknown

We just flee into a dream

That never comes true
Low to the ground we feel safe
Low to the ground we feel brave
Oblivisci tempta quod didicisti
Open your eyes

We're not in paradise
How can't you see

This stress is killing me
Fulfil your dreams
Life is not what is seems
We have captured time
So time made us all
Hostages without mercy

Seemingly generous
Fooling ourselves
Selfishly venomous time tells
Too much thinking
Goes at the cost of all our intuition
Our thoughts create reality
But we neglect to be!
So we're already slaves
Of our artificial world
We shouldn't try to control life
But listen to the laws of nature
We all think we're generous
But we only fool ourselves
The only thing that matters is
Our way and our vision
Selfishly we're venomous
But you know the time tells us
There is more to life than our
Higher positions, race for perfection
Better, faster
We must return to the laws of the nature
Free ourselves from madness
