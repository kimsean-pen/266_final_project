I always thought you were my friend
I never knew that this could end
I'm still thinking about you
Now and it's hard to find your way
I never wanted to let you go

You gotta run to me
Uuh can't you see
You gotta run to me
Uuh can't you see
You gotta run to me

I never needed anyone but you
Once again just let me be

Your precious Baby
So there she goes my girl
She's playing like a fool
But now we have to say goodbye

Some dem a fall ina out of love
When your body get not it's like a blessing frame above
An di qyai a make you crazy cause keep couscious cool ca
You love di qyai you wah show her you tool
You better free up free up with body and soul
You better give her your loving wad a kinda control
And roll and roll an roll and make her feel right
And make her die in your arms tonight

I never needed anyone but you
Once again just let me be
