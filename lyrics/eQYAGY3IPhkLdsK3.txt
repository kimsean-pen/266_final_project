You, you, you, you are, you are

Say my name again
Watch me start a riot
Push me to the edge
I know you wanna try it

Give me all your energy
Love me like an enemy
I know that you'll never stop
(So give me your best shot)

I need you to be
The keys in my ignition
I need you to feed
The fire in me
'Cause you're still my ammunition

You, you, you, you are, you are
You, you, you, you are, you are

You've been on my mind
Bullet through my system
Don't apologize
I want the motivation

Give me all your energy
Love me like an enemy
I know I should give you up
(But I just can't get enough)

I need you to be
The keys in my ignition
I need you to feed
The fire in me
'Cause you're still my ammunition

You, you, you, you are, you are
You, you, you, you are, you are
'Cause you're still my ammunition
You, you, you, you are, you are
You, you, you, you are, you are

I need you to be
The keys in my ignition
I need you to feed
The fire in me
'Cause you're still my ammunition

So don't hold back
Back back back back
So don't hold back
Back back back back
So don't hold back
Back back back back
So don't hold back
Put you in the gun and the gun kicks back

You, you, you, you are, you are
You, you, you, you are, you are

I need you to be
The keys in my ignition
I need you to feed
The fire in me
'Cause you're still my ammunition

'Cause you're still my ammunition
