The time is almost over
The people are divided
So come a little closer
I try now I can't fight it

Evoke the invective
Penetrate the malice
I'm counting down the minutes
From an hourglass full of ice

I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long, long, long
I won't be long, long, long

Can't you hear the catchy station
Coming from another car?
Broken air conditionin
No one has a clue where we are
Cause things are getting silly
We're covered in a secret
Buried in voluptuary
Cause there's nowhere else to keep it

I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long, long, long
I won't be long, long, long

I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long
I won't be long, long, long
I won't be long, long, long

Oh so silently we go
Oh so silently we go
Oh so silently we go
