Never do I dare think about this
Almost too high
To make sense of a 'Never do I"
Need not we talk about a "Never too high"

Strange dreams and weather
They have taught me a lesson
I hear strained screams from heaven
Singing: 'Save me'

(When I realized)
(That I'm paralyzed)
This can't be okay
Shadow's lying here and
It's blocking out the light
(I am paralyzed)
(On a different high)
And I really can't stay
For it's not safe here
Please take me or they might

Clever to try
And only dream about it
Clever to die
Come back and haunt me like this
Clever to lie
You were clever to try

Strange dreams and weather
They have taught me a lesson
I see stained scenes of Heaven saying:
"Save Me"

(When I realized)
(That I'm paralyzed)
This can't be okay
Shadow's lying here and
It's blocking out the light
(I am paralyzed)
(On a different high)
And I really can't stay
For it's not safe here
Please take me or they might

In another world I could be that girl
In another world
And time will bend until we meet again
Until we meet again
Just like that, the days went
Each day, a statement
Of your love, of my love
We get up, you let go
One black hole, too shallow
For your love, for your love

But my love is breaking
But your love is broken
But you r love is wasted
But my love is breaking
But my love is broken
But my love is hated

(When I realized)
(That I'm paralyzed)
This can't be okay
Shadow's lying here and
It's blocking out the light
(I am paralyzed)
(On a different high)
And I really can't stay
For it's not safe here
Please take me or they might

(When I realized)
(That I'm paralyzed)
This can't be okay
I have no place here in the absence
Of the light
(I am paralyzed)
(On a different high)
And I really can't stay
For it's not safe here
Please take me or they might
