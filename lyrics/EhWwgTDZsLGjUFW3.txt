I won't let you, talk to me like that
I don't care who you are to me
It's the last time I will turn my back
On you and us
You won't see me round here

PRE-CHORUS:
No matter what you're going through
I don't deserve this from you
No there ain't no excuse
And I, got to escape your energy
The thought, it takes me over

I'm gonna love you from afar (ah ah ah ah)
I hope you can be there
Wherever you are
I'm gonna love you from afar (ah ah ah ah)
I hope you can be there
Wherever you are (ah ah ah ah ah)

I wish I could help you get your shit together
But you don't listen at all to me
I see your potential and it hurts
To see you throw it all away

PRE-CHORUS:
No matter what you're going through
I don't deserve this from you
No there ain't no excuse
Cause I, got to escape your energy
The thought, it takes me over, over

I'm gonna love you from afar (ah ah ah ah)
I hope you can be there
Wherever you are (ah ah ah ah)
I'm gonna love you from afar
I hope you can be there
Wherever you are (ah ah ah ah ah)

But if you ever reach out your hand
I'll save you, I'll save you, I'll save you (save you from the end)
And though you act like you don't care
I'll say the things that you don't mean
You can be so mean to me
But I love you still
I love you still
I love you still

I'm gonna love you from afar
I hope you can be there (hope you can be there)
Wherever you are
I'm gonna love you from afar
I hope you can be there
Wherever you are

Wherever you are
I'm never gonna stop loving you
I'm never gonna stop loving you
