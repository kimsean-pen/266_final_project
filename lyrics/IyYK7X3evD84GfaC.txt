You know I've been hurt before you
Yeah, you know the score
And I know you want more
You want me to go out
Yeah, you know I get high score
I get cold when you don't go slow
But I know you want more
You need me to go out

And I know you were worth it
And I know this gonna work it
I could only let you win
But I'm freezing
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I will feel the pain instead
I'm not running again
I'm not running again
Even though I'm scared, baby

And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
I'm gonna let you win
And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting

There is my heart for you to hold
Feel the beat, feel the one blood?
Yeah, I feel the feather that I pushed through
And so and you you wanted more
And so I thought I'll

And I know you were worth it
And I know this gonna work it
I could only let you win
But I'm freezing

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I will feel the pain instead
I'm not running again
I'm not running again
Even though I'm scared, baby

And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
I'm gonna let you win
And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting

I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting
I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I will feel the pain instead
I'm not running again
I'm not running again
Even though I'm scared, baby

And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
I'm gonna let you win
And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting

And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
I'm gonna let you win
And I won't freeze you out
Like I've been
I won't freeze you out
My heart is melting
