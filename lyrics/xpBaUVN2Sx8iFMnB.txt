I was standing at the counter
I was waitin' for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart

After taking every detour
Gettin' lost and losin' track
So that even if I wanted I could not find my way back
After drivin' out the memory of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rollin' through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love and we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I had forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must've happened
And we must've said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once

If I stop to wonder how on earth you are
But that's just a lot of water
Underneath the bridge I've burned
And there's no use in back tracking around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bary

Are just bound to rise again
And even if the whole world had forgotten
The song remembers when
Ya even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
