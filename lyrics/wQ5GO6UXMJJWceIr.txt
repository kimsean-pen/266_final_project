Through fire and darkness
I'm riding alone
In burning debris
I'm coming home
Ashes and ruble
In eternal night
Silent remains
Of horror and fright
The demons appeared
With scorching breath
Descending from heaven
Like angels of death
Here I am now
Alone in the dark
Grief and despair
Are breaking my heart

Goddess of fate
What have I done
The vigor is fading
I'm longing to rest
Is this the end of my quest

Send me a sign
Give me a reason to carry on
Send me a sign
Give me the power to carry on
Give me a reason to live

Those years I've been suffering
In anguish and pain
Can't be just wasted
They can't be in vain
In determination
I look through the skies
To challenge the impossible
Cause love never dies

Goddess of fate
You must be wrong
As long as a heart
Is beating in my chest
I shall continue the quest

Send me a sign
Give me a reason to carry on
Send me a sign
Give me the power to carry on
Give me a reason to live...

Send me a sign
Give me a reason to carry on
Send me a sign
Give me the power to carry on

And in the winds
The winds of eternity
I hear your voice
Calling for me
And as long as this heart
Beats in this chest
I will follow the call
Forever I'll be on the quest
