When I think of us I see love that lasts
Until the very end us dying hand-in-hand
Death is whispering his answers to my fears
But with consequence I'd have to leave you here

I tell him there's no chance
I'm not giving him my soul
It doesn't feel enough but I know my heart is full
I'm not sure he's right
But I'm not sure he's wrong
I'm just desperate to belong

Her voice like a sunrise
His voice like temptation
She sings to me softly
He's screaming salvation

When I think of him there's comfort in the cold
He gives me solace when I offer him control
Her voice so beautiful will find me and explain
That life is agony but worth it all the same

I've been to hell and back
I've been living in between
Where the sky is always grey
And the grass is ever green
I'm not sure I'm right
But I'm not sure I'm wrong
I'm just desperate to belong

Her voice like a sunrise
His voice like temptation
She sings to me softly
He's screaming salvation

At home she waits for me
In hell he calls my name
At home she waits for me
(It's all so deafening
I can't escape the violent screams)
In hell he calls my name
(It's all so deafening
I can't escape the violent screams)

Her voice like a sunrise
His voice like temptation
She sings to me softly
He's screaming salvation

He's screaming salvation
