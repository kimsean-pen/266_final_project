The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot
I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you

No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it!
Ideas are the bombs in your mind
A fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon
You can't have mine!

I can bleed if I wanna bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face, it's my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oohoo, I'm not afraid!
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero!

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react
It's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

I can bleed if I wanna bleed
I can feel if I feel the need
This face, it's my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oohoo, I'm not afraid!
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil but I won't be your hero!

One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I waste a life times worth
Just to play to one more day

No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man! It's a four letter word
It's really absurd
The hate isn't fake, its just inferred

Oohoo, I'm not afraid!
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world

Oohoo, I'm not afraid!
And I won't let you down as I hold you in
Your looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil but I won't be your hero!
