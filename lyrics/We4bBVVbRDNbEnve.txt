All the money goes to a traveling way
There's little shock in a cabin train
Going overground through the i have knowns
Never nothing new

Eastern green, navigation's clear
Warm thing, thicker and see through

There are maps on the wall
Geographic claims with no chart of wind
For the wide wide plains
Silver shuttle steam shuffling across
Shaking off a root

Eastern green, feels me all the time
Something looking right through me

Eastern green, feels me all the time
Something looking right through me
Something looking right through me
Someone's looking right through
