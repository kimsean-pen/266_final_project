Coming to me in the morning
Leaving me at night
Coming to me in the morning
Leaving me alone

You've got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard

Running to me a-cryin'
When he throws you out
Running to me a-cryin'
On your own again

You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
But the picture has a mustache

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face
Coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face
You're coming looking like you never ever done one wrong thing

So many fantastic colours
I feel in a wonderland
Many fantastic colours
Makes me feel so good

You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
Got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard
