He will disappear to become what you want
The world won't fall apart when he's gone
In search of absolute truth, he's gone far
From delight to an ache, from an ache to delight

An scape in the night
Above all heights
Where something flares
A jump of consciousness and you'll see him there
The sky loves more those who suffer most
In the highest degree of suffering
In the highest degree of suffering

He will disappear to become what you want
The world won't fall apart when he's gone
Your soul looks at the body,
Like there is something else inside of you
Like there is something else inside of you

An scape in the night
Above all heights
Where something flares
A jump of consciousness and you'll see him there
The sky loves more those who suffer most
In the highest degree of suffering
In the highest degree of suffering
