Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it

You say you've found yourself a new sound
This ship's loaded and ready to go
A bit too much just like the old sound
Already heard it for the hundredth time
One hundred more, all have the same sound
Running around with all the sheep that you know
It's so sublime, they're breaking new ground
They're sure to have another hit this time, come on

Can't you just leave it alone, it doesn't have any soul
Just find a thing of your own and stop pretending to know

As the countless numbers hunger for worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

I'm still surrounded by the new sound
I've had enough and I'm ready to go
A stranglehold throughout the world now
The new obsession will fade in time
A thin reminder of the past now
All convoluted hardly ready to go
Their whines and moans will never last now
I think you've given us our fill this time, come on

Can't you just leave it alone, it doesn't have any soul
Just find a thing of your own and stop pretending to know

As the countless numbers hunger for worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

As it's blown apart, hundreds thrown away
Makes me question just what I believe
Brothers torn apart, mindless drones enslaved
Makes me search for an answer I don't want to know
It's like a plague from below
Killing all that I know
One hundred voices the same
Drench their sorrow in flame

As the countless numbers hunger for worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
As the countless numbers hunger for worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers they don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me

Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
