Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front manequin sleepin' in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walkin'
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the band so we never paid our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dress to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy you know its been awhile

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
Like a good time tease
I'm only countin' on your cancellation
When I should be countin' on you at my door
Did you forget about how we ran around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

Oh, oh anymore

I got some platforms sittin' in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city side walk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh
But you ain't gettin' uh uh
If you don't come pick me up,
(Damn!) Show me off (Wow!)
You might be tired but I'm not

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
Like a good time tease

I'm only countin' on your cancellation
When I should be countin' on you at my door
Did you forget about how we ran around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation

When I should be countin' on you at my door
Did you forget about how we ran around?

I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go round round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation

I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh oh oh oh anymore...

Yeah, I don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

I just don't get it!
