Ride with me baby 'till ya face numb
Close to the sun, we're too young
Pull up, pull up, pull up in a Maybach
Keep messin' 'round to get paybacks
Everybody wanna know who's real
Backseat, black limousine
Now let me show how I feel
I don't ever fuck with the scene

Now we got green light
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
Keep an eye on me baby
I'm all about the fight
So they fight me daily
Snakes bite
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
One fight
Watch out for me baby when I fight one fight

Nobody's down 'till the chips are
Trying paint a bigger picture
Back up, back up, back up all the real ones
Back to the day when we had none
Everybody wanna know who's real
Backseat, black limousine
Sometimes I'm all in my feels
I just don't fuck with your scene

Now we got green light
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
Keep an eye on me baby
I'm all about the fight
So they fight me daily
Snakes bite
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
One fight
Watch out for me baby when I fight one fight

Bite me daily
Daily, bite me daily
Daily, daily, bite me daily
Daily, bite me daily
Daily, daily, bite me daily
Daily, bite me daily
Now me baby

Now we got green light
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
Keep an eye on me baby
I'm all about the fight
So they fight me daily
Snakes bite
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
One fight
Watch out for me baby when I fight one fight

Now we got green light
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
Keep an eye on me baby
I'm all about the fight
So they fight me daily
Snakes bite
Watch out for the snakes 'cause you know snakes bite
One fight
Watch out for me baby when I fight one fight

Daily, daily
Bite me daily
Daily, bite me daily
Now me baby
