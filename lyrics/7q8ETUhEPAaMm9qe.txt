Push me closer to the edge.
Keep me standing on the ledge.
Every risk I fall for you.
Empty bed and sheets await.
Every time you go away.
I'm feeling empty, Plain and simple, will you stay? (My Juliet)
Cause' the desk is a mess and the walls are undressed, leaving echoes of anger and words we confessed.
This glass is tall I'll drink it deep with every secret we both keep.
Tie an anchor round' my waist.
Throw me to the crashing waves.
Send me to an early grave I beg of you.
Pull the trigger now in haste.
Kiss me til' I suffocate.
You'll be my Juliette as long as I'm with you.
We drink the poison no avoiding all the feelings inbetween
You're the drug, I'm the user I'm the fiend.
And we say "We'll be friends" and "I'll call you again" but I'll write you a letter that I'll never send
Please don't say this is the end (If it's the end)
Tie an anchor round' my waist.
Throw me to the crashing waves.
Send me to an early grave I beg of you.
Pull the trigger now in haste.
Kiss me til' I suffocate.
You'll be my Juliette as long as I'm with you.
Your lips, your kiss You leave me breathless.
This love, always will be the death of me. The death of me.
Whoah!
Tie an anchor round' my waist.
Throw me to the crashing waves.
Send me to an early grave I beg of you.
Pull the trigger now in haste.
Kiss me til' I suffocate.
You'll be my Juliette as long as I'm with you.
Tie an anchor round' my waist.
Throw me to the crashing waves.
Send me to an early grave I beg of you.
Pull the trigger now in haste.
Kiss me til' I suffocate.
You'll be my Juliette as long as I'm with you.
Whooaaah!
When I'm with you!
Whooaaah!
As long as I'm with you!
