She buys a new dress for the party
She always looks good in red
Turns around in front of the mirror
And disappears inside of her head

She wonders if he'll even remember
She asked him in a casual way
Just in case he didn't want to go with her
in that event she knew just what she would say

She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend
Even though she only has one or two
She's always done much better with boys anyway
So who needs girlfriends?

Pacing nervous across the floor of her bedroom
Gripping tight the phone in her hand
Fighting back the rush of emotions
And dreaming of just having a man

It's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But underneath it she's a broken girl

But it's a long walk and the music is loud
She see an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But she will always be a broken girl

She struggles with an awful decision
Stay at home or walk in alone
Her mother does her best to console her
Her father doesn't know what to say

Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress
Holds her head high then gets in the car
Tells herself that no one will notice
Assuming she can make it that far

On the way she imagines reactions
Cupped hands whispering into ears
Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching
And she's also hoping he won't

Walking tentative alone up the driveway
See some people smoking off to the side
She stops and waits until they go back in
Crosses her fingers and follows behind

It's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But underneath it she's a broken girl

It's a long walk and the music is loud
She see an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But she will always be a broken girl

He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man

He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man

He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man

He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man

He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down

This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
Hush child, don't make a sound
