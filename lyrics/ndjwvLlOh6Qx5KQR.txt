My destiny
I made a promise I couldn't keep
I left my love on northern ground
My destiny, my destiny

I'm so lost, I am damned
In this gray lonely valley
(I'm damned)

Starless night, so vast and so black
My prayers slowly sink to a whisper
I see your smile, but then I see your eyes
Through the mist of tears

I'm falling into the deep
I'm falling
Drowning in memories
(My destiny)
I made a promise, a promise

I'm drowning in destiny
(My destiny)
My destiny
My destiny

All my hopes, fearless pride
Drowned in smoke and ash
(And ash)
A color red
Forsaken blood on ice
The evening dance on me

And do you care
Where I sleep?
Do you mind my destiny?

I'm falling into the deep
I'm falling
Drowning in memories
(My destiny)
I made a promise, a promise

I'm drowning in destiny
(My destiny)
My destiny
My destiny

The color red
Blood on ice
The evening dance on me

Do you care
Where I sleep?
Do you mind my destiny?

I'm falling into the deep
I'm falling, falling
Drowning in memories
(My destiny)
I made a promise, a promise
I'm drowning in destiny
(My destiny)
My destiny, my destiny
My destiny
(It's my destiny)
My destiny
(My destiny)
My destiny
