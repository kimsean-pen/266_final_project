"...pinned down by the dark..."

Been fighting with my sheets
And nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well-taught gripe
The most restraining type
You should have racing stripes

The way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot
And you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me
I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I won't be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through
The thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And cause the audience

Of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam
She broke everyone's hearts
I'm pinned down by the dark

A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than i would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess, lioness

I'm pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark, oh

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
