Pain!

(Here comes the pain!)

Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way it better be
Don't you fuckin' pity me
Get up, Get off

What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war

Fuck it!

Who's the fuck am I to criticize you
Twisted state of mind?
Your leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass, suffer

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war

Go!

I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time gotta get mine

Yeah!

You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you

Sic! Sic! Sic! Sic!
