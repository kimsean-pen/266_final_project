Just put aside your grief
And insecure beliefs
And drive with me, side with me
When all you see
Are roads hidden between
The towns we know
And signs we don't

We're riding through the side streets
A place we thought we threw away
But we let it stay

We let the night remind us
To shed our skin and hope
To start again
Hope to start again

I can't forget I want you here
Everything together
If you don't mind now
A place we both remember
Just a little bit more than I can say
Everything together
Everything feels far away
Everything
Far away
