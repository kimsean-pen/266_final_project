Washington boulevard, eastbound
Thirty three
'can i get a transfer maaaannn?
95 cents!
Fuck you i'll skate to the beach!
And i'll look better gettin' there!'

There's nothing I'd like more than to let you in
But now you're on the other side and there's no way...
To feel your breath of life upon my face
Cause with the state you're in there wouldn't be a trace
Now I wake up every night with this emptiness inside
Hasn't been the same since you quit
the human race, left without a trace
Quit the human race, did you? Camina con la muerto?

Roses roses, pocket full of posies
Ashes ashes, we all fall down

Now i wake up every night with this emptiness inside me
Hasn't been the same since you quit
the human race, left without a trace

Death march baybeeee!

Nothing you can do to stop me
