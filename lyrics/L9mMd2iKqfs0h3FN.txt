I'm kin to the broken Aztec cup
I'm kin to the golden ram from Iraq
I'm kin to Argos recognizing Ulysses
I'm kin to greyhounds hanging from the trees
I'm kin to two stones making fire
I'm kin to melted ice giving water
I'm kin to the rock that made me fall
I'm kin to what I tread on
I'm kin to two stones making fire
I'm kin to melted ice giving water
I'm â€“ I'm
Kin
I'm kin
