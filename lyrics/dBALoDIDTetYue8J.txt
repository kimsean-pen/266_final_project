I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what
We had once I was wrong
It wasn't keeping me awake

You didn't listen (you didn't listen)
You didn't hear me (you didn't hear me)
When I said I want more I got no more
You weren't stealing me away, oh

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

All the memory's that we're losing
All the time that I spent with you everyday
I think is running down the drain
I'm feeling (feeling)
That we're fading
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems, yeah

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now

I can see we're burning out, so show me, show me
How you gonna turn it around?
Because

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me
It's not enough, it's not enough
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me
It's not enough, it's not enough
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
For me, yeah, yeah

Hey, hey
Oh, hm, hmm
Oh, hmm
