stirring at water's edge
cold froth on my twig
my mind in whirls
wanders around desire

may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i or have i too often now
craving miracles
craving miracles

no one imagines the light shock i need
and i'll never know
from who's hands deeply humble
dangerous gifts as such to mine come

may i, should i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
craving miracles

my romantic gene is dominant
and it hungers for union
universal intimacy
all embracing

may i, should i or have i too often
craved miracles
may i, can i or have i too often
craved miracles
crave

waves irregularly striking
wind stern in my face
thunderstorm come
scrape those barnacles of me!

may i, may i or should i too often
crave miracles
may i or should i or have i too often

all my body parts are one
as lightning hits my spine
sparkling
prime runs through me
revive my wish
inviolable

may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i, should i or have i too often
craving miracles
