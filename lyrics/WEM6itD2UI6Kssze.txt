While love seasons will undo so
Time forgives us and it takes control
Separate our face to put us back together

Very light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
If it was rainstorms

But i hands together to plough(not sure) obey
Like a show was over we just gave the walkaway
Or for the better
Worst for the way

Very light as a feather
Got You and I together

Meanwhile inside of me it was rainstorms... ohmmmm...
You didn't know... hmmm...
God bless your soul

Very light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
Very light as a feather
Got You and I together
