Yeah!
Yeah!
The time you walked into the bedroom
You were visibly upset
Telling me I made a bad move
But I didn't do nothing
And you start screaming, wake the neighbors
Now everybody's out for blood

I didn't want no confrontation
Because of you that's what I've got

Well you gotta chill out
'Cause baby I don't want to fight with you
And every battle we've fought
Just make us look like fools
No you can't have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting
And you know
Whoa oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack

It doesn't drive me to fight you back
And then I know
Whoa oh
That I'll never let it be World War III

World War III
Let me tell 'em
Now you're rounding up your army
Turning all your troops on me
Tell a lie just to feel happy
But I won't retaliate
No
No you cant have a World War III
If there's only one side fighting

And you know
Whoa oh

That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
And then I know
Whoa oh
That I'll never let it be World War III
Well you got to chill out
'Cause baby I don't wanna fight with you
And every battle we fought just make us look like fools
No you can't have World War III

If there's only one side fighting
And you know
Whoa oh
That there's lessons left to learn
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
And then I know
Whoa oh
That I'll never let it be World War III
Not gonna be World War III
Every time you attack
It doesn't drive me to fight you back
And I know
Whoa oh
That I'll never let it be World War III
World War III
World War III
