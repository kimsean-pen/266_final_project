Yeah yeah, she's the one
Yeah yeah, she's the one
When I see her on the street
You know she makes my life complete
And you know I told you so
She's the one, she's the one

Yeah yeah, she's my girl
Yeah yeah, she's my girl
When I see her on the street
You know she makes my life complete
And you know I told you so
She's the one, she's the one, she's the one

Know I'll never find a girl like you
But in my heart I'll always love you

But in my heart I'll always love you

Yeah yeah, she's my girl
The best girl in the whole wide world
When I see her on the street
You know she makes my life complete
And you know I told you so
