ay, ay, ay, ay
Memories of love

You know my world.
This is my right
You can take my love
but not my life
I dream of you
inside my mind
Love revelations
we will find
ay, ay ay, ay
ay, ay ay, ay

Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories of love
are melting in my arms (in my arms)
Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories will stay forever
with your love
Memories of love
Memories of love
Memories of love
Memories of love

The mood is right,
I'm feeling fine
When we move
our bodies through the night
You call my name
right from the start
My destination for your heart
ay, ay, ay, ay

Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories of love
are melting in my arms (in my arms)
Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories will stay forever
with your love
Memories of love
Memories of love
Memories of love
Memories of love
ay, ay ay, ay
ay, ay ay, ay
ay, ay ay, ay
ay, ay ay, ay
ay, ay ay, ay
Memories of love

Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories of love
are melting in my arms (in my arms)
Memories of me
and you go on and on
Memories will stay forever
with your love
Memories of love
Memories of love
Memories of love
