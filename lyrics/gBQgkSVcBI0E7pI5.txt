All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again

We sat on the wall of happiness
We sat on the wall of love
We sat on the wall of security
So high above

With his arms all around me
It was like a fairy tale
Two people so in love
Tell me how could it fail

The wall started shaking
I heard love cried out
Happiness is given away
Security is coming down

He fell, I fell
And all there is left to tell

Is all the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again

The walls started shaking
I heard love crying out
Happiness is giving away
Security is coming down

He fell, I fell
And all there is left to tell

Is all the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again

Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again
Couldn't put our two hearts
Together again

Couldn't put our two hearts...
