Hello again friend of a friend I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip shapshift and trick the past again
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up everytime
Everyone pulls away
Ohhh
From you...
Ohhh
Got balls of steel got an automoblie for a minimal wage
Got real estate I'm buying it all up in outer space
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip shapshift and trick the past again
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up everytime
Everyone ohhh pulls away
Ohhh
Its a mechanical bull and I'm the one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride
Pulls away ohhh
From you...
Ohhh
