[? to go out
We go away, don't want to go out anyway
[?] the wine
[?] with a knife 'cause we lost the corkscrew

We don't need a free weekend
I tell your best friends
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't even need to sleep in
Just to function
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't need a free weekend
I tell your best friends
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't even need to sleep in
Just to function
We can stay up late on a weeknight

We don't need everything they tell us we do
We don't need everything they tell us we do

We go out in a classy way
[?] so it's okay
We're talking 'bout the boys we hate
[?] at school, makes everything better

We don't need a free weekend
I tell your best friends
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't even need to sleep in
Just to function
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't need a free weekend
I tell your best friends
We can stay up late on a weeknight
We don't even need to sleep in
Just to function
We can stay up late on a weeknight

We don't need everything they tell us we do
We don't need everything they tell us we do
