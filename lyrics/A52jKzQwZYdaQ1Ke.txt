If finders were keepers, I'd still be at home
Take it or leave it, I'll show you the ropes
When you no longer see me
I'll be gone

So much for answers, I don't have a clue
I can hear ya, you're calling from outside my room
You're still locked inside me
Holding on

So I take what I can get
So I take what I can get

I'll break out your windows, I don't need a key
Show me your doubts and I'll make you believe
Yeah, you're still here to haunt me
You ain't gone

So I take what I can get
So I take what I can get

If you are coming home
I'll be out on my own
I don't need you
To give me back the open wounds
But if you start to shed your skin
Naked heart - wearing thin
When you call
I'll be here
Once again

So I take what I can get
So I take what I can get
What I can get
