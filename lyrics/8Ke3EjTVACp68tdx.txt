Can you feel the lightning covering your skin, it's the (nightmare?)
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

I'm having visions, infinite visions
The same ones as you
I try not to worry, but I always worry
Til all I can do...
Is wish I could stay here, feeling forever
Before I must go
Wish we could change it to before we changed it
What did we know?

10, 000 Eyes and 400 hands
And all of my arms are made of the sands
And oceans have all been dried up and left
They became the skies and then they all wept
The first time they heard the song from Tom Petty
The one where Johnny Depp plays the rebel named Eddie
The sky was the limit and then it came crashing down

Can you feel the lightning covering your skin, it's the (nightmare?)
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

I'm having visions, infinite visions
Of something new
You feel it changing, slowly the changing
About to break through

10, 000 Eyes and 400 hands
And all of my arms are made of the sands
And oceans have all been dried up and left
They became the skies and then they all wept
The first time they heard the song from Tom Petty
The one where Johnny Depp plays the rebel named Eddie
The sky was the limit and then it came crashing down

Can you feel the lightning covering your skin, it's the (nightmare?)
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired
But you're not tired
But you're not tired
But you're not tired

I'm having visions, Infinite visions
The same ones as you
I'm having visions, infinite visions
Of something new

I'm having visions, Infinite visions
The same ones as you
I'm having visions, infinite visions
Of something new
