Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin' I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together

Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
'cause in my heart I know
Love will lead you back

Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining

One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back
One of these nights
We'll I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say

Oh, how much you miss me
You walked out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Oh, darling I know

Oh, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes
Sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that

Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as the stars are shining
One day you will find me again

It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back
Ahhh...
But I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know... oh yeah.
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back
Hey yeah... love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long...
One of these days our love will lead you back
Ahhhhh...
