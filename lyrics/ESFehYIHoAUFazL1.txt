He didn't walk up with that "How you
doin'?" (Oh, and he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can

I knew him forever in a minute (That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him

He got me feeling like
Oh, I knew it when I met him, I loved him when I left him
Got me feeling like
Oh, and then I had to tell him, I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, oh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, oh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana, my heart is in Havana
Havana, oh na-na

Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, yeah
Bump on her bumper, bump on her bumper like a traffic jam

Oh, I knew it when I met him, I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oh, and then I had to tell him, I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, oh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, oh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana, my heart is in Havana
Havana, oh na-na

Havana, oh na-na
