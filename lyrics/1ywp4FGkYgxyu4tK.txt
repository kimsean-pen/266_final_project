You gave my shirt back, I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told, but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long
I-I-I want to go wherever you are
I-I-I want to be whatever you are
I-I-I want to see whatever you are
You said love's a fragile thing

Made of glass, but I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

You've gotta work it out, make it stronger
Try for me, just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle

It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I can turn this pain around
I'd fly to where you are right now

Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
We can move, or spend the night alone together
Although we're good listening, but you don't have much to say
Wake up you, you won't pick up the phone, whatever
You're probably sleeping, I hope we're still OK
I-I-I want to go wherever you are
I-I-I want to be whatever you are

I-I-I want to see whatever you are
You said love's a fragile thing
Made of glass, but I think

Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You've gotta work it out, make it stronger
Try for me, just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle

Your heart is a muscle
It's time like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle

It's time like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I can turn this pain around
I'd fly to where you are right now

Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
If I can turn this pain around
I'd fly to where you are right now

Write your name into thes ky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
You said love's a fragile thing
Made of glass, but I think
Your heart is a muscle

Your heart is a muscle
You've gotta work it out, make it stronger
Try for me, just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
It's time like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle (make it stronger)
It's time like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I can turn this pain around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
