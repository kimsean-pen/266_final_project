Oh baby baby tears
Go catch me under the door
Go catch me under the door way
Turn away baby sought
Leading tears
Go catch me under the door
Go catch me under the door way

So slow your ...I can see who is drinking my thoughts
White tears so slowly white tears this plane is ticking of
This plane is ticking of
