How did I get to here?
A random chain of events
Or chemical and elements
Conspiring, divining

From the star I've been pulled apart
By weightless love
And the heavy hearts
Of sadness

Oh, I was born blown minded
With an eye on oblivion
oh, I was born blown minded
With an eye on oblivion

In my heart I have lived without aught
It's been the war of attrition
Between a small-minded fool
And sublime intuition

I believe there's a meteor out there
With my name on it
Hurtling through space
And nothing can stop it

Oh, I was born blown minded
With an eye on oblivion
Oh, I was born blown minded
With an eye on oblivion
