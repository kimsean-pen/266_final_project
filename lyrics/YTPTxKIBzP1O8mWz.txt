Not another second to lose
You just walk away
You see it's gone
Not an other second to live
And you hear my voice
And now it's gone
Whatever happened to our love
It seems so strange to me
That you're running away
And then I think of what I've done
And it's not strange to me
That you're running away
It's a fear (4x)

Do you think of me now
Just you and me
What I wouldn't do or say
And I feel like I was left alone
Then it's like news to my heart
And I'm walking back because I want
Whatever happened to our love
And it's so strange to me
That you're running away
And when I think of what I've done
Than it's not strange to me
That you're runnung away
It's a fear (8x)
It's a fear (8x)
