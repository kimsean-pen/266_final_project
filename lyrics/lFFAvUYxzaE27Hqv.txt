There's a faded shot of me
Of a faded time
When out of frame I could be seen
Kissing back your lies
And now I'm, I'm forever ever never yours
I never cross your mind
Bloody forever, tonguing again the sores, you're mine
You're ever ever mine
You're ever ever mine
You're ever never...

Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tie
(I shall follow it, I shall follow you)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue
And I shall follow you

There's a fading shot of me
Of a squandered time
Just out of shot he could be seen
Kissing back your lies
That's why I â€“ I'm forever tonguing again the sores, you're mine
You're ever, ever mine
You're ever, ever mine
You're ever, ever...

Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tie
(I shall follow it, I shall follow you)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue
And I shall follow you

Did we really bleed?
(Did we really bleed?)
Was it healing you?
To go that you needed to heal it in me
Was it really you?
There within my frame
Was it healing you?
Pushing back the pain
He was kissing back your truth

Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tie
(I shall follow it, I shall follow you)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue and I shall follow
(I shall follow)
Drawing blood that draws my tongue
And I shall follow you
