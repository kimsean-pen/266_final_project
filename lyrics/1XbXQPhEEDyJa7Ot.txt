take one step see how it goes
nobody wants to listen
there's never time to get what i'm owed, nobody thinks it's worth it

but i think we're getting on so well

she's always there when i'm not
and never here to listen
my drugs don't do anything
i don't know why i bother

cuz it's getting really hard to tell
i know i like to get it wrong from time to time
but i think we're getting on so well
