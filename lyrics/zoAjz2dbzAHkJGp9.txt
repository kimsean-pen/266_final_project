You call me a dog well thats fair enough
cause it ain't no use to pretend
You're wrong
When you call me out I cant hide anymore
I have no disguise you cant see through

Well you say its bad luck
To have fallen for me
Well what can I say to make it good for you
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold

But when its my time to throw
The next stone
Ill call you beautiful if I call at all

You tell me I'm low cause Ive slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers & wolves
You threw me out cause I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal

But when its my time to throw the next stone
Ill call you beautiful if I call at all
And when its my time to call your bluff
Ill call you beautiful or leave it alone
You call me a dog
Well thats fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
Bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and
You drag me along
