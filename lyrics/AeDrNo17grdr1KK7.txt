Hoping they could treat you better
Are you running out of patience?
Kissing up to fortune-tellers
Have you given up already?

You're uncertain, falling out of focus
I can hear you talking in your sleep

Waiting for your bus even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of talking in your sleep
Waiting for a love even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
You can't seem to break out of it
Lucid dreams and sunken treasure
Lost another one too many

Ooh, you're uncertain, falling out of focus
I can hear you talking in your sleep
Waiting for your bus even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of talking in your sleep

Waiting for a love even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
You can't seem to break out of it
Is the figure getting any closer? Closer?
Overheard you saying that you're scared of this silence around you
In the back of the gutter of your mind I can already see it
Tell me you see it.

And you can't seem to break out of it!!
Waiting for your bus even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
And you can't seem to break out of talking in your sleep
Waiting for a love even though you know you'll end up walking a mile on your own
You can't seem to break out of it.
