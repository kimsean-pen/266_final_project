She spoke to me, approaching me
On a road so dark and dreary
Her black halo walked by me
Disappearing so far behind
She travelled not alone
An old wife followed on her side
And snakes crawled behind her steps
And crows circled overhead

Time and again they come to me
In the darkness of the night
And the raven-haired girl
Whispers her listless words

"Do not look at me
I am the daughter of hate
You must not see me
Never touch my heart
Never"
The words of raven-haired girl
"Do not look at me
'Cause I'm the daughter of hate"

Each morn I swear, each day I pledge
Should we yet meet
On the road of dream
That we would look each other in the eye

Time and again they come to me
In the darkness of the night
And the raven-haired girl
Whispers her listless words

"Do not look at me
I am the daughter of hate
You must not see me
Never touch my heart
Never"
The words of raven-haired girl
"Do not look at me
'Cause I'm the daughter of hate"

First come the ravens, swirling overhead
Your words, the hiss of snake
The old wife is ever silent
Your words, the hiss of snake

Kun taivas taas on pimeä
Ja tuuli tuo askelten äänet
Odotan kuun alla
Vaanin varjojen välissä
Ensin tulivat korpit
Kieppuivat kulkueen yllä
Vanha vaimo on sanaton
Sinun sanasi käärmeen kuiskaus on

"Do not look at me
I am the daughter of hate
You must not see me
Never touch my heart
Never, never"

Your words, the hiss of snake
Whispered in my ear
The words of raven-haired girl

"Never, never
Do not look at me
'Cause I'm the daughter of hate"
