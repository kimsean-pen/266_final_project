There are clouds on the horizon.
Shifting colors, heavy rain.
High above the roaring thunder.
Shooting bullets through your brain.

There's something wicked left behind.
A befell sight, a calming, sinister state of your mind.
Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell.

The gate is open lift the curse.
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite.
At the Threshold of the universe.
We will rise!
Late at night they heard the sirens.
From a place so far away.

A light forces mighty brethren in a vesture of decay.
They are the legions of the night.
Turning darkness into... turning the dark into light.
Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell.

The gate is open lift the curse.
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite.
At the Threshold of the universe, universe.

Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell.
The gate is open lift the curse.
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite.
At the Threshold of the universe.
Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell.
The gate is open lift the curse.
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite.
At the Threshold of the universe, universe, universe, universe.
