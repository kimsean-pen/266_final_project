I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
Cos in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could hire a car
Cos in a car you can go far
It just depends what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
And she said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
And she didn't half talk a lot
About a lot of things that I forgot

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

She said, shut your moanin'
Because your wastin' my time
Shut up moanin!
Because your wasting my time

My time, my time, my time,
my time, my time

I said I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
Cos in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could take a car
Cos in a car you can go far
It just depends what kind of car you are...
