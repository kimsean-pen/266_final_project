Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an known enemy

Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old enemy

Memory, memory
Memory, memory

Come doused in mud
Soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old enemy

Memory, memory
Memory, memory

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun

Memory, memory
Memory, memory

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun, no I don't have a gun

Memory
Memory...
