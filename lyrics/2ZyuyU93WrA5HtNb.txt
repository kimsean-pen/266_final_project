She's a reckless lover with her blood stained hands
'Round the neck of her helpless man
She's the midnight silence, an outbound train
She's glory of fallen names

Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore

She's a patient killer, a timeless hand
The choke of the falling sands
She's a proven saint with a witches tongue
The gods of war at her command

Sweet Aya, bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya, bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone

Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore

She's the broken shadows on the fallen walls
With no master there's no call
She's the faithful silence that visits all
With no mercy, no remorse

Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore

Sweet Aya, bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya, bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone

Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone
And there's no room here anymore

Aya, Aya, we're alone
There's no room here anymore
Aya, Aya, we're alone
