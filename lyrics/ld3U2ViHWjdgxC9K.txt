We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a path of will up ahead?
Or are we just destined to get what we get?
True to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
We steal the molecules from the dead
We liberate inanimate objects
Is this a sign of will in our head?
Or are we predestined to get what we get?
True to your face like never before
Even the mistakes aren't really mistakes at all
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
We're just fragments of a great collide
I wanna confess that you own me
And we don't rest if we're lonely
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
There's innocence in the moment
Maybe now's the time to be alive
