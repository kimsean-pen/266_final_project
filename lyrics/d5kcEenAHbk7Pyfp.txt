Leave the waves of Galveston but only if you can
Cause you've been hit behind the seawall, gently folded in the sand
Papa left you for Heaven after your Mama lost her song
And though your baby left you for
Houston, no one stays there very long

There's a graveyard by the pizza parlor, a gate that only closes
Snowbirds fly away like secrets sn one really wants to know
The climbing moon's always shining on the kind of shells you keep
The broken horse tied to the water tower's running in his sleep

It's too bad that you ain't got a soft place to fall
It's too bad Texas leans to the least of us all
And says, "If you can make the music then you can have the dance
If you can shoot the pistol then you can wear the pants"

So leave the waves of Galveston but only if you can
Cause it's the only place the Lone Star kind have offered you a hand
Your baby left you nothing and a dog was left for dead
You never knew you were a burden til it hit you on the head

It's too bad that you ain't got a soft place to fall
It's too bad Texas leans on the least in us all
And says, "If you can make the music then you can have the dance
If you can shoot the pistol then you can wear the pants"
