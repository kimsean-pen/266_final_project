You talk like you need me, like you'll never leave me
Until I begin to believe it
I was good on my own, until you came along
With the fire need to fold, now you're gone, baby gone

If you don't mean it, don't you say it
If you don't feel, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it? Why'd you take it?
How come you bought it just to break it?
If you don't love me, don't say, don't say you do!

They spot since I've seen a trace of your face
What's new then when things got to the tension?
I beg just be honest, you said that you promised
My disbelief lost in suspension
I was good on my own until you came along
With the fire need to fold, now you're gone, baby gone

If you don't mean it, don't you say it
If you don't feel, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it? Why'd you take it?
How come you bought it just to break it?
If you don't love me, don't say, don't say you do!

Got your fame, and your name, and the beautiful people
I guess I can't say I'm surprised
But who's gonna love you when all that you've got
Is your name and your fame, and your lies?
And your lies?!

If you don't mean it, don't you say it
If you don't feel, don't you fake it
If it's a lie, baby, don't say it's true
If you don't want it? Why'd you take it?
How come you bought it just to break it?
If you don't love me, don't say, don't say you do!
