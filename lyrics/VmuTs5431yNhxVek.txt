I have boyfriend
He says I'm his only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young

So young
Can't marry no one
No one
Ooo...

They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
My heart's direction

So young
Can't marry no one
No one
Ooo...

I'm, I'm, I'm, so young
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so young
I'm, I'm, I'm, so young
Can't marry no one
No one
Ooo...

Gotta go now
Cry myself to sleep
My lovin' baby
Will have seen the last of me

So young
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
Can't marry no one
