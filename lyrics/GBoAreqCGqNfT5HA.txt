The day, the day that you left here
A crown was placed upon me
I was the king of nothing
Inside this cell of skin

Thoughts like ice against the wall
In a home where lies taught us all
Relax into that place deep within
Deep in the skin, you know where you've been
Why don't you sing to me?
A song of sanctuary

You could have all you wanted
Sing
You could build it all from nothing
Sing to me
You can live a life alone
Sanctuary
But you can never call this

A home that's beneath us
Somewhere the light won't reach us
The sky and the earth that birthed you
Just another burden that hurts too
Much to say, just separate from all these faces you cannot recall
I'd do the same, and leave just how I came

King for today
But a fool forever
Relax, and come on home

You could have all you wanted
Sing
You could build it all from nothing
Sing to me
You can live a life alone
Sanctuary
But you can never call this home

You can never call this home
Relax deep within
Inside this cell of skin
You can never call this...
Home

King for today
But a fool forever
You could have all you wanted
You could build it all from nothing
You can live a life alone
But you can never call this home
