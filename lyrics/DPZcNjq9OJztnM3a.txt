I'll build you a shiny dollhouse or church
For you to shrink into a tiny wight spider
And gorge on horrid memories with conceited wings

Smother the past in a cocoon for me
And I'll help you move all the bodies, oh, oh

I'll possess you but I don't need you
To be another one of my possessions
I don't need you to be my possession

And I won't make you kneel for anyone but me
Won't promise a star, don't promise your soul
We'll say that we don't believe

I'll keep you wet when the world is dry
I can see them coming I'll take you back inside
If they came for answers I'll wrap my claws around your mouth tight
We'll consume each other until there's nothing left to hide
And they can all drown in our blood

I'll possess you but I don't need you
To be another one of my possessions
I don't need you to be my possession

And I won't make you kneel for anyone but me
I won't promise a star, don't promise your soul
We'll say that we don't believe

And I won't make you kneel for anyone but me
I won't promise a star, don't promise your soul
We'll say that we don't believe

We can't haunt this home, home anymore
No, no, no, no, no
We can't haunt this home, home anymore
No, no, no, no, no

We can't haunt this home, home anymore
No, no, no, no, no
We can't haunt this home, home anymore
No, no, no, no, no
