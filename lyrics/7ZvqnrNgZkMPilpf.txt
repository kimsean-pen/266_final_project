This love is torturing me
A thousand miles an hour again
And all that stays with me
Is the fear inside my gut
You're the fear inside my gut

You've been my reason to breathe
The gravity that pulls me in
I can't escape the weight of your ultraviolent heart
Of your ultraviolent heart

You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
You've been my reason, reason to breathe, reason to breathe
