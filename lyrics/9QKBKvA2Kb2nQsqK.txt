I've been stagnant. I've been bored,
Think I've seen it all before,
Chewing on a different age, You got carried away.

Mirror image for the worse,
Another one out of the herd,
Take a look around and say that you can tell the difference.

Put a gun up to my head, wouldn't miss me if I left
Negative opinions fall from me.

I've been so sick of flowers on everything,
Someone told me I'm crazy, keep it in.
Thousands under a dim light, it's hard to see.
Guess it's just me. Oh well...

Symmetry in everything, but one side is always fake.
Take a look around and say that you can tell me different.

They killed everything. I'm falling asleep.
You're missing the point again.

I've been so sick of flowers on everything.
Someone told me I'm crazy. Keep it in.
Thousands under a dim light. It's hard to see.
Guess it's just me. Oh well...
