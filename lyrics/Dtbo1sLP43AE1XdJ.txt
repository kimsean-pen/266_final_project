Every year goes by.
Never ending change and I start to miss the ones
I've kept the closest to me.
Their names spoken now in memory.

I've always tried to carry my
Words without deceptive cause but clear objective.
I've shed the youth I lived in.

My head feels so heavy my heart follows suit,
Is this what I wanted to turn into?
You don't have to stay, and wonder who I've become.
I'm the story of the one you used to love.
I'm the story of the one you used to love.

Every time that I never seem to answer why
I'm ignoring all the calls from home to be alone.
A foreign voice or dial tone?
I'm ignoring all the calls from home to be alone.
A foreign voice or dial tone?

My head feels so heavy my heart follows suit,
Is this what I wanted to turn into?
You don't have to stay, and wonder who I've become.
You don't have to stay, you don't have to stay,

Your eyes look so heavy, I had to concede.
Is this what you wanted to prove to me?
You don't have to stay and wonder who I've become.
Who have I become?
I'm the story of the one you used to love.
I'm the story of the one you used to love.

I spent the morning looking down at the baggage claim.
With yesterday, your hand in mine, sitting as you laid.
A world away and now the words soak into my head,
That your chest has stilled and I'll never see you again.
I'll never see you again.

I swear to god I tried to come back home, be by your side,
To hold you close while the sorrow spread to divide us both.
I swear to god I tried, I swear to god I tried.

I'm the story of the one you used to love.
I didn't want this.
I'm the story of the one you used to love.
I didn't want this.

I swear to god I tried to come back home, be by your side,
To hold you close while the sorrow spread to divide us both.
I swear to god I tried, I swear to god I tried.
I tried!
