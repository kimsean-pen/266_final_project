And a lightning rod hammer stop
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenchin' up his shit

She was writing his name in blood
You know I saw his woman

She said she was his baby
Who looked just like the hoover dam
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock

He's a killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead

He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer stop
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenchin' up his shit

He's a killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead... yeah
Killboy powerhead... yeah
