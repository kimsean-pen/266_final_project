When I'm in the woods I know what to call you now
When I'm in the woods I know what to call you now

Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf

Well maybe the mountains know what to call you now
Maybe the mountains know what to call you now

Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf

When I'm in a womb, I know what to call you now
And when a belly blooms I know what to call you now

Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf

Well I can say Marie, I know what to call you now
Swimming in the sea I know what to call you now
And when you swim with me I know what to call you now
And when you're under me I know what to call you now

Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf
Hey mama wolf

Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf

Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf

Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
Hey, hey mama wolf
