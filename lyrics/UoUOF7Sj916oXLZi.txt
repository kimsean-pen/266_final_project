You make my heart spin sorrow into silk
You make me sleep like a young child with warm milk
You held me tighter when I pushed you away
You turn my sorrow into silk
You turn my sorrow
You make my heart spin sorrow into silk
You make me sleep like a young child with warm milk
You held me tighter when I pushed you away
You turn my sorrow into silk
You turn my sorrow
Sorrow(Superb, superb)
Sorrow(Superb, superb)
Sorrow
I'll make your heart spin sorrow into silk
I'll stay awake when you can't get to sleep
I promised myself, if I pushed you away
I'd turn your sorrow into silk
I'd turn your sorrow
Sorrow(Superb, superb)
