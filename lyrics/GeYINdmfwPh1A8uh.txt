With the bangs of the drum
Walking town to town
You know that it's you
That I need around
And if you're walking downtown
Then I'm coming 'round
For you, for you

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

When the room gets hot
I know you'll always give it up
I can't get enough of you
This feels so good
It feels so good
It's up and it's down
Was lost and I'm found
For you, and for you

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
I keep falling in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough
