Oh, so warm
Screaming in the field
As I was born
Oh, will you return me
To the robins beak
I'll be a bird

Terminal
We both know
Let the rest of me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream you're making of

Woman
Ooh, woman
Hold me in your heat
Do let me, don't let me
Do let me, don't let me
I remember

Terminal
We both know
Let me rest
Let me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream you're making of
