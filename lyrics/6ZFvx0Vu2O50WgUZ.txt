We all find ourselves
In honor of the good cause
How empty we've become
With our sight to be the true force

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt

You're waiting for a re-run
But yesterday won't come
Want to relive the moment
But yesterday is gone

Lies and desperation lead us through
As we're trying to be heroic
Straight the world to what you manage
Take a step back, I'll tie you to it

You're waiting for a re-run
But yesterday won't come
Want to relive the moment
But yesterday is done

Hopes and prayers in pursuit of salvation
Take a short cut, it all depends on the cost
But as far as I remember there is nothing
That will get back the days you lost

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt

You're waiting for a re-run
But yesterday won't come
Want to relive the moment
But yesterday is done
