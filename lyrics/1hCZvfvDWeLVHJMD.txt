A fine disservice
Deceptive, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you
Caught me wide open
No simple burn
This is complicated
Calls for return

Fine disservice
Intended, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you
The point has been recorded,
The malice has been revealed
When I stripped away the humor
From the arrow it concealed
Sharpened and soaked in urine,
It was meant to spread disease
But now discovered
Becomes the sweet antithesis

Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
It comes back to you
