Find me the reason
Why are we here?
To get funky and to feel that you're alive

How do we reason?
In music we trust
Let's get funky on the smoothest chords of life

It doesn't matter
Dance to the groove

Find the true reason
What do we fear?
Let this funky song light up your darkest night

How do we reason?
What do we miss?
It's the funky groove that makes my booty move

It doesn't matter
Dance to the groove

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up, just dance

Ask yourself
Why are we here?
To get funky on the rhythm and the rhymes

Unravel the meaning
For in funk we trust
Let us dream of how to spread the melody

It doesn't matter
Dance to the groove

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up, just dance

Arouse our curiosity
Deep down the rabbit hole

Center your inside
Due to new insights
Everything seems possible
Clear the confusion
Lift the veil of illusion
Don't give up, just dance

Follow your instinct
Or we'll become extinct
Everything seems logical
Our only salvation
And our true destination
Is not to give up, just dance

It doesn't matter
Dance to the groove
