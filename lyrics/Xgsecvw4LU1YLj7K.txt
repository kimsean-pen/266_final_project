Last night last week
A million years ago
Today or tomorrow
Freaky future show
Someone Somewhere
People near and far
All men all mankind
Look for Shangri-la
Looking for Shangri-la
Old man young girl little
baby child
Can you remember the words
of Oscar Wilde
Down in the gutter,
looking at the stars
All men all mankind
look for Shangri-la
