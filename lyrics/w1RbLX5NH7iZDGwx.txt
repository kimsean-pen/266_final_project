Take this down, turn it around
I am water underneath a bridge
So, what do I know?
Getting here must be a privilege

Do say something meaningful
If at all just to fill the air
Or, believe I adore you
Love me if you dare

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I may put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime

Let it ride always inside
Isn't worth the indecision I hide
So, nowhere to go
Stimulating no illusion

I should say something pivotal
Belittle how you let me down
Or, believe I adore you
Love you if I dare

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I may put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime no, no

Look at you going places, see two faces
I know which to trace
I would be holding my breath
But things will stay the same won't they?, oh, I know

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I may put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I may put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime

By chance, when I turn out the light
I'm finding the right line
By chance, I may put this to right
Not in the rest of this lifetime no, no
