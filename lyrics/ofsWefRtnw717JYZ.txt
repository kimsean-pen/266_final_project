Stand tall, acting small
You see it all, I got your calls
That's no use in sorting out, no
That's no use, there ain't no doubt
Good times on the rise
Could it be they got all that you longed for
A place to lay it all
Could it be that you're just like me
In my thoughts you're so much more
Good times on the rise
Now it's all in your hands
No, no you won't go wrong, no
Oh no, it pays to belong
