Tumbling ice, I yearn to get undone
Do you open? Do you open?
Loving like the fire to get it on
Do you open? Do you open?

Leave me by the wake
All covered in mould
And get in the water, get in the water
Leave me by the moon
Left ready to bloom
I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water

Tumbling ice, I yearn to get undone
Do you open? Do you open?
Loving like the fire to get it on
Do you open? Do you open?

Leave me by the way
All covered in mould
And get in the water, get in the water
Leave me by the moon
Left ready to bloom
I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water

I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water
I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water
I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water
I'm needing the water, I'm needing the water
