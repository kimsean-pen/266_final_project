I waited for your call for the moon
To release me from the longest afternoon
I've re-arranged parts of my living room
But time is hard to kill since I met you

Looking at the cars that drive on by
While spring is making promises outside
Red cars are quite rare I realize
Then I wonder which colour you like

Seven little numbers
Baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers
Baby, I know yours by heart

Woo-oh, oh-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Woo-oh, oh-oh, I feel you in every heart beat
Woo-oh, oh-oh, were you ever in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

Watch the sky change to a darkened blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singers sounds as if she was longing,
As if she was longing, too

Seven little numbers
Baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers
Baby, I know yours by heart
They could make a change
Make a fire out of this flame

Woo-oh, oh-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Woo-oh, oh-oh, I feel you in every heart beat
Woo-oh, oh-oh, were you ever in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I read your name on every wall, on every wall - tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all - tell me
I read your name on every wall, on every wall - tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all

Woo-oh, oh-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Woo-oh, oh-oh, I feel you in every heart beat
Woo-oh, oh-oh, were you ever in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you
Woo-oh, oh-oh
Woo-oh, oh-oh
Woo-oh, oh-oh
These numbers could be lucky
These numbers could be lucky
These numbers could be lucky for you
