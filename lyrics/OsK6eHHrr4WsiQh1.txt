called you up
under the weather
had to find a reason for it
sooner or later
distract myself
Just to forget it
try to sleep it off
but i find
its harder than that

we show the miles
and im falling with the evening sky
we show the miles
now im miles and miles and miles
apart

god Im done
force in the meadow
couldnt find the words that i had
lost in the battle
you dont change
you only get better
falling over your sentences
like i remmeber

we show the miles
and im falling with the evening sky
we show the miles
now im miles and miles and miles
apart
