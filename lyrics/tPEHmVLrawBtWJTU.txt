I may have faltered in my life
But not with you, I couldn't make this up
I've had trouble disengaging my heart
but I'll bite the grenade pin out

You know I want you, you know I will fight,
down in the trenches, holding your hand tight
I will not make it out without you,
I'll bite the bullet, I'll fall right through you

Sweet, sweet baby of mine
You will be the one I call on for all time
Your weird mind, your bright eyes, I've wasted so much time,
on all the things that don't turn me on, so let's find a way

You know I want you, you know I will fight,
down in the trenches, holding your hand tight
I will not make it out without you,
I'll bite the bullet, I'll fall right through you

And as the dust falls down, I usually give up so easily
I let my head hang down before I even see a truth
that's plain as day, staring back at me
I'm a defeatist but I don't have to be
