"Oh look at me"
That sweet boy's plea
His mother cried
"My child's tied his laces"
Why must we move on
From such happy lawns
Into nostalgia's palm
And feed on the traces

Do you hop to the dance
Or embarrass the parents?
Who should I please?
I'll go to sleep worrying

That blood in the dark
Will attract the sharks
Who are not violent
We've all got hungry bellies

But where are the still unborn
Who could look at me with the one eye?
Who could look at me with no eyes?
Who could look at me with the inner eye?

It all was chained
and all was damaged anyway.
Stop crying like a child.

It all was graying
It all was aging anyway.
Start growing in the wild.

But I feel like I've just been born
When you look at me with your pretty eyes
When you look at me with your black eyes
When you look at me with your dead eyes

And I can't understand
When holding her hand
So womanly
I have to go kiss her

And what a surprise
To look in those eyes
To find suddenly, he is Jack the Ripper
Too suddenly, he was Jack the Ripper
There he goes...

Stop crying like a child
She stopped crying like a child
Jack the Ripper
