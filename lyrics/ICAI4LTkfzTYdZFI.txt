Now baby,
Are you sure you wanna leave?
Cause when I play, I usually play for keeps
Now baby,
Are you sure you don't want more
You gotta let me know

Am I sleeping with the enemy
While thinking we're in harmony
Don't play me like a fool
I can make more money
What do you want from me
Won't you tell me yeah

No need to justify
That this love had died
Just say you sweet goodbyes
Farewell if you think the love is gone
No need to justify
Can kill those butterflies
I'll get you off my mind
Farewell if you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone

Now baby,
I admit I like a war
And usually I'm left lying on the floor
And maybe I'm a sucker for the pain
And sometimes I can stand to take the blame
You can give me back the keys
Don't forget before you leave
Take everything with you
I don't want you calling me
Saying that you're over me
You are happy now

No need to justify
That this love had died
Just say you sweet goodbyes
Farewell if you think the love is gone
No need to justify
Can kill those butterflies
I'll get you off my mind
Farewell if you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone

Happens in slow motion
Won't be left bruised
Nothing left unspoken
No nothing
I can make it easy, easy for you
Ok bye then I ain't fighting

If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
If you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone
Farewell if you think the love is gone
