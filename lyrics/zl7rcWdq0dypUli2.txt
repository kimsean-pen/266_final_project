Someone sang your name today
and a stranger saw me crumble.
Haul my broken heart and shell away,
begging: "bury me beside you".

The devil popped around today,
selling promises and potions
that could take a memory away;
help forget I'd ever met you.

Tell me, can't you please
kindly take away the misery?
Give me a baker's dozen please.
Wrap me up to go away.

But I want you.
I need to.
Forget you,
don't want to,
but I need to let you go.

The devil bent my ear today,
about his magical elixir
that would make the sorrow go away;
help me forget I'd ever met you.

Give me a baker's dozen please.
Wrap me up to go away.

I want you.
I need to.
Forget you,
don't want to,
but I need to let you go.
