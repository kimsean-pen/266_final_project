Well it seems I lost bet when I was just a boy
The trees they wrap around me
And I couldn't touch the floor
But I suppose if I had everything
And everything had me
Then I would be a dreamer
But dreams don't mean a thing

But I'm forced to hear a whisper
Blowing with the wind
If all I could do was witness
Then I would be a king

(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Now we're all wrapped up in a story
Some stories never gets old
And this one, it feels like a movie
A movie that I can't control
'Cause so far I've been tempted
By the silver plated dreams
I've been such a fool for colors
Now I can't see a thing

But I'm forced to hear a whisper frozen in the wind
If all I could do was witness
Then I would be a king
