I would rather pick a lane if we're gonna crash
I'd rather go insane rather wear a mask
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather fall in love if it's gonna last
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather say nothing if you gotta ask
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Throw like laterals
I deal with badder hoes
Maybe the sadder hoes
Purple hair and blue dollars from my Adderall
Maybe we had it all
Maybe got too involved
I'm just trying to find a way I can keep my calm
Anyway what's up
I don't mean to interrupt
Someone can you fill my cup
I'm abrupt cause it's rough
Dealing with these people's sus
Yeah
Dealing with these people

I would rather pick a lane if we're gonna crash
I'd rather go insane rather wear a mask
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather fall in love if it's gonna last
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather say nothing if you gotta ask
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I don't know
Maybe your cynical
Mixing my chemicals
People reaching off my plate for my diner roll
I don't care I'm off the shots
Maybe 10 or so
And that's the minimal
I deal with literal
Throw like laterals
I deal with badder hoes
Maybe the sadder hoes
Purple hair and blue dollars from my Adderall
Maybe we had it all
Maybe got too involved

I would rather pick a lane if we're gonna crash
I'd rather go insane rather wear a mask
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather fall in love if it's gonna last
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Rather say nothing if you gotta ask
Yeah Yeah Yeah
