So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playin', everyone went home
But the stars are still out and you're so damn hot
And I ain't ready for the music to stop

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockin' 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along comin' on
Baby be my love song

Girl, fast or slow, three-quarter time
Ya don't have to make sense
And it don't have to rhyme
As long as it's you
Babe, I'm all in
And when it's over
Just play it again

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockin' 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along comin' on
Baby be my love song

Baby be my melody
My little feel good that gets to me
Don't be shy baby, set it free
Crank it up, hit me way down deep

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockin' 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"

I feel a little sing-along, (sing-along) comin' on
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along comin' on
Baby be my love song (be my love song)
Baby be my love song, oh yeah
Be my love song (be my love song)
