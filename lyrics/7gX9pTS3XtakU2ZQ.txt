One more time for old sake I meet you by the BYOB place on Avenue A
A little drunk
Stopped for donuts
And I got robbed by the J Station
I labeled you as a bad omen Did you see me hide under my scarf to cry
As you rubbed my back and said
"You look beautiful tonight"
Drive me home through Jersey And I'll pretend that the song you
playedWasn't meant for me and me only So I will rest or maybe
put on my shoes I'll regress to 12 AM calls that hurt you too
One more song for old sake I'll be sad
you were ever in my life in the first place
