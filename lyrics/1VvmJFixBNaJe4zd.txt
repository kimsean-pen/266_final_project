My love My love My love My love

My love adding you, adding you,
answers the phase im going through
Adding you, adding you
Dont tell me you dont feel it

You, me, them were not at all the same
We see things different
Chain me down feed me your medicine
Im losing control

I feel tired the walls are closin in
I give in

My love adding you, adding you,
answers the phase im going through
Adding you, adding you
Dont tell me you dont feel it

You me them were all a bit insane
Lost and decieved, hold my breath
Promise you wont forget me if I sucede

I feel tired the walls are closin in
I give in

My love adding you, adding you,
answers the phase im going thorugh
Adding you, adding you

I can break thourgh this mess
I can see though this mess
I can go through this mess
I can live in this mess
I am feeling so numb I could die

My love adding you, adding you,
answers the phase im going through

And now I see the things I did
It broke me down ripped my heart
I patch it back and watch it die
Watch it die inside

My love adding you, adding you,
answers the phase im going thorugh
Adding you, adding you
Dont tell me you dont feel it too

My love My love My love My love
