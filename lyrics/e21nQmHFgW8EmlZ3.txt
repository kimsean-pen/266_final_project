It's more what you are than what you might've been
It's all that you are, restart everything
Too soon, it's always too soon
It suits you and it's still half true
It caught, it caught my eye
It was borderline peace of mind
It cost more than you thought
You should definitely try to find your peace of mind
Did it sneak up beside you?
If it follows you around and it's making you down and you giving it more than it brings
And it's pulling up everything
You're thinking things you don't wanna think of
If it follows you around
If it's dragging you down and you're giving it more than it brings
You can rearrange everything
It won't stay the same nothing is everlasting
It's just passing
If you're asking, it's true
It caught, it caught my eye
And it was borderline peace of mind
It cost more than you thought
You should definitely try to find your peace of mind
Just needed the time to grow
But probably not together though
All of them telling you go when you know you'll know
Somebody will if others don't
It's only harder till you go blindfolded, everything is possible
