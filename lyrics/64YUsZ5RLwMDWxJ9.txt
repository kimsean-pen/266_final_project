Hey, are you in there?
Don't you remember me
Your oldest friend
Are you in there?
Don't you remember
How I've always been
The one who cared
When no one else did

Hey, are you aching
You used to turn to me
When you were down
Are you breaking?
You can still trust in me
To turn it all around
And calm you down

Just remember we're a team

How do you feel?
I don't
How do you know
You won't
To let go of you
I will fight
Until my last breath

How do you feel?
I don't
How do you know
You won't
To let go of you
I will fight

Hey, are you still mad?
About the time
We almost went too far
I know your regrets
In my defence
By now, it's just a scar
That distracts you from
Your broken heart

Just like you wanted it to do

How do you feel?
I don't
How do you know
You won't
To let go of you
I will fight
Until my last breath

How do you feel?
I don't
How do you know
You won't
To let go of you
I will fight

Don't deny me!
Do you want to try me?
I know exactly what you need
Don't deny me
You know the comfort of the blade

Don't deny me!
Do you want to try me?
I know exactly
What you need
You're nothing without me
You're nothing without me
You're nothing without me

Without me
Without me
You're nothing without me
You're nothing without me
