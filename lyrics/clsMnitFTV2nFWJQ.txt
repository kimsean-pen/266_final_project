Can't step in my way
Head first into love and dismay
It's like beating the dead
I can't stop going out of my head
Whatever this could be I'd never know
I never said it'd be the end all to be all

I hate you today
I can't find a way
Don't drag me down now

Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time

It's no better today
I never thought it would end up this way
You've got something to say
Don't wanna hear it if it gets in my way
All this confusion, wondering, so overwhelmed
All this illusion seems so clear
Can't find conclusion, disappointing evolution
Not all things are what they appear

So what's the point of this hell?
I know you too well
We're running backwards

Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time

But waiting's so frustrating, I'm so sick of
All this tension, not too mention I'm so sick of
Can't take it, you won't make it
Just save yourself this trouble (Everything is alright)
Get down and pray for yourself
'Cause I'm just fine (Everything is alright)

You speak for all of us when you can't be heard
(I can't help you anymore than)
I'll bet you haven't listened to not one word
(I have helped myself before)

But waiting's so frustrating, I'm so sick of
All this tension, not too mention I'm so sick of, sick of you!
