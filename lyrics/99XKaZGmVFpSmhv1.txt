sugarlight we're addicts
why do you think we came
he's pasting cold leeches
on my arm

we sharpen up our teeth
white sugar he speaks french
memorizing torsos
he's open throated

in the corner
hands arrive at hands
my arm is tired of waiting
to burn it down

sugarlight, sugarlight i can't believe
swallowing one bulb after another
in the city of electric light
