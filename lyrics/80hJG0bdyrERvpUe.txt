Ruby really rev up, now stacking up gas
From the Wal-Mart wall
Make some platinum plaques
From depression, the profession that happens so fast
Take some dabs last night now im back with no wax
Always gotta get fucked up, I can't last one day without fucking it up, Fuck it ill consume whatever pills are better, whenever they go and get stuffed, ill match it because if im in the lab until the pain is goin' thru' my skull
Aye, walkin' to the CVS with VVS's
Drippin' on my chest, bright white lights make the diamonds dance
But they also reveal my face without a mask on
What a mess, lookin' for a reason but I wanna rest

Lil $lick jumped in this bitch, tell me Ruby got a problem
Emo bitch suck your dick like shit punk rappers
Yeah they all flawed just
Smokin' dope in Los Angeles in the Corvette back it up
Park it like, fuck it die a junkie
Got the .45 on me at all times, bullet with your name
Bullet with mine
Ride mine for the sake of $uicide
You see anybody riding with me in a chevy? (No)
I didn't think so, Stay solo, Stay Dolo
Lights go dim, Low key I'm, all alone and, sit on a throne
Of illusions
Every drug i'm on I start abusing
Every drug i'm on I start abusing

Fuck it!
