You say you'll know when you really find the one
But it's hard to tell With the damage that's been done
But id like to say that it's your fault
But I know better
Cuz' I'm a fool to think you'll wait around forever

Maybe I Could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's to late too try
To make it right

I didn't know how good you were for me
Now it's clear I'm seeing all that we could be
And I know that it's my fault
But I'm gonna treat you better
Cause If I had one wish you'd be with me forever

Maybe I Could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try
To make it right

Is there something I can say?
Show me how to break it down
So before you walk away
Take the time to turn around
Listen to me now

Maybe I Could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try

Maybe I Could have loved you
Maybe I could have shown
That I still do care about you
More than you could know
Don't say it's too late to try

To make it right
To make it right
Make it right
Gonna make it right
