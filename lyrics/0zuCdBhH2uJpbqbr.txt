Free is all you gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
Sometimes you wanna run away
But you never know what might be comin' round your way
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause on a day like today, the whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine, shine through the rain
On a day like today
You never wanna see the sun go down
You never wanna see the sun go down

Somewhere there's a place for you
I know that you believe it too
Sometimes if you wanna get away
All you gotta know is what we got is here to stay
All the way

On a day like today, the whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine, shine through the rain
On a day like today, no one complains
Free to be pure, free to be sane
On a day like today
You never wanna see the sun go down
You never wanna see the sun go down

Yeah free is all we gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
But you never know what might be comin' for you and me
Yeah, it's gonna be

On a day like today, the whole world could change
Yeah the sun's gonna shine, shine throughthe rain
On a day like today, no one complains
Oh free to be pure, free to be sane
On a day like today
You never wanna see the sun go down
You never wanna see the sun go down
