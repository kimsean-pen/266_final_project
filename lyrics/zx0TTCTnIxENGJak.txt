There was a boat in a sea I knew
Couldn't believe what I saw was true
I swam out through the waves
I caught it as it moved away

I said I'd stole you away
I said I'd stole you away
Next time I'll steal you away
Next time I'll steal you, darling, you stay

There was a change
In the way you breathe
I couldn't believe
You would change for me

And if you hear the sound
Of shooting stars
Protect your heart 'cause it burns bright
Can turns back around

I said I'd stole you away
I said I'd stole you away
Next time I'll steal you away
Next time I'll steal you, darling, you stay

High strung your soul
It's uncovered by the leaving
And the things that you see

You spent so long running
But there's nothing coming
Turn around and run into me

I said I'd stole you away
I said I'd stole you away
Next time I'll steal you away
Next time I'll steal you, darling, you stay
