You light up when you're in range of the sound of misfortune
Someone shaking the change
String me up like a marionette dancing for you
Do you miss us at all?
Do you miss us at all?
Do you miss us at all?

You find what drives you and mesmerize you
Leaving us to discover love through
The fascination isn't
The fascination unless
It motivates you to death

And do you miss us at all?
Well never mind it's the same old rhetoric
And if you want to complain
Well would you mind remembering us for a change?

You find what drives you and mesmerize you
Leaving us to discover love through
The fascination isn't
The fascination isn't
The fascination unless
Do you miss us at all?
