Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours

Neighbours
Have I got neighbours?
Have I got neighbours?
All day and all night
Neighbours
Have I got neighbours?
Ringing my doorbells
All day and all night

Ladies, have I got crazies?
Screamin' young babies
No piece and no quiet
I got TV's, saxophone playin'
Groanin' and strainin'
With the trouble and strife

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight?

Neighbours
Do unto strangers
Do unto neighbours
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself
Yourself, yourself?

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight?

Neighbours
Do unto strangers
Do unto neighbours
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself
Yourself?

Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours, neighbours
Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours, neighbours

Neighbours
Do yourself a favour
Don't you mess with my baby
When I'm workin' all night
You know that neighbours
Steal off my table
Steal off my table
And doin' alright, alright, alright, alright

Neighbours do unto strangers
Do unto strangers
What you do to yourself
Yourself, yourself, yourself
