Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na

I got a feeling that the weather's gonna change
So I'm turning off my brain for a minute
I had a premonition that tonight is getting strange
So I'm turning up the sound when you get in

'Cause I can't watch you dig your own grave, dig your own grave, today
And I can't hear a word that you say, a word that you say

You got me going around in circles in my head
The signals that we send
Electric confidence (Na na na na na)
Push me, pull me down
Pick me up, drag me around
Parade me through the town
Fake jewelry wear me out (Na na na na na)
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your...

I ignored the warnings on a bottle full of pills
And I stumbled off the rails for a summer
I bought a filthy car with a thousand dollar bill
Just to watch it rust away in the gutter

'Cause I can't watch you dig your own grave, dig your own grave, today
So I'll just disappear with no trace from here, with no trace

You got me going around in circles in my head
The signals that we send
Electric confidence (Na na na na na)
Push me, pull me down
Pick me up, drag me around
Parade me through the town
Fake jewelry wear me out (Na na na na na)
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your...

I can't tell what's real or what I'm dreaming anymore
Don't know how to feel when I've felt this all before
I can't tell what's real or what I'm dreaming anymore
Don't know how to feel
Don't know how to...

You got me going around in circles in my head
The signals that we send
Electric confidence (Na na na na na)
Push me, pull me down
Pick me up, drag me around
Parade me through the town
Fake jewelry wear me out (Na na na na na)
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your drug
Na na na na na na na, na na
Na na na na na
Can't get enough of your...

(I can't tell what's real or what I'm dreaming anymore)
(Don't know how to feel when I've felt this all before)
