Come by you have come far
All I had I lost in the flood
Come sit with me at the bar
Tell me of progress strengthen my blood
No one here knows my name
I have traded my memories for things
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Why have you waited so long
Why have you waited so long

Come by you have come far
Long since I saw you so how have you been
Come sit with me at the bar
How long since they told you that they had found him
No one here knows my name
I gave up my worries for one good thing
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Why have you waited so long
Why have you waited so long
Why have you waited so long
Why have you waited so long

Was it because I never told you
I was going away
That you waited so long
Was it because your fucking dreams
Meant nothing to me
That you waited so long

It runs from the top of my fingers
Into my hands
What is it I have been drinking
I do not understand
I thought I'd lost you my brother
I'm so glad you came
My regards to the ones that I love I miss them
Tell them I love them I miss them
