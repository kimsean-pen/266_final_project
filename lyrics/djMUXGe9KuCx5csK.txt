You say that they've all left you behind
Your heart broke
when the party died

Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?

When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Put your glad rags on
And let's sing along
To that lonely song
You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark

Oh Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this horror show
I've got to tell you so
Oh Laura, you're more than a superstar

You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?

When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Put your glad rags on
And let's sing along
To that lonely song
You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Oh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You'll be famous for longer and then
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
Oh Laura, you're more than a superstar

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Oh Laura, you're more than a suá¹—erstar
And in this old horror show
I've got to let you know
Oh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You're more than a superstar
