One day she came along
I didn't know her name
My friends said to me
"Watch out for the game"

I didn't want to believe
All the things they said
It seemed to be the right time
A love affair instead

Walkin' down the beach
Kickin' up the sand
Not so far away
Wonderin' where they'll land

We talked of things to do
And places that we'd tame
A one with a love to share
With a girl who had no name
Who had no name

Then it came the time they said
When all the good went bad
She walked into the night
It didn't make me sad

I felt my friends' advice
Echo through my soul
A one with a love to share with a girl
Who had no name
Who had no name
