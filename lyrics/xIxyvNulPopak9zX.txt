Maybe I'm the afterglow
'cause I'm with a band you know
don't you hear the laughter on the way down
Yes I am the anchorman
dining here with Son of Sam
hear too much to chatter on the way down

gonna meet a great, big star
gonna drive his great, big car
gonna have it all here on the way down

way down
way down
way down
she knows
way down
way down
way down
she knows
