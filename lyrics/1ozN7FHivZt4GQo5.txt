You need not to climb mountain tops
you need not to cross the sea
you need not to find a cure
for everything that makes you weak

you need not to reach for the stars
when life becomes so dark
and when the wind does blow against the grain
you must follow your heart

you must follow your heart

all your friends have come and gone
and the sun no longer shines
and the happiness for which you long
is washed away like an oceans tide

when all the hard times outweigh the good
and all your words are misunderstood
when the day seems lost from the start
you must follow your heart

you must follow your heart

If you feel you've paid the price
and your wounds should cease to heal
and everything you love in life
spins like a winding wheel

if you should wake to find your abandoned
and the road you traveled leads to a dead end
when death creaps in to play it's part
you must follow your heart.

you must follow your heart.
