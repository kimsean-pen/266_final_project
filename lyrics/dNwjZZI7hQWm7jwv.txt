Ever seen a speeding bullet
Ever found yourself too deep
I can't seem to break this habit
Regretting what I just can't keep

Comfortably numb til the dark's a familiar place
Each step that I take is a journey to my faith

There ain't no way I'm escaping
This prison I'm in
There ain't no one left to save me
Cause I'm wild like
I'm wild like the wind
I'm wild like the wind
I'm wild like the wind

I can see that freight train coming
I can see it all from here
My pain's become my only weapon
Learned to stand behind my fear

Comfortably numb til the dark's a familiar place
Each step that I take is a journey to my faith
The good inside me is a stanger
And I'm in love with my sins

There ain't no one left to save me
Cause I'm wild like the wind
There ain't no way i'm escaping
This prison I'm in
There ain't no one left to save me
Cause I'm wild like
I'm wild like the wind
I'm wild like the wind

I'm wild like the wind
I'm wild like the wind
I'm wild like the wind
