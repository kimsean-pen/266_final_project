So satisfied, leave without a trace
You taught me doubt, still you do it again
And it's high, high time I found myself on the road
Educate myself 'til it hurts
And it's high, high time I satisfy what it takes
It all just seams so differently

That's the biggest joke of all
You know it's the biggest joke of all

And it's high time I recognized
To do it again, it's growing outside my walls
I can't do it when I'm dead
I can't tell you anything at all

And that's the biggest joke of all
You know it's the biggest joke of all
