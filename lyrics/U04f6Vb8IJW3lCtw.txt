Is this everything?
I've dreamed of so much more
Between the end and where we lie
Here all our hopes and dreams
Are scavenged from the floor
And fed into machines that feed on vacant eyes

All of my dreams
Always find me
Far beyond these fake fluorescent skies
I know there must be something more
If I could only find the door
Then I could free myself and see the world outside

Where daylight
Breaks on you and shines into the
Grey that
Sleeps beneath your skull
Daylight
Breaks on you and burns away the
Grey that
Suffocates your soul

For now I hold a key
And though I may be lost
I know that I will find my way
I search endlessly
But every time I've thought
That I was near the smoke and mirrors lead me astray

See the pit boss
Steal each tick tock
Time, it seems, will suffer at our hands
I look for exits in the haze
The dense electric twilit maze
I've heard that there is one that leads to sunlit lands

Where daylight
Breaks on you and shines into the
Grey that
Sleeps beneath your skull
Daylight
Breaks on you and burns away the
Grey that
Suffocates your soul

Daylight...

Daylight
They tell me that it's just a myth
And they try
To betray me with a kiss
And daylight
They tell me that it can't exist
And they might
Never know just what they missed

As daylight
Pours fire into my
Grey eyes
Pour grace into my
Grey life
Breaks in and lights the
Way, I
Can't live without the day.
