I was trying to cross the street when I tripped and spilled my coffee
On a man who yelled at me, then he walked off in a hurry
Now he's gonna be late for work so he called his secretary
Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby

Who's been waiting for a while and talking on the phone
Got invited to a party and thought he couldn't go
But he's here right now, standing in my house
And someone turns the music loud

So we dance and we laugh, and we touch
Yeah, we dance and we laugh, and we touch
Gonna party all night 'til the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us
When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

I was planning out my party, running errands round the city
Grocery bags full of alcohol and chocolate chip cookies
Saw a dress that was amazing in the window of a boutique
So I went to across the street then my heel broke and it threw me

I tried to catch my balance but I was supposed to fall
It seems that spilling coffee was no accident at all
'Cause you're here right now, sitting on my couch
Funny how it all works out

So we dance and we laugh, and we touch
Yeah, we dance and we laugh, and we touch
Gonna party all night 'til the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us
When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

Every choice we're making, every road we take
Every interaction starts a chain reaction
We're both affected when we least expected it
And when we touched then it all connected

Every choice we're make and every road we take
Every interaction starts a chain reaction
We're both affected when we least expected it
And when we

When we dance and we laugh, and we touch
When we dance and we laugh, when we touch
Gonna party all night 'til the sun comes up
'Cause it feels like the world disappears around us
When we dance, when we laugh, when we touch

Ooh, we touch
Ooh, we touch
Ooh, we touch
Ooh, we touch
