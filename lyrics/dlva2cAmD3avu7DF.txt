I always knew that I was
Created for more
To be something more
To feel something more

Free from your convictions - my decision
Don't need to fix me
Cause I'm not broken

Yeah you should know this
The time has come and I gotta resist
Live your life like a slave
But it's not for me

Don't try to change my way
Cus I'm unbroken
Why should we be the same
I gonna show you

I will never forget the day
I've found the way
Back home and fell in love
With night skyes again

Too much falseness in this word
I can't stand it anymore
I got to listen to myself
Nobody was there
When I was bleeding
Pretending that I'll be ok
Before it was to late
To late

Don't try to change my way
Cus I'm unbroken
Why should we be the same
I gonna show you

I will never forget the day
I've found the way
Back home and fell in love
With night skyes again

In the end
You will understand
There's nothing here
Except the face of your fear
