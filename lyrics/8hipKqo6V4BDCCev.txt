She's not a bird you can cage
She'll fly away
She'll fly away
And each passing day
She slips away
She slips away
But I don't wanna just be friends
No I don't wanna just be friends
No I don't wanna play pretend
No I don't wanna just be friends
She will give me a sign
To let me know that she's mine
I wanna give her my time
Because she keeps pass me by
Now all I want I can't say
To make her stay
To make her stay
But when I give her art
I feel okay
I feel okay
So I don't wanna just be friends
No I don't wanna just be friends
No I don't wanna play pretend
No I don't wanna just be friends
She will give me a sign
To let me know that she's mine
I wanna give her my time
Because she keeps pass me by
