Hold me, I'm just trying to be good
It's all talking, gotta stutter my way out of here
Hold me, don't wanna be misunderstood
It's so noisy, gotta shut it, gotta turn it off
Gotta shut it, turn it off

I don't want problems
I promise I'm gonna do it right, sir
I'm not a lost case
I'm just a poor kid and I wear fake tan, sir
Got a short term memory
Got no interest in the paps
Got a phantom ache
Where I used to have a heart

Time ticking, 1, 2, 3
Clicking, I don't need a countdown to know it's a long round
I'm ticking, 1, 2, 3

So, hold me, I'm just trying to be good
It's all talking, gotta stutter my way out of here
Hold me, don't wanna be misunderstood
It's so noisy, gotta shut it, got to turn it off
Gotta shut it, turn it off

I thought I did all ideas
Fill in the paperwork, sir
Talking 'bout these walls again
First you hit him
Then you use, "No, I can't live without him, sir!"
But I've opened the doors
Don't underlook our halfway home
Check out the sofa, sir, sir
Check out the window, sir

Time ticking, 1, 2, 3
Clicking, I don't need a countdown to know it's a long round
I'm ticking, 1, 2, 3

Hold me, I'm just trying to be good
It's all talking, gotta stutter my way out of here
Hold me, don't wanna be misunderstood
It's so noisy, gotta shut it, got to turn it off
Gotta turn it off
