A swing bangs on the wall
Of a manor amongst the colours of fall
Below a hatch I've found a book
As an organ repeats its hook

There is the shed, there is the saw
But not the chained one I was looking for
As silence comes I lose what goes
It's the value I drew from hope

A growl, I stand out wide
But my axe has fear to strike
I see how it falls. I'm prone to run
Into those woods that hid the sun
