oh in my heart
oh in my head
oh I'm not there
I am here
I see my base
could use a raise
just to fight
at the floods

you know I
I
I don't wanna fall in love
no no baby not again

you see my hair
is falling out
I watch it run
down the drain
with a twist
and then a spin
oh they exist
in my brain

you know I
oh yeah I
I don't wanna fall in love
no no baby not again
