Flower girl
I am not what I seem
I'm the reason your leaves are withering
My sun has set
And I will never keep you warm again
How I long to be in bloom for you
How I long to be in bloom with you
Pollen eyes
I fear that I'm falling asleep
Winter is calling me
Far sooner than it ought to be
How I long to be the soil to keeps you safe
Will I ever be more than my mistakes
Stoner viens
I'm fainting death
I'm losing breath
And sense of time
