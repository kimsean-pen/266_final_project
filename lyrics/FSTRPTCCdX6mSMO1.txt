Oh, yeah

Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old
And make it new

Oh, eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
You and I
We're a deadly combination

So don't start mixing
Truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear
As far as I can see

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time

Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Yeah, yeah
I love you, little girl

Black and white
Always go together
Day and night
You're the precious jewel I treasure

Wanting every part of you
Is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one
Who's wrong this time

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time

Pamela
There is no second second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Leave all

Oh, Pamela, oh
Thousands of miles away
But always in my heart

Pamela
So don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time

Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time

Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Leave all behind
