Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, buh bye
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?

Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
Yeah who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, buh bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

(Bye, bye, bye)
(Bye, bye, bye)
(Bye, bye, bye)
(Bye, bye, bye)

Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong, buh bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Oh, you know you can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
