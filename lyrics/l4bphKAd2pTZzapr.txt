You know I'll be the one who gets fallen down drunk
At my neighbor kids soccer game
I got an 82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the interstate
I got a beer stained t-shirt
Lookin like joe dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash stealin, drug dealin, loser without any feelin
Gettin trailer trashed tonight

'Cause I'm a lowlife and I'm lovin it
I got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife
So fuckin deal with it
No you can't change somethin that you don't understand

I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly
Hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me,
naked, sleepin like a baby tonight

'Cause I'm a lowlife and I'm lovin it
I got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife
So fuckin deal with it
No you can't change somethin that you don't understand

I'm livin it up, livin it up
(And being a lowlife)
I'm livin it up, livin it up
(And being a lowlife)
I'm livin it up, livin it up
(And being a lowlife)
I'm livin it up, livin it up

A gun packin, bitch smackin
Mess with me it's gonna happen
Lovin life, livin in sin
Passed out on the floor, sorry just don't work no more
Givin up on givin in
(Ah fuck it)

'Cause I'm a lowlife (lowlife) and I'm lovin it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a lowlife (lowlife)
So fuckin deal with it
'Cause deep down I really know everyone is
'Cause we're lowlifes (lowlifes)
And we're lovin it
We got the whole damn world in the palm of our hand
'Cause we're lowlifes (lowlifes)
So fuckin deal with it
No you can't change somethin that you don't understand

I'm livin it up, livin it up
And being a lowlife
