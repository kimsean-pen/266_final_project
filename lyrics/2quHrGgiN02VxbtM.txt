These walls are paper thin and everyone hears every little sound
Everyone's a voyeurist, they're watching me watch them watch me right now
They're shaking hands, they're shaking in their shoes, oh Lord don't shake me down
Everyone wants to move them and half of everyone else moves around
It's been agreed the whole world stinks, so no one's taking showers anymore

Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank
I can't be blamed for nothing anymore
It's been a long time since you've been around
Laugh hard, it's a long ways to the bank

Tow the line to tax the time, you know that you don't owe
I can't be a fool for everyone that I don't know
