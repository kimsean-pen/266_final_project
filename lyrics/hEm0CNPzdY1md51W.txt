Severed me roots of dead family trees
Finding the damage inside of me
Parting blood red seas on bended knee
Too much to ask when it's so hard to breathe
No way out
Tearing my soul to finally see
The real wreckage between you and me
A cold grin for those damned at my door
My hanging heart for your product of war
No way out
Cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling
No way out cutter, cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling
One way down
No way out
