I could of sworn that I saw you knee bent on the bedside
Arms stretching like a kite
That time will eventually grow, I'm so sure of it

I've got a reason to long for songs
That tells why your legs and arms
Are actually able

'Cause I confide in wolves at night
Well, have you seen my baby girl?
She's lonely, yeah, oh, oh, oh

I've got to crucify myself if I am gonna believe you
I've got to promise that I'll finish all the things I said
I'd do to begin with too

I've got to make my bed if I am gonna lay with you
'Cause a disaster's a disaster
No matter what Christian language you drag it through

'Cause I confide in wolves at night
Well, have you seen my baby girl?
She's lonely, so lonely

'Cause I confide in wolves at night
I'm like a virgin losing a child
So lonely, so lonely

Swear I did what I could for your rights
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try nothing, try something, try anything

I swear I did what I could for your rights
And you swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, for nothing, for something
Something

I swear I did what I could for your rights
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, try nothing, try anything
