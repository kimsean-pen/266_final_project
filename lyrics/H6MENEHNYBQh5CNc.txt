Island mountain
Under the eye of the sun
Red rocks ringing
Blinding colours run
Pillars of dreams
Towering peaks touch the sky
Through the bones of the earth
Spirit wind sighs
Within the living tree
Seeing as one
Beneath the eye
The eye of the sun
Hot on the trail
The trail of the wind
Beyond time and space
Rainbow ring

Pillars of dreams
Towering peaks touch the sky
Through the bones of the earth
Spirit wind sighs
Within the living tree
Seeing as one
Beneath the eye
The eye of the sun
Hot on the trail
The trail of the wind
Beyond time and space
Rainbow ring

Within the living tree
Seeing as one
Beneath the eye
The eye of the sun
Hot on the trail
The trail of the wind
Beyond time and space
Rainbow ring
