Give me a cue
I think I've nearly found you

Give me a cue
I can see clues all around me
The sound of music
The crying of the air
Give me a cue
I think I've nearly found you

Give me a cue
I can see clues all around me

The sound of music
The crying of the air

(Give me a clue)

(Give me a cue)

The sound of music
The echo of the earth

I'm sick and tired of the same old chaos
Must be a way to get out of this cul-de-sac

Give me a cue
I can see clues all around me

The sound of music
The sound of my own voice

I'm sick and tired of the same old chaos
Must be a way to get out of this cul-de-sac

Give me a cue (Clues)
I think I've nearly found you (Clues)
