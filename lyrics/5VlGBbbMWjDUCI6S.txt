this time last year
there was a twinkle in your eye
while you stared into the fire was a love affair
but that was then this time last year

this time last year
we raised our glasses to night
oh i was your family and she wowed my eye
but that was then this time last year

but this time this year
im running circles round the thoughts of you my dear
i should've realized the end was drawing near
we acted out of fear see
well now it's over

this time last year
while the amber lights were shinning so bright
i held a hope that we would be alright
but that was then this time last year
