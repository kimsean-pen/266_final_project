Love love love why'd you take so long to come to me, oh baby
Love love you love tell me where you hiding from me
All the time
Each time I try to find someone to take your place
It was all in vain, no their lips were never quite the same, oh baby
When I was kissing someone new deep inside I was missing you
Oh baby you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey I looked out into empty
space and all I saw was your sweet face
Love love love you can't imagine what you do to me, oh baby
And love your love everytime you smile it goes through me all the time
Day by day I'm fallin' more in love with you
And that's no lie, cross my heart and honey I hope to die
'Cause I'm not tryin' to mislead you believe me girl I really need you
Oh baby you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey I looked out into empty
space and all I saw was your sweet face
Oh baby you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey I looked out into empty
space and all I saw was your sweet face
Love love love
Love love
