we forever were changed
in this room where I have been living
and in these years it's been dangerous
but I cannot help from receiving
all the Spirits here they all say:
"for now you must suffer so that we may live"

all the Saints come down
I wish they would now

thought in time it has changed us all
the room itself, it is breathing
we forever are chained
in what we have done, we have won
we have given to the spirits here,
who still call upon me,
say "suffer so that we may live"
So, come
take back the old way
take what's not right
take back the unborn child
take it back
