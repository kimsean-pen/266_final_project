Yellow turns this courage badge into a valentinal trash.
These are the crushes meant to crush you.
The contact was dry, but exasperating like a teething smile.
Pulse by pulse, i honor the we weather to myself into her hands,
and for an angel even she knew it well.
when my drool dropped past her lips.
A dead man floating in one in a forgetful moment.
She saw it haunted in my eyes when they finally opened,
coughing up blood like a throat.
No, lover let go of my neck.
We knew together that every crack in the wall
is a step towards release of the lascivious waters i no longer wade through.
