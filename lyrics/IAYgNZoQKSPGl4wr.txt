*Cold wide sweet highway the place where we'd all go
Went out like a razor sharp and we'd all let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll, let it go
Let it roll

**She'd skid up, and we really let it down
Laying it out, let it roll

When these wheels get rolling, let them roll right over you
The time will be sound and I'll always put it through
Let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll

**Repeat

*Repeat

**Repeat
