The violet textures so van gogh, your hands have always held their own,
I'll help you decorate your garden home,
I'm curious I've come to know, with every spark we're losing glow,
we've lived to compliment but now where do we grow,
some leave share an attribute with you dandelion,
you're both fading since you heard a whisper in the autumn wind,
some trees are deciduous, october's feeling cool,
these contagious idealizations aren't conserving any fuel,

as we grow older we won't feel all this weight,
we build strength through consequence,
each seasons a theme for what take's place,
we don't celebrate controversy,
my hearts flaring its disgrace, I'm not here to let you down,
apart this life just doesn't taste much like the place that I once knew,
without you,

milemarkers, milestones, take what we like and let it show,
that we experience the high times and the low,
nutrients will come and go, our loyalty won't move,
appreciations what we're chasing what we're chasing is far and few,

as we grow older we won't feel all this weight,
we build strength through consequence,
each seasons a theme for what take's place,
we don't celebrate controversy,
my hearts flaring its disgrace, I'm not here to let you down,
apart this life just doesn't taste much like the place that I once knew,
without you,

when you're with him you look so nice, I'm torn inside

as we grow older we won't feel all this weight,
we build strength through consequence,
each seasons a theme for what take's place,
we don't celebrate controversy,
my hearts flaring its disgrace, I'm not here to let you down,
apart this life just doesn't taste much like the place that I once knew,
without you,
