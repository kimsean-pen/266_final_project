If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz

Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cut-away coats
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super-duper

Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts
