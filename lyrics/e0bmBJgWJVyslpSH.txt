Taking on seven years
The holy ghost had left alone
Test my arms, kick like crazy
I've been trying way too long
Only push the way off to fight you
Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure
Getting off my chest, the story ends
I would find a way without...

Tell him his eyes see too clear
I would find a way without you
Tell him his eyes see too clear
That mistake was gold
I know that without you
It's something that I could never do
That was why
Staple the eyes and
Seven dates for me to sell machines and tear on

Seven years you assured me

That I'd be fine if I complied
Only push the way off to fight you
(Only push the way off to fight you)
Now I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure
Getting off my chest, the story ends

I would find a way without...
Tell him his eyes see too clear

I would find a way without you
Tell him his eyes see too clear
That mistake was gold
And I know that without you
It's something that I could never do
That was why staple the eyes and
Seven dates for me to sell machines and tear on
Don't treat me, I'm to blame
(Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not sure)
Don't treat me like I never accused you
