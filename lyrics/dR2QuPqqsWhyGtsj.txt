Today love finds off little
You see your singing is so vague
His joined her love so little
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find

So many stars take care of me
Take care of those they love
My love has done right

Love me so, love little
So you see now the sun is out
Love will accieve no ends
I can't be fickle, oh that I find

So many stars take care of me
Take care of those they love
Our love has done right
They know where they like it
All of love flow 'round of me
Strain and love me

Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find

They know whether I come
(We flow and we fall)
I love for mine
(We fall down)
Strain and love me
(These stars that love)
So many stars take care of me
(We flow and we flow)
All of love flow 'round me
(Our love comes down)
Our love comes down
(These stars I love)
They know whether I come
(We flow and we fall)
Full of love fall down
(Our love comes down)
Strain and love me
