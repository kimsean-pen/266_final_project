I found myself in late night drives
with no destination
All I had is thoughts of the past
and a list of my favourite songs to keep me company
But I still struggle
and lose myself everyday
I always find myself lost in all these lines of thought
but I felt better
when I saw that this is life
and in life we're gonna cry
in life we're gonna lose sleep
we're gonna feel helpless
but that's how it's gotta be
but that's how it's gotta be
but that's how it's gotte be
when you lose yourself
you'll find what you're looking for
when you lose yourself
you'll find what you're looking for
but that's how it's gotta be
but that's how it's gotta be
but that's how it gotta be
but that's how it gotta be
