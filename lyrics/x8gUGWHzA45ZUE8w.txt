In my eyes, coarse and jaded
It's no surprise, the lights have faded
I always walk away
You'll always hear me say "I don't need this"

I've been given such a gift
Shame to take advantage of it
Wanted wasting leaves, you wanting more
Be careful what you're wishing for

Nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands
I'm not thinking that I should anyway
So I leave holding nothing
Don't care what you say
'Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away

Now my days are feeling numbered
The sad clich√© I'm hiding under
This spider web of dreams
I'm stuck here as it seems to be breaking

Shining brighter than you burn
Something that I would never learn
I could never lay this curse on you
Cursing the days where there's

Nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands
I'm not thinking that I should anyway
So I leave holding nothing
Don't care what you say
'Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away

'Cause it makes no difference
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away
It makes no difference
It makes no difference if I throw it away
Makes no difference if I throw it away

It all just ends up tasting watered down
(It's never been so complicated)
And everyone has found an easy way out
An easy way out

It all just ends up tasting watered down
(It's never been so complicated)
And everyone has found an easy way out
An easy way out

Nothing that I can hold onto with my broken hands
I'm not thinking that I should anyway
So I leave holding nothing
Don't care what you say
'Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away

'Cause it makes no difference
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away
It makes no difference
It makes no difference if I throw it away
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away
(Throw it away)
