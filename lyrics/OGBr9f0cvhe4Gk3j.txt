Work on my presentation
Shoes shirt and dictation
Give my best effort to stand up straight for that
Emails politely phrased
Everything about me begs
Don't pass me over please there's rent I gotta pay

Those grimy eyes paw at you
Those greasy hands grab at you
They wanna wring what little you have left
You're not welcome, they make it clear
They tell you, you're only here to hold their ladder

Seeing a therapist but being open to risk
No way to safely convey the size of this shoulder chip
Running' on bitterness briar hooks into hips
Get hot from anger and melted straight into my couch

At least there's some self in self-destruction
