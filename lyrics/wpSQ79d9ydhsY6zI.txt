In and out of darkness, in and out of sleep
trying to keep my hands upon the wheel.
Never saw the corner in the driving rain.
I never saw her step into the street.
Dreaming while you sleep
dreaming while you sleep
memories to keep
dreaming while you sleep

I can never understand what went thru my mind
I didn't stop to see what I had done.
Had to keep on driving deep into the night
the miles between would somehow put it right

Dreaming while you sleep
dreaming while you sleep
memories to keep
dreaming while you sleep

All my life you lie silently there
All my life in a world so unfair
All my life and only I'll know why
and it will live inside of me,
I will never be free all my life,
trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes,
please open your eyes

Dreaming while you sleep
dreaming while you sleep

Heard it on the radio, saw it on TV,
but could I take my secret to the grave.
If I had another chance, would I do the same.
Would I still deny that it was me.

Dreaming while you sleep
dreaming while you sleep
Dreaming while you sleep,
Are you dreaming while you sleep?

All my life I'll be haunted by
all my life just one moment in time
all my life until the day I die
and it will live inside of me
Oh I will never be free all my life
trapped in her memory all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes

All of my life - you lie silently there
All my life - in a world so unfair
All my life - and only I know why
And it will live inside of me
I will never be free all my life
Trapped in her memory - all my life
Till the day that you open your eyes.

All of my life.
Just one moment of time, all my life.
