Of part and parcel
Well, we're already dead and well,
it's probably been said
That it's always been said that

One wing isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough to leave

One wing isn't even enough
It isn't even enough
It isn't even enough to leave

I'm gonna shake myself right out the door
I'm gonna take myself when it's finally over
I'm gonna let my old bad self take over
I'm gonna move my arm out with my shoulder

And one wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave

One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave

One wing wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough
It wasn't even enough to leave

First off, Gary was on trial and drunk before we left bed
As things got better wasn't hard to say that he had no idea
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they really didn't want us around
So we all just opened up our mouths and walked to this town

Well, I was walking just a little bit sideways
And you were walking sideways too
Well, I hadn't learned when a front door can be used,
here we go sir

We have darkened doors so we didn't read what the sign read
Though simple enough it was to me really tough
The ground needs to be fed
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they didn't really want us around
So not a single one of us will ever leave town,
here we go sir

Our bodies were laid out,
we were laid for fifteen yards
Well, two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed
That they really didn't want us around
So every single one of us fed the ground, here we go now

One wing wasn't, wasn't even enough
One wing wasn't, wasn't even enough

Oh, pardon pardon,
so it's probably been said
That it's always been said, we were already dead
