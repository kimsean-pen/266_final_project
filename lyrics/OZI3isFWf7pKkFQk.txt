Adam enters sedated Eve beneath wisdomless tree
Death spell of the beckoning of the serpent
Forked tongue wags as his mouth it spews his wretchedness
A paradise of pain
An obscene Eden insane blood drips near the base of his erection
Down her palish thigh much to the satyr's satisfaction

Impart these burdens to all man, corruptively
Poisoned the apple shines in hand, so rottenly
At the tree of life with noose in hand, horrendously
Divine insanity begins

Absurd our innocence was lost
Eternal is the cost
Transgress at the tree of good and evil
Estowing shame and guilt into the hearts of his created fools

All truths will be revealed
Mortality is sealed
In god's name it's believed that we should thank him
When on this blackened day by his foul curse we were forsaken

Impart awareness to all man condemningly
Luring temptation placed in hand pervertedly
The tree of wisdoms deviant in mockery
Conceive our blasphemy

Of god and serpent of spectre and snake
Shamed in our nakedness forever we're the blamed
Of god and serpent of spectre and snake
One in the same are they a fiend of many names

Pillaged hymen perforates
It sorely gives away
Unto the blood engorged lust
Of sick humanity

Swallow whole the both of them
O Luciferian snake
And so was spawned the soulless world
When foul semen met poisoned egg

Carnality unending the torment in divine
In this garden of delight
Depravity unceasing eternity defined
Innocence left behind in this garden of delight

Slithering gold majestic snake
As who would hiss one thousand lies
Coiling around the first created
Constrict them of their mortal lives

Of god and serpent of spectre and snake
Shamed in our nakedness forever we're the blamed
Of god and serpent of spectre and snake
One in the same are they a fiend of many names
