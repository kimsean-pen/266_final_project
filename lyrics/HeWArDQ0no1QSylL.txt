Waking up to another day older
I dream about immortality
Tell myself that it's mind over matter
That love will last for eternity

With all my heart and all my soul
I know love will save us
From the lies designed to feed the hunger
While the cities turn to dust
You and I better stick together when
All is said and done

If were gonna live forever and ever, forever
We wanna live forever and ever, forever

They send us all on a doomsday mission
But you and I have a better plan
To take a sip of life's sweet nectar
The kiss of death to the mortal man

Time will slip away, but love will save the day
