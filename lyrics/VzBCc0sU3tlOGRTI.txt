i'm misaligned
misanthropy to pass the time
this crooked jaw
i'm always feeling awful

i'm so ashamed
yes that's it i'm so ashamed
& so is she

i'm so awake
the reverberating seam of daybreak
the hem where night falls again
is splitting into livid mistakes

i've been tryin to say
but these awful letters rearrange
my name: my namesake

look around
these redundancies resound
take this sound:
how the architecture
meanders

oh my my
i can't get it off my mind
your fingers curled:
a contorted row of antlers
are you reaching out to me oh god
