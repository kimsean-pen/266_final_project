Well she's almost grown
The way she's walking
But her mind's not her own
The way she's talking

Hours up on the phone
Talking and talking and talking and talking
Nights away from home
Walkers and walking and walkers and walking

Baby how long
Will you be oh will you be?
Baby how long
Will you be oh will you be?
Will you be, yeah!

Well she's almost grown
And I drove her to the station
She don't want to stay at home
It's a fool's invitation

She hates to turn it down
It is a moment of truth
(A moment of danger)
She loves to stick around
And smiling at strangers, she's smiling at strangers

Baby how long
Will you be oh will you be?
Baby how long
Will you be oh will you be?
Will you be, yeah!

Hours up on the phone
Talking and talking and talking and talking
Nights away from home
Walkers and walking and walkers and walking

Baby how long (Nights away from home)
Will you be oh will you be?
Baby how long (Nights away from home)
Will you be oh will you be?

Baby how long (Nights away from home)
Will you be oh will you be?
Baby how long (Nights away from home)
Will you be oh will you be?
Will you be, yeah!
