It's all the same
Only the names will change
Everyday
It seems we're wastin' away

Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night
Just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways

Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
All you do is think

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
(Wanted)
Dead or alive
Wanted
(Wanted)
Dead or alive

Ohh alright
Ohh

Oh I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
(Wanted)
Dead or alive

When I walk these streets
A loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps
'Cause I might not make it back

I've been everywhere
(Ohh, yea)
Still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces
And I've rocked them all

'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
(Wanted)
Dead or alive

I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted
(Wanted)
Dead or alive
And I'm right
(And I'm right)
Dead or alive
I still drive
(I still drive)
Dead or alive

Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
