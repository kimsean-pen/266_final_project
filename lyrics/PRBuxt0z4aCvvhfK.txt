Under the rug
Old shadows inside
Wait for their moment

They plan their surprise
A confetti supply
When I'm feeling feeble
I swear that it won't happen again

There's nobody else
I swear that it won't happen again

We've become lost
Shine lights in the past
No sign of way out

Our cryptic love
With time it gets worse
It builds up behind us
I swear it won't happen again

There's nobody else
I swear that it won't happen again.
