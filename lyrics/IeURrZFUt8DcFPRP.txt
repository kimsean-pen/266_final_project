I've been your Lolita
I've been your toy
I've been your saviour
And I've handled it like a boy
I've been your Lolita
I've been your toy
I've seen it all
And boy did I fall
Too sweet, but too shine
Too sweet, but too little sunshine
Too sweet, but too sentimental
Too sweet, but too sentimental
You're so good
Too sweet, but too shine
Too sweet, but too little sunshine
Too sweet, but too sentimental
Too sweet, but too sentimental
You're so good
And I've been your Lolita
And I've been your toy
I've been your saviour
And I've handled it like a boy
I've been your Lolita
And I've been your toy
And I've seen it all
And boy did I fall
Too sweet, but too shine
Too sweet, but too little sunshine
Too sweet, but too sentimental
Too sweet, but too sentimental
You're so good
Too sweet, but too shine
Too sweet, but too little sunshine
Too sweet, but too sentimental
Too sweet, but too sentimental
You're so good
Because I've been your Lolita
And I've been your little toy
I've been made into a saviour
And I've handled it like a boy
I've been your Lolita
I've been your Lolita
And I've seen it all
Your Lolita, your Lolita, your Lo, lo
