Only you could make me feel
What i feel for you right now
But you're all gone
And it's all my fault

And i tried to hide it
But was no use
All was ruined with me n you
But now your gone
And i feel alone

This could be the only chance i got
To make you love me again, yeah

--Chorus--
You crushed all my dreams
my dreams of you
I tried to make you love me
somhow that just ddnt work out
You crushed me
All i wanted was one night
Guess you werent meant for me
Cause i know You missed out

By myself i closed my eyes
Dreamin of me and you
Leaving together and never turn back

So now, maybe after what you did to me
You'll come crawling back to me
But you know what?
I dont want you

--guitar solo--

This could be the only chance i got
To make you pay, yeah

--chorus--
You crushed all my dreams
my dreams of you
I tried to make you love me
somhow that just ddnt work out
You crushed me
All i wanted was one night
Guess you werent meant for me
Cause i know You missed out
Yeah, you missed out

--short guitar solo--

yeah, you missed out
