Kill everyone here
Ain't no survivors
Am I making it clear
Yea, I'm making it clear
Ruff Ruff
Ah, they won't do anything
I don't know about you,
but I feel I got all the power in the hand
There's no line that I wouldn't cross
No divide between me and that
Sha la la la la la la yea
This opportunity
Lose hope
Kill everyone here
Bang bang bang
I ain't scared
With the ruff ruff
Yea I ain't scared
I don't know about you,
but I feel I got all the power in hand
