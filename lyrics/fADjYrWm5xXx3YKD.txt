All I ever wanted to be
You strip a sense of self from me
And it all remains a blur
Sordid
Ever hounding
I wish somebody would have told me
Cause the past you can't get back
Feels like somebody wore me
There's a deliverance I lack
And it's in my body

I wish somebody would have told me
Cuz the past you can't get back
Feels like somebody wore me
There's a deliverance I lack
I can't remember everything
You break the bread
You drink the wine
You were a bad man
You break the bread you drink the wine
When we scream inside
You break the bread you drink the wine
You fucking joker
You break the bread you drink the wine
Wish somebody would hold me
Cause the past I can't get back
Feels like somebody wore me
Yeah there's an innocence I lack

I see you with your narrow eyes
Plotting in your heart
I knew you were a miserable
Pitiful harm
I see you with your narrow eyes
Plotting in your heart
I knew you were a miserable
Pitiful harm

You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread and you drink the wine
You break the bread
You break the bread
And you drink the wine

I can't remember anything
You break the bread you drink the wine
You were a bad man
You break the bread you drink the wine
When we scream inside
You break the bread you drink the wine
You fucking joker
You break the bread you drink the
All I ever wanted to be
