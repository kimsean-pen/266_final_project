It's 6AM, I'm shivering beneath the bed sheets
The pillowcase fell off last night when I held it in my arms. I read
Short stories, while you twitched in your sleep beside me, your
Breath it fell so heavy, as I sat there in the dark

And oh you whispered quiet, making friends beneath the
Scenery of a sun cracked open sky beneath the dark lids
Of your eyes. You were skipping stones and I was still alone
When I turned off the light, scribbling onto sticky notes

I am scared and that's the best that I can say

I work a job to pay the debt I owe my family, to pay back for
That one time I pushed your chin. All this hope I hold just buries
Its evil in me out of sight, but it slips through a whole
In my side, I've seen another of me and you

So we'll climb in that Buick down 222, and I'll
Close my eyes, the sun goes down each time I see the light
I swear it's true. Because I've loved down with this crown watching
Old dogs age without whimpering, and I find it hard to say that
I am strong

But I'll be sure with each passing breath to read you
Stories that are glimmering with the light that reflected
Off these marigolds that caught my neck when I hit
The ground

And oh you whispered quiet, making friends beneath the
Scenery of a sun cracked open sky beneath the dark lids
Of your eyes. You were skipping stones and I was still alone
When I turned off the light, scribbling onto sticky notes

I am scared and that's the best that I can say

All we are is all we are and still I will become, all I am and all
I thought I can't recall because
I thought I can't recall because
I thought I can't recall because
I thought I can't recall because
I thought I can't recall because
I thought I can't recall because

And oh you whispered quiet, making friends beneath the
Scenery of a sun cracked open sky beneath the dark lids
Of your eyes. You were skipping stones and I was still alone
When I turned off the light, scribbling onto sticky notes

I am scared and that's the best that I can say

I'm still tugging on your hand, like when I was innocent
We used to only lie when we needed sleep
