Take my money!

Black jeans, white tees, black Converse
You know she gets it right
Blue hair, blue eyes, I saw her
I couldn't help it, I was like

I wanna be (be)
Be in the game
I wanna know (know)
Your middle name
If we could go (go)
It won't be the same
Cause' right now
You're killing the game

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money!
Take my keys
Drive this car through the drive thru, please
From the floor to the ceiling
Robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place
Catch that feeling like
Oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh, ohh

Take my money!

Late night, passed out in Tokyo
New York, LA, Chicago
She said her friends
Were at the show
Backstage, we'll let 'em in

They wanna be (be)
Be in the game
They wanna know (know)
What we gotta say
And in the front row
You're going insane
And in the back row
You're killing the game

Everybody's gonna go big tonight
In a couple hours we'll be like

Take my money!
Take my keys
Drive this car through the drive thru, please
From the floor to the ceiling
Robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place
Catch that feeling like

Take my money!
Take my keys
Drive this car through the drive thru, please
From the floor to the ceiling
Robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place

You can all take my money
Take my keys
Drive this car through the drive thru, please
From the floor to the ceiling
Robbing and stealing
Everybody in the place
Catch that feeling like
Oh, oh, ohh, oh, oh, ohh
Take my money!
Take my money!
