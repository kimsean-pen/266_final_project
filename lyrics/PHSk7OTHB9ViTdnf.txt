I've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child

I was tied up like a boat
On a button like a coat
Set free for the wild
I'd jump to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?

I saw behind my brain a haunted stain
It never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take

And I cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Over night?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight

I saw behind my brain a haunted stain
I'm never fade
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take

I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child
