Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up
Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up

Got no past, no future, fumbling through the ether
Take a ride in aquila, cost you 30 liras
Pushy dealer hits the meter, a shrewd operator
In the shadow of a beacon have a dirty weekend
Interesting proposition, insinuate then listen
What a way to make a living, scissor to the ribbon
Throw my hands like a reverend, triple sixes, double sevens
When I get down to this I'm the catalyst
For a revolution, for a revolution
For a revolution

Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up
Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up

Beautiful corpse
Beautiful
How you lie so still?
Another life fulfilled
Oh, beautiful corpse
Beautiful
How you lie so still?
Another life fulfilled

Fifteen hundred red cases, a multitude of faces
The body in the basement, double on the bunk bed
You better watch the babies, careful with your manners
Only drinking water on the cabana
Well-built family, subject to the battery the battery
Mental men are manic in their manacles
I meant to make a metaphor for radicals
Taking off my clothes at the lido
All I got is my decadent credo

I don't think that I could watch you posing dead

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up

Abandoned by a suffragette, given to a gang of gits
Sold to a pack of losers downtown apalucia
I heard you got guns, well, I got fun
I got something sweet, what you call sin so
You lose, I win
I saw some bunch of cowboys today
I whooped-di-wood and they turned and rode away

Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up
Come here and do the right thing
Get up and have a party
Get up, get up
