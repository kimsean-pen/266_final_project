Is one lifetime enough
To go through all the layers of
What life has to offer
What life has to offer

All I have
Time for is
Knowing what
Time it is
And what we have to offer
What we have to offer

Knowing what time to stop
Never having lived enough
My mind is made up
My mind is made up

One lifetime
In layers
Of a lifetime

(One lifetime)
One lifetime
(In layers)
In layers
Of a lifetime

Waking up
When time is up
Having had
Just enough
My mind is made up
My mind is made up

One lifetime
In layers
Of a lifetime

One lifetime
In layers
Of a lifetime

(One lifetime)
One lifetime
(In layers)
In layers
Of a lifetime

This one time
on
Take me through the layers
Of this lifetime
