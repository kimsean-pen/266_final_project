I still remember when you used to be my friend
How could you take everything we had andthrow it all away
The sound of silence is getting old
Stuck inside this hell
Your heart may beat but still is cold
Tell me how low can you go

You don't ever stop, stop, stop
Until you get your way
And I'm getting sick, sick, sick
More than I'd ever say
I bite my tongue every time and keep it in
Beacause you won't ever stop, stop, stop
Until the bitter end

So here we go until it all breaks down
I still remember when you used to be my friend
I'm sorry if somehow you think I'll take the blame you're wrong
Take a look inside the mirror
Go point the finger at yourself

You don't ever stop, stop, stop
Until you get your way
And I'm getting sick, sick, sick
More than I'd ever say
I bite my tongue every time and keep it in
Beacause you won't ever stop, stop, stop
Until the bitter end

Building there four falls around yourself
A prison cell you call your home
Thinking it's easier by yourself
With no ones help
But you're so wrong

You don't ever stop, stop, stop
Until you get your way
And I'm getting sick, sick, sick
More than I'd ever say
I bite my tongue every time and keep it in
Beacause you won't ever stop, stop, stop
Until the bitter end
