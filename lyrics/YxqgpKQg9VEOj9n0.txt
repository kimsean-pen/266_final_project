I watch you and your friends
You stick out so sorely girl
You grow up a poorly girl
Girls who don't go out and play
And you at your wit's end
With your meaningless conversations
Well I tell you they test my patience
And maybe we could be friends

As light as a feather while
Grade A smart color while
She's now Heather while
So I see you laugh together while

Heather, she lives, she breathes!
She's beautifully unconventional
She seems to be
From the best place in the world
Must be the best place in the world

Head way up in a storm cloud
Calm but so extreme
Did you ever analyze your dreams?
You know, nothing is what it seems
You're a walking contradiction
Cute with such conviction
But dark is a devil who walks
And as loyal as a stalker who stalks

Changing like the weather while
As tough as leather while
Floating in the ether while
Friends forever but

Heather, she lives, she breathes
She's beautifully unconventional
She seems to be
From the best place in the world
Must be the best place in the world

She's beautifully (unconventional)
I long to see (her arms above my soul)
I long to be (with her forevermore)
She's beautifully
As light as a feather
Grade A so clever
Floating in the ether
Friends forever
