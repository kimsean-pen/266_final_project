Had to go for a ride she drives me crazy
Got a lot on my mind I just hit 80
Shit been pissing me off a whole lot lately
Think I'm ready to die please lord take me

Had to go for a ride she drives me crazy
Got a lot on my mind I just hit 80
Shit been pissing me off a whole lot lately
Think I'm ready to die please lord take me

Take me away from here
Take me far far away from here
This was my worst fucking year
I could drown in my own tears

When I die who gon' come to my funeral?
Todays the day I sh'd of done it sooner tho
I been feeling way too low
You told me that you loved me
Then why'd you go?
You bring the fucking worst out of me
I ain't shit thanks for telling me
You bring the fucking worst out of me
I ain't shit baby I agree

You drive me to drink
You drive me insane
I hate when we fight
But I love all the pain
You're my courtney love
I'm you're kurt cobain
Bought a Glock so I could blow my brains
It's time to lay down
I'm on my way down
Tell my mommy
That I'm sorry
I'm sorry
