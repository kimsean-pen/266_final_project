And all the rain is full of ghosts tonight, London in mortal terror
You can kill a lifetime without feeling anything but skin

Your eyes are labyrinths of lies (labyrinths of lies)
And all the dead will rise
And I will walk the earth searching for candlelight
And I will let you drown (I will let you drown)
Turn your world upside down
And I will walk the earth searching for candlelight

Real beauty on the inside does not apply to you
I am the ripper and it's killing time in this cutting room
Our worst wounds we inflict upon ourselves
I am as hollow as my willingness to let go

What could be more beautiful than death?

Your eyes are labyrinths of lies (labyrinths of lies)
And all the dead will rise
And I will walk the earth searching for candlelight
And I will let you drown (I will let you drown)
Turn your world upside down
And I will walk the earth searching for candlelight

And when the dead walk the earth
All the living will fill these coffins
And at the end of the world
I'll remember to bring you flowers

And when the dead walk the earth
All the living will fill these coffins
And at the end of the world
I'll remember to bring you flowers
London in terror, London in pure terror
And when the dead walk the earth
All the living will fill these coffins
