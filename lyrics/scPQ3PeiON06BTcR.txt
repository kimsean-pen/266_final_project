Looks like I've been crying again over the same thing
I wonder if anyone has ever cried for me
Nothing means anything, at least anymore
Even my tears have gone, room temperature

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

I was sitting here last year, the same time ago
Still wearing the same thing, these aren't even my clothes
I've just don't change that much 'cause who's to impress?
There's nobody around when I'm at my best

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
