Caroline,
I miss you more than I ever wanted
I don't know you but I know you are beautiful
Caroline,
Your eyes are little pools of death
You're a waste of my time but I couldn't care less
'Caroline, please kill me' said my spirit to your mind
I will hang out on your feelings until the end of time
She's so over
Caroline,
I love you more than I ever wanted
I don't want you, I don't want you to go away
Caroline,
Your eyes are dead like outer space
And I know that I am boring, I can read it on your face
'Caroline, please kill me' said my spirit to your mind
I will hang out on your feelings until the end of time
She's so over
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
