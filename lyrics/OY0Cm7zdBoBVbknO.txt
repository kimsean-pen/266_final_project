Ay, ay
Whoo-hoo
Ay, ay
My mic sounds nice (check one)
My mic sounds nice (check two)
My mic sounds nice (check three)

Hey, what you gonna do when I step in the room?
Bet you mutherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Bet you mutherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Get down to the beat and rock to the tune
What you gonna do when I step in the place?
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass
I, I get money all day, baby
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Spend that money, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
All day, all day, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Roll up in the ghost, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in green
Diamond on the neck, got a diamond on the ring
Cash rules everything around me, cream
Dolla, dolla bills all around me, me
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I didn't mean to roll up to the club in the ghost
I didn't mean to pull out a bottle of the mo
Do the champagne shower spread, spraying on the clothes

I didn't mean to hurt 'em, I didn't mean to kill 'em
I didn't mean to make 10, 20, 100 million
And ever since I made it, I been murdered on the ceiling
I know why they be hatin', 'cause I be top billin'
And now I'm cold, cool and cold, chilling like a villain
They feeling my diamonds, the gold on my grillin'
I smile like I swallowed a jeweler
I'm ill and I'm sick with the paper my bank keep on filling, uh

Hey, what you gonna do when I step in the room?
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Get down to the beat and rock to the tune
What you gonna do when I step in the place?
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass
I, I get money all day, baby
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Spend that money, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
All day, all day, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Roll up in the ghost, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing, swimming in Lou
Swimming in fashion, gotta stay cute
I kill 'em if I show 'em my birthday suit
I kill 'em when I roll up in my Merce' Coupe
I don't mean to show off, I don't mean to floss
I don't mean to be the head bitch and the boss
I didn't mean to buy up the whole damn bar
I didn't mean to spend it like what, what it cost?
I didn't mean to whip out the keys to the city
I didn't mean to dress so fresh and pretty
I'm talkin' 'bout my ladies, rub on your titties
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
Ladies, rub on your boobies
Yeah, honey, I said it, rub on your boobies
I don't mean to hang with these ladies with booties
We loud and we crazy like we in a movie

Hey, what you gonna do when I step in the room?
Bet you mutherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Bet you mutherfuckers gon' rock to the tune
Get down to the beat and rock to the tune
What you gonna do when I step in the place?
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass
Bet you motherfuckers gon' rock to the bass

Roll up in the ghost, bitch
Like it ain't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Not, not a, not, not a damn thing
