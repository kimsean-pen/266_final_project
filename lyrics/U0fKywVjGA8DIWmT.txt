I don't believe in the secrets you keep
But I do wanna know
How do you sleep at night

And I'm over you, congratulations
Thank you for all the pain
'Cause it made it be so much more fun

There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead
And I don't believe there's a way now
All that is said has been said
I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind

But I'm leaving with blood in my eyes
Seen through the lines
While believing the lies

For too long a time
And I still don't know how I did
And now war's declared

Drawing the battle lines
And I can't see straight anymore
With all of this blood in my eyes
There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead
And I don't believe there's a way now
All that is said has been said

I'm waiting for another day, another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So I'll leave it all behind
But I'm leaving with blood in my eyes
