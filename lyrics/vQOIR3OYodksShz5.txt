you are too afraid to say it's said
well I think it's the silent rule
that it's coming back to you
and you know that
and it's a colder night
because I haven't seen you
so it seems that you're still so afraid of me
yet I stand and wait baby
and it is so sad

she keep on telling me that I should act like a man
look a lil bit closer please
cuz' you have no plan
your fear doesn't let me be
the one that you need
I'm not the one that you've been looking for
stop there you know just what it takes

and yes you're afraid to take the step
well I believe in the silent rule
that it's coming back to you
and you know that
and it's a warmer night
because I haven't seen you
so it feels that you're still so afraid of me
such a shame to me baby
and it is so sad

come along just to get me baby
anything you say to me girl
it's something about your style
there's nothing to regret

she keep on telling me that I should act like a man
look a lil bit closer please
cuz' you have no plan
your fear doesn't let me be
the one that you need
I'm not the one that you've been looking for
stop there you know just what it takes
