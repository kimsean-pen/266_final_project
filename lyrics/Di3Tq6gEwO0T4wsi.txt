They'll give us something
they'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it

They'll give us something
they'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it

With pencil and light
You heard your love again
you wrestled your nightmares
the sweat in your bedsheets

This is all of it
this is everything
I'm wanting to forget

When winter sets in
it has a way of crystal-
lizing the bad times
The fevers the heartaches

This is all of it
this is everyone
I'm wanting to forget

They'll give us something
they'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it

They'll give us something
they'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it

With pencil and light
You heard your love again
you wrestled your nightmares
the sweat in your bedsheets

This is all of it
this is everything
I'm wanting to forget
