Another East Bay night
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)

When the sun goes down and the night come around
And the fog come a'rolling in
When you cast a line to go dance one time
And an old friend invites you in
Hear a punk rock song and we sing along
Everything gonna be all right

Another East Bay night
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)

Well Gran'ma stands on the very same land
On the old house up on the hill
You can see the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz Albany landfill
And reminisce on the front porch under a yellow light

Another East Bay night
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)

Earthquakes shake and fires take from this view
I've seen it all, I've tasted smoke as the hills burned
I heard the freeway fall, when there's nothing to say
Just look into the bay
You know some things, they just feel right

Another East Bay night
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)
(East Bay night)
