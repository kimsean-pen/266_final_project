Rise, and rise again! when the traitors stripped the land, the true wickedness of man was
Great. the deluge sentence passed upon his flesh and bone, he tore great fists of clay to
Create what should not have been.

Rise, rise! rise, rise! rise, rise! and rise again! and so let it be written, that when the
Silver pool is empty the vagrants will dine on that which they expel. breathing life
Into a living statue, which moves with rigid stillness and lurks beneath the waves,
Unseen

We shall not bow down to he who wields the trident. we shall not kneel for he who
Spawns the silent. we shall. not bow down to he who shakes the earth. destroying
Blackened paradise-a savage rebirth. we shall not bow down to he who shakes the
Earth. destroying blackened paradise-a savage rebirth

Moving to erase his canvas-awash with the darkest depths of the abyss and sparkle of
The surface. it gleams deceitfully awaiting life to swallow, tranquillity exposes
Nothing of the perfect storm that will rise.
