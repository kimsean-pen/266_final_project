What you now are seeking
Hope to real life
Don't give it till the weekend
It will take weeks, months, years,
It will take you your whole life

Cuz it's not a question of the convalescent time
It's a thought that lives in the back of your mind
It is a story told with many different endings
Somehow it will always sound that same

It's like the dreams we chase these days,
Well they all have patents pending, but
None seem to hold your name,
Your name, your name, your name

So we try to figure out why you never think of anything smaller than
Galaxies
While spend eons wondering what happened to our thundering
It's gone
