Snake in it
jack into the wall
TV amp on fire
blowin' in the hall
gun yr. sled
close yr. peeping toms
turbo organizer
crankin' on the knob

You got it
yeh ride the silver rocket
can't stop it
burnin hole in yr pocket

hit the power
psycho helmets on
you got to splice yr. halo
take it to a moon
nymphoid clamor
fuelling up the hammer
you got to fake out the robot
and pulse up the zoom

You got it
yeh ride the silver rocket
can't stop it
burnin hole in yr pocket

can't forget the flashing
can't forget the smashing
the sending and the bending
the ampisphere re-entry
You gotta have the time
Got a letter in your mind
Gotta heart injection
That you got yourself a line

You got it
yeh ride the silver rocket
can't stop it
burnin hole in yr pocket
