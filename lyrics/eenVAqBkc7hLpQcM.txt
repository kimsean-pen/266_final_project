Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me, while I stare at you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me, while I stare at you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at, me while I stare at you

It's true, I crave you
It's true, I crave you

I walked into the room dripping, in gold
Dripping, dripping
I walked into the room dripping, in gold
Dripping, dripping

It's true, I crave you

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Crave you
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Why can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?
Can't you want m-me?

Let's just stop and think
Before I lose faith

I walked into the room dripping, in gold
I walked into the room dripping, in gold

A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told

My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled
Oh, I cannot solve

Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me, while I
Crave you
