Through the winter night
In my darkest hour
You glow
You glow in the darkness

Both my hands are numb
And my heart is frozen
You burn
You burn like a fire

A thousand voices
A million words
Calling for my heart
You start a fire
You breath your life
Within

I can't bear the weight
I have burned my bridges
So clear
Your words still remind me

Out of the dark
Out of the night
You will keep us warm
Until dawn

A thousand voices
A million words
Calling for my heart
You start a fire
You breath your life
Within
