You just can't stand the way that I walked out from the wreckage
Can't understand the way that I turned myself around
I try to terminate this war, with you
But you won't let it go you keep coming back for more

Freedom
I'm taking it back
I'm outta here, no turning back
In a baby blue Cadillac
Just when I was stalling, I heard an angel calling

This is your life, you can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it and drive it like you stole it
Rollin, this is your life, you can be anything
You gotta learn to rock and roll it, you gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it, and drive it like you stole it

We get stuck in the dirt and we cant see where we're going
We've faced all kinds of hurt and the friction slows us down
But I won't be waiting here for the world to end in gold
I leave your dust behind me stranded in the road

Freedom
I'm taking it back
Attitude I'm giving it back, in a baby blue Cadillac
Just when I was stalling, I heard an angel calling

This is your life, you can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it, you gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it

This is your life, you can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it and drive it like you stole it
Rollin, this is your life, you can be anything
You gotta learn to rock and roll it, you gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it
And drive it like you stole it
And drive it like you stole it
And drive it like you stole it
