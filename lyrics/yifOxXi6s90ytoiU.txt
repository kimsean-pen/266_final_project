Won't someone give me a gun?
Oh, well, it's for my brother
Well, he writes the line, wrote right down my spine
It says, "Oh, do you believe in love there?"

So slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over

Won't someone give me some fun?
As the skin flies all around us
We kiss in his room to a popular tune
Oh, real drowners

So slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over

Slow down, slow down, you're taking me over
And so we drown, sir, we drown, stop taking me over

You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over

Stop taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
