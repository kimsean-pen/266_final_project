Se il volere tuo è questo
Lotteremo, male no, non vicerà
Inside we all should know
That saints don't care
They'll send the infantry
To fight our wars
March on
Just follow me
Carry on
The Lord will be
Leading the fight
Be at your side
Design
Refine
The ancient art of war
Dismember what stands in our way
Define, the olden art once more
Inside we all should know
That saints don't die
They stay far from the heat
Won't burn their hands
March on
All blessed by me
Carry on
The lord will be
Leading the fight
The guiding light
Design
Refine
The ancient art of war
You took away our sons
Used them to satisfy
Your sick needs for power
Infected with your lies
They followed your commands
And plunged into darkness
Many will fall
But who cares after all
Feed our sickening desires
Fire!
Children will die
Innocence, bombed with lies
Pull the trigger and fire
Liar!
Blind greed won't last
Ma lottando troveremo la tua luce Che ci salverà
Inside we all should know
That saints don't cry
We can't deny
Cannot stop this machine, driven by us all
No more
Can't predict the outcome for these massive flaws
Take this chance, grasp the last straw
Change the errors one by one
March on
Just follow me
Carry on
The lord will be
Leading the fight
Be at your side
Design
Refine
The ancient art of war
Dismember what stands in our way
Refine, the olden art once more
Bastards
Liars
Retire
Resign, it's not worth dying for
