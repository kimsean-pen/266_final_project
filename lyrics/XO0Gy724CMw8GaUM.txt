This time i'm leaving for good
I'll show them all that I could
Come with me run to the woods
Show them they misunderstood
And big eyes, don't cry
And big eyes, don't lie
And big eyes, don't cry
And big eyes, don't lie about it
()
And if all we had to answer was you and me
And if all we had to run from were wolves and beasts
Oh I, could be, a fantasy
And you, could breathe, the night with me
Are you afraid of them now?
Now that your head wears a crown?
I'll be the sword at your side
I'll be your friend for all time
