Broken windows and empty hallways,
a pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,
the frozen smiles to chase love away.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna to rain today.

Bright before me the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way.
Human kindness is overflowing,
and I think it's gonna to rain today
oh I think it's gonna to rain today
