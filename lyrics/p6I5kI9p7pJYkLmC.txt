Hey, Mind Reader
You know what I feel before I speak
It always seems you got a one up me
Have a worse for me
Is that what you need?
I've got it all and you've got nothing

Hey, Mind Reader
Bet you didn't see this one coming
'Cause your eyes are never open
I've said sorry, you just mock me
And I'm ready to throw this up and away

I'm not able
Able to say

CHORUS
Don't let me get away
I haven't been honest either
We could use each other
Don't let me get away
I'm not getting any better
We could use each other

(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)

Hey, Mind Reader
Just as soon as I leave the room
My stomach drops, my guts I lose
I'm not the type to follow through
But you knew that, didn't you?

Hey, Mind Reader
Quick steps, reality check
I might be gone before you're back
You bite your nails at the thought of that
Just tell my off
And let me hear you say

Are you able
Able to stay?

Don't let me get away
I haven't been honest either
We could use each other
Don't let me get away
I'm not getting any better
We could use each other

(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)

Start speaking your mind-reading
You can't keep me out
Believe it
Start speaking
Say what you mean
No lies tucked in between your teeth

(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)
(Don't let me get away)

Don't let me get away
(Don't let me get away)
Don't let me get away

Don't let me get away
I haven't been honest either
We could use each other
Don't let me get away
I'm not getting any better
We could use each other

(Don't let me get away)
Don't let me get away
We could use each other
(Don't let me get away)
Don't let me get away
