I got a symphony in my head whispering things I should hide
If I listen it might bring back feelings that I almost couldn't leave behind
Amphetamines you're not supposed to use
Have to figure how to "shhhh"
Move but keep yourself behind the rule
Have to figure how to...
Lie, but you won't
Bright is what you're not
Climb 'til you don't see beneath the lines
They've never been written right
It's like a rolling dice
It goes 1, 2, 3, 4 times
Randomly accurate
It feels chaotic, right
I got a symphony in my head whispering things I should hide
If I listen it might bring back feelings that I almost couldn't leave behind
It's all about the common sense or there's a page telling how to do
Keep the feeling that a man should have the chance to draw his own true line
