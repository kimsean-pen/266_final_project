I was a soldier with no regrets
Walking on a fence
Falling back on my feet again
There was a vision decisions made
To mold me out of clay
Taking away my wings
Ho hoo ho The man I'm supposed to be
Ho Now is the enemy
And I wonder who I am
Will I be someone to remember
After the glory ends
Hiding in my disguise
I'm a stranger, a stranger in my life
I'm perfect but broken
The mirror tells it all
Looking into my window soul
Off in the distance, a different me
No one else can see
Someone I used to know
Ho hoo ho I made all the right mistakes
Yeyeah Now I'm a ghost in the big parade
And I wonder where I've been
Where is the dreamer I remember
Losing a long lost friend
Hiding in my disguise
I'm a stranger, stranger in my life
I woke up, all choked up out of my head
My heart is wide open re-writing how this story ends Hey yeah Ho
And I wonder who I am
Will I be someone to remember
After the glory ends
Hiding in my disguise
I'm a stranger, stranger in my life Ho ho
Stranger in my life Ho ho ho
