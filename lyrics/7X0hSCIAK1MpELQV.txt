You're just way too cool
to get caught up on things,
like how carpet's made of glue
just my feet inside the window
thinking about you, and how you're home from school now.

And if these blanket's weren't shackles,
I'd write you up a letter
full of all my memories
so it could reach you in your bedroom
thinking about him, and how he's home from school now.

But I'm still held captive
by these dusty bookshelves
from the thought of you and I
held ransom by old pictures of when i wasn't selfish
and you were my bestfriend.
