If it's not with you
There is no thing that makes wanna settle down
I thought it was a bad cough
But never knew how much illusions hide a torture

Lonesome and forsaken with no gratitude
Who's goin' to tell, devotion's not the problem
It's me against a wardrobe
Focused on the pain to see how we can get along

Doing things, getting better
I'll move on

(Together)
The more I try the less I care about it
(Together)
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, I forget what you did
(Together)
The more I try the less I care about it
I'm giving up my conscience for another
(Together)
The only one I want is you

Things I wouldn't do
Try to treat me like a friend, get another late call
I'll lose you for another
'Cause you can't believe how much your pleasure is a factor

Writing down the logic of my solitude
As far as I'm concerned I'd like to leave it random
I'm acting like an orphan
Let me get to know you better to make me less attracted

Doing things, getting better
I'll move on

(Together)
The more I try the less I care about it
(Together)
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, I forget what you did
(Together)
The more I try the less I care about it
I'm giving up my conscience for another
(Together)
The only one I want is you

Parisians all gone
Words they're all gone
Parisians all gone
Words they're all gone
Let me tell you
Parisians all gone
Words they're all gone
Parisians all gone
I'm giving up my conscience for another
The only one I want is you
