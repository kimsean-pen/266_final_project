Don't rob, bad idea
You've been so good, I hear
Don't rush
Don't move, bad idea
You've been so still, I'm here for you
Don't rush

One way or another
I'll find my way to cover
I sing to find my other
Sing to find my
One way, my lovely other
Defy restless cover
You sing to another
Sing to find your

Don't leave, bad idea
You've been so far, so wrong
Don't rush
Don't run, bad idea
You move so fast
I need to rush

One way or another
I'll find my way to cover
I sing to find my other
Sing to find my

One way, my lovely other
Hit by restless cover
You sing to another
Sing to find your

One way or another
I'll find my way to cover
I'd love to find my other, love to find you

One way, my lovely other
You'll find restless cover
You fill so many others

One way to erase bad ideas
Well, I won't see you once you arrive
One way to escape bad ideas
Well, I won't cry to you, not that you would mind
One way to erase bad ideas
Well, I won't see you once you arrive
One way to escape bad ideas
Well I won't cry to you, not that you would mind

One way or another
I'll find my way to cover
I sing to find my other
Sing to find my

One way, my lovely other
Hit by restless cover
You sing to another
Sing to find your

One way or another
I'll find my way to cover
I'd love to find my other
Love to find you

One way, my lovely other
Defy restless cover
You fill so many others
