I watched you bleed out
I watched your lungs cave
I saw the worst thing that I've ever seen
As I watched you slip away from me
And out daughter's first breath
Is the last one you will ever take
And I don't think I can make it on my own
Remember, they said you'd have to sacrifice, I know
But I was not prepared to watch the life drain from your soul
I've never felt so crushed
This sand is buried in my bones
How the hell am I supposed to raise a daughter on my own?

I turn to stone when I look in your eyes
(I turn to stone)
I lost the only reason that I'm alive
(That I'm alive)
I don't know if any words will do
All I know is that I'm so in love with you

There was nothing that they could do
After three days of labour it's a miracle that anyone survived
I'm alive, but I'm dead inside
And I'm supposed to raise a child with a smile now
I used to wonder why people put bullets in their brains
Now it seems like the only way to stop this pain
How the fuck am I supposed to wake up every day
And pretend that I love her as much as I love your face?

I turn to stone when I look in your eyes
(I turn to stone)
I lost the only reason that I'm alive
(That I'm alive)
I don't know if any words will do
All I know is that I'm so in love with you

I watched you bleed out
I watched your lungs cave
I watched you slip away from me
And I don't think that I'll ever be okay
