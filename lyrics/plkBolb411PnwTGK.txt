What a strange thought
I'm running around town
I'm trying to find my heart but it's been shot
By the one who holds the gun
Oo he got me, he shot me good
Oo he got me, he shot me good

You you treat me like a fool
You're making me feel used, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
Oo I'm so confused
I guess I pay my dues
Why do I like this abuse, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
You're just another dude

I used stand so tall
Now I cant stand at all
Baby made me fall
He shot me on the wall
Oo he got me, he shot me good
Oo he got me, he shot me good
He had the gun he had the pen I was the mark

Oo baby you, you you treat me like a fool
You're making me feel used, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
Oo I'm so confused
I guess I pay my dues
Why do I like this abuse, by you
Oh what do I do to break lose

Oo baby you got me running running running running all over town
I got nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing to show
But these fools are proof
It's all cause of you

Oo baby you got me running running running running all over town
I got nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing to show
But these fools are proof
It's all cause of you
You're just another dude
