No truth
All lies, disgrace
We are not the same

Fuck your trends, fuck your friends
Fuck your groupies that try to pretend that you're down
You're fucking not
Nobody wants what you've fucking got

You will never be one of us

Our pain (is) not your pain
Our pride (is) not your pride

No truth, no trust
You will never be one of us
Soaked in disgust
You will never be one of us

(This is) Not for you to claim
We are not the same

No truth, no trust
You will never be one of us
Soaked in disgust
You will never be one of us
