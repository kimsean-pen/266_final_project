Yes I'm thinking of this, yes I am
Puddle town Tom was the underground
Hold you tighter so close, yes you are
Please hold on to the steel rail

Colonel with gloves [Incomprehensible]
He isn't loved on 'Sundays mail'
All the fives crock Henrietta
She's mean go-getter gotta write her a letter

Did I wink, did I wink of this, I am
Yum, yummy, yum, don't, yummy, yum, yom, yom
Yes, I'm thinking of this, in steam
Skeleton kissed to the steel rail

Fleas in Pamela gloves [Incomprehensible]
Chugging along with a funnel of steam
All the fives crock Henrietta
She's mean go-getter gotta write her a letter
