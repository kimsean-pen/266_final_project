It's a shame
Growing up with the thought of what we had
But I still want you
I know you want me too
I remember the days when we'd stay up late
And we'd show and tell all our darkest demons
Arrogant as hell
But I'll live to tell
At least we had ourselves to believe in
I've been waiting for a sign
To let you know that
We are running out of time
Now I'm waiting here tonight
I need to tell you somehow
I'm nervous and your guards down
I know that you're the one
I play it safe
But I know there's something I should say
I just want you
Would you want me too
I remember the days when we'd stay up late
And we'd show and tell all our darkest demons
Arrogant as hell
But I'll live to tell
At least we had ourselves to believe in
I've been waiting for a sign
To let you know that
We are running out of time
Now I'm waiting here tonight
I need to tell you somehow
I'm nervous and your guards down
I know that you're the one
Temporary
Loss of feeling
Hearts are racing
This January night
All I want is to get this off my chest
Say the words and our lips can do the rest
Say the word and my lips will do the rest
I've been waiting for a sign
To let you know that
We are running out of time
Now I'm waiting here Tonight
I need to tell you somehow
I'm nervous and your guards down
I know that you're the one
(All I want is to get this off my chest)
(Say the words and our lips can do the rest)
(Say the word and my lips will do the rest)
(It's safe to say I know that you're the one)
Now I'm waiting here tonight
I need to tell you somehow
I'm nervous and your guards down
It's safe to say I know that you're the one
