(Ah, nevermind that outer space stuff, let's get down to earth!)

What is the architect doing?
He is by the riverside
What is he thinking out there?
He is committing egocide
Now isn't that a strange thing?
Well, to him it feels just
Oh we guess a person's gotta do
What a person feels he must

He said:
"I won't throw myself from the pier
I'm gonna go home and shut up for a year
And when the year is over I'll reappear
And have a solution"

I've reason to believe that what I find
Is gonna change the face of humankind
And all these years before, well I was blind
That's my conclusion

Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect

Now the man has understood
That outerspace is overrated
About all the problems on this Earth we should
Worry now to solve them later
And so he's brooding and alluding on a perfect design
He thinks that working on behalf of himself is a crime
He flashes out by the water, a view so divine
He's the architect of his own fate, a man in his prime

He said:
"I won't throw myself from the pier
I'm gonna go home and shut up for a year
And when the year is over I'll reappear
And have a solution"

I've reason to believe that what I find
Is gonna change the face of humankind
And all these years before, well I was blind
That's my conclusion

Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
(That's it, we're going to make it)
(Don't let up)
(Don't let up or we won't make it)
(Don't let up)
(Don't let up or we won't make it)

And so he drew himself a pentagon
Thinking it through a geodesic dome
From the coast of Tahiti to the hills of Rome
Step aside cause the man will take the Nobel prize home

He said:
"I won't throw myself from the pier
I'm gonna go home and shut up for a year
And when the year is over I'll reappear
And have a solution"

Now if these aspirations bother you
Well you are just you, you don't have a clue
I'm sticking to the plan, I will see it through
Let there be no confusion

Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect
(I feel its touch and go)
Cause I'm the architect
