I walk with my head down
I mumble all my words
I keep my feelings to myself only

I never stand my ground
I just stand around
If you love me then why won't you hold me?

Everything and everyone around me is changing
Now that I've been the other woman

Your music rides ten horses in the sky
And gallop through the evening
You, you have no side for me to stand by
In space, I see you and her

And everything and everyone around me is changing
Now that I've been the other woman
Oh, now that I've been the other woman

Like a newlywed hummingbird
Building its home
Stick by stick upon the river

You are green, you are red
You are yurple, you are blue
You are gold, you are silver

Well, my eyes are made of lemons
My tears are made of limes
You love me, you hate me
I'm losing my mind

You know I've sailed the sea of love
Aboard the ship of hopes
I'm the skipper, I'm the captain, I'm the crew

Everything and everyone around me is changing
Now that I've been the other woman
Oh, now that I am the other woman

I will always be the other woman
I'll never be the only woman
The only woman, the only woman
The only woman
