Won't forgive your ways
I strip my mind with all but scorn
The scales of madness mesmerize

Voice your dead prayer

Hey
You used me
But I had none to confide

Under a vail of stars
Where the darkness grows
The pressure from the chain that you hold
Me in
Ornament of scars
And the darkness rising
Over the ashen stains that I hold within

Did not forget the name
I stripped my mind with all but you
The scales of madness just before we die
