this is a reckoning,
a cliched cut of lying tongue
revenge never goes out of style

gorilla honing trigger finger that makes gorilla man
ingrained, there's hate within us all

spiraling I've lost my footing once again
I'm flailing in a tantrum of disgust!

when life holds nothing sacred,
when the loveless turn to loathe
we'll witness this final threatened pose

oh mother war,
I sleep in your arms tonight
I'm burning, I'm burning for your love

this juggarnaut of bronze and alcohol
machines of vengeance now are born

of vengeance we are born
to our graves these grudges shall be sworn

behold the death of emotions never mourned
we'll die before we crawl

twisted ministers of death, praying for a bullet

hail, gorilla suffocate gorilla, maim
an education in howling
ministers of death, we'll be praying
praying for this bullet, hail

gorilla suffocate
gorilla maim
an education in complete misanthropy
