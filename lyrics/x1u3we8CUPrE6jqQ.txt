I don't see the point
You are a replacement
I can't take the noise
I don't care what your saying
I'm preoccupied
Benji's all I'm chasing
You won't get reply
I'm too zoned out here spacing

I got no time, No time
I ain't got shit else to tell you
I got no time, No time
I ain't got shit else to tell you

Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no

You know your smiling boy
You keep on giving lessons
You say I have no choice
Boy you must be crazy
I saw myself when I finally talked to you, I
don't need your help
I was never to lose

I got no time, No time
I ain't got shit else to tell you

Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no
no
Ain't got no time

To all you ladies like me
If you can't really see
just how good you are
Please raise the bar
Please raise the bar

Ain't got no

Baby baby
I would of had your baby baby
I would of held you down
I would of held you down

Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no time
To waste anytime on you
Ain't got no

No, you can't waste no more time
You can't waste no more time
Time, time
No, you can't waste no more time
You can't waste no more time
Time, time
