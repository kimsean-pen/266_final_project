Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina

Out of the flames
A piece of brain in my hair
The wheels are melting
A ghost is screaming your name

Tina, Tina

Bleeding all around
Liquid metal through my veins
The rays break
A ghost is screaming your name

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina

Tina
Bleeding all around
Tina
Bleeding all around, yeah
Tina
Bleeding all around
Tina

Tina
Bleeding all around
Tina
Bleeding all around, yeah
Tina
Bleeding all around
Tina
