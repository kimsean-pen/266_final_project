I'll give you the sun, the rain, the moon, the stars and the mountains
I'll give you the world and all that you wish for
And even more
Girl I'll love you more than you could know
And that's for sure
I'd climb the highest hill, cross the widest sea
Nothin' could discourage me
And I pray that you'll be always there for me
Forevermore (Hoooo oh)
Ready or not
I'll give you everything and more
All that I've got is yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for
I'll give you my heart, my soul, my time my love is a fountain

I will be your earth
Ooooh and all that you need for and even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
My love is pure
I, I'll walk a thousand miles, sail a thousand seas
Nothin' will discourage me

And I pray that you will be always there for me

Forevermore
Ready or not

I'll give you everything (Every little thing)
All that you're looking for
Whooaa, Everything is not anything
If you're not here to share my dreams
You don't know what it means to me
If you'll accept my love

Ooooooh I dedicate my love, my soul, my heart beats for you
Girl I can't get enough so I'll wait for your love
