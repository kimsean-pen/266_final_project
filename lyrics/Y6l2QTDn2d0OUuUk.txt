Press my head against the glass
Infinitesimal city streets
And for a moment I welcome the axiom
A transfixing breeze of relief
Sailboats littered in the Hudson
Today is Saturday
Cloudless people in sunglasses
The black glitter of New York City

I write you ceaselessly and abstracted
I hang out with old friends
And they unknowingly remind me
Of who I was before we met
You were somewhere out in the desert
You frame the natural light perfectly
Will you come back soon and
Let me love you completely?

I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you grow into a ghost

While all the desperate people around me
Breathe life into objects with certainty
The likelihood of death in this very cab I'm in
Will be today's undoing
All the desperate people just like me
Breathe life into objects with certainty
The likelihood of death on this corner
I'm standing on will be my own undoing

I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you grow into a ghost

I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
I watch you
