Hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
We're here to pull ya
Back in to do it all the same

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Not sent to save ya
Just here to spank ya
Play some games

Do it long, long, doin' it long
Do fine, fine, doin' it fine
Go in, out, goin' in, not out

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Not here to praise ya
Just here to raise ya
Fill you full of maze

Hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
We're Mr. Bitter
We'll take a bit of this and that

Hallelujah, hallelujah
When Shaun William Ryder
Will lie down beside ya
Fill you full of junk

Just here to spank ya play some games

Do it long, long, doin' it long
Do fine, fine, doin' it fine
Go in, out, goin' in, not out

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Not here to praise ya
Just here to raise ya
Fill you full of maze

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
