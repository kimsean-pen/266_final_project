You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and this model sit outside of the side
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night

Dad was a risk taker, his was a shoe maker
You greatest hits 2006, little list maker
Caught in the melody, you wait in the car
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

Interest in colors, I discover myself
If your highlife is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in coats, you should be lining the walls
When your birth right is interest, you could just accrue it all

Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
It's a line that is always running
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

You can turn your back on the Biddlewood
You can turn your back on the Biddlewood
You can turn your back on the Biddlewood
You can turn your back on the Biddlewood

Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
