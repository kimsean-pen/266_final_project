I know you think i'm afraid
To take a chance
Go into the deep end
Usher baby
Turn the lights on

These waters, can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trecking through the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No parts, are dry
Lovin' made you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I...
I knew I was ready baby, to take that dive...

Can't help it, no oh
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me, baby
I don't need a life saver, baby
Baby going deeper ain't gonna kill me
And I love the rush I get from it

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until i'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid, oh no

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Lovin' made you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I...
I knew I was ready baby, to take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
All night, baby
I'm not afraid to try
And knew I, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to, take that dive...

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Lovin' made you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I...
I knew I was ready baby, to take that dive...

Oh...
Oh-ho-oh-oh, ready baby
