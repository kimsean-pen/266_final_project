I can hear you cry
From behind the door of your troubled mind
You locked yourself inside
A lonely prisoner of your own desire

Do you feel the burn?
Does it ease the pain?
When you close your eyes
You give in to your desire
One loving side your tower of endless nights

I would burn it down for love
I still smoke around
And I don't get hot
Burn it down for love
There's no force around that can keep us apart

Take my hand
I'll lead the way
Through the darkest parts of these castle' holes
No more masquarades
Will find ghosts and demons
Will preach these ones

I know you're still afraid
I'll guide you through these______
Tossing me the light away
If these blowing flames that you all inspire

I would burn it down for love
I still smoke around
And I don't get hot
Burn it down for love
There's no force around that can keep us apart

I can hear your voice from far
I never shared loneliness
Can you hear me now?
Where are you?

I would burn it down for love
I still smoke around
And I don't get hot
Burn it down for love
There's no force around that can keep us apart

Burn it down for love
Burn it down for love
I would burn it down for love
Burn it all for love
There's no force that can get us apart
I would burn it down for love
