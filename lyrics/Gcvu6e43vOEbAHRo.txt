i've got the world on my shoulders
but i feel good all over
i've got the world on my shoulders
but i feel good all over

in my eyes the stars are cornered
between crimson and clover
they found a way to jump over
meanwhile i'm still getting older

but you
don't you know that i've been let down
travelled through the same grounds
looking at you
maybe i don't see the light
but maybe i'll be alright this time around
this time around

so let them tell you everything you want to hear
and take a picture if you'd like
darling
i'm underneath it all
i need to find a place to put my feet back on the ground
but dont u know that i'm missin it missin it

i've got the world on my shoulders but i feel good all over
i've got the world on my shoulders but i feel good all over
maybe i'm not getting over the way you brush me off, the way you look around
i know you should've come over
'cause it makes me feel good all over
all over now

all over now
all over now
this time around
