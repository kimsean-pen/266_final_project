Too late to leave, blinded by the last night
Too far, too late, too deep
To escape from the hands of this night
Winter has our hearts, it finally tore us apart

The cries of loss, ripping wings
We are frozen on the lake
So close to watch her die
But too far to leave together
This tomb of ice finally ripped us apart
We are sleepless swans, frozen on the lake

Lay down your eyes, blinded by the last night
The sun won't light them any longer
The deeper the dark, the clearer we see
Escaping death only made it stronger

The cries of loss, ripping wings
We are frozen on the lake
So close to watch her die
But too far to leave together
This tomb of ice finally ripped us apart
We are sleepless swans, frozen on the lake

Waiting, silence, burning touch of air
Eyes, frozen, Orion, the map of sky is quiet
November sang us songs of goodbye
But foolish hearts hailed the wait

Winter has our hearts now, it finally tore us apart
We are sleepless swans, frozen on the lake
