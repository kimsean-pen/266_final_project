Menergy Lyrics
Menergy... Menergy... Menergy...

The boys in the barroom
Living it up,
Shootin' off energy.

The guys on the sidewalk
Workin' it out,
Talkin' 'bout Menergy.

Menergy... Menergy... Menergy...

The boys in the back room
Laughin' it up,
Shootin' off energy,
The guys in the street talk checkin' you out,
Talkin' 'bout Menergy.

Menergy... Menergy... Menergy.

The boys in the bedroom
Lovin' it up,
Shootin' off energy,
We all know the feelin'
It's no mistery,
Talkin' 'bout Menergy.

Menergy... Menergy... Menergy...
