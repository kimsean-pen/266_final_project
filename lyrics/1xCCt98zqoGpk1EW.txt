OK, you had sedatives and cold champagne
They say that must be the price of fame
It's not a joke if you can choke on the thought of it
You're not my friend to defend if you're loving it
So Kurt I heard that you squeezed somebody's hand
It doesn't hurt if you think about your fans

Kiro TV
they've got their visions again like it's Oxygen
Kiro TV
they've got their visions again want your heroes dead

(It don't hurt, if you think of your fans)

(It don't hurt, if you think I'm your fan)
OK, they've got your file down at the CIA
They say you're worse than Manson for the US of A
It's not grief if you can see-thru the source of it
It's only true if you're bruised by the force of it
So Kurt I heard that you opened up your eyes

They call it work but it don't make it civilized
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV

They've got their visions again like it's oxygen

Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV- They've got their visions again
Want your heroes dead
Your hero's dead
OK, so time takes your cigarette

They say, it puts it in your mouth then you'll forget
No longer "live 105" - can you hear me?
The life expectancy of any popularity
So Kurt I heard that the side show bet your life
It doesn't hurt that the worst go "Nevermind".
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again
like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heros dead
Kiro TV...
They've got their visions again
Want your heroes dead
(It don't hurt if you think of your fans)
(It don't hurt, if you think I'm your fan)
