Who is it you want to be?
Where is it you need to be?

You are not here, I'm alone
You know that you left
It's really sad
You know it was wrong
At least admit that

I simply can't stop questioning
Why you left here oh, so suddenly
But who am I to question things?
You say I'm merely a boy
I say you're half a man
You're not a man
You know I am

You are not here, I'm alone
You know that you left
It's really sad
You know it was wrong
At least admit that

You are not me, I'm not you
Not everything faced can be changed
But nothing can change until you face this

Wait
Don't turn away
Just stay
Stay
Wait
Don't turn away
Why can't you stay?
Stay
Why does it pain you to stay?
Why does it pain you to stay?

You are not here, I'm alone
You know that you left
It's really sad
You know it was wrong
At least admit that

You are not me, I'm not you
Not everything faced can be changed
But nothing can change until it's faced
