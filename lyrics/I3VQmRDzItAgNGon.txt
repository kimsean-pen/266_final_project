Smiles and her laughter
It's the only thing that I've been waiting for a time
Regardless of our distance and our hope... grows greater
Trapped by pretty eyes and letters for all time
...the only thing that I've been waiting for.

I hope it's something worth the waiting
'Cause it's the only time that I ever feel real
Thunder storms could never stop me
'Cause there's no one in the world like Emily

She's simple yet confusing
Her sparkling eyes make me weak at my words, they tremble
Days seem like years in this month of December
The winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep
And never will I give up trying 'cause you're everything to me

I hope it's something worth the waiting
It's the only time that I ever feel real
'Cause thunder storms could never stop me
'Cause there's no one in the world like Emily,
There's no one in the world like Emily.
