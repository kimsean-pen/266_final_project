Can't shake the headaches
Can't break the chain
I ache for your touches
Bittersweet foreplay
When your legs come open
I run cause i'm afraid

You will feel my every fear
You will cry my every tear
Say Hello Melancholia!
I want you to adore me
I want you to ignore me
Say hello melancholia!

Your pale complexion
Tender embrace
I feel elevation
I feel disgrace
I know you need it
If i must i will obey

You will feel my every fear
You will cry my every tear
Say Hello Melancholia!
I want you to adore me
I want you to ignore me
Say hello melancholia!

The never-ending story of me
Is playing out tonight
The manic streams, the paranoid dreams
Are waiting in line

You will feel my every fear
You will cry my every tear
Say Hello Melancholia!
I want you to adore me
I want you to ignore me
Say hello melancholia!
