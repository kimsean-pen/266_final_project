You're begging
I can feel your knees sinking
When did this bed turn into water?
Is it that good?
My love, my flower
Is she that good?
Am I that good?
My hands are powers
They're just that good

There's no need to ask, babe
I'll give it all to you
Anything you ask me
I'll give it all to you

Desire's burning
Your hands are sweating
When did this room catch fire?
Is it that good?
My love, my flower
Is she that good?
Am I that good?
We go for hours
And it's still good

There's no need to ask, babe
I'll give it all to you
Anything you ask me
I'll give it all to you

There's no need to say a damn thing
Your actions are doing all the asking
I can feel your body trembling
Don't worry, I'ma give it all to you

There's no need to ask, babe
I'll give it all to you
Anything you ask me
I'll give it all to you
