If I asked you do you wanna die
You'd probably just lie and say no, no, no
And if you asked me do I feel sick
I'd probably try to trick you and say how I wish I did
I'd probably try to trick you and say how I wish I did
And that's how I know that it's starting up again
But your petal to the metal and break my arms
Or you can break my legs if you want me to stay put
Underneath the covers I don't care about anything
But hey I would sit on your birthday cake
I'll take what I can take and you can get what you get
'Cause it's your party, treat me how you want
Your mother and your aunt don't care for me anyway
No, your mother and your aunt don't care for me anyway
But I never thought it would happen to me
You cut my hair off in my sleep and put it in the kitchen sink
I never thought it would happen to me
Well you treat me like a little toy and make me do a dance
If you want to, we can make a pact
But it will be an act, it doesn't mean anything
Tie me with balloon strings to the floor
I don't care anymore
You can do what you want
No, I don't care anymore
You can do what you want
