I see your wishes on the wall
And that's all right with me
I see you run to make a call
Putting up to someone free

Your life and my life they don't touch at all
And that's no way to be
We've never seemed so far

What's real? What's true?
I ain't turning my back on you
Where're you goin'? Where've you been?
Making wishes, watching dreams

It might be simple, it might be true
I might be overwhelmed by you
You might be empty
The way your eyes just look right through

It's such a mess now anyway
Wish fulfillment every day
I don't believe you
Now I can't hear a word you say

I see you shaking in the light
Reading the headline news
The others they're not quite so right
We want them to choose you
I could almost see your face tonight
Singing simple rhythm'n'blues
You'll always be a star

Shake it baby
Come on scream
Just seen your face in a magazine
Don't doubt it
Leaves 'em sore
I can't stand it anymore
It's my favorite shot of you
You look so pretty your eyes were true
I'm still on your side
In spite of everything you do

We're only blood on blood on life
You paint me pictures every night
Come wish beside me
Don't you know you know what's right
