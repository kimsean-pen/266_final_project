Of all the extras
your're my favourite standing
when no one else is around
there's always you

And I don't care
that you're older than my mother
cause I don't wanna hangout
with those teenage freaks

Your're always my second choice
easily amused my friend

You're not that nice
but i'm not really bothered
When I feel likely
I just look at you
And I just want somebody
I can presto
When I have no better things to do

Yor're always my second choice
easily amused my friend
