Sweaty body, the sun is burning
Yeah, I'm feelin' kinda hot right now
And my t-shirt is now useless

I thought I was ready
Obviously I wasn't
My body's burnin' and I got to get inside
'Cause I'm feelin' kinda dizzy

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you baby
(I'll dream about you baby)

Baby I have to go, really need to leave now
Yeah I'm putting on my t-shirt
It's not what I want to but I have to get inside
'Cause I'm feelin' way too dizzy

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you baby
(I'll dream about you baby)

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you baby
