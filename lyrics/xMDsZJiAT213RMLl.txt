What will one day become of us
We'll grow as grass under their feet
No one here will ever know your name
And you still lie here next to me

If it takes another life, I'll wait for you
On the other side
Everything that comes to me as good
Belongs to you

I'll count our blessings as I wait for you
On the other side
Good luck and I will see you through

Get used to this, you're going to be alright
The world goes on with or without me
If I don't ever leave a thing behind
I'll still leave you without me

If it takes another life, I'll wait for you
On the other side
Everything that comes to me as good
Belongs to you

I'll count our blessings as I wait for you
On the other side
Good luck and I will see you through

If it takes another life, I'll wait for you
On the other side
Everything that comes to me as good
Belongs to you

I'll count our blessings as I wait for you
On the other side
Good luck and I will see you through

And I have a right to be a nothing
And I have a right to be loved
There'll be over the rainbow for me
