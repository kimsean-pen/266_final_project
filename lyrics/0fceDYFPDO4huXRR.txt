Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sittin' in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney

She said," Free that brown eyed man
If you want your job you better free that brown eyed man"

Flyin' across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walk across the sand
She been a walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay

To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history, three thousand years
Back ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear

For a brown eyed handsome man
It's a lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man

Her mother told her darling go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man

That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand

But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two, three, the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game, it was a brown eyed handsome man
