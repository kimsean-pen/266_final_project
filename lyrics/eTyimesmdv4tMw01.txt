Oooh oh yeah

AJ: She keeps the secrets in her eyes
She wraps the truth inside her lies
Just when I can't take what she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

All: I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She danced away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
Nick: But I'm helpless when she smiles
Howie: Oh when she smiles, she smiles

Brian: Maybe I'd fight it if I could (Maybe I'd fight it if I could)
It hurts so bad, but feels so good
She opens up just like a rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she asked me to, I would

I'm out of control
But I can't let go

All: I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She danced away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
Nick: But I'm helpless when she smiles
Howie: Oh yeah
Oh when she smiles, she smiles

When she looks at me (When she looks at me)
I get so weak

All: I'm a house of cards in a hurricane
A reckless ride in the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel
She danced away just like a child
She drives me crazy, drives me wild
Nick: But I'm helpless when she smiles
Howie: Oh when she smiles
Nick: She smiles
Howie: When she smiles
All: When she smiles
Nick: When she smiles
Howie: Ooh when she smiles
All: When she smiles
