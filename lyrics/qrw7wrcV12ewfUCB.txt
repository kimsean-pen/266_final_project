I need pharmaceuticals just to get my cuticles done
I've been running from the moon since I got burned by the sun
Your face brand new but your smile is gone
(Smile is gone, smile is gone)

Oh, welcome to my circus
Another priest without a purpose
Holy Spirit, I can feel it in my cervix
But they wanna shut me down like my pussy's fucking worthless
Okay, bitch? I don't know what to say, bitch
If you really care about another man sucking dick
Then you might be gay, bitch

Summer time, hot as hell
Blunts goin' round like a carousel
Blunts goin' round like a windmill
Oh, it's gettin' sticky like caramel

I'm without it
Gimme that gun, I'ma hold it
Push it, squeeze it, pull it
Bad habits, I just can't control it
Fuck power, fuck you, it's me
I'm up to everything you wanna believe
Reasons for the milk, no cookies
Season's night out, you a fuckin' rookie
Oh, my mind's gettin' violent
It only multiplies in the silence
Give you a fist full of violets
Then watch 'em blossom underneath your eyelids
If my skin was any darker they'd be spillin' my blood
But I don't need to swallow my drugs
Funny how religion's so selective with love
It's so selective with love

Summer time, hot as hell
Blunts goin' round like a carousel
Blunts goin' round like a windmill
Oh, it's gettin' sticky like caramel

Be yourself tonight
Most people don't know how to do that
You can just be your worst tonight
Baby, that's who we are
In fact, I'll punch the mirror, I've kissed it
I've said goodbye and never missed it
And you should (You should)
(Grapes)
