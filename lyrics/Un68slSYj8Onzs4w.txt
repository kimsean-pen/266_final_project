Wait, there was a brighter day
Where I could view the world
Without the sorrows that I've known
(What if I could feel?)
Now it's a different place
Memories fade away without a trace
But there's a shadow
A shadow I can feel
My eyes are closing softly

(I never wanted to be)
Inside these walls I fade away
(I never wanted to be)

Still holding on 'cause this is
Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder
Waiting for the sun to rise again
Crawling closer
So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over

I won't fear anymore
Wait, I know it's not too late
Even though the innocence is scarred
There's still tomorrow
(What if I could see?)
I could just escape
Close my eyes and dream about
A sentimental vision

A vision I could feel
This time I won't go softly
(I never wanted to be)

Refuse to simply fade away
(I never wanted to be)
Still holding on 'cause this is
Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder
Waiting for the sun to rise again
Crawling closer

So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over
I won't fear anymore

What if I could feel?
(What if I could feel?)

What if I could see?
(What if I could see?)
Again?
It's far from over
And I am crawling closer
Far from over
I won't say goodnight
My heart's grown colder

Waiting for my sun to rise again
Crawling closer
So save your kiss goodbye
It's far from over
I won't fear anymore
Far from over, far from over
(Waiting for the sun)
Far from over
I won't fear anymore
