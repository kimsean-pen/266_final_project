Why
Do we always feel that we need to try
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else to feel alive
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes
In believing that it won't make a difference if we try to break away

I know
I know what you must be thinking
That we are
Powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love
I won't
Throw my hands up to surrender
Cause love
Is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love

Time
Don't you think it's just a waste of time
When we're always fighting over material, trivial things in this life
I don't understand why we don't get it right
Why do we keep going round and round
At the end of the day
We've only got ourselves to blame

I know
I know what you must be thinking
That we are
Powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love
I won't
Throw my hands up to surrender
Cause love
Is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love

We got love
We got love
We got love

I know
I know what you must be thinking
That we are
Powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love
I won't
Throw my hands up to surrender
Cause love
Is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
Cause we got love
Cause we got love
Cause we got love
