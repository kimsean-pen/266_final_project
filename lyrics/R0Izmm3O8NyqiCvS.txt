I can't walk the streets now to consolate my mind,
Some pretty mama, she starts breaking down, stop breaking down.
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out,
Well, it'll make you lose your mind.

You Saturday night women, you love to ape and clown.
You won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.
Stop breaking down, stop breaking down.
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out,
Well, it'll make you lose your mind.

I gave my baby the ninety-nine degree,
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me,
Stop breaking down, stop breaking down.
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out,
Yeah, it'll make you lose your mind.
