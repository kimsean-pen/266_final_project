Mama told me not to talk to strangers when I'm out of home
'Cause we live in a universe where no one can really know a soul
Papa told me not to talk to strangers when I'm out of home
'Cause we live in a universe where everything is just hurt and dust
No, I can't regret what I did
'Cause my life won't stop
And Hey(hey), you(you)
Don't forget to grow up
Hey(hey), you(you)
What's your name?
