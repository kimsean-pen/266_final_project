She's a wistle on the wind
Feather on the breeze
Ripple on the stream
She is, sunlight on the sea
She's a soft summer rain
Falling gently through the trees

And I love her

She's cunning as a fox
Clever as a crow
Solid as a rock
She is, stubborn as a stone
She's a hard-headed woman
And the best one that I know

And I love her
Yeah well, I love her

She's as new as the springtime
Strong as autumn blows
Warm as the summer and,
Soft as the snow
She's a thousand miles from here
But she's everywere I go

Cause I love her

She loves me like a woman
She looks like a lady
But she laughs like a child
And cries like a baby
I think that maybe,
She's the one that's gonna save me
