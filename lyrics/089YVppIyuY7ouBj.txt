I know I just met you
Been talkin' your ears off
But I wanna know everything
And I got all night long
Are you tryna be someone for someone?
'Cause you remind me
Of where I come from
So boy, I know it's kinda soon
But I'll tell you what I wanna do

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two
Mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I'm talking about a
Map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like
I do and why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Daddy's gonna love you
He'll probably talk your ears off
Drive you by the little church
That saved me when I got lost
Take you down roads that I grew up on
Wish on those stars that I used to wish on
Kiss you on the bleachers on the 50-yard line
Boy, you know I

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile
Ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I'm talking about a
Map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like
I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

I ain't tryin' to jump the gun
Sure ain't tryin' to make you run
But the second I saw you
I knew I had to get you alone

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two
Mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old song
About two hearts hookin' up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I'm talkin' about a
Map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like
I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

And tell you about me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
