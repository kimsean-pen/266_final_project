Where did you go
Cutco connection
I wanna live up in a tree and sell a knife to a bee
And agree that he won't poke me
(now you don't poke me)
In my 180
In my 180 degree
In my 180
In my 180 degree
Cup in my cap
And I'ma drinka my mimosa!
Read "KEEP CALM CARRY ON" Poster
(Drivin' the kids to the mall and back
Listening to John Mayer
Gettin' my mom on)
Cup in my cap
And I'ma drinka my mimosa!

(Slip into JC Penney's
Having a day sale
Gettin' my mom on)

Culinary perfection
I'm gonna lay out the PB&J while I'm walking away
'Cause I hid the Special K
(Oh that's just for me)
On a paper plate
On a round white paper plate
(Oh, yeah)
On a paper plate
On a round white paper plate
Cup in my cap
And I'ma drinka my mimosa!
