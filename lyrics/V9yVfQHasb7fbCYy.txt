Whenever you are feeling lonely and afraid
The time will pass away on you
So many times you feel like losing the pain
And you try to fade away
暗闇の中 切り裂かれた記憶を蘇らせて
夜が明けても眠れないまま傷跡を残していくの
たった一つの思い出も投げ捨てて
We can't find you anything now!!
There's nothing to be seen
We can't find you anything now!!
I will never... say it
Tell me when you will come back
Will wait 'til the time is over
Tell me when you will come back
I will never... say
Now you remember when you were afraid alone
And you will start over again
You understand that you can't change, the time is gone
But it is nothing you can break
積み重ねてたモノが崩れて形がなくなる前に
寂しくないと気付けないから足跡を消してみるの
閉じ込めてた言葉でも届いてくれるなら...
Hello, what's going on my friend??
You can always count on me
Hello, what's going on my friend??
I will take it... over
Goodbye to the painful days
Maybe I can see you later
Goodbye to the painful days
I wil take it... over
You'll decide,
It may be hard to achieve
and memories might never let you go
You'll believe,
if you could leave it somewhere in your heart
Today, it will be with you
大切なモノはココにあるのに君と僕だけが
今、まだまだまだまだ遠くて
いつしか失くした何かを抱えてソコに行くのは
僕てはなく君だから
We can't find you anything now!!
There's nothing to be seen
We can't find you anything now!!
I will never... say it
Tell me when you will come back
Will wait 'til the time is over
Tell me when you will come back
I will never... say
