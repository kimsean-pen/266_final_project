I'm not sure I want to step outside with my
Emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of great concern and the emotion in your eyes of my
Emotional haircut
It's better to me
It's much better than it used to be
Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV
You missed that you've been told about whatever
Led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just harder to do whatever you please
And dream yourself tonight
To a little love life

Now we all get ideas
I know I should shut em down with the
Emotional haircut
Now I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this
Emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We're gonna toast to the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you're in love with the bodies in here and your
Emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put this shit on repeat
You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can't delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of the dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin to bones when you just can't sleep
I know you can't calm down

Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out to the
Out to

You know what it does
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat
Come on
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen
It's coming down
