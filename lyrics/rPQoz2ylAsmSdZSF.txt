You're calloused (You're calloused, baby)
But you don't even know (But you don't even know)
I'm picking at my scabs (At my scabs)
I'll let all the bruises show

I'll never forget
What all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral
Was my last regret

I hear a telephone
Three thousand miles from home (Three thousand miles from home)
Do you even really care? (Really care?)
Your heart is just a stone

I'll never forget
What all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral
Was my last regret

I'll never forget
What all these feelings meant
Flying home for a funeral
Was my last regret
