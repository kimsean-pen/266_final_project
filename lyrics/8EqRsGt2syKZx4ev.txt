We were talking all night
Slow dancing into a fight
Turn me into the wild
Turn me into a child again

There's nobody else like you
There's nobody else like you
There's nobody else like you

Maybe I want to spend my life with you
Maybe I want to spend my life with you
I wanna feel like other people do with you
So maybe I want to spend my life with you

I had time on my side
Lost it by playing you right
That's the luck of the draw
But you were all I was playing for

Maybe I want to spend my life with you
Maybe I want to spend my life with you
I wanna feel like other people do with you
So maybe I want to spend my life with you

Don't know what I want to do
Don't know what I want to do
Don't know what I want to do

But maybe I want to spend my life with you
Maybe I want to spend my life with you
I wanna feel like other people do with you
So maybe I want to spend my life with you
