On my way to the 7th house
I ended up
Caught right in the river's mouth
Spinning in circles

Fake water feels
Black and cool
But it wears me out

All my powers used up
Getting to you
Easier to float along

Canoe
Stuck between two
Shores
Canoe

Was built for you
And I
Canoe

She's not an enemy
She's a friend to me
And she'll let me leave
If I ask nicely

All she promised me
Was eternity
But I couldn't keep
Up the energy to row
Just float!

Canoe
Stuck between two
Shores

Canoe
Was built for you
And I

Canoe
Stuck between two
Shores

Canoe
Was built for you
And I

Canoe
For you and I
Canoe
For you and I
