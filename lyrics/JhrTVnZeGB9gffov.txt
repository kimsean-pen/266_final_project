I can't be everything that you want me to
Fill my mind up with silly dreams is all I seem to do
And people look like they're specks of dust when you're...
This high off the ground
I'll do my best not to let you down
So feet don't fail me now

'Cause I am walking the tightrope
I am walking it for you
I am living on high hopes
Now they're, now they're crashing through
So I hold my breath
And close my eyes
I grab my heart when I realize
I am walking the tightrope for you

I'm fighting with gravity
Trying not to fall
But how come the ones we love can make us feel so small?
Oh, people look like they're specks of dust when you're...
This high off the ground
But everyone's got a line to walk
We got to keep from looking down, no

I am walking the tightrope
I am walking it for you
I am living on high hopes
Now they're, now they're crashing through
So I hold my breath
And close my eyes
I grab my heart when I realize
I am walking the tightrope for you

Oh, the higher we go, the farther we fall
To hearts on the line and the winner takes all
But nobody wins when it's all just a show
I'm losing my grip, gonna slip, now it's time to let go

I am walking the tightrope
I am walking it for you
I am living on high hopes
Now they're, now they're crashing through
So I hold my breath
And close my eyes
I grab my heart when I realize
I am walking the tightrope for you, for you, for you, oh-oh-oh
I'm walking the tightrope, oh-oh-oh
I'm walking the tightrope

I am walking the tightrope for you
