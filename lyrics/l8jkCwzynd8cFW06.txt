Stick, and stones, shattered bones
But in the end they always heal
Take a sip, make a joke
Turn on the pain, but this is real
Every time I look in the mirror, all your words I keep on hearing
Are tearing me apart
Open names, sweeter games
What you did behind my back
Memories echoing
Making sense, now playing back
Every time I look in the mirror, all your words I keep on hearing

I think you might've said too much
Sorry isn't good enough
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
I think you might've said too much

Then you really messed me up
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might've said too much

I can't glue back broken glasses
But I can fix what you were smashing
Don't apologize again
I won't make a frozen bet
No, no, no
Stick, and stones, shattered bones
But in the end they always heal
All the lies, you crossed the lines
You showed me how you really do
Every time I look your way, I can see my future clearer

I think you might've said too much
Sorry isn't good enough
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
I think you might've said too much

Then you really messed me up
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might've said too much

Why you took it all the way?
Why you took it all the way?
Tell me why
Passed the point of no return
Why you took it all the way?
Why you took it all the way?
Tell me why
Passed the point of no return
Why you took it all the way?
Why you took it all the way?
Tell me why
Passed the point of no return
Why you took it all the way?
Why you took it all the way?

I think you might've said too much
Sorry isn't good enough
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
I think you might've said too much

Then you really messed me up
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might've said too much
