We were visiting friends and saying hello
Then getting stoned and not saying much
Watching the people on TV who talk faster than us
I'm still holding the cup
Ignoring the sound of the ice cream truck
Here stands danger he?
She had visiting moods
What it wants to be

We were visiting friends
Wanted words too runny?

I heard a bird in the windowpane
You rolled up your grass
?
But the comfort to know what visiting is
?
Wanting to be friends
The way that they smell
The light hits them differently

The sheets they get cold
The windows are cracked
Do you recognize the room
The posters that fill it
all the â€” spread around
We were visiting mine
(Repeat)
