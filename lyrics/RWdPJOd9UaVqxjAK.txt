When you climb to the top
Of the mountain
Look out over the sea

Think about
The places perhaps
Where a young man could be

Then you jump back down
To the rooftops
Look out over the town

Think about
All of the strange things
Circulating 'round

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to Heaven
When you're going down

Well, all the people
Have got their problems
That ain't nothin' new

With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through

Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up
And sometimes down again

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to Heaven
When you're going down

Satisfaction
Satisfaction
Keep me satisfied

I've got the love
Of a hoochie koochie woman
She callin' from inside

She's a callin' from inside
Tryin' to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her somethin' too

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to Heaven
When you're going down

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to Heaven
When you're going down
