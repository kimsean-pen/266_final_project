all through the night
I was a redwood before your door
so I don't die
realize who was here before

sunlight through the blinds
black hills, white nights

oh and you know
native bones mixed in the walls
adobe bricks can make us
scented wind and red clouds

sunlight through the blinds
black hills, white nights

up on the mountain we climb
watch as the seas rise so high
we will be baptized just like before

sunlight, sunlight

sunlight, sunlight
white nights, sunlight

up on the mountain we climb
see as the seas rise so high
we will be baptized just like before

up on the mountain we climb
we watch the seas rise so high
we will be baptized just like before

sunlight, sunlight
sunlight, sunlight
sunlight, sunlight
sunlight, sunlight

black hills, white nights
sunlight, sunlight
