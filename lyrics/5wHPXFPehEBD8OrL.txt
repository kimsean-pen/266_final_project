This time you have to face your future
Although it's just a dusty road
It's clear that backing down don't suit ya
I hate to break your sacred code

People along for the ride
High noon getting closer

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long

I see you need a trial of fire
A coward would wisely walk away
Heaven help us bide our time
Hideouts get discovered

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long

I think you'll find
Everybody loves a loser
So you'll be fine
You won't be lonely long
