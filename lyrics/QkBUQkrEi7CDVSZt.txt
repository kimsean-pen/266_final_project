Wake up
It's almost over
Something is taking me
Every time I'm up it kills me
With day to day
Shock waves shatter me

I don't beg in security
Get up and don't look back now
Don't look back now
We ride a dying star

Across a burning sea
We're like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria
Giving up

I won't stop fighting
Bring it on, it wont phase me
Any time it makes me stronger
With day to day
Shock waves shatter me
I don't beg in security

Get up and don't look back now
Don't look back now
We ride a dying star

Across a burning sea
We're like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria

Go on day to day
Stirring up the happy sorrow
Why does life got be this way?
Every time i'm up it kills me
Somewhere deep, responding change
Manipulation rapid all around
Dark all these days
Calling on something to follow

Mass hysteria (mass hysteria)
We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We're like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria
