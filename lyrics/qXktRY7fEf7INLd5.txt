(Maniacal laughter)
Ahhh! Okay
(Daytrip took it to ten)

Wait uh
You'll never take up my place uh
Get up and ride in the wave uh
Watch how I get it and change yuh
Keep all the tips I don't wait uh
I tell her sit on my face uh
Sipping my gin with no chaser
Saving not spending the paper
Yea

Getting everything I fucking asked for since the start
I get stupid payed up just for spilling out my heart
I just got a new bitch she rides dick incredible
If she falls in love too fast her numbers getting blocked
Demons all around still
So numb I can't feel
Course you're gonna hate your life if shit is going down hill
Yall all think I'm crazy
Fuck it I'm changing and switching it up
I change the pace and i weave in the dust
I got the throne I'm not giving it up
Yuh

Making sure that everything I do is fucking heavy
Watching everything I'll ever fucking do is legendary
I don't wanna slow it down I wanna keep it resurrecting
Gotta plan it all out no I never will regret it
Never gave a fuck about a penny
Been had cash now my racks steady
Uhhh

Living what I'm talking evidently
Real life shit don't you tempt me
Stay in your lane I know where the fuck I'm going
Keep a mask on my face I don't need to fucking show it
Sitting back in my cave
Steady plotting I'm so focused
I still laugh at the pain
Now my pockets overflowing
Young lxrd still going in like WAHo

Been the illist motherther fucker here I know
I won't share these cheats I code
If you wanna chat that shit then go ahead
Young lxrd still going in like WAHo
Been the illist motherther fucker here I know
I won't share these cheats I code
If you wanna chat that shit then go ahead
Why does the devil try pick at my soul he
still hits like a bitch I could kill him and eat him
