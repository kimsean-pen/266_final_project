It seems this boy's bathed in ridicule
Too forward way too physical
It's time that I had another
I'm always wanting more, if there's another one
Give me some more, I'll have another one
I'll have a slice with your mother

And this boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car, I want a car
I want a car, I want a car

I see losers losing everywhere
If I lose, I'll only lose the care
That I might have for another
I am complete, invincible
If I have one principle
Then it's to stand on you brother

And this boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car, I want a car
I want a car, I want a car

If I like cocaine, I'm racing you
For organic fresh Ecgonine
One kick's as good as another
If I'm tired, I'm tired of telling you
I'm never tired, I'm always better than you
Bye-bye, run to your mother

And this boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
Oh yes I am spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car, I want a car
I want a car, I want a car
