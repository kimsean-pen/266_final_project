When I read your letter I coudn't believe that you'd gone.
I dialled your number but no one answered the phone.
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you wer,
they said they thought that you were ill.
I hired a detective to try and find out where you are.
He managed to trace you, I know that you're living in France.
A watchman saw you climb into someone elses car
and drive off laughing in the night.
Why didn't you tell me. Not leave me this way.
You should have warned me and not waited for so long.

I've tried to forget you but I find myself walking the street.
I went to the doctor and he gave me something to sleep.
I sent you telegrams but you haven't aswered one.
Your mother told me I best leave you ell alone.
I hope your satisfied now you've done this thing to me.
I hope you're pleased with what you've done.
Why didn't you tell me. Not leave me this way.
You should have warned me and not waited for so long.

For so long I never realised just exactly who you are.
I never realised the girl I had before.
I hope you're satisfied you won't hear from me again.
I hope you're pleased with waht you've done.
Why didn't you tell me. Not leave me this way.
You should have warned me and not waited for so long.
