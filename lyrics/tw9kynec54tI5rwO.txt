Let me talk to 'em
I guess you know you made it when they start talking 'bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
Y'all don't pay me no mind
I just gotta get some stuff off my chest, listen
Young, energetic, famous, but don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot, so, basically, sex is not
Difficult to get
That ain't my fault, no, no, listen
And just 'cause I might take advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right, thinking that sex was my life
But that just ain't me
So let me clear it up for those who have obviously misread the code
Listen to me now
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be, yeah
I won't apologize for bein' just a little freaky
I can't help it; it's just in me
But a problem it is not
I'm just fine, y'all
Don't worry 'bout me
Listen
And I won't apologize
For bein' blessed with the ability to satisfy accurately
And quickly find the spot
It's a gift and a curse
Don't mess around
Find my number in your girlfriend's purse
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be, yeah
I never been shy about myself and sexuality
Never been taboo (never been taboo, but if I)
Have to live without
I know it's something I could do
But I just really don't want to
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I, am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But, girl, I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be, yeah
