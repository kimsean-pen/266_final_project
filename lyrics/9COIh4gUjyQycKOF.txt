Back when we had it
So easy
I would surrender
Completely

I built a shelter
For green beings
In the sun
In the sun

Around in the fields we grow
With love for everyone
Dreams we saw with eyes of hope
Until that dream was done

I used to be
So confuse
Now you just want to
Say to you

I was just floating
On an inner tube
In the sun
In the sun

Around in the fields we grow
With love for everyone
Dreams we saw with eyes of hope
Until that dream was done

Around the fields we grow
With love for everyone
Those dreams we saw with eyes of hope
Until that dream was done
