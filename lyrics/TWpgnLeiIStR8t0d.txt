A moth into a butterfly and a lie into the sweetest truth
I'm so afraid of life
I try to call your name but I'm silenced by the fear
Of dying in your heart once again

I see the seasons changing
And in the heart of this autumn I fall
With the leaves from the trees

I play dead
To hide my heart
'Til the world gone dark fades away

I cry like God cries the rain
And I'm just one step away from the end of today

I see the reasons changing
And in the warmth of the past I crawl
Scorched by the shame

I play dead
To hide my heart
'Til the world gone dark fades away

I stay dead
'Til you veil my scars and say goodbye to fate
Before it's too late, before it's too late

I play dead
To hide my heart
'Til the world gone dark fades away

I stay dead
'Til you veil my scars and say goodbye to fate

I play dead
To hide my heart
'Til the world gone dark fades away
Before it's too late
