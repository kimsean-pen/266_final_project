Baby, you're not the only one
I see the things he does to you
all the pain that he puts you through

and i see what's really going on
staying out at night
while you're by the phone
Take it from me
it's a lesson to be learned

even the good guys get burned
take it from me
see, i would give you love
the kind of love that you've only dreamed of
Baby, you're not the only one
you don't have to be afraid to fall in love
and i know that you've hurt in the past
but if you want it here's my heart
no strings attached
He doesn't give you the kind of attention
that a girl like you needs (that a girl like you

needs)
'cuz he always looks around
his eyes wander around
he doesn't see you like i see
Take it from me
it's a lesson to be learned

even the good guys get burned
take it from me
baby, i would give you love
the kind of love that you'd only dreamed of
Baby, you're not the only one (baby, you're not the only one)
you don't have to be afraid to fall in love (to fall in love)
and i know that you've hurt in the past (hurt in the past)
if you want it here's my heart (here's my heart)
no strings attached
Take it from me
it's a lesson to be learned

even the good guys get burned
take it from me
see, i would give you love
the kind of love that you've only dreamed of
So if you want to take a chance with me
(if you) baby (take) take a chance (a chance) with me
(i'll be every-) everything you need (-thing you need)

(because it's our destiny)
(if you) (baby, you're not the only) baby (one) you're not the only one
(you don't have to be afraid to fall) to be afraid

(i know that you've hurt in the past) you've hurt in the past
if you want it here's my heart
no strings attached
(if you) (baby, you're not) baby (the only one) you're not the only one
(i'll be) (you don't have to be afraid to) you don't have (fall in love) to be afraid
(and i know) (because it's our destiny) (that you've hurt in the past) i know that you're hurtin'
if you want it here's my heart
no strings attached
