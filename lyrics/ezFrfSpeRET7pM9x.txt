Its always been up to your friends, they'll make your mind up, for you
The popularity's gone to your head, but still i don't ignore you
You ran for school election, you even got my vote
But you know, my favourite pastime's poetry, and yesterday i wrote

Just because im nerdy
and my friends are flirty
It doesn't mean that i swing that way
You've got complications
And a reputation
Wouldn't wanna get in your way
Oh anyway
This morning you walked past my door

Just like a daydream
But much more
I followed you round to the store
And i was shellshocked
When i saw
You and your friends were smoking
It always makes me choke
And did you know
I'd do anything to have you
But I wouldnt take your toat
(Hey)
Just because im nerdy

and my friends are flirty
It doesn't mean that i swing that way
You've got complications
And a reputation
Wouldn't wanna get in your way
Oh anyway
Anyway, oh anyway
You said my words were beautiful

They almost made you cry

The markings on the wall were jaded
I wonder why
Just because your nerdy
And your friends are flirty

Doesn't mean she won't swing your way
Shes got complications
And a reputation
Go ahead and stand in her way
Just because your nerdy
And your friends are flirty
Doesn't mean she won't swing your way
Shes got complications
And a reputation
Go ahead and stand in her way
But anyway
