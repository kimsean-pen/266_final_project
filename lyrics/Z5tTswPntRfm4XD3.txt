Staring at a photograph of where we used to be
When the sky was bright and crystal clear and life was just a breeze
Oh well, now something's taking you over
You're burning all your bridges and you're left without a clue
You wonder why these memories keeps staring back at you
Oh well, now don't look over your shoulder

Sing for life
Sing for joy
Sing for every man and woman, girl or boy
Sing a song, a simple melody
Sing out loud or just hum
Sing for moments in the past and times to come
Sing for history and destiny
Won't you sing for me?

Standing at the station and you don't know where to go
You're trying hard to hold on to the world you jused to know
Oh well, don't let it get to you baby

Sing for life
Sing for joy
Sing for every man and woman, girl or boy
Sing a song, a simple melody
Sing out loud or just hum
Sing for moments in the past and times to come
Sing for history and destiny
Won't you sing for me?

Don't look back, just keep moving on
Get on your feet and walk into a different zone
Don't care what they say, just let the music play
Hey

Won't you sing for me?
(Sing for me)
Sing for me

Sing for life
Sing for joy
Sing for every man and woman, girl or boy
Sing a song, a simple melody
Sing out loud or just hum
Sing for moments in the past and times to come
Sing for history and destiny
Won't you sing for me?
(Sing for life)
(Sing for joy)
(Sing for every man and woman, girl or boy)
Sing for me
