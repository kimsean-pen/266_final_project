If there was a chance
To save our broken romance
I'd let it go
'Cos now I know

That life doesn't end
You can start again
All isn't gone, just carry on
Be your own best friend

It's easy to survive
Now that I've finally realize

That the world still turns
The stars still shines
The way they did
When you were mine

A broken heart
Is a lesson learned
Though we're apart
Baby, the world still turns

I couldn't believe
That you were going to leave
Without a care
Heading somewhere elsewhere

Ooh, my aching heart
Never thought that we would part
What could I do, my love for you
I was honest from the start

Time takes away the pain
And the sun will shine again

'Cos the world still turns
The stars still shine
The way they did
When you were mine

A broken heart
Is a lesson learned
Though we're apart
Baby, the world still turns

It's easy to survive
Now that I've finally realize

That the world still turns
The stars still shines
The way they did
When you were mine

A broken heart
Is a lesson learned
Though we're apart
Baby, the world still turns

That the world still turns
The stars still shines
The way they did
When you were mine

A broken heart
Is a lesson learned
Though we're apart
Baby, the world still turns

That the world still turns
The stars still shines
The way they did
When you were mine

A broken heart
Is a lesson learned
Though we're apart
