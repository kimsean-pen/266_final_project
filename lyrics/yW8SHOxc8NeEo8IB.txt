I want to go up to Detroit
l want to lie in the shade
I want to visit the President
And then I want to get laid

I want to go down to Memphis
I want to talk to the King
I want to tell him we're sorry
And it won't happen again

I've got a photo of James Joyce
It's a photo by Man Ray
It's not very, very much like him
But it's not for me to say

She sacrifices her body
Almost every night
Just like a lamb to the slaughter
And she thinks it makes him feel right

You give me so many problems
You made me crash in my car
I'll have a martini cocktail
And then we'll see where we are

So just be nice to your brother
I'll take your sister to bed
I can bloc bloc bloc till the weekend
But you'd better come back soon
