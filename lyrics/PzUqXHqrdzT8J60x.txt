These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe.
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free.
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price.
Life time slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a god, was a god,
You would be the death of him.

These colours don't run,
Like colours from the face,
Eyes roll back chemical despair,
It's true what they say life isn't fair.

So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine
So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine

These colours don't run,
Like colours from the face,
Eyes roll back chemical despair,
It's true what they say life isn't fair.

And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free.
I'm struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss
So I guess I'll just say it how it is
You had it all, you fucking pigs!
These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe.
