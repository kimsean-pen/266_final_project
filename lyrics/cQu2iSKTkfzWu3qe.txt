Grafitti skies, skies...
I don't think y'all ready
Yo, I don't think ya'll ready

Grafitti decorations under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension still giving me away
The lessons I've forgotten
In spite of all I've learned
Now I find myself in question
(Point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(Point the finger at me again)

I wanna runaway (I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind (And open up my mind)

Paperbags and angry voices under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension won't seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
(Point the finger at me again)
I'm guilty by association
(Point the finger at me again)

I wanna runaway (I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind (And open up my mind)

Gonna runaway, gonna runaway
Gonna runaway, gonna runaway
Uh, y'all not ready

Hey, yo
I don't think y'all ready for what I'm about to do
Y'all new-skool dudes ain't even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zulu
Two urban jazz DJ's, they paved the way
Let me spit it for y'all who said I wasn't going to make it
Every time I blaze it, y'all the first to hate it
My team reigns supreme to stay strong
Every 2 series son, they scared to put us on
Can't get with the high prince, get off your hiatus
Too many of y'all is dyin' for us so I gotta blaze it
I'm still reppin' BK, Brooklyn D and on
Hell fire and family alienation
Banging hits in the backyard
Out on the episode
I'm a little kid named
Phoenix Orion

I wanna runaway (I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth (I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers (I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door (And open up my mind)
And open up my mind (And open up my mind)
