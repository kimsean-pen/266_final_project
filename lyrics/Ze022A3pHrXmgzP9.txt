What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna, gonna be?
Be, be, be, be

Irresponsible, tired of taking control
It's not impossible for us to have it all
Your gendered principles were so incompatible
But it's not impossible for us to have it all

Let it be, know that we were never meant to be
One condition, at least, so you and I agree
What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

I don't think about the future
(It doesn't matter)
Or whether we'll stay together
(Whether we'll part)
Making promises is dangerous
(I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Nowhere else to go
Turn to you but I hope you know
This love is just for show
One night and nothing more
Wreckless but in control
Like girls, we run the world
So don't tell me it's impossible for us to have it all

Let it be, know that we were never meant to be
One condition, at least, so you and I agree
What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna, gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

I don't think about the future
(It doesn't matter)
Or whether we'll stay together
(Whether we'll part)
Making promises is dangerous
(I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Can't you see that this is fading?
(A love affair)
Baby, let's keep it out of our feelings
(Baby, be fair)
Making promises is dangerous
(I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

And I don't wanna take this falling down, I'll be there
All I want is everything

I don't think about the future
(It doesn't matter)
Or whether we'll stay together
(Whether we'll part)
Making promises is dangerous
(I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Can't you see that this is fading?
(A love affair)
Baby, let's keep it out of our feelings
(Baby, be fair)
Making promises is dangerous
(I'm just a phase)
I'm just your valentine

Nowhere else to go
Turn to you but I hope you know
Nowhere else to go
Turn to you but I hope, turn to you but I hope
Nowhere else to go
Turn to you but I hope you know
Nowhere else to go
Turn to you but I hope, turn to you but I hope you know
