It's that desire over love I have to turn around and cut my bet today
'Cause you're my ceiling of plankton
You hold a white light

And you know
You got that keeping it warm
Got to tie it
Just like my favorite spittle
And the glow
You purple star

And when you notice all your stars are in line
Yes, yes you'll find me
I'll be there waiting right behind
And when you notice that your heart is bleeding
Mine is bleeding, too,
That magic walk that's in your skies

I'll give you all my gush
You make me feel you make me blush
You make me go wow
My whole mind

And when you notice all your stars are in line
Yes, yes you'll find me
I'll be there waiting right behind
And when you notice that your mind is fleeting
Mine is fleeting, too,
That magic walk that's in your skies

But I'll give you all my gush
You make me feel you make me blush
You make me go wow
My whole mind

But I'll give you all my gush
You make still you make me blush
You make go wow
My whole mind
