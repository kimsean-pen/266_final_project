Tell me what does it take to make
Take to make me a man?
You've been speaking to tired gods
I've been conferring with cats
They told me when to look to the sky
Where to stand on that road
Where they led me in secrecy
Tracking signals of gold

(You will wave goodbye to someone)
You will wave goodbye to someone you forgot
(Goodbye to someone)
And I'll say, "Hello, hello, astronaut"

Now and then you look to that sky
From that spot on the road
Wondering at the elusive lights
I'll be harvesting gold
I'll be harvesting gold
I'll be harvesting

('Til you wave goodbye to someone)
You will wave goodbye to someone you forgot
(Goodbye to someone)
And I'll say, "Hello, hello, hello"
('Til you wave goodbye to someone)
You will wave goodbye to someone you forgot
(Goodbye to someone)
And I'll say, "Hello, hello, astronaut"

I've lost my way on this road
Yet found a perfect way for me to go
And to the love who lost me not
I will wave goodbye as I say, "Hello, hello, astronaut"

(Goodbye to someone)
You will wave goodbye to someone you forgot
(Goodbye to someone)
And I'll say, "Hello, hello"
(You will wave goodbye)
(Goodbye to someone)
And I'll say, "Hello, hello, astronaut"
