If I beg you will you smother me
Just to put me out of my constant misery
This is too much for me to bear
You'd know this too if you ever had been there

I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you never leave me

I wander through these empty halls
As the moon casts shadows of just me upon the walls
My time wasted in endless regret
While you sleep away your troubles and forget

I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you never leave me

I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you have sweet dreams
And I hope you will never leave me
I hope you never leave me
