Wheeeeeeen I had you (had you)
I treated you baaaaaaad and wrong my dear
And girl since, since you went away

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you

Ever made you cry
And boy since yer since you been gone

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's lovin' you

Life with out love, huh...

All, all I can do, all I can do since you've been gone is cry
