Can you keep a secret?
Will you hold your hand
Among the flames?
Honey, you're a shipwreck
With your heart of stone

Can I get a witness
To the bruises and
The wasted tears
You could dry a river
With your heart of stone
With your heart of stone

I can breathe
I can breathe water, water
I can breathe
I can breathe water, water

When you're here with me
You're not here with me

Can I pry your finger
From everything I
I say and do
And I just can't forget you
And your heart of stone

I can breathe
I can breathe water, water
I can breathe
I can breathe water, water
I can breathe
I can breathe water, water
I can breathe
I can breathe water

When you're here with me
You're not here with me
