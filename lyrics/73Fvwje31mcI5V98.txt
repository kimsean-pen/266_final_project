Can you take me some other way
A you I can't do all
I'll stable her to make it happen for you.

I know I . the sky

So you ...
With the feel still the glass.

Knew this was always gonna happen
In the breakin' down with all .
now I can be fine, working at your smile
Carry me Elise so I can wait.
Carry me Elise so I can't wait.

Knew this was always gonna happen
In the breakin' down with all .
now I can be fine, working at your smile
now I can be fine, working at your smile
Carry me Elise so I can wait
Carry me Elise so I can't wait.
