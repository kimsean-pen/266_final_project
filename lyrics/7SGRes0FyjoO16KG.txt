They try to bend, they try to break me by design
But I am the nightmare that will haunt you in the night
If thats all that you want, then I'm ready to play
And the world's gonna know my name
Know my name
Know my name
Know my

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I fold
Every crack in my bones
I'm Untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade,
Built to blow you away,
Pull the pin I explode
I'm Untouchable
I'm Untouchable
I'm Untouchable

I'm Untouchable

Born underground I dug myself out from the dirt
With every scar I made a vow to shape the Earth
Unless its pain that you want, get the fuck out my way
Cause the world's gonna know my name
Scream my name
Scream my name
Scream my

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I fold
Every crack in my bones
I'm Untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade,
Built to blow you away,
Pull the pin I explode
I'm Untouchable

Untouchable
Untouchable
Untouchable

Untouchable

You can't let it go
The price that we paid
But I am the grave from which I came
You reap what you sow
We don't bleed the same
Cause I own the rights to my own fate

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I fold
Every crack in my bones
I'm Untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade,
Built to blow you away,
Pull the pin I explode
I'm Untouchable

Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I fold
Every crack in my bones
I'm Untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade,
Built to blow you away,
Pull the pin I explode
I'm Untouchable

I'm Untouchable
I'm Untouchable
I'm Untouchable

I'm Untouchable
