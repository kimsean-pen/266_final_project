Yeah!

Hello again, it's been awhile
How do you sleep with your crooked smile?
Oh what a shame that you've become
A bad excuse for bleeding gums

You had your chance when we were young
But now you sleep with eyes open
In Hollywood you aim to be
The ugly son of Los Angeles

Separated, aggravated
I want your ugly idol mannequin
Overrated, contaminated now
I want your ugly idol mannequin

Ugly idol mannequin

You beg for more when time is up
You pray for war to feel the love
You cut your lips in dreams of doubt
The queen to be in disco south

Separated, aggravated
I want your ugly idol mannequin
Overrated, contaminated now
I want your ugly idol mannequin

skit
I want your ugly idol mannequin
I want it, I need it

Separated, aggravated
I want your ugly idol mannequin
Overrated, contaminated now
I want your ugly idol mannequin

Ugly idol mannequin
God dammit I got cottonmouth
