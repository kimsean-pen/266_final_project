Black Vultures Circling Us

Black Vultures Circling Us
Black Vultures Circling Us

Feels like the end of the world
But it's only the beginning of it all
Forget the things that you learned
I been a survivor since I began to crawl

I've fallen down but I'm not out
The Devil's at my door

I don't give in
I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one standing
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces
Scavengers waitin' for me to die
But I'm not defeated

I'm on the edge of the war
I'm holding on and hanging by a thread
I am the eye of the storm
And you haven't seen the last of me just yet

I've fallen down but I'm not out
I'm coming back for more

I don't give in I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one standing
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces
Scavengers waitin' for me to die
But I'm not defeated

I am still alive
I'm still alive

I don't give in I don't give up
I won't ever let it break me
I'm on fire I'm a fighter
I'll forever be the last one...
Black vultures circling the sky
Pick at the pieces
Scavengers waitin' for me to die
But I'm not defeated

Black vultures circling the sky
You all waiting for me to die

Black vultures circling the
Black vultures circling the
Black vultures circling the
Black Vultures circling the sky
