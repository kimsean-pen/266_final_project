How do I walk this earth
So much work at first it goes
How should I walk this earth
So much worse the further, the further you go

Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told

you need it more than you thought
but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out
Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between the wrong and the right
You get yours I'm gonna get mine

Is that what you signed for
They're feeding you lines
To keep you on their side
It works every time
What you got to live for

Now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
And how much more
Can you pass yourself round?
What you got to live for
Now you got the whole of the world at your feet?
But you're still shaking
You need to make up some ground
Go take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
and keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know
Not all that you know though
The truth be told
you need it more than you thought
but you're managing
That's how you evened out, out
