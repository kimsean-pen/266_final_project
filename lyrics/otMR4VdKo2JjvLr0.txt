Does anyone in here get hit with inside fever?
So bad sometimes it's hard to move around.
They'll show you all the things you are not doing
Instead of helping you they'll block ya out
And you're whining you shouldn't waste your money
But the couch fibers kept you inside
Said I'm so sorry I came in late this evening
But all the clocks around the town had died
And all the fruit stores' colors were so bright
With couples smiling, cooking things tonight
And what were all those troubles on my mind?
Oh, I took a walk

(Cough!
Sniff...)
Well, uh, just what I need
Right, the morning light
The room *cough* we all have
No more any (?)
I just listen tonight
and all we know
Is all that I have
is ...?)

The room is filled with metal pots
All the pretty mismatched socks
Are you coming out tonight?
Pretend I am? Well, I just might.
The room is filled with ancient dates
Where I've been and what I ate
Before I'm asked to throw them out
I play up every little doubt
The room is filled with gummy bears
Electric shavers, ingrown hairs
I keep the curtains tied in knots
You sleep on cotton, rest in fluff
The room is filled with letter logs
Encyclopedias, books enough
To keep me busy in the morning
Sun sets fast without warning
The room is filled with cords and plugs
Electronic translucent bugs
And what's that crawling all around?
What's that twitching, is it still alive!?
Is it still alive!?
Is it still alive!?

I'm so sorry I came in late this evening

And what were all those troubles on my mind?
Yes, I took a walk
Oh, I like a walk
Oh, I like a walk
