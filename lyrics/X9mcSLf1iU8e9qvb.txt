dress the part it's storytelling time

sharpen your knives
watering mouths
clean your plates for some tender i

tell me how the story ends now

come home, come see our place
our labyrinth, you keep pace
we push the boundaries
so the rules are bent
so it's give and take

come wallow in my sorrow
breath your air into my lungs
what hides in my shadow
my worst fear is real life

tell me how the story ends now
