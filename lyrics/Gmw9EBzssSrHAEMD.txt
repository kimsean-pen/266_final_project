The mountains below we reached by our will
The flames of our swords are burning still

Temptated by the night to spread hate and fear
Were the revenge the blackest, Their souls is our prey

Storms of evil, thunder and might
Their moons in our eyes, a guiding sight

Were in the march of profanity
The darkest breed, again well rise
forth against the flocks of the weak
Well approach a land forlorn

Our hordes arrived / Oh hordes of white,
watch us take your lives
As false youll fall, falseness disappear

(The Land) where eyes are blind we have found
Battle sign under the shape of mine
Darkest souls now set free
We rose again, damnations reign

Watch me absorb your thoughts
See me ruin your halls of light
Weltering in your sadness for infinity

Were the march of profanity
Your tragedy, falmes will rise
forth against the flocks of the weak
No return, A land forlorn
