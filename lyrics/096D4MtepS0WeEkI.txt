Listen, seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansing my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm falling apart
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
Cause we're falling apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen, hard at building trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're falling apart
Leaving you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep falling apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passing up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
