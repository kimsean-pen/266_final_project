After that confrontation, you left me wringing my cold hands
We shared some information we might not recover from
And I watch your convictions melt like ice cubes in an ocean
You were so poorly cast as a malcontent

You've got them all on your side, that just makes more for doubt to slaughter
I never knew he thought that, I heard you say, falling out of the van
Don't ask for his opinion, they ought to drown him in holy water
Will you remember my reply when your high horse dies?

We'd like to go the distance but not a one of us is going
You see, nobody's wise enough to turn this ancient boat around
These are the muddy waters I'm swimming in to make a living
That I might drown in them should come as no surprise

You want them all on your side, that just makes more for doubt to slaughter
I never knew he thought that, I heard you say, falling out of the van
Don't ask for his opinion, they ought to drown him in holy water
Will you remember my reply when your high horse dies?

You've got them all on your side, that just makes more for doubt to slaughter
I never knew he thought that, I heard you say, falling out of the van
Don't ask for his opinion, they ought to drown him in holy water
Will you remember my reply, one finger parallel to the sky?
