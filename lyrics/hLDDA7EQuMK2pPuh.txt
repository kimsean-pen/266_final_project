Digable Planets in the house
Yo everybody's going retro right? word
And I was thinkin', if the sixties and seventies were now
Isaac Hayes would have his own 900 number
I know and MC Hammer wouldn't have been a pimp, right?
Uh huh, yo and Jimmi
Jimmi would have dug us, right?
Word, yeah

Get yours, float up to the stars
Planets is a spot bout six blocks east of Mars
Air sole kicks and crushed velvet hats
Hangin' off the ave with the beautifulest naps

Ride in the crest with the blessed give a yes
Planets kinda funky as if you hadn't guessed
Placebos gettin' blocked, funky joints get rocked
Jive is not found we fly from the flesh

Whether Jeep or 'Lac?
Peak it as you render and float to them raps
Butterfly's planets for the jam eight tracks
From the knotty tops with the twist and plaits
Look beneath my hat

Find the brains that hit ya, metro quite equip
Knows of all the funk that was laid in seven zips
Funk is fat, homey homey don't you know me
Cool is back, give some skin lay it on me

Groovy you could call it, hip yeah you could call we
Vicky sticky fingers stuck us loop junkies
If you diggin' rhyme then you diggin' rap
Jimmi's diggin' this and we be diggin' that, yeah

This song uh, is by some groovy cats
If you can dig the cats, can dig the song

Yo, the Black Panthers woulda had their own cartoon right?
I know and eight track Walkmans right?
True and Jackson 5 woulda had dreads
Word my man and Tito would look fly right?
Word and Jimmi woulda dug dig plans for real, word

Planets bustin' out of this L7 square
Check out the wears, check out their hairs
Sweet back chills we shaft on the ave
Jimmi's diggin' cat and that's just the half

Where'd they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard, really weird or is it
It's just the logic from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its

We, the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses by a dj and some felts
Long haired hippies, afro blacks
All get together, 'cross the tracks

Because when we shows up, rhythm rose up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life ain't what it seems, life is but a dream
Planets freakin' havoc is as constant as the rain, yeah

Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats

Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats
Jimmi's diggin' cats

This song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig the cats you can dig the song

Yeah, I can really dig the way the cats are
Gettin' down with the sound as it is today
The way they bringin it all togther, really cool
The brothers are doin' it right
And their payin' good respect to the masters
I can dig it exactly the way it should be, they out
