Everything you say, you say it with a smile
Everything you do, but does she cares for you
Everyone you meet, sees your big ol' heart
Everyone you love, but does she loves you back

You're so in love, you hope she wants
To come and find you

I know you want to be free
Just like that guy on the TV
I know you think it's all right
But it makes no sense to me

Every foolish game, every mid-life rage
Every ounce of pain, what else is there to blame?
I only wanted you, to open up your eyes
You know however cute, she's a monster in disguise

You're so in love, you hope she wants
To come and find you

I know you want to be free
Just like that guy on the TV
I know you think it's all right
But it makes no sense to me
