Gave you everything I had, still you wanted more yeah
Told you that I loved you but you know I wasn't sure
All these thotties on my phone are for whenever I get bored
You would ride me like a Harley even when I'm in a-
(Yeah) Gave you everything I had, still you wanted more yeah
Told you that I loved you but you know I wasn't sure
All these thotties on my phone are for whenever I get bored
You would ride me like a Harley even when I'm in a Ford
Break your heart into pieces
Don't know why you sleeping
When I'm wide awake, swear I'm swimming in the deep end
I don't wanna love you if it's only for the weekend
Baby I don't call you but you know it's for a reason
I thought I had it all, I was on the rise
Now you cut me off like I'm not alive
It's crazy how they only want me when I'm on the grind
These b*tches hit me up but I don't give em any time
You were my number one but now you gotta wait in line
Too many trying to get me but this money on my mind
I'm sending shivers down your way, feel it in your spine
Don't try to tell me that it's true when I know it's a lie
So here we go now
I be lone now
You better hold out
When we go down
I'm in my zone now
I'm feeling bold now
They steal my soul now
Till it all blows out
(Yeah) Gave you everything I had, still you wanted more yeah
Told you that I loved you but you know I wasn't sure
All these thotties on my phone are for whenever I get bored
You would ride me like a Harley even when I'm in a Ford
Break your heart into pieces
Don't know why you sleeping
When I'm wide awake, swear I'm swimming in the deep end
I don't wanna love you if it's only for the weekend
Baby I don't call you but you know it's for a reason
Smoking by myself, I'm a stoner
I be on my own like a loner
You say you're cold hearted, my wrist colder
She think she know me so I f*ck her like I know her
I'm under pressure but I brush it off my shoulder
She said she love me, I don't want you what I told her
These b*tches switch up like the weather, they're bipolar
You left me broken, all I wanted was some closure
I'mma play my cards right when I need to
Stay the f*ck up out my life, I don't need you
All these people say they real but they see through
I remember all the times it was me and you
Break your heart into pieces
Don't know why you sleeping
When I'm wide awake, swear I'm swimming in the deep end
I don't wanna love you if it's only for the weekend
Baby I don't call you but you know it's for a reason
