He said to me, he said to me
I was losing love
Wounded but I don't wanna stitch it up
He said to me, he said to me
I was losing love
Keep your bandaid, I wanna bleed it out
Wanna bleed it out, I wanna bleed it out
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Don't you know that
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Not a machine, not a machine
Not a machine, not a machine
He said to me, he said to me
Weakness is a flaw,
Flaws are beautiful like a flower you see
What am I to be?
What's love for me?
Won't trade my heart for metal
It's better to be breakable than rust
I wanna fall in love, I wanna fall in love
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Don't you know that
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Not a machine, not a machine
Not a machine, not a machine
Ouh hey, ouh hey
Ouh hey, ouh hey
Bleed love out, bleed love out
I want to be human, I want to be human
Bleed love out, bleed love out
I want to be human, I want to be human
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Don't you know that
I'm happy to be human, happy to be human
Not a machine, not a machine
Not a machine, not a machine
Ouh hey
