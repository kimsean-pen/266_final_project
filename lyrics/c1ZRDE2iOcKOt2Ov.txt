Play us a song we can slow down
We want to hold each other
Play us a groove so we hardly move
Just let our hearts beat together
Oh baby, 'cause it feels so good
When we're close like this
Whisper is my ear and let me steal a kiss

Come on and touch me
When we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
(Loving touch)
Oh, touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
(Feel you when I'm fallin' in love)

Tonight's the night and it feels so right
My heart is saying it to me
You're the one I've waited for so long
So let your love flow through me
Oh baby, 'cause it feels so good
(Feels so good)
Just to be this close
You've got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast

Come on and touch me
When we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
(Loving touch)
Oh, touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
(Feel you when I'm fallin' in love)

Touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
(Loving touch)
Oh, touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
(Feel you when I'm fallin' in love)
Touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that loving touch
(Loving touch)
Oh, touch me when we're dancing
I want to feel you when I'm fallin' in love
(Feel you when I'm fallin' in love)
