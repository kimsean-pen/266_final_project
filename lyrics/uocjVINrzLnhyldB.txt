Rip the heart from my chest
Right here i confess
My words, they are not on vein
Since the day that she left
He just hasn't be the same
Can she be worth the pain that just won't go

How did it end this way
There was no reason
So many things to say
When can he breath again
Watching the memory fade with broken wings

If it's worth the regret
Then my mind is set
The legacy ends in shame
Years of living in fear
Have won in this deadly game
To leave behind a name
To leave behind a name
That i can't say

How did it end this way
There was no reason
So many things to say
When can he breath again
Watching the memory fade with broken wings, let her bird fly away

Fly away
Abandon hope, abandon faith
Take in deep
One last glance of the ground
And tie the rope of sorrow
Take me home

How did it end this way
There was no reason
So many things to say
When can he breath again
Watching the memory fade with broken wings
Watching the memory
Watching the memory
Watching the memory fade with broken wings, let her bird fly away
