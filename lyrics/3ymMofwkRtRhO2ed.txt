This game of cruelty
hardly becomes me
this game of cruelty
is easily the most boring part of the week
Why can't you say to me
"I mean something to you"

'cause
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
do to me
(Oh)
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
do to me

You think I'm livin' it
livin' it, livin' it
livin' it up
in the spotlight
You think I'm livin' it
livin' it, livin' it
livin' it up
it's a lie, lie

Who's next in your journal of ardency
Private, yes
But I think it's me
So give me a sign
Give me a warning
Please don't lie
or take your time

'cause
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
do to me
(Oh)
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
Do to me

I don't care what you say
just care what you do
when the time's right

You think I'm livin' it
livin' it, livin' it
livin' it up
in the spotlight
You think I'm livin' it
livin' it, livin' it
livin' it up
it's a lie, lie

'cause
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
do to me
(Oh)
everybody knows
everybody sees
that this is the thing you do
do to me

I don't care what you say
just care what you do
when the time's right
