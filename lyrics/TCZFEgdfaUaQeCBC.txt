I wanna know if you care for me
If you feel my touch as heavenly
I wanna know if you feel this too
If you don't, I can't be in love with you

A million miles between you and I
I wanna know if you feel it too
If you don't, I can't be in love with you

I wanna know, when you look at me
Do the voice of angels start to sing?
I wanna know if you hear them too
If you don't, I can't be in love with you

A million nights I've loved this quiet
I need to know if you hear this too
If you don't, I can't be in love with you

A million times I keep on trying
I'm gonna know if you love me too
If you don't, I can't be in love with you
