Sitting in the back sitting in the cap in that old cap day
Making the list and run some'for tonight when I DJ
I watch the morning ring, day tunes in the window plane
So I pick up my bags I'm heading to the door
I make a run for it before the next sample
And I spill my coffee on some passing guy
And I apologize and he kinda smiles and

Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes
Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes

Had I been grown in a parallel world
In that all kept day
Sitting in the back sitting in the cap watch the morning rain
Daydreams in the window pane
And we never wanna go, we never wanna go
We never wanna leave
But I keep on heading straight towards the door
I make a run for it before the next rain
And I '. on some passing guy
And I apologize and I smile and

Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes
Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes

Na na na na na hey
Na na na na na hey
Na na na na na hey
Na na na na na hey
Lightning strikes, oh
I can fight, I can fight
And I know I can fight, I can fight

Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes
Lightning strikes hits me hard inside
All the lights my heart beats
From the rose and I know I can fight, I can fight
I can fight, lightning strikes
