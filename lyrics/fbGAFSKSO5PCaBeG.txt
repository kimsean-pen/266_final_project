[Inaudible]

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
All nine yards down her back

Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
All nine yards down her back

Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation

What is in my mind?
What is in my mind?

[Inaudible]

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
All nine yards down his back

Give me a couple
Don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Conversation fear, conversation fear, conversation fear
