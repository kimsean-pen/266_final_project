The lonesome Texas sun was setting low.
And in the rear-view mirror I watched it go.
I can still see the wind in her golden hair.
I close my eyes for a moment I'm still there.

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight.
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky.
Her memory fills my mind.
Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight.

Another town another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely way before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

For every heart you break you pay the price
But I can't forget the tears in her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
