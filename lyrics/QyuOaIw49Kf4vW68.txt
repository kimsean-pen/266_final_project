Bonefish

Bonefish

A Peacebone got found in the dinosaur wing
Well I've been jumpin' in all over, but my views are slowly shrinking
I was a jugular vein in a juggler's girl
I was supposedly leaking the most interesting colors

While half of my fingers
Are dipped in the sand
You progress in letters but you're used to cooking broccoli
The other side of takeout is mildew on rice

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the old times
Then we did believe in magic and we didn't die
It's not my words that you should follow it's your insides
You're just an inside
Adjust your insides
You're just an inside

Bonefish

I bet the monster was happy when we made him amazed
Cause he don't understand intentions he just looks at your face
I'll bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bath
All the birds are very curious all the fish are at the surface

With half of me waiting for myself to get calm
I'm like a pelican at red tide
I'm a corpse I'm not a fisherman
A blow out does not mean I will have a good night

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the old times
Then we did believe in magic and we didn't die
It's not my words that you should follow it's your insides
You're just an inside
Adjust your insides
You're just an inside

Bonefish

I start in a hose and I end in a yard
When I feel like I'm stealing I can keep myself from hearing God
Only the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the ground
It was the clouds that carved the mountains
It was the mountains that made the kids scream

Oh well she bore all her parts but she never was found.
You think I'll carve a path through New York
And be an artist but are you anything
Then you find out you can't ask a baby to cry

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the old times
Then we did believe in magic and we didn't die
It's not my words that you should follow it's your insides
You're just an inside
Adjust your insides
You're just an inside

Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone
Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone, Peacebone...
