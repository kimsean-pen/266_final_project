The eye burns bright
Laced with scars of deceit
Gazing into the void - the enemy
Betrayed
A dissident reality

Dig deep beneath your skin
Scratches of denial, of emptiness
Inherit unreason
Beg for fate
For we have wasted away

Lay low
The unseen lucid
In an age, fragile and expired
Emancipate

This collective conscious reeks of shadowed delusion
Existence is fear
A saviour from the surrogate utopia

So weep your blood sincere
Drowning in the deadest sky
Grasping the exhausted ashes of hope
Crowned in absolution
The eternal fallen
Suffocate

We are nil
