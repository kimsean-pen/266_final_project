I don't feel much
Afraid I don't feel anything at all
In the name of love
I keep close by
But I am no one
I'm stuck with this track
Even when the world has gone
Climbing one step at the time
Waiting for a reason to fall

Our love is like a long goodbye
We keep waiting for the train to cry
Because my baby don't understand me
He doesn't understand me anymore
Oh no, my baby don't understand me anymore
Oh, what do you do when that happens?
Where do you go when the only home that you know is with a stranger?

When our love was young
We could make the whole world crumble
Oh, but with one word
He could turn it all the way around

Our love is a long goodbye, our love is a long goodbye
Our love is a long goodbye, our love is a long goodbye
Our love is a long goodbye, our love is a long goodbye
Our love is a long goodbye
Waiting on the train, waiting on the train
