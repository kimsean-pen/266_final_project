Big bold women, round of applause.
Get-my-goals women, round of applause.
Know-my-roots women, round of applause.

Betcha, betcha, betcha
She gon' catch ya.
Big bold women gonna come and applaud.
Got-my-back women, I do applaud.
I'm an F E M A L E.
From the ghetto, bet she got a brain and Stilletos.
She work five to nine, still got time for the men, true.
There's another way and forget about the echos at the ghetto. Got the giggles, since
she never leave the ghetto,
Gotta tell 'em, "Get the memo"
Cause in time she gonna let go.
She a QUEEN.
And you know she never leave.
They be waitin' for a stumble but she never trip again.
(my god)
F E M A L E
Though she a QUEEN.
And you know she never leave.
They be waitin' for a stumble but she never trip again.
She got talent, class, brawn.
Askin' me if "Baby got back?" Got it from the motherland.
Mother Mary never met a mother tell me like that.
So far only made in Africa.
Cause the women in my village only carry five stars.
F E M (my god)
