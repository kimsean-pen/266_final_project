Every attempt that I've made to take my life
Has ended in failure
Have I been denied the right to die
I call out the being who dare keep me within this realm

Here upon a broken planet where only parasites seem to dwell
Born in blood have you seen a crueler fate than this
Men women children all slaves within this hell

I am bound to this earth
Fallen past beneath the dirt
Purveyor of pain
Powerless life in vein
Everyday remains the same
Such filthy creatures living in shame
I could not fathom a lesser form of life

How can this be I can feel everything
Born of the flesh
Will of a god
This life will not fucking end
What have I done

Every voice that cries out in panic I hear their pleas
An offering of lives laid out for the taking
Every soul upon this planet fuels my body from mass panic
Fear embodies my will to feed

I except my roll death has always been my destiny
Death has always been my destiny

I just want to fucking die
Death has always been my destiny

Every attempt that I've made to take my life
Has ended in failure
Have I been denied the right to die
I call out the being who dare keep me within this realm

Here upon a broken planet where only parasites seem to dwell
Born in blood have you seen a crueler fate than this
Men women children all slaves within this hell

Every voice that cries out in panic I hear their pleas
An offering of lives laid out for the taking
Every soul upon this planet fuels my body from mass panic
Fear embodies my will to feed

I except my roll death has always been my destiny
Death has always been my destiny
I just want to fucking die
Death has always been my destiny

I am bound to this earth
Fallen past beneath the dirt
Purveyor of pain
Powerless life in vein
Everyday remains the same
Such filthy creatures living in shame
I could not fathom a lesser form of life

How can this be I can feel everything
Born of the flesh
Will of a god this life will not fucking end
What have I done

I just want to fucking die
Death has always been my destiny
I just want to fucking die
