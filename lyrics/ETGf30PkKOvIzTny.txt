Inject it into the blood
Directly into the vein
Metal assault on the ear
Feeling it flow to the brain
It can get under the skin
The power metal syringe
It puts an end to all pain
Another headbanger singed

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing death

Scream at the top of your lungs
It's time to let yourself go
There is no lesson to learn
Get up, get into the show
The power to satisfy
Those who react to high speed
There is no secret to hide
Metal is all that you need

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing death

Inject it into the blood
Directly into the vein
Metal assault on the ear
Feeling it flow to the brain
It can get under the skin
The power metal syringe
It puts an end to all pain
Another headbanger singed

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing

Breathe the metal in the air
Feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take
A fix of power thrashing death
