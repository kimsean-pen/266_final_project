Ease your trouble, we'll pay them double
Not to look at you for a while
And you rely on what you get high on
And you last just as long as it serves you

Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it
Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it, yes we will carry you

'Cause you're deserted, what's good you hurt it
And kills you, it keeps you alive
So give it up in a world of puppets
It's a shame what they do to us all

Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it
Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it, yes we will carry you

Can we do anything for you now

Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it
Explode or implode, explode or implode
We will take care of it, yes we will carry you
