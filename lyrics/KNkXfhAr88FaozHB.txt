Been thinking little thoughts
Keep on walking trying to stand up
Pay attention to the details
We go slowly, slowly down

Been thinking little thoughts
Keep on walking trying to stand up
Pay attention to the details
We go slowly, down

I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me

I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back, back-back-back-backwards

This world ain't just m-m-m-made of facts
Every half hour is a countdown
If it's 'cause of my age then you're a coward
If it's 'cause of my age then you're a coward
If it's 'cause of my age then you're a coward
I haven't got the guts to stand alone

I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me

I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back, back-back-back-backwards

I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back if you ask me
I'll go back if you ask
I'll go back, back-back-back-backwards
