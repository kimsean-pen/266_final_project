This is not a riddle but it's meant to entertain.
I'll be your loyal Apostle,
Just send me in to take the blame.
Well what would you expect to say?
It never mattered anyway

There'll be a site (sight)
And an invisible light shown down on them and took them in
There'll be a time when, Maybe tonight temptations win And I give in.

This is not a puzzle or mainframe
But it's meant to strengthen your faith
And each time the night falls upon us
We always end up the same,
Well what would you expect to say?
It never mattered anyway

There'll be a site (sight)
and an invisible light shown down on them and took them in
There'll be a time when, Maybe tonight temptations win And I give in.

Were we not born into original sin?
What you ask for is what you get
and what you were given
So fold your hands and get down on your knees

There'll be a site (sight)
and an invisible light shown down on them and took them in
There'll be a time when, Maybe tonight temptations win And I give in.
