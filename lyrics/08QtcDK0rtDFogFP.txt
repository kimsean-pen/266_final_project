Soon, come soon
Sweet so sweet
Falling soft
Between the sheets

This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven
This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven

Please, you please
Mine, be mine
Forever
And all time

This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven
This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven

Sleep, to sleep
Sigh on sigh
On a lovers
Lullaby

This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven
This could be
Heaven right
Here on earth
This could be Heaven

This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be
Heaven
