Tonight were gonna share the same space
To see what will become of it
Forgive me if my mouth is dry
I'll blame it on my battle cry

The secrets in the snow
Will always come out in the thaw
All those terrible things
Can you entertain us all?

Tonight were gonna share the same space
Just if you invite me in
Forget it cause you should have tried
How are you unsatisfied?

The secrets in the snow
Will always come out in the thaw
All those terrible things
Can you entertain us all?

You could have taken it all
But you should have asked
I would give you my tongue
Or my dying breath
Please believe in me like I believe in you
It's the only thing to see us through
You could have taken it all
But you should have asked
I would give you my tongue
Or my dying breath
Please believe in me like I believe in you
It's the only thing to see us through

The only thing to see us through
The only thing to see us through
The only thing to see us through
The only thing to see us through
Tonight we have all shared the same space
Has anything become of it?
