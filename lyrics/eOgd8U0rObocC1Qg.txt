A dream like this not something you wish for
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for (dance for)

Hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, this is something you dance for

There's a moment when you look to decide
Who will fall, who will survive?
That's the moment when you find it inside
On the line, this is your time
And it's all I want and it's all I do

A dream like this not something you wish for
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

Can you believe it you feel alive?
Hit your mark, ready to rise
Your body's aching but your heart doesn't mind
Feel on the ground, eyes on the prize
And it's all I want and it's all I do

A dream like this not something you wish for (oohh)
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

A dream like this not something you wish for
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

For the love, for the fame, to bring down the rain
By the way that you feel when they're calling your name
For the days, nothing more, it's just you on the floor
Oh, this is something you dance for

A dream like this not something you wish for
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
Then this is something you dance for

A dream like this not something you wish for
A dream like this not something you ask for
When it's a gift worth taking a chance for
