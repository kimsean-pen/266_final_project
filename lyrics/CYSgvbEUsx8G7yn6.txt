All my spirits come through we when I bleed
A fractured skull in a desert well, I leave this disturbed, destroyed child will follow you
A wild and wounded beast I stand inside the sun
My heart let memories flood my mind
All the fixed, breathing strobes in the waking hours
The clouds are looming to remind me of the judgement passed on my soul
Acid stars have scarred my mind and left me as a ghost
I shattered my curse and spread it through the land
I wander guilded, willing, and unclean
Project dark eyes sullen, drawn out and wicked
Nameless lights pull me into a reflected psychic black hole
