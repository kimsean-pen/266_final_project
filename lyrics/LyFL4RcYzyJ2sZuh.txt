My ride broke down last night
So I'm nowhere now in House 113
Your mouth is bleeding out
From a razor blade in a tangerine
I feel you haunting me every other year on my birthday
If I had thought it out I would change this line
Find an in-between

Last night's ride never came
Could you meet me here in the 7th room
Nowhere forever now
Feel like the lilacs grow, feel the panic bloom
I feel you haunting me every other year on my birthday
It's like being trapped in a fog
You can be yourself but don't breathe the fumes
