I left most of my things on the floor
A wild heart, I don't remember.
A different place I don't want to go.
When I'm alone I howl loudly.
I can't promise that I let the right one in.
Am I invisible now?
I became the dust as it settled.
I saw the wolf in the storm.
A native son
A warm home
Am I alone?
Hello?
