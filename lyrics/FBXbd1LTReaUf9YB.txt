Go

Trust is dead like everything else you said
Each word more meaningless than the next
Your lips and your lies have severed the ties
I don't deserve this and you don't deserve me

I should've known but I doubted myself
Gave you every benefit of the doubt, I wanted no one else
But I guess I wasn't enough for you

Don't pretend like we can recover
When you chose the lust of another

Where did I go wrong?
I know I wasn't perfect but I certainly tried so hard
Was it a moment of weakness, or was it the thrill?
Did you ache for a feeling that you faked to feel?

Don't pretend like we can recover
When you chose the lust of another

I see your wandering eyes and second glances
I see through your lies, no second chances

Cut me free, you'll never be what I need
I hope you choke on the words I was lead to believe
Like a puppet on your strings
Control means everything

And in my heart I want to forgive you
That doesn't mean I'll forget
You'll always be my regret, oh

You'll always be my regret

Here's to a past I'll never need
No, "Here's to you, rest in peace"
