Never give up hope
You know give back to the people
You least expect it

Hard day, long road
Another time try to make it gold
So far from home
Can't remember here I left my soul
If I'm here and you're there
I got a picture of you everywhere
In my heart, in my mind
And it will be there 'til the end of time

Face down like a domino
In a place I will never know
Sometimes, yeah, you need to go
Yeah, you need to go
Where the rhythm runs up

Counting up the days and the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbeling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time, but I know they kept them waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

I live up in my dreams
Got a role, gonna play the scene
Your face on my screen
And I remember how it feels to be
Your mind, our lives I couldn't get better if I tried
I run, jump heights just to make it right by your side
Grey sky and I feel the cold
Another pin in another globe
Some times, yeah, you need to go
Yeah, you need to go
Where the river runs up

Counting up the days and the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbeling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time, but I know they kept them waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

Face down like a domino
In a place I will never know
Sometimes, yeah, you need to go
Yeah, you need to go
Where the rhythm runs up (Where the rhythm runs up)

Counting up the days and the ways I'm gonna make it happen
I feel the walls are tumbeling
I see the doors are opening
It's been a long time, but I know they kept them waiting for me
And the world will always spin
'Cause love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win

Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
Love will always, love will always
Love will always win
