Witchcraft, voodoo
Love experiments, and paint books
Potions, lotion
Perfume to find you
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby

Oh my heartache, but I know fate
Will send you my way
And when you came my heart was saved
I've known you for lifetime baby
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a deja vu
Deja vu
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to do
Deja vu, deja vu
Deja vu, deja vu

Moments in time
I'm yours and you're mine
Two souls, one heart
Two souls, one heart

The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
The man come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby

I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a deja vu
Deja vu
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to do
Deja vu, deja vu
Deja vu, deja vu

And all the love is fine
To one be kind
Baby
Ooh
And I'm loving all
Here we are, in entity
And all the love is fine
To one be kind
Baby
Ooh
And I'm loving all
Here we are, in entity

I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a deja vu
Deja vu
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to do
Deja vu, deja vu
Deja vu, deja vu
