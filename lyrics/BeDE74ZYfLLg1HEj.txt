Look down on the body that you have grown
Four mountains stand around you, they're not your own
And light squares and bodies are all you see
Since you broke down, since I broke down
Since we broke down

Oh, I jumped into your grave and died
And on my word you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn, bigger and stronger unless I lie

Cross your fingers, hold your toes
We're all going to die when the building blows
Cross your fingers, hold your toes
We're all going to die when the building blows

And the house that you were born in
Is crumbling at the corner
Sagging skin and feet of crows, feet of crows

Oh, I'll jump into your grave and die
And on my word you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn, bigger and stronger unless I lie

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
