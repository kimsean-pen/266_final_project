If only I'd have waited to say those words
Can't escape my thoughts of you
How long have I been on your mind?
Try to decide what's right

If only I'd have sensed I'd be set adrift
If only I'd found a way round it
Guide me away to safer shores
Take me away from it all

Take me away from it all
Take me away from it all
