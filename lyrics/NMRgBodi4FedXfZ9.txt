Oh this bag of bones, just wondering
Oh, nowhere to run, I guess we're just falling

And we're all just searching, not knowing where we're going
And it makes us nervous so we try to find a way out

We're still vagabonds
We're still vagabonds

Oh this careless ground, guessing this is home now
Oh in no man's land, at least we're still standing

And we're all just fighting, some of us will not return
And there's no redemption in trying to find your way out

We're still vagabonds
We're still vagabonds
We're still running from the simple life
We found a reason to hold on to this
We're still running from those little things
We can't help it cause we're still vagabonds
We're still vagabonds
We're still vagabonds
