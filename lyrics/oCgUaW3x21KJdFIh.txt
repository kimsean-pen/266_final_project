Growing up without a dime, it was so damn fun
Mom worked overtime and Dad was gone
And I know it's not easy
Now I know I'm not easy

Ride around the neighbourhood with my older friends
Go to sleep whenever I want and burn it down
Oh, I know I wasn't easy
Now I know I wasn't easy

I don't blame you for things we never did or bad things I've done
I don't blame you for things we never did or bad things I've done
She was lost, he was gone, it's alright
I could do whatever I wanted
He was lost, she was gone, it's alright
I could be whatever I wanted
Whenever I wanted, whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted

We never had the nicest things but we sure looked good
I can make anything feel so much better than it should
Oh, I know I wasn't easy
Now I know I wasn't easy

I don't blame you for things we never did or bad things I've done
I don't blame you for things we never did or bad things I've done
She was lost, he was gone, it was right
I could do whatever I wanted
He was lost, she was gone, it's alright
I could be whatever I wanted
Whenever I wanted, whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted
