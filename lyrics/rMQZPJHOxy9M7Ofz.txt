Maybe in this house I'm not the same
A set of walls to block out all the blame
I'm counting up the days without the shame
Hoping that you'll notice my new name

And you're not what I pictured
But you're doing it better than my imagination could and you've
Found your way into my nights
And the days seep by and there's nothing else I can think about

And I find myself losing my breath when I'm round you
I find myself losing my breath when I'm round you
You're talking but I can't hear a thing that you're saying
I'm just waiting to catch that glint in your eye

Maybe here with you i'm not the same
You make me laugh like i don't feel this pain
You're in my headphones dancing through my brain
Singing me the words i wish you'd say

And you're not what I pictured
But you're doing it better than my imagination could and you've
Found your way into my nights
And the days seep by and there's nothing else I can think about

I've got this space here now and it's all mine
I can pick and choose who comes in
And for once I think I'm feeling fine
It's you that I want to let in

And I find myself losing my breath when I'm round you
I find myself losing my breath when I'm round you
You're talking but I can't hear a thing that you're saying
I'm just waiting to catch that glint in your eye
