They call me a menace
They say that I'm cursed
But somethin' about me is makin' 'em jealous
So listen and learn
I herd 'em like cattle
'Cause I'm surrounded by cowards
And I don't give a fuck when I walk into battle
And that's why I got all the power
I'm where you wanna be
Ain't no one ahead of me
All of my enemies made a decision
It's better to follow me
I make no apologies
All of my sins I would repeat and I repeat
'Cause I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

I can smell your fear
The only reason that I'm here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I'll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I'll be back at it
'Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you'll die hard
Die hard

I dine with the blood on my hands
Thrive when I'm beatin' the man
All I learned in the pen
Is never get caught
Just get out and hit it again
Straight outta context
Ain't see me come like it's phone sex
Ain't hear me tick like a Rolex
'Cause I'm keepin' a nuclear conscience
I fly like an atom bomb
In a world riddled with conflict
Hate that you need me
Wanna destroy me but you can't
You're gonna deploy me in the end
Better believe that I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

I can smell your fear
The only reason that I'm here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I'll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I'll be back at it
'Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you'll die hard
Die hard

And if love is real
Maybe I'm just too bad
To remember how good it feels
My heart is still
My heart is

I can smell your fear
The only reason that I'm here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I'll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I'll be back at it
'Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you'll die hard
Die hard
