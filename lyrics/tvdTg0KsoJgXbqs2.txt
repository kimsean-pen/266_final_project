Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all i had.
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad.

Picture this everyday kids that just can't find a way.
Stuck in disarray can't find hope for better days.
It's the degeneration of childhood frustration.
In the last 30 years
Teenage suicide has increased 300% in North America
It is the second major cause of death in Canada.

Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all i had.
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad.

When will all my problems disappear.
Am I just going crazy from the fear.
Oh my oh my I'm going far past the brink.
This pressure's like a weight
And I still can't think straight.

Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all i had.
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad.

I've met my destinations
So what's left to complain about.
With all these aggravations
Building 'til the seams fall out.
I'm running my mouth dry
With every time I lie.
Don't tell me without a doubt
This dumbfound luck has all run out.
Don't tell me without a doubt
This dumbfound luck has all run out.
Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all i had.
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad.
