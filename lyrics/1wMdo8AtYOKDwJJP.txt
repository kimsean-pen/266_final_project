Witness of old
A wave to the sea
Open chest to the eyes
Eternal
Wounded stars
Fall as they must
To suffer unto wisdom
For the soul to trust
Trust

Unmask the spectre
Arise Rigpa arise
Silent in the shadow
Nature flows to it's source
Let this moment grace
Blood for the river to chase
Arise Rigpa
Unmask the spectre
Rigpa arise

Storming swells
A skiff in the sea
Tempered by witness
Eternal
The hammer
Falls as it must
Ringing unto wisdom
For the soul to trust
Trust

Razor tongues
Safe upon the shore
Blind to the deep
While the storm rages forth
Who can grasp
The undercurrent's roar
Safe in the shell
Safe upon the shore

Moon brings in the tide
Earthen mother enshrined
Blazing spiral maze
Nature inherent

Witness of old
Suffer unto wisdom
The hammer falls as it must
Ringing unto wisdom
For the soul to trust

Behold the dawn
Break through the seal
All we cherish
In fires revealed
Unearth our eyes
Never more real
In blessed silence
I see
