Inside I feel life, aah, aah
I rise into your light, aah, aah
I rise, leave the dream behind
I'm returning to life
Returning to life
(Ooh)
By the sound of your voice
And the love that you give
I see, I have found, aah, aah
How deep my roots have grown, aah, aah
I rise, leave the dream behind
I'm returning to life
Returning to life
(Ooh)
By the sound of your voice
And the love that you give
I'm returning to life
Returning to life
(Ooh)
By the sound of your voice
And the love that you need
Your arms open
I'm devoted
In sunshine and shadow
You love and protect me
I'm returning to life
Returning to life
(Ooh)
By the sound of your voice
And the love that you give
I'm returning to life
Returning to life
(Ooh)
By the sound of your voice
And the love that you need
I'm returning to life
I'm back in your arms
Mother, you give me hope
When I'm cold and alone
I'm returning to life
I'm back in your arms
Mother, you give me hope
When I'm cold and alone
