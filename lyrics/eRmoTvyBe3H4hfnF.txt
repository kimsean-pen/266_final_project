Don't wanna hang around anyone today
I'm sick of playing the same old games
Cause I know I can't win them anyway
And I will dream a different lie
Stuck in between her thighs and wonder just when I will meet her
All I really need is someone like Phoebe
Someone to excite my fantasy
And every night I'll dream that she is here with me
And i will be the only one for her
And I'm wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine
I've been in love since the day I saw fast times
It's on a permanent rewind and can you guess my favorite part
I used to like tossing off to her pool scene
Now I'm kissing TV screens
She's the only star who's touched my heart on
All i really need is someone like Phoebe
Someone to excite my fantasy and every night I'll dream that she is here with me
And i will be the only one for her
And I'm looking for a fast time

Watching out for bright lights
Send me off to private school
When I'm with you it's paradise
Looking for a fast time
Watching out for bright lights
Send me off to private school
When I'm with you it's paradise
When I'm with you it's paradise
When I'm with you it's paradise
When I'm with you it's paradise
All I really need is someone like Phoebe
Someone to excite my fantasy and every night I'll dream that she is here with me
And I will be the only one for her
And I'm wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
Wasting time going blind thinking she'll be mine tonight
