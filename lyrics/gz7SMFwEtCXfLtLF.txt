Always... always search for the light
Even in the darkest night
I will follow the drums and the bass
Cause it makes me feel alive

I call out your name
I felt a trance
I can feel deep inside
The heart beats in the sounds

Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire

Someday... someday I will be free
But I wonder, do you still think of me
Do you remember when our love was true
Do you remember when it was me and you

Oh I, yeah I... dream of you when I close my eyes
I, oh I... dream of you when I close my eyes

Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire
Did you know you left me on fire
