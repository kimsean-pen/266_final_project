So I'm nothing?
You took something from me, now you've disappeared
You're right where I want you
You said you wanted it, Alright

NO! It's not alright! (X3)

No . . .

Now I'm something?
And your head is in my closet
Dead forever
They'll never search he's . . .
Out of sight!

No! It's not alright! (X3)

No . . .

I'm cold, so cold,
My life, ohhh ...

I'm cold, so cold,
My life, I'd buy it, buy it, I ...
Ohhh...

NO! NO WAY! (X4)
