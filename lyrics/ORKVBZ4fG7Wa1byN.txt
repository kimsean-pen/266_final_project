So you think it's funny
That you been calling me all of the time, every day
Oh, honey, don't wanna be following, falling behind
If you're gonna be walking away

And I don't know
Why I wouldn't follow
Wouldn't follow

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin
You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in
Stopping the loving getting in

Now you say it's easy
That you've been falling for all of my charm
And getting lost in my smile
Never ceases to amaze me
When I'm chancing my heart
That I still do it with style

And now I hope
You'll be with me tomorrow
With me tomorrow

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin
You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in
Stopping the loving getting in
Oh yes, I'm stopping the loving getting in

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin
You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in.
