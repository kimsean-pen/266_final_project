False Conversation
Hidden agendum
You think we're stupid, how dare you

The rug has not been pulled
Over our eyes you fool
We can see right through

Tip-toeing villian
Eyes in the ceiling
Your false intentions have warn thin
But we've been in your room and in your closet too
We've got one on you
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to

Lies you wake up to
Lies from the altelollllll angel
A smilin boomer with snake eyes

Creates the latest trends
And i just can't pretend
Don't call me your friend
When all these
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to

Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to

Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed

LIES!
Lies will come back to haunt you
Bulletproof your limosine
Lies will come back to haunt you
Hit and run, a broken dream
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to

Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies
