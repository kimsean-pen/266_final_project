Sometimes I wanna quit this all & become an accountant now
But I'm no good at math & besides, the dollar is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold
I gotta feel the windchill again before I get old

I wanna scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town
& get new passports & get, get, get, get, get out now

All the yes-men said "No comment"
My mouth got going
The wrong way, & all the calls started snowing
The time my dad caught me a horseshoe crab
& I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back

I wanna scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town
& get new passports, get out now

Tell that boy I'll leave you alone, now
Like a stove I'll turn my love down
Supra & the prophet are both in the business of soles

I wanna scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me, woah
I wanna scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital I know we're gonna leave this town(we're gonna leave this town)
& get new passports & get, get, get, get, get out
Get, get, get, get, get out now
