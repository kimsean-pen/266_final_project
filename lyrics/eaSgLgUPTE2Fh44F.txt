I don't see why you try so hard to make it look that we're alright,
and that we're still friends.
I just don't see the point in it,
because it's quite obvious to both of us that we've passed that point now.
it's all long gone.
whenever, whenever I see that expression on your face.
I just, I just want to be on my own, at home.
it hurts, it hurts to see you hurt. (of course it hurts)
and I won't let you hurt anymore. (anymore)
it hurts, it hurts to see you hurt and it's all my fault.
but I won't, I won't hurt you anymore, anymore.
these years have changes us, but not for the better.
(these years have changes us, but not for the better)
you used to blush and keep quiet when I was there,
but now you just turn away and hide.
and I used to imitate, imitate
you, your movements and your words. (your words)
I used to look up to you, up to you
but now, now it's not the same. not the same...
it's dark now. I sit alone in the grass. I'm watching the stars.
(kyou wa choudo mottomo warukatta desu ne?)
I'm waiting for a certain star to fall,
so I can catch it before it hits the ground.
I'll wait right here
