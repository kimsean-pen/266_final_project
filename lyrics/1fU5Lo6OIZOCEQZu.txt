Oh oh oh oh

Boy you said
That you don't want anybody
Then went and found somebody
Oh oh
Bet you thought
I'd be all messed up about it
Losing myself about it
Oh oh

And I got of my bed

And I quickly discoverd
That I never needed you
Oh oh
And I picked up the phone
And I called all my friends
Told whem why don't
We make a move
Oh oh

If you think I cry

For you tonight
I'm out having my
Oh oh
And I look so hot
The boys forgot
That after it comes
Oh oh
Tonight
Tonight

Don't call me

Like you wanna talk about it
You had a chance to do it
Oh oh
Don't have your
Friends call my friends
Looking for some advice about it
You can forget about it
Oh oh

I was all by myself

And I quickly discoverd
That I never needed you
Oh oh
And I picked up the phone
And get me another you
I bet he'll know just what to do

If you think I cry

For you tonight
I'm out having my
Oh oh
And I look so hot
The boys forgot
That after it comes
Oh oh
Tonight
Tonight

Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I was all by myself
And I quickly discoverd
That I never needed you
Oh oh
And I picked up the phone
And get me another you
I bet he'll know just what to do

If you think I cry

For you tonight
I'm out having my
Oh oh
And I look so hot
The boys forgot
That after it comes
Oh oh
Tonight
