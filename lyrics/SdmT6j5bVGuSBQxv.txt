Feels so good to be with Alexandra
Born in grey, but still she tries her best
Brown hair to her waist, a porcelain face
And a manicured grace, I tried but she ran away
Could not keep her safe, Alexandra (Ooh)
Alexandra
Oh, Alexandra
Why did you leave me?
We used to glow like copper newly shined
Oh, Alexandra
You've got to tell me
Dear Alexandra, were you ever mine?
I miss the way she used to eat her breakfast
So careful with the way she held her spoon
Kept away from the sun, always chill to the bone
Only I'd keep her warm, I wonder now that's she's gone
Where did I go wrong, Alexandra (Alexandra, ooh)
Oh, Alexandra
Why did you leave me?
We used to glow like copper newly shined
Oh, Alexandra
You've got to tell me
Dear Alexandra, were you ever mine?
If you see her, let me know
If you see her, let me know
