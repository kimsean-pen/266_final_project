Looking all around, you think nothing is really working
The pieces never fit quiet, naturally
It didn't come with directions, but somehow we find perfection
And it all worked out just how it was meant to be

Through the passion, through the fights
The wrong turns we made right
The one thing, one thing never changed

And this too shall last
The beauties gon' let tackles [?] back to[?]
The feelings of all the troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last

Now the door is always open, never mention and never spoken
And only we know where we like to hide the keys
No wind could've weather, this holding us together
As long as we live in our home, yeah I believe

And this too shall last
The beauties gon' let tackles [?]
The feelings of all the troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last
This too shall last

Through the passion, through the fights
The wrong turns we made right
The one thing, one thing never changed

And this too shall last
The beauties gon' let tackles [?]
The feelings of all the troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last
