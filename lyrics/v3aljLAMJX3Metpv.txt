Never loved a girl, that hasn't walked away first
Made a few mistakes, lost friends along the way
But ill never shut the door
On someone who'll spend time with me
(with me)

I have never loved a woman more than I love my mom
She's the keeper of the garden in the silvery fog
If you see her in the flowers
Cause she's been through a lot

Keeping me alive

If I had a lot of friends I've done a lot with them
I don't think they forget
Somewhere in their head
Don't blame them in the end â€”
Cause I've got no regrets
Now I feel so free
Never get upset

I have never loved a woman more than I love my mom
She's the keeper of the garden
In the silvery fog, if you see her in the flowers
Cause she's been through a lot

I have never loved a woman more than I love my mom
She's the keeper of the garden, in the silvery fog
If you see her in the flowers
Cause she's been through a lot
