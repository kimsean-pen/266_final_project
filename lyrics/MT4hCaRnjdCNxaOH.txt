I, I went to hell
I might as well learn by my mistakes
I at twenty-four, was insecure, do whatever it takes

Come on and wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
It's time, smell the coffee, the coffee
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
This time, smell the coffee, the coffee

She's only got one reason to live, this is your life
She's only got one message to give, give it tonight
She's so gorgeous, I'll do anything
She's so gorgeous, I'll lose everything
Everything

Come on and wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
It's time, smell the coffee, the coffee
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
This time, smell the coffee, the coffee

She's only got one reason to live, this is your life
She's only got one message to give, give it tonight
She's so gorgeous, I'll do anything
She's so gorgeous, I'll lose everything
She's so gorgeous, I'll do anything
She's so gorgeous, I'll lose everything
Everything
