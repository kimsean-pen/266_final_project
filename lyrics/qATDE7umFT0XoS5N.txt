No-one's gonna save us,
Superman please save us,
Hollywood creators,
They're the ones who take us

Someone's trying to trade us,
We are all in danger,
We're made up in the paper,
Everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that no-one's gonna save us

Prince is gonna save ya,
Wu-Tang might just save ya,
Rock 'n' roll gon' save us,
The banks are gonna frame us,
And we must be courageous,
We are gonna save us,
Your mama gonna save us

How can they save you if they can't help themselves?
How can they save you if they can't help themselves?

Someone's trying to shame us,
Making it contagious,
The blueprints of salvation from idle corporations,
The empire's attraction is getting no reaction,
It's no satisfaction,
Oh

Something's gotta shake us,
War is gonna shape us (?),
Something's gotta shake us,
Now that this is us

How can they save you if they can't help themselves?
How can they save you if they can't help themselves?
