Waking with the rhythm and the chemicals in bloom
The bodies of the water and the phases of the moon
There are a so many ways for the day
To arrange and it breaks on you and me
And me, and me

So open up the windows, you can put your record on
Wrap your arms around me, wrap your mouth around a song
There are so many ways for the songs
That we make And I take the song with me
With me, with me

Everyone around this table are occupying
And I know that we're living, I know that we're dying
And every moment a new one is arriving

It's rolling over me just like a pen upon a page
A dog out in the grass it's like a light upon the stage
There a so many ways for you love to behave
For your hands to be laid, for the bed that we make,
For the chances we take, for a light to arrange,
For a light that we made, it's a life that we make you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me

Everyone around this table are occupying
And I know that we're living, I know that we're dying

Everyone around this table are occupying
And I know that we're living, I know that we're dying
And I know that we're living, I know that we're dying
And I know that we're living
