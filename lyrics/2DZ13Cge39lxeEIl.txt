I see the B-boys, Break it down girl,
I see you brushing them off of your shoulder,
I can feel it, Getting louder,
Can't keep our feet on the ground for much longer,
They wanna close, The lights come up,
But no way, So follow me,
And we can hit the runway
Break it down now,
Shake the ground now,
Wanna hear you scream loud with the countdown, (5)
With the countdown, (4)
With the countdown, (3, 2, 1)
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Out of sight,
Say goodbye and we disappear,
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere
The heat is rising, Getting louder,
All the ladies look like a damn poster,
Grab your girlfriend, Pull her closer,
Make her ride it, ride it, Roller coaster,
They can try to shut this down, But no way,
We're taking off, It's time to clear the runway
Break it down now,
Shake the ground now,
Wanna hear you scream loud with the countdown, (5)
With the countdown, (4)
With the countdown, (3, 2, 1)
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Out of sight,
Say goodbye and we disappear,
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere
I can make you fly cause,
Can't nobody stop us,
I can make you fly cause'
Come and join the mile high club
Break it down now,
Shake the ground now,
Wanna hear you scream loud with the countdown, (5)
With the countdown, (4)
With the countdown, (3, 2, 1)
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Out of sight,
Say goodbye and we disappear,
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Out of sight,
Say goodbye and we disappear,
Let's take off tonight,
Going in so hard that the world can't take us,
Can't take us, Can't take us,
Gone from the atmosphere.
