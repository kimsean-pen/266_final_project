Well look at the world my friends,
We used to live for the weekend.
We dont live twice, just let that sink in.

I said when we colour the good days.
The days we didnt need a stage.
Just to have a room thats full of it.

Oh I hope for the best
Im prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes,
You wouldnt know, You wouldnt know. How it felt.

Your always out for the highs.
And never for the lows.
Your always focused on my cons.
But never on my pros
(Never on my pros)
You gotta keep the dream alive,
or else it will die.
Im long for the simple days.
When things were less contrived.

Oh I hope for the best
Im prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes,
You wouldnt know, You wouldnt know. How it felt.

And I dont know how.
Yeah I dont know how.
Were gonna make it through this.
Were gonna make it through this.

Oh I dont know how.
Oh I dont know how.
Were gonna make it through this.
Were gonna make it through

Oh I hope for the best
Im prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes,
You wouldnt know, You wouldnt know. How it felt.

Oh you wouldnt know
Oh you wouldnt know

How it felt.
