When I tell you baby that I got a problem
You say, "Honey, hold on. I got it."
What you gotta say is you don't know anymore
Everybody's got 'em, it's a big bad world
But I, I want more
I wanna know what it's all for

'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me
Waiting to be realised
I keep my eye on that prize
If the best days that I know are just in the past
Am I gonna last forever?
I want more best days

I could've stayed in college but I didn't wanna
I dropped out and moved to California
Left Ojai for the next best thing
Got a pick-up truck
I want a diamond ring
Oh, oh

'Cause the best days of our life are coming for us
Waiting to be realised
And it's not a surprise
If the best days that we'll know are just in the past
Are we gonna last forever?
I want more best days

I want more best days
I want more best days
I want more best days
I want more best days
I want more best days
I want more best days
I want more best days

'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me
Waiting to be realised
I keep my eye on that prize
If the best days that I know are just in the past
Am I gonna last forever?
I want more best days

I'm gonna last forever
I, I, oh I, I, I
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me
