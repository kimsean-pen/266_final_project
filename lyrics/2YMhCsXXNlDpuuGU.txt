Crash land
still I can't find you
and just as things were looking up
we're stuck
don't panic
because I'm left without food
and just as things were heating up
I should have told you that you're good enough

I'm stuck here on this island
and I've lost her all over again
nothing gets better than memories
when all you have are memories for friends
I went searching when the lights went out
I went searching when my flight went down

Cos I made a rope
can I throw it out to you?
You drag me back home
I deserve to be rescued
but still I have trouble with
most days and nights
but still I have trouble with moving my life outside

Crash land
still I can't find you
and just as things were looking up
we're fucked
don't panic
because there's nothing here to fear
just don't lose imagination
or luck

Because I'm stuck here on this island
and I've lost her all over again
nothing gets better than memories
when all you have are memories for friends
I went searching when the lights went out
I went searching when my flight went down

Cos I made a rope
can I throw it out to you?
You drag me back home
I deserve to be rescued
but still I have trouble with
most days and nights
but still I have trouble with moving my life outside
