It's going alright
We'll soak it in
I mean, this sponge side
Is coated in
The warmth of your tides
They're breaking in
All across my coastline
It's what I'm waking in
To find that heaven

Has bled into my bed
And I'm drifting
Away

Victor walked to the High Street
Victor walked to the edge of the town
Victor came to the trash heaps
And here his tears came tumbling down

He cried; "Are you in heaven father?
I need you so
Have you melted yet lover, lover, lover?
For reasons unknown?"

You're sweet like no other
This haze is a worm hole
It radiates me undercover
I feel your burning soul

Has bled into my bed
And I'm drifting
Away

Neither of us remain
Neither of us remain

So let my waves take
What I adore

Swept away
And off the shore
Neither of us remain
On the floor
I know you want this
More and more

So let my waves take
What I adore
