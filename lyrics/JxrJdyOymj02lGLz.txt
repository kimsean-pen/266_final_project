Watched you drive away
You're back out on the road
Tried to make L.A. a second place for home
And I know we've got a thousand ways to go
And there's not much more I know I can control

Are you coming back for me?
Hope you're coming back for me

Now you've got the time;
remember who you are
Miles and miles from me,
I feel it though you're far
And I know we've got a thousand ways to be
But it still won't do until you come for me

Are you coming back for me?
Hope you're coming back for me
Coming back for me
Hope you're coming back for me

I always want you here
And I'm trying to find a reason,
but I only want to hear

Coming back for me
Hope you're coming back for me
Coming back for me
Hope you're coming back for me

For now, I know I'm on my own
Until the day you call me home
For now, I know I'm on my own
Until the day you call me home
