Haven't the word
and hands are tied
they're leaving you
the cheap confusion
pulls through
Enter the mirror
the grays appear
discard the reel
she's making me
seem unkind (unkind)

Listen too long
so play along
one seldom viewed
policing, I'm told "jut out"
Shooting the breeze
and see her now
confide in you
two images bound and cut (and cut)

Something angled in the dirt
You don't walk for an hour

First offense it has been shot
lost your footing
hopeless now
Covered metal on the wall
you can lend another skin
Twice now fixed on such a mess
subtle green and send it back
Precious ornament to crack
it's an overwhelming lie
