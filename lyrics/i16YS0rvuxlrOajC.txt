You hit me up
It's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Love me in then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that, I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the mornin' and I'm all alone
Tell me that you with it then you say you won't
Can you make your mind?
Oh please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah

I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest
Deep down I know that this should be
The last time I'm come over
You always lift me such a mess

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Love me in then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that, I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you with it then you say you won't
Can you make your mind?
Oh please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah

And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start letting go
Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep driving me crazy

When you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you with it then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you with it then you say you won't
Can you make your mind?
Oh please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah
Please, I'm losing my patience, yeah
