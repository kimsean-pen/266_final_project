I'm taking no advice tonight, I'm shooting on sight
I got no time for a belly full of lies
And I've been moving in the right direction without you
You find it easy to come at me like you do
You, you you you you you
You always find a way out
I, I I I I
It's time I had my moment now
We could always move in circles if we had to
It's time to cut that loose and move forward with what we do

I never saw an easy sign
To let me know the good times arrived
And I was always on your side
Now, now, now
And now and now

You're so predictable
Do what you always do
Go back to where you came from, from

Pain has a way of playing out in slow motion
If things get worse I hope I come to your mind first
This hate is spreading through my veins just like a wildfire
Can't put it out, I don't know how I'd even start

And now you know the truth it hurts
It's better than living in reverse
Oh we used to fall into each other
Like love and now it's died

You're so predictable
Do what you always do
Crawl back to where you came from, from

I'm taking no advice
I'm shooting on sight tonight
My aim is good, you know you would if you could aim that high

You're so predictable
Do what you always do
Crawl back to where you came from, from
Oh
You're so predictable
Do what you always do
Crawl back to where you came from, from
