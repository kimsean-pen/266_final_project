Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losing
With the path you're choosing
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

Know, know
Know, know
Know, know
Know, know
Someone that I used to know

Rides the high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves the crowd
The king of fools a heavy crown
He didn't know he almost drowned

Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losing
With the path you're choosing
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

Know, know
Know, know
Know, know
Know, know

It's been a long time coming
Couldn't keep on running
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losing

With the path you're choosing
And it's time to let go
Of someone that I used to
Someone that I used to

Know
Know
Know, ooh

Know, know
Know, know
Know, know
Know, know
