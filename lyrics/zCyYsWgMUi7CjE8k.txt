I bought my baby a red radio
He played it all a go-go a go-go
He liked to dance to it down in the streets
He said he loved me but he loved the beat
But when I switch on I rotate the dial
I could see it there driving him so wild
I bought my baby a red radio
He said he loved me but he had to go
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
On my radio on my radio on my radio
I bought my baby a red radio
He played it all a go-go a go-go
He liked to dance to it down in the streets
He said he loved me but he loved the beat
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
On my radio on my radio on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
On my radio on my radio on my radio on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
It just the same old show on my radio
I bought my baby a red radio
He played it all day go-go a go-go He liked to dance to it down in the streets He said he loved me but he loved the beat
