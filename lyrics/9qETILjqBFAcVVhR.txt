The rain is falling, it's after dark
The streets are swimming with the sharks
It's the right night for the wrong company
And there ain't nothing 'round here to look at
Move along, move along

The neon lights on Baltimore
Every shadow's getting famous
In some backyard, in some plastic chair
Hoping these cigarettes will save us
Here we go again, here we go again

You got rings in your ears
And you got kicked around and made up
Looking high, looking low

Where did all the shadow people go?
Where did all the shadow people go?
I wanna know where the shadow people go

I stole a bike from the second mile
Saw a band play in the basement
I crossed the path of a friend of mine
And I know what that look upon her face meant
Something's gone from her eye
Something's gone wrong

You could be a woman or you could be a man
Wear the glove on the other hand
Or you could be twisted or you could be insane
Pushing the envelope against the grain
Just playing along, just playing along

And I got something on my mind
And I got voices on the other line
Saying hi, saying hello

Where did all the shadow people go?
Where did all the shadow people go?
I wanna know where the shadow people go

Where did all the shadow people go?
(Where the shadow people go)
Where did all the shadow people go?

Where did all the shadow people go?
(Where the shadow people go)
Where did all the shadow people go?
Where the shadow people go
