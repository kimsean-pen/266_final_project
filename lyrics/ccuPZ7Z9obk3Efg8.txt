My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds
And he's makin' me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

C'mon, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teachin' me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds
And he's makin' me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Drugs, suck it up like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Woah, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Woah, woah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Oooh, aaah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Oooh, aaah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Oooh, yeah
