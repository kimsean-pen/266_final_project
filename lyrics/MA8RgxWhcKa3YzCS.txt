Oh I am growing tired of allowing you to steal
Everything I have, you're making me feel
Like I was born to service you
But I am growing by the hour

You left us far behind so we all discard our souls
And blaze through your skies so afraid to die
'Cause I was born to destroy you
And I am growing by the hour

And I'm getting strong in every way
You led me on, you led me on, you
And I'm getting strong in every way
