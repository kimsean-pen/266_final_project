When my baby and I get together
Oh, we don't have a lot of time
So I love him too hard cause I get stressed out
You know, we don't have a lot of time

People say it must be so hard
To be apart from the one you love
But they don't know what it's like for me
Nobody knows what it's like

He's on my mind
He's on my mind
He's on my mind
All of the time
All of the time

When my baby and I get together
Oh, I love him like it's the last time
And I say all the things you're not supposed to say
But I can't help myself
I Just want him to know

People say it must be so hard
To be apart from the one you love
But they don't know what it's like for me
Nobody knows what it's like

He's on my mind
He's on my mind
He's on my mind
All of the time
All of the time

Come on, babe
Come on, babe
Come on, babe
Come on, babe
