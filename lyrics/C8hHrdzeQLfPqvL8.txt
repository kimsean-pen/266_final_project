It's just a telephone
We're dancing on our own
Red lipstick, pleased to meet ya
Yeah, give me tequila

Their life inflicted me
Still, I'm before the beat
So what you waiting for?
You gotta give me

I want your midnight, honey
I'll take it for free

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight honey
I'll take it for free

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

They kill my rock and roll
Transist the radio
Clock ticks for you, the dreamer
Yeah, give me tequila

I took what I could stash
Two beats before the crash
So what you waiting for?
You gotta give me

I want your midnight, honey
I'll take it for free

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight honey
I'll take it for free

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

On and on and on and on and on
It keeps me going
On and on and on and on and on
It keeps me going
On and on and on and on and on
It keeps me going
On and on and on and on
And only for me

The tears they roll
They roll down, down, down
We do what we know
What goes around comes around

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight honey
Only for me

I want your midnight, honey
I'll take it for free
I want your midnight honey
Only for me
I want your midnight honey
I'll take it for free
I want your midnight honey
Only for me
