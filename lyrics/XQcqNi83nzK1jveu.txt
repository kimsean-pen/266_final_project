Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby oh.

Be there seconds flat,
Just tell me where you at,
Everywhere you wanna go,
I will gladly follow.

That mean's he don't need to know,
No one will ever know,
No one will have to know.

Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby oh.

Give me a second chance,
Just let go of the past,
Weaving through the high and low,
See the ebb and flow.

That mean's he don't need to know,
No one will ever know,
No one will have to know.

Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby I love you,
Baby oh,
Baby oh.
