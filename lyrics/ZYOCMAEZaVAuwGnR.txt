We laugh until we cry, to ourselves we lie
Dance in the moonlight, are you satisfied?
We wake up to the sun burning while we're young
Set fire to our lungs 'til what's left is none
We're the wild ones
Curious fools trapped in the flume
We're the wild ones
Raised by the wolves, we howl to the moon
Wooooooooooooo
Wooooooooooooo

War inside my mind, drowning in the tides
Fighting for my life, are you satisfied?
Intoxicate my veins, make me misbehave
Be my great escape 'til we fade away

We're the wild ones
Curious fools trapped in the flume
We're the wild ones
Raised by the wolves, we howl to the moon
Wooooooooooo
Wooooooooooo

We're the wild ones
Curious fools trapped in the flume
We're the wild ones
Raised by the wolves, we howl to the moon
Wooooooooooooo
