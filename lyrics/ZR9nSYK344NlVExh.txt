And do you feel like talkin', I'm an open book
And if you feel like walkin', I guess we drunk enough
Tonight ]to sink a ship
Our lips too dry to kiss
And clingin' onto silhouettes of you, of you

But it's me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, me

And it's me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, me

And do you feel like talkin', from across the room
In the English language, you know I can't find you
Tonight the truth will slip
This drink's too strong to sip
I'm holdin' onto memories of you, of you

But it's me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, me

And it's me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
Me, it's just me

Have I been sad
Like I thought I would
And have I been bad
Or have I been good?

In Hollywood
In Hollywood

And it's me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
Just me, myself and Hollywood

Me, myself and Hollywood
Me, myself and Hollywood
