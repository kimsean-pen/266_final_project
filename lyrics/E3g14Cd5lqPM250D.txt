Hey, gimme hollow stimulation,
It's so sleazy to be free.
Let's invest in dull creation,
Thrill city, cheap legacy.

What a waste, you're so chaste.
I can't wait to taste your face.

Vapid signals lead me to you,
A sublime spectacular dud.
Safe and sound from chatter confusion.
Get the picture, yes, it's clear as mud.

What a waste, you're so chaste.
I can't wait to taste your face.

I wouldn't lead you on ever since your song, yeah.
You could have had it all, but you didn't call me.
