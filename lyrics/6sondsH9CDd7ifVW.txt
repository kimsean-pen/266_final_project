I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

Our love is dead
But the dead don't go away
They made us what we are
They're with us every day
Our love is dead
But the dead are still alive
In memory and thought
And the context they provide

I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

Our love is dead (Our love is dead)
But the dead are here to stay (Don't go away)
They made us what we are (That's what we are)
They're with us everyday (Oh everyday)
In darkest night (In darkest night)
The memory keeps up strong (It keeps us strong)
And if our love is dead (Our love is dead)
It won't be dead for long (No not for long)

I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
(Believe in love)

(Don't go away)
I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
(Believe in love)
I know enough's enough and you're leavin'
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
(Believe in love)
