Put your hands on me
And tell me
That you could be in love enough

Put your hands on me
And tell me
You think you've got the guts
To jump
Into the unknown with or without me

I just gotta know
If this is real
Enough
To touch

Of is this just fool's gold
Fool's gold,
Is this just fool's gold or something I can hold

Put my hands on you
And tell you
The things I'm thinking of
Are dark
Put my hands on you
And tell you
I think you gotta trust
My heart

I just gotta know
If this is real
Enough
To touch

Of is this just fool's gold
Fool's gold,
Is this just fool's gold or something I can hold

Maybe I'm lost
Maybe I'm wrong
But baby I saw us burning all night long

I just gotta know
If this is real
Enough
To touch

Of is this just fool's gold
Fool's gold,
Is this just fool's gold or something I can hold

Put your hands on me
And tell me
