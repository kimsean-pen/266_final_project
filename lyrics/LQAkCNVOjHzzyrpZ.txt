You take my hand when I caught money
You kiss it better you heal me
And even now when it gets too much
You're by my side you pick me up
I'm rich in second hand clothes
They keep me safe when the world is cold
It don't matter they have worn them before
And I don't want for anything more
(For anything more, for anything more)
(For anything more, for anything more)

When we were nothing we had it all
In your arms of love you kept me warm (warm)
Warm, warm
You kept me warm (warm)
You kept me warm

I think you're something that I wanna be
With your arms of love wrapped around me
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause you gave me everything that you never had

We laugh we cry we get by
And we gotta be strong
We always gotta stay strong (stay strong)
We laugh we cry we get by
And we gotta be strong
We always gotta stay strong

When we were nothing we had it all
We had it all

We had it all
When we were nothing we had it all

When we were nothing (when we were nothing)
We had it all

All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
All, nothing
When we were nothing (when we were nothing)
We had it all (we had it all)
When we were nothing (when we were nothing)
We had it all (we had it all)
We had it all
