All of the time that I'd been wrong
Ooh, I watched it slip right through my hands
Again and again, I did things wrong
Ooh, I watched it slip right through my hands

I don't wanna mess this up
You got your hooks in me
Ooh, you've got a hold on me
I don't wanna mess this up
You got your hooks in me
Ooh, you got a hold on me

And we were on our own
I know it sounds absurd
When we joked about the people
That would threaten our world
Yeah we were so sure of ourselves
Oh, again and again I gave too much
Again and again

I don't wanna mess this up
You got your hooks in me
Ooh, you've got a hold on me
I don't wanna mess this up
You got your hooks in me
Ooh, you've got a hold on me
