With ticking womb of wedlock soaking blood
through a dogwood lung
the unhinged cull of oxygen
how have I been stuck here for so long?
drained out a tunnel in an albatross
now I'm haunted by the bird
her hounds left tracks on my breath until I had no more air left selling out an old soul for sales
I am caught up in the guilt
making a living off of drowning leaves me one step in the wrong
have I been stuck here for so long?
with broken works on love loss
collecting earth from ground alone
on my soft slide into torch songs
how have I been stuck here for so long?
the winding love of life lost
no longer haunted by the thought that every mark I make on emeralds are now
one step in the wrong
I'm alright, it's time I moved on
