Back to the frontlines
Back to the night
Medieval marauders
Under the lights

Back for the plunder
The thrill of the flames
The roar of the thunder
Back in the game

Storming the castles
Swords in the air
Killing the monsters
In their own lair

Lighting the torches
Setting the stage
You get what you ask for
Right in the face

Six string sabres
Screams in the night
War clubs pounding
Living just for the fight

So we drive through the night
With the howling wind at our backs
Riding on Teutonic Terror
We will... Give em' the Axe
We will... Give em' the Axe

String up the razors
Sharpen the blades
Tighten the skins up
No one escapes

Crank up the grindstone
Load up the sleds
Saddle the horses
Off with their Heads!

Six string sabres
Screams in the night
War clubs pounding
Living just for the fight

So we drive through the night
With the howling wind at our backs
Riding on Teutonic Terror
We will... Give em' the Axe

For the roar of the crowd
For the raging frontal attack
Delivering the Teutonic Terror
We will... Give 'em the Axe
We will... Give' em the Axe

So we drive through the night
With the howling wind at our backs
Riding on Teutonic Terror
We will... Give em' the Axe

For the roar of the crowd
For the raging frontal attack
Delivering the Teutonic Terror
We will... Give em' the Axe
We will... Give em the Axe.
