She's a loaded gun
In my shaking hand
Am I in hell
Or the promise land?
Yeah

(What's your name?)
So I'll tell you my name when I'm on your skin
(You can be)
You can be the queen and I'll be the king
(I'll get born)
I was born to echo but I'll never repeat
Not for anyone
Anyone

She said
(Show me yours)
I'll show you what I got yeah
(I'll show you mine)
When you tell me what you need!
(Show me yours)
So put your money where your mouth is
(I'll show you mine)
Wooooww!

And the beat goes on
She'll know that nothing is wrong
She goes down
Like a setting sun

(What's your name?)
If I tell you my name you got to let me in
(You can be)
You can be the sinner and I'll be the sin
(I will take)
I take what I want and it's easy to see
I got everything
Everything

She said
(Show me yours)
I'll show you what I got yeah
(I'll show you mine)
When you tell me what you need
(Show me yours)
So put your money where your mouth is
(I'll show you mine)
Woooooww!
