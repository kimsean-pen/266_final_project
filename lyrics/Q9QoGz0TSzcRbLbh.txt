I never saw it as the start it's more a change of heart
Rapping on the windows, whistling down the chimney pots
Blowing off the dust in the room where I forgot
I laid my plans in solid rock

Stepping through the door like a troubadour whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside feeling it's a holiday

You and I should ride the coast
And wind up in our favorite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like
Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

He sipped another rum and coke and told a dirty joke
Walking like groucho sucking on a number ten
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in
I miss the crush and I'm home again

Stepping through the door with the night in store whiling just an hour away
Steeping to the sky and the star-bright feeling it's a brighter day

You and I should ride the coast
And wind up in our favorite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like
Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

You and I should ride the tracks
And find ourselves just wading through tomorrow
And you and I when we're coming down
We're only getting back you know I feel the sorrow

When you find that things are getting wild
Don't you want days like these?
When you find that things are getting wild
Don't you need days like these?
When you find that things are getting wild
Don't you want days like, like these?
