When the sun is in the mid sky, were he wears a golden crown
And he soaks the world with sunshine as he makes another round
It's been a faster yeard than yesterday, all things that I had planned
And when I think I might be gaining, I'm in the sunshine once again

Well I walk the road of life among the strong, among the weak
And I ask them for the shortcut to the answers that I seek
But no one seems to understands what is and what will be
Oh, the questions of my childhood, weave a web of mystery
Just a web of mystery

Can you get me through these changes?
Well, I sure don't know about life, but one thing for sure
All I need is you babe
We got to get the golden key to unlock the door

I don't wanna to face a world of disillusion
I've come to one conclusion that I know you know is true
In the game of silent searching the cost of love is rising
And I'm just now realizing I'd be better off with you
Better off with you

It's a game that I've been living, now I need to know what's real
Can you help me find the answers, can you tell the way I feel?
Will you stay with me forever, just stay with me tonight
And we can talk about tomorrow if it all works out alright
Yes, if it all works out alright

Can you get me through these changes?
Well, I sure don't know about life, but one thing for sure
All I need is you babe
We got to get the golden key to unlock the door
