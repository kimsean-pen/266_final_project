I get a high whenever you're around
Sweeping from my head to my toes
I gotta get my feet back on the ground

'Cause you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line, making me say what I have in mind

And you make me so excited and I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush
Ain't nothing better, baby, is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush

I got a sweet tooth and a taste for you
And I might be too obvious
But I can't help myself from what I do

'Cause you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line, making me say what I have in mind

You make me so excited and I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush
Ain't nothing better, baby, is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush

Baby you're my sugar rush, I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my sugar rush, I get weak and talk too much

'Cause you make me go out of my way
Crossing the line, making me say what I have in mind

You make me so excited and I don't wanna fight it
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush
Ain't nothing better, baby, is it for real or maybe?
I start to blush, you are my sugar rush

Baby you're my sugar rush, I get weak and talk too much
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Baby you're my sugar rush, I get weak and talk too much
You are my sugar rush
