I was in a dark, dark place, yeah
I fought between my needs and my memories
It's kinda hard to be good, good, good enough for you
But it's even harder to be good enough for me, yeah.

Or maybe it's cheaper 'cause my ego
Has been eating up my logic since the day I was born, yeah
But this shit's been fucking with my work flow
Had me feeling negative about the one I adore.
So we've come a long way since long train rides
And I'll gladly take a slice of humble pie
Beuaty's in the eye of the beholder of a [?]
Won't you dream it?

You say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
Say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
You say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
Say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?

Quick thought before some time for reflection
I must have never led these lines in myself
But I must admit that I love the attention
If a woman wants a [?] that's a choice
And a choice I will respect.

Or maybe it's because my ego
Has been eating up my logic since the day I was born
But this shot's been fucking with my work flow
Had me feeling negative about the one I adore, yeah.
So we've come along way since long train rides
And I'll gladly take a slice of humble pie
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder of a [?]
Won't you dream it?

You say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
Say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
You say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
Say what's right, do what's right
But do you really feel it?
