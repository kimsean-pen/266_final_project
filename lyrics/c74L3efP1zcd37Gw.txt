Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, won't you help me?
You and I purify
You and I purify
Purify

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash, ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes, diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, oh, won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, oh, won't you help me?
You and I, purify
You and I, purify
Purify

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything
I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I, I ain't dancing with what might have been, no

Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, oh, won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Purify, can't you help me?
Purify, why won't you help me?
You and I, purify
You and I, purify
C'mon, purify
