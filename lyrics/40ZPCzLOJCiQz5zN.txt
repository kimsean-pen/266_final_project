Yeah
Uh
New Blaque
Darckchild, Darkchizzle
The jump off

Is it true that I'm the one making you nervous?
Trying real hard as if I'm for sure press
By you and your crew, that's helpless
You saw that X5, that's me outside
I know you, kinda seem so confused
You can't understand how my diamonds sing blue
But its cool its true, its unusual
A girl so fly out shining a guy

We can talk about this, lets talk about it
We can talk about this, don't think about it
About me on the floor, that's what I came here for
So pump ya breaks it seem as if ya wantin' more

It ain't me, I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me; I just came out to have fun
It ain't me, go out and find another one
I don't like what your kickin' son, now leave

Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me cause, I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me than, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing cause, I'm good
With or without you

(Chorus:)
I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good

Playas please, please stop frontin' and do you
I didn't know Benz started making Isuzu's
But its new, cause I do what I do
Which causes me not to be needin' you
When I leave, I got a crib to go to
That I got myself straight out of high school
So if you comin' at me, be ready
Cause there ain't no way I'm gonna let somebody play me

We can talk about this, lets talk about it
We can talk about this, don't think about it
About me on the floor, that's what I came here for
So pump ya breaks it seem as if ya wantin' more

It ain't me, I'm sorry you got the wrong one
It ain't me; I just came out to have fun
It ain't me, go out and find another one
I don't like what your kickin' son, now leave

Cause even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me cause, I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me than, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing cause, I'm good
With or without you

I'm good I'm good without you (said I'm so good)
I'm good I'm good (whoooaa)
I'm good I'm good without you (said I'm so god)
I'm good I'm good (whoooaa)

(Rap)
Yo, I'm only Clyde if you clip me
And I still got ice even if you ain't wit me
Candy paint and I still bump Biggie
Halter, throwback, ripped up dickies
Ya hate me cause I I'm nice up on the mic
I'm twice the size of rice
My flow keepin em' right
Brain dead you need cents like 50
Cause you won't truly love me like Bobby and Whitney
No

And even if I leave alone, I'm good
And even if you come along, I'm good
Don't mean a thing to me cause, I'm good
With or without you
If you wanna play games with me then, I'm good
Say what you do for me than, I'm good
You don't really mean a thing cause, I'm good
With or without you

I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good without you
I'm good I'm good

I'm good!
