She rests her head close to mine
I feel her in me all the time
It's been a while since I've seen her around
We weren't at our best when she left town
I've seen the red of the sun
It's dull compared to what I've done

And you're haunting me from space
As I crush my car again

I, I get lost in you
A safe place to come
Cause you, you were the only one
To help to see me through

Faces can tell you've been used
I've seen how much there is to lose
Love seems to shine falls down
All the new tattoos have gone wrong

And you're haunting me from space

I, I get lost in you
A safe place to come
And you, you were the only one
To help to see me through

It's hard not to miss what you destroy
All that weakness knows no joy
Will I ever see her again
Once I was inside her

I, I get lost in you
A safe place to come
And you, you were the only one
To help to see me through

I, I get lost in you
And I try, try, try not to fade
