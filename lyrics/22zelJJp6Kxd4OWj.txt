Loose rain
Let us rest
Where words speak
Nor confess
Always beside, always besides
For one another winding west
We seek and grow apart
Blood disappears where deeds begin
You never stop nor start
Turn out the silent glare turn down the silent stare
400 winters never count
Sleep never rusts
A fine sign of things to come
You cannot lay your hand upon
It's only ever more
