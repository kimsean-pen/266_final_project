You're the perfect
Your honesty compares to mine
Baby you are the only boy
Who's shown me another world

I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love

Now that we both can fly
Travel at the speed of light, alright
Let's make love, won't you pretend
I'll be asleep tonight

I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love

Long as I can tell
You've known me so well
But baby please
Never let me down
Oh no no baby yeah

I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
I get high on your love
I get high yeah on your love
