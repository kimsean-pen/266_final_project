does what i'm wearing seem to shock you?
well, that's okay
'cause what I'm thinking about you
is not okay
i've got it on my mind to change my ways

but I don't think i can be anything other than me
no i don't think i can be anything other than me
do you have a light?
can you make me feel alright?
there's plenty of white to go around

do you think it's right, when you hit me to the ground well,
light me up when i'm down
light me up when i'm down
does what I'm saying seem to haunt you?
well, that's okay

'cause what I'm saying about you
is not okay
i've got it on my mind to change my ways
but i don't think i can be anything other than me

No, i don't think i can be anything other than me
do you have a light?
can you make me feel alright?

there's plenty of white to go around
do you think it's right when you hit me to the ground well,
light me up when i'm down
just light me up when i'm down
just light me up when i'm down

light me up when i'm down
does what I'm taking seem to bother you?
well, that's okay
'cause I can take it all without you

and i'm okay
i've got it on my mind to change my ways
but I don't think i can be anything other than me
no i don't think i can be anything other than me
do you have a light?
can you make me feel alright?
there's plenty of white to go around
do you think it's right when you hit me to the ground well,
light me up when i'm down
just light me up when i'm down
light me up when i'm down
light me up when i'm down
