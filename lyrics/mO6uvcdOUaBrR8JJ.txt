I'm in love with the end of my rope
Ripping apart what I'll never sow
I'm alive somewhere deep in my soul
But it's a light that refuses to glow

Stay in the boat, stay in the boat
And keep your voices down
Stay in the boat, stay in the boat
Stay in the boat, keep your voices down

Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives

We're all alone in the end of it all
Screaming out for the pain to stop
Forgive me, forget me
I swear I'm not worth your time

Keep your eyes peeled, keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world
Keep your eyes peeled, keep your ears peeled
For the end of the world

Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives
Our words will outlast our minds
Our scars will outlast our lives

Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire
Set my tongue on fire

Set me on fire
