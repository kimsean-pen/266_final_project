We're a small crowd left to rotten, there's not many hard souls left
As the pop is growing stronger, will metal fade away?

Will we be broken, will we go down?

No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long

As I'm tweaking with my radio, there's disco everywhere
When I turn on my big TV, is hip hop what I want to see?

Have we been broken, did we go down?

No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long

Master

No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we are the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
