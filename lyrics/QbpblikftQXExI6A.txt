Flattered that you
Think I warrant ugliness
Gutters drain west
Mud made a mess of us
It's time to leave this place

I'd saw through your wrist
To find a better trap that fits
I'd saw through your traps
To find a better you
A part of you that lasts

I saw through your trap
And into my own wrists
Saw we were through
Red ribbons spill to blue
A sight to sore your eyes

I got this dress
I'm hiking it around
This waste of laughter
Slow dance alone
With no one
To the sound of four hands clapping

Congratulations to you both
I hope somewhere you're happy
If there's a moral to this story
Then I wish you'd show me

Hair in the blood
Fly in the disappointment
Rubber, I'm glue
I'll write the book on you
It's sticking to my face

You need a little less
Than what you take for granted
This is the sip that's drinking
Back from you
Blacking out your eyes

You need a little more
Suppression of your appetites
This is your honeymoon
In separate rooms
It's neither sweet nor bright

I made a word to give
This state a name
This game a guess
I call it "sluttering"
It means as little
As your little test

You are your worst revenge
Your very means
They have no ends
This is a story
You won't tell the kids
We'll never have

If you hear this song
A hundred times
Still won't be enough
