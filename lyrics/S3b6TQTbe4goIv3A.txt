I wait, for you, in dusky avenues
My skin, soaked through, the tree you nailed me to
You wanted my heart, for its little worth
I was half your age, and thought we were in love
Then I found your car, it was already burnt
Your eyes stung like stained-glass windows
but you had my soul

Standing in the cold
Trying to get back home
Frozen to the bone of wanting to know
Of wanting to know

We write, all night, make out in hotel light
Your touch, and your kiss, parrots every note of this
You wanted my heart, for its little worth
I was half your age, and I thought we were in love
Then I found your car, it was already burnt
Your eyes stung like stained-glass windows,
But you had my soul

Standing in the cold
Trying to get back home
Frozen to the bone of wanting to know

(Guitar solo)

I wait, for you, in dusky avenues
My skin, soaked through, the tree you nailed me to
You wanted my heart, for its little worth
I was half your age, and I thought we were in love
Then I found your car, it was already burnt
It was covered in rust
Someone got there first

I was running away,
Cos I thought we were in love.

Then I saw your eyes
But they said it all
Standing in the cold
Trying to get back home
Frozen to the bone, of wanting to know,
Why I'm screaming in the dark, and my boyfriend won't
call,
Standing in the cold, I wanted to know, I wanted to know
