Yes, I can run
Yes, I can run run run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can

My feet need a holiday
From this never ending race
Like MI6 or CIA
If I hide, you'll always find me
The best Addidas I could buy
Or Converse, Gucci and Nike
Made me fast but you caught up
'Cause nothing can separate me from your love
Chasing shadows, chasing time
Crossing boarders, crossing lines
Jumping oceans tryin' to get away

Yes, I can run
Yes, I can run, run, run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can run
Oh, I can run, run, run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can't escape your love

Sandals, boots and stilettos
Take me far as I can go
Rivers, planes and roads
But nothing can separate me from your love
Chasing shadows, chasing time
Crossing boarders, crossing lines
I'm so over getting over you

Yes, I can run
Yes, I can run, run, run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can run
Oh, I can run, run, run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can't escape your love

Hide and seek
Everywhere I go you follow me
'Cause your love it catches up on me
No, I can't escape your love
You've been waiting for love
(I can't escape your love)
It's gonna find me

My feet need a holiday
From this never ending race

Yes, I can run
Yes, I can run, run, run
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can run
Oh, I can run, run, run (You've been waiting for love)
But I can't escape
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can run (whoa)
Yes, I can run, run, run (whoa)
But I can't escape (whoa)
No, I can't escape your love
Yes, I can run (whoa)
Oh, I can run, run, run (whoa)
But I can't escape (whoa)
No, I can't escape your love
