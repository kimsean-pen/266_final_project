I woke up to another mess in the living room
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep

'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screamin' "Everybody, look at me"

And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standin' in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire

I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings

'Cause I'd talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love, in my backyard
Now it's my own anxiety that makes the conversation hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody ever cares 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screamin', "everybody, look at me"

And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standin' in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm faded away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
Well, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire

You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire
