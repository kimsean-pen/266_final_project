Is this the one who thougt it was insane
coming down against it all

didn't want it didn't need it didn't want it

twisted face of fading beauty
count the cost of suffering
cannot see the day before you
only feel what's deep inside
try to change it makes no difference

didn't want it didn't need it didn't want it
didn't want it didn't need it didn't want it

let me go

looking outside inside craving for something
hoping for anything - I'll believe in anything
who has eyes that see - who wants to believe?
in something, in anything? in one thing
in freedom - looking outside inside
set assist pandemonium - broken promises
died alive flying high - you caught me
in your eye. disintegrated insinerated
this is not now I want to be -
too much is coming through someone please tell me what to do
looking outside inside
