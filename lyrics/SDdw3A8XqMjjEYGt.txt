When the day's over and I have a second to myself
I lie on the sofa watching TV
Get on the computer and start checking up on everyone else
On everyone else

Looking at all the pictures
Up to all sorts of mischief
Some of them are ridiculous
Everything's there to see

Everyone looks so wasted
Totally off their faces
I feel so isolated
Everyone there but me

Why does it feel like I'm missing something?
"Been there and done that" was good for nothing
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

Tell me I'm normal for feeling like this
It's a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

I'm not complaining but last night I hardly slept at all
But actually yes I am complaining
No energy left in me, the baby might have taken it all
Cause I've hit the wall

Please don't think that I'm being rude
Honey I'm just not in the mood
I'm head to toe in baby food
So please will you give it a rest

It's not that I don't love you
And it's not that I don't want to
Honestly baby to tell you the truth
I feel like a bit of a mess

Why does it feel like I'm missing something?
"Been there and done that" was good for nothing
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

Tell me I'm normal for feeling like this
It's a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

I could never get bored of it
And most of the time I love this
But sometimes I get nostalgic
When actually I'm complete

Why does it feel like I'm missing something?
"Been there and done that" was good for nothing
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

Tell me I'm normal for feeling like this
It's a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)

Everything's perfect, yeah I'm as content as can be
This is the life for me (this is the life for me, yeah)
