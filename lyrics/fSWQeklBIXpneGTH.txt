When we're up an' dancing on the floor,
darling
And I feel like I need some more, And
I feel your body close to mine, And I
know my love it's about that time

Makes me feel
mighty real
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real.

Well you've got me goin' Like I knew you would
And the music's in me. And I
feel real hot. Then you
kiss me there
And it feels real good Cause I
know you'll love me like you
should
Oh, you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.
Makes me feel mighty real
Makes me feel mighty real

You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.

Well you've got me goin' Like I knew you would
And the music's in me. And I
feel real hot. Then you
kiss me there
And it feels real good Cos I
know you'll love me like you
should

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.

I feel real when you kiss me baby
I feel real when you're next to me
I feel real when you love me baby
I feel real when you hold me

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.
You make me feel
mighty real.

I feel real, I feel real
Woooh, I feel real, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real

make me feel mighty real
