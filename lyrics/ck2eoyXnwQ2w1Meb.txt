It was the last time I felt like this
I've felt nothing at all
And I was 15 when you got sick
I still remember that phone call

They said there's something inside of you
So they tried radiation, chemicals too
And now you're standing on the last line
And so am I
I've got you
You've got me too
Oh I've got you

And you said there's broken links in your brain
And I said it's okay, mines exactly the same
There's still some things I don't understand
Like the casual blindness toward the cruelty of man

And a cop shot the wrong guy again
And they tore down a childhood home again
Oh, nobody seemed to blink an eye
When they wanted you to pay to see the sky alive
Running out of time
You're still running for your life

These days I wish you could forget
When the broken glass cut open my arm and my chest
And you just held me down
As the needle went in and out

And mum was retracing her steps
When the doctor asked her for a cigarette
A two-year-old child in a hospital bed
I will never run with glass again
Just like you said
Don't be an idiot

I know that when you go
Part of me will go with you to the infinite unknown
And we'll stand at the edge of the divide
I will hold your hand and together we'll dive

And I will never meet a man
That can make me question life the way you can
A defender of freedom
An advocate for truth
I'm so proud that half of me grew from you
All the broken parts too
I've got you

I will always hear your voice when I speak
I will always see your face in me
I will always hear your voice when I speak
I will always see your face in me

We never found the Subway
We never found the Subway
We never found the Subway

"Alright, I'm done"
