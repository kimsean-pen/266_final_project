Oh, nah, pretty lady trying to find your way
I just got a couple things to say to you
Like this could be so beautiful
Girl, I can tell that love ain't gone your way
And you probably thought another would change for you
But this could be something so real
So, so, so real
So, so, so real
So, baby, won't you come my way
Cause this could be something so real
Heard now that you're the one to hold down
Don't fret, cause I know what I hold now
It's like a spark in my mind when I met you
Mind asking me now what you gon' do?
I know a place and later we can stay now
If you don't like the hills, then we can stay down
Anything cause you know the deal
I'll give you my heart, let you know that it's real
Oh, nah, pretty lady trying to find your way
I just got a couple things to say to you
Like this could be so beautiful
Girl, I can tell that love ain't gone your way
And you probably thought another would change for you
But this could be something so real
So, so, so real
So, so, so real
So, baby, won't you come my way
Cause this could be something so real
Pretty lady, wanna take you tonight
I wanna show you something you never seen
Now, it's not crazy that I wanna see you smiling
It's team us, baby, over everything
And I just wanna see you at the end of the night before I dream
And first thing in the early morning
Now that's real
Oh, nah, pretty lady trying to find your way
I just got a couple things to say to you
Like this could be so beautiful
Girl, I can tell that love ain't gone your way
And you probably thought another would change for you
But this could be something so real
So, so, so real
So, so, so real
So, baby, won't you come my way
Cause this could be something so real
You know, it's funny
This is likeâ€”like a non-fictional story
You know, this thing between us
It kinda seems like a fairytale
And this is all based on a true story
It's all real
Oh, nah, pretty lady trying to find your way
I just got a couple things to say to you
Like this could be so beautiful
Girl, I can tell that love ain't gone your way
And you probably thought another would change for you
But this could be something so real
So, so, so real
So, so, so real
So, baby, won't you come my way
Cause this could be something so real
