I'm patient of this plan, as humble as I can.
I'll wait another day before I turn away.
But know this much is true, no matter what I do,
Offend in every way, I don't know what to say.

I'm coming through the door, but they're expecting more of an interesting man,
Sometimes I think I can, but how much can I fake?
I'll speak until I break with every word I say, offend in every way.

You tell me to relax, and listen to these facts,
That everyone's my friend, and will be 'till the end.
But know this much is true, no matter what I do,
No matter what I say, offend in every way.
