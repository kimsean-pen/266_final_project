As I walked across the bridge
With a backpack cross my shoulder blades
The Everglades below the wooden cracks
You had offered up a ride
So I might not get accosted by
But I said no I'd rather not
Said no I'd rather not step in
As I left my home I cried
And a substituted figure tried
To reconcile the things I'd left behind
You had opened up the door
And made a place where I could sit inside
But I said no I'd rather not
Said no I'd rather not step in
Now no ones been invested in
How no one knows what's best for him
When no ones left to light the load
Then so one goes to lift alone
I'd like to embrace it all
Have I made this or is it
