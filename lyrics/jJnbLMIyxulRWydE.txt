Spine forged from a steel
Perpetual construction
Shatterproof backbone
Foundation built from stone

Nature's flawless creation
Superior structure
To withstand all the force
Unbreakable core

Cold waters of the north
Crush your waves into the shore
Breakwater stands against the force
Crush your waves into the shore

Like an armor
Hammered thousand times
Iron that will not bend
Is the strength of my flesh

Like a bedrock I stand
Majestic and grand
Perpetual construction
Unwavering power

Cold waters of the north
Crush your waves into the shore
Breakwater stands against the force
Crush your waves into the shore

In the eye of the storm
The profound silence
Thunder is taking its form

When the first raindrop falls
And the winds return
Hold your ground and
Gather your strength
Annihilate or fall
