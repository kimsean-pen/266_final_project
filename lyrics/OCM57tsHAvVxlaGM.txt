The goodbye is the hardest part
When we find ourselves back at the start
But I'm not so brave, and I'm not so smart
No, I'm doin' you a favor
Doin' you a favor

One day you will understand
Why I pushed you away as I ran
And you will find a better man
Than I am
Trust, I'm doin' you a favor
Doin' you a favor
Oooh

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder, uh
Despicable
I ain't never gonna keep her, uh
Despicable
Love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said, if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

The boy who fell into the sky
Had no one there to watch him cry
He looked at you with his empty eyes
And said, I'm doin' you a favor
Doin' you a favor
Oooh

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder, uh
Despicable
I ain't never gonna keeper, uh
Despicable
Love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

How I wish I told a different tale
Why we chase the light and his love prevailed
But his blood ran cold and his skin went pale
She got a letter in the mail
Said, I'm doin' you a favor
Doin' you a favor

Said, If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither, no
Said If I were you
Said If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
