Drifting apart, getting harder to hold you

Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight, rolling up on an ocean
There's a cut on the rose, and you're lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then we might
Send us back to the sun
Now I know, I know

We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me
Back to where it was before
When we were on fire

Fire
Head down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Streets are alive now, and everything's racing
You're on my mind, running in my veins, fueling the flame

Let's start it again
And I know, I know
That we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me
Back to where it was before

When we were on fire
Fire
We were on fire
Fire

Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh
Now don't tell me, no
That we're burning down
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh
Now don't tell me, no
That we're burning now
I know, I know we're losing light and our love is dying
Take me, take me home
Back to where it was before when we were on fire
Fire
And I know, I know that we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me
Back to where it was before when we were on fire
Fire
When we were on fire
Fire
