And you came to me one night,
Like a morning light,
Just to hold me tight
Then you left and I was so alone,
Saying I should've known,
You're no good for me.

There's no reason I should cry
No, no baby, I'll survive,
I don't care,
I don't care

No one will ever hold you tight,
No one will ever love you like,
Just no one like I do,
There is no one, no one
No one will ever treat you right,
You're the one who's never satisfied,
There is no one like I ... like I am.

I can feel what you're looking for,
I'm not that girl no more
I'm not made of stone
I'm gonna stand on my own,
Not gonna break me down
No one will stop me now
No, no, no, no,
'Cause life is kind without you,

And I know I can make it through
Without you

Life goes all around
Round and round and round
I feel love for sure
And it's gonna get you,

Life goes all around
Spinning all around
Now you want me, don't you

No one will ever hold you tight, (hold you tight)
No one will ever love you like, (love you like)
Now you're back, I can feel your love,
O yeah, I'm never gonna let you,
No one will ever treat you right, (treat you right)
You're the one who's never satisfied, (satisfied)
After all, you can fall,
And there's no one you can reach to

No one will ever, ever love you
No one will ever, ever touch you,
No one will ever, ever hold you,
Turn around now, just turn around now
If you love me yeah
No one like me
No one
No one
