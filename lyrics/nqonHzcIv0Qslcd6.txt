Whispering like children at that
Watching the blandness of night
Catching illusions and kites
Counting the blandness at art

I'll walk those islands for you
I'd climb those mountains for you
I'll reach new countries for you
Conquer new memories for you
Astounding discovery
Feel the change
What's it gonna be?
Oh beautiful discovery
It was there, I couldn't see... Could not see

I sailed those oceans for you
I crossed new frontiers for you
I touched new faces for you
Asking new questions for you

Amazing as stars in the night
Smiling at changes in time
Talking til morning gets tired
Waving through shadows and light
Astounding discovery
Feel the change
What's it gonna be?
Oh beautiful discovery
It was there, I couldn't see
