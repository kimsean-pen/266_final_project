Oh i used to be your baby
used to be your pride and joy
you used to take me dancing
just like any other boy
but now you've found another partner

and left me like a broken toy
Oh it's someone else you're takin'
someone else you're playin' to
honey though i'm aching
know just what i have to do
if i can't have you when i'm wakin'

i'll go to sleep and dream i'm with you
Oh take me take me take me
to the dreamer's ball
i'll be right on time and i'll dress so fine
you're gonna love me when you see me

i won't have to worry
take me take me
promise not to wake me 'till it's morning
it's all been true

What you say about that hey honey?
you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball?
i'd like that
right on down forty-second street
way down down town dreamer's town
Oh take me take me take me
i'm your plaything now

you make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
gently take me remember i'll be dreamin' of my baby
at the dreamer's ball
Take me hold me
remember what you told me
you'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
i'll meet you at the dreamer's ball
