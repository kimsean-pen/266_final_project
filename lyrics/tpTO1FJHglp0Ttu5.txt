So the winter comes
Where we belong
I feel the cold
Within my heart
I see the night
Deep in your eyes
The winter comes at last

4x
Here the winter comes
Again

So the winter comes
Where we grow strong
I hear your words
Melt like snow (on my skin)
I taste your kiss
It tastes like snow
The winter comes to last

My tongue is frozen to the ground
I cry alone for times to come
It beats the daylight out of me
The winter comes to seize the day
The winter comes to seize the day

4x
Here the winter comes
Again

Again
Again
