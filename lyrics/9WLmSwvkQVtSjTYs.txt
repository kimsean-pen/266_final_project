Kissin in the back row
That's how we missed the movie
Said you had cottonmouth
That apple juice was groovy
Splish smack on my lips
Apple juice kissin makes me roll my hips

Kissin in the doorway
No where else to play
Cottonmouth pillow lips
Better take a swig of this
Splish smack on my lips
Apple juice kissin makes me roll my hips

Easy to love â€" our love will find a way
Easy to love â€" our love is here to stay
Ubby Dubby Lovey Dovey

Kissin by the streetlight
Don't want to say goodnight
Swooning practically spooning
Boom! Moon was never so ripe
Moment never so right

Apple juice kissin
Baby we're blissin
