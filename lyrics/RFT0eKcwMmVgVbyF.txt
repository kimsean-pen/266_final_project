Sun purifies the unfair world below,
Needs new strengths to eternally glow.
The rite gives fire new forces to burn,
And this gives birth to the Sun, in turn.

Renewed by an antique rite,
The life in black and white
Is coloured by the solar light.

Sun has an inner motion,
It seems to overrun
The igneous oceans.
Fire's devotion
To the brightest one.
Birth of the Sun!

Saint John bonfires in the summer solstice
Turn into real a revival auspice.

Renewed by an antique rite,
The life in black and white
Is coloured by the solar light.

It seems to overrun
The igneous oceans.
Fire's devotion
To the brightest one.
