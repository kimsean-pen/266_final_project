You're still here under all these things
I've gathered up just to make it seem
Like I found faith on a chosen course
But it's just grief come to settle scores
Still not out of the cold but I pretend
All of this had a warm and graceful end
Choose my words with a clouded mind tonight
Guard the doorway to the truth
My virtue lives with you
I could wait on an answered prayer
If I believed there was someone there
But you don't need any light divine
You shed your skin and leave it behind
I hear peace in the rhythms of your voice
Comforts me knowing you have made a choice
Lost my words in a clouded mind tonight
Guard the doorway to the truth
My virtue lives with you
