I call my name
aloud
looking for what I remember
My name I know
I love going to the movies

I turn and see my childhood home
on this new beach
where strange birds fly
These birds swoop right over
looking out for me

"Who is she?"
"Where does she come from?"
the building disappears

"Oh she's been marooned
can anybody help her?"

The sun comes up
slower than I remember
A man I know
he lights his cigarette with nothing
Not a smile or memory
his shadow still wet as my gash against the rock
Sharp and high on the Balearic promontory
I see his ship go
What stings me?
These birds can't stop the waves

"Oh she's been marooned
can anybody help her?"

The birds can sing a song
He covered me in cactus
I don't remember much but
good riddance he is gone
He put me ashore
at 4 am
The man is gone
Good riddance he is gone
His billcaught their eyes
Blood is on his billHis billcaught my neck
How unnaturally I gaze
I don't remember much but
he turned me around
My mouth quivered
Perpetually alarmed
I gaze at nothing
My emerald is gone
He lifts my hand
I hear him
