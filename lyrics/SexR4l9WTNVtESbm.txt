My days are used for nothing
But tearing myself apart
Nights I'm spending wasted
Alone in the dark
Is this all my pathetic little life
I hope I won't throw away
My chance to get it right

I am hiding in the shadows
You've been standing in the light
I hope you understand
I'm scared of who I really am
I just need you to show me, me

I wish that I was younger
Honest and more innocent
Tired of living the normal lie
Sick of all the emptiness
I am the ocean tide pulling until I drown
I'll be counting down until
I'm six feet underground

I am hiding in the shadows
You've been standing in the light
I hope you understand
I'm scared of who I really am
I just need you to show me
Show me, me
Show me, me
Show me, me

I am hiding in the shadows
You've been standing in the light
I hope you understand
I'm scared of who I really am
I just need you to show me

I am hiding in the shadows
You've been standing in the light
I hope you understand
I'm scared of who I really am
I just need you to show me
I just need you to show me, me
