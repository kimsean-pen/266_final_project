When gravity's a palm pushing down on your head
Like the devil's got a paw dug in your shoulder
And the other one is rubbing your back
But the kitchen in this new place has a window
Yeah you can grow basil on the sill
Maybe you can call your neighbors by name now

Berries on the dash is the sweetest kind of living
Still this feels like eating the meat of the mountain
It's all grit and gristle I can't chew and swallow,
I'm gnawing my way back home
The clouds look a lot like wool gone through the wash
I check my phone for the time but I still wear my watch
Yeah i'm confused about how i'm supposed to connect to anything now

The kind of high I like is when I barely make the train
And the people with a seat smile big at me because they know the feeling
And for a millisecond we share a look like a family does
Like we have inside jokes
Like we could call each other by little nicknames
And I could tell the story of how
My great grandmother's sister was deemed a saint
How they exhumed her body after years of being buried

And they found she hadn't even begun to sully

So they moved her again, straight into the Vatican

I think of all the billions of eyes
All looking at something different at the same time
And I feel nauseous
Some days I can only see into my suitcase
It's got everything I need
Plus some superstitious things I may also need
Music soothes the savage beast

The pilot says to me and he asks me to sing
But now is not the time

I just want to fall into a pile of warm laundry
I just wanna keep very very quiet yeah

It's June where you sleep and July where I land
Thought I saw you on the platform in Amsterdam
And I nearly missed my train
And I felt so defeated 'til I jumped on to see all the warm smiles were for me
I made my train and it made me so happy
I made my train and it made me forget everything
It made me forget, made me forget made me forget made me forget everything
It made me forget made me forget made me forget made me forget made me forget everything
