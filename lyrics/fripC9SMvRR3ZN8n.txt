Hey Aaron, it's Daddy
Give me a call when you get a chance here buddy
I ain't nobody to talk to now, what the hell is going on
Call me buddy, bye

Bringing back the memories
You know you were the first to hold my hand
All the times you feel in front of me
You gave me all the strength to be a man
All I wanna be is half of you
Give me that side from him
You told me that freedom's in our truth
Tell me where I begin

Where are you going, can't understand
Don't want you to be alone, send you off but can't let you go
Where are you floating, where does this end
I just wanna meet you there
Papa, I'mma meet you there

You were my champion
You were my champion
Always run the race, always had to chase
Leave 'em in the dust when they wave that flag
You were my champion

I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad

Running into memories,
Remembering the day you saved my life
Pulled me out of tragedy
Drawn to the dark but you see the light
All I wanna do is stop this hurt
Give me one sign tonight
All I wanna put time in reverse
Back when it was you and I

Where are you going, can't understand
Don't want you to be alone, send you off but can't let you go
Where are you floating, where does this end
I just wanna meet you there
Papa, I'mma meet you there

You were my champion
You were my champion
Always run the race, always had to chase
Leave 'em in the dust when they wave that flag
You were my champion

I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad

You were my champion
You were my champion
Always run the race, always had to chase
Leave 'em in the dust when they wave that flag
You were my champion

You were my champion
You were my champion
Always run the race, always had to chase
Leave 'em in the dust when they wave that flag
You were my champion

I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad
I love you, Dad
