Cruising in the moonlight
heading downtown
looking for some fast love
gotta get down

Look good woman
Looking my way
If you want a good time
Know just where I stay

Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club

Meet me at the dance floor
Let me shake my stuff
Know you aren't just play this
In the rock and roll game

Only one woman
Join me for a dance
If you want a good time
Girl you know my place

Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club
Rock and roll night club
