I was lucky
I met a girlfriend
Someone who loves me
Unlike my mother
She likes graveyards
And sometimes sunsets
She's complicated
And underrated
Her kiss is soothing like morhpine
Exciting, filthy and obscene
She says "I want you too
I'll see, what I can do"
In the daytime, in the evening
In the spaces, abandoned places
In the school yard, so appealing
At the essen
Not that I wanted to
Her kiss is soothing like morhpine
Exciting, filthy and obscene
She says "I want you too
I'll see, what I can do"
