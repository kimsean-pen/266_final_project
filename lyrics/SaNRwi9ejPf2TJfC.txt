Will I wish I would have stayed?
Is the other side charades?
By the time I tie the braid
Will it be worth the fray?

When I decide to leave
Will it be everything I dreamed?
When I swallow before I speak
Will I hate to see a different side of me?

And I hope it's just a phase
Just a dull side of the blade
Under the stone
The cure is to be alone

Go home
Lock the door
Put on something
You've heard before
Sink into the floor
If I could go back
I would have never started the war
I used to soar
But I don't want to anymore

When I decide to leave
Will it be everything I dreamed?
When I swallow before I speak
Will I hate to see a different side of me?

Go home
Lock the door
Put on something
You've heard before
Sink into the floor
If I could go back
I would have never started the war
I used to soar
But I don't want to anymore
