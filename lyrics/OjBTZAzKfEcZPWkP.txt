Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night

Saturday morning, Friday's enemy
Housework is calling, but where to begin
Kids are out of school, trying to find a friend
Everybody's busy, can't wait for the night to begin

You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, I can't wait for Saturday to begin

Gonna have myself some fun, fun, fun, fun
(Get down it's Saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come
Make love until the morning come

I love to party, everybody does
You can't wait for the weekend no, no
See what you get into
But you've got to get down, down, down, down

Even if you stay at home
Make love and listen to the music
You've got to let yourself go, go, go, go, go, girl

You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, yeah, I can't wait for Saturday to begin

Gonna have myself some fun, fun, fun, fun
(Get down it's Saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come
Make love until the morning come

In New York, in Detroit
Yeah, yeah
In New York, in Detroit
Even in LA

I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
I can't wait for Saturday to begin

You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, I can't wait for Saturday to begin

Gonna have myself some fun, fun, fun, fun
(Get down it's Saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come
Make love until the morning come
Some like the party, some like the dance
Some like to make romance
Some like to smoke, some like to joke
Some like to drink, some like to think
Some is on the blink
Me, my baby and me, yeah
You work all week long
You work the fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, I can't wait for Saturday to begin
Get down, get down, get down and spend the night
