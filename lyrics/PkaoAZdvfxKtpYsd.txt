Taking back what you've spent
Time that we have spent
Walking on wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can't taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking on wasted, take what I can play

Taking back what you've spent
Time that we have spent
Walking on wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can't taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking on wasted, take what I can play

It's off here, too late to talk
It's oddly when you want
Too late to talk
It's off here,
Taking back what you've spent
Oh I can't taste it,
It's off here
Walking on wasted, say that I can't
Walking on wasted, take what I can play
