Outside it's nighttime and you're mine again
Red lights and thick frost are clothing all the land
Your breath draws a cloud on the window of our car
Our eyes exhausted, still begging for more
Engraved in wildness, have we gone too far?
Somewhere four wheels unwind the roar of their power
This road is a snake skin, glittering and bald
Like a reptile, that gash the frozen soil
The world is not ours
But faster than the rain
We cut the night
We're random bullets, love
Shot by some drunken god
Guilty only, of growing old
Hours like fires, burning our beliefs
Soon the sun will rise up and sew us in its dreams
Forgetting that we're sailors, without wind in our sails
Twins by the heartbeat until the morning brakes
Dismissed in dizziness, and begging for more
Have we ever noticed that nothing last for ever?
Faces toward the sky, 'cause the unknown is sublime
Printing every hour in polaroids of mine
The world is not ours
But faster than the rain
We cut the night
We're random bullets, love
Shot by some drunken god
Oh guilty only, oh guilty only
Of growing old, of growing old
Of growing old, of growing old
Of growing old
Hours like fires, burning our beliefs
Truth is right there baby, even if we bleed
Night roads are coal coats on the muscles
Of the world, leading us to nowhere
'Cause nowhere is our home
Nowhere is our home
Oh guilty only, of growing old
We're random bullets, love
The world is not ours
But faster than the rain
We cut the night
We're random bullets, love
The world is not ours
But faster than the rain
We cut the night
