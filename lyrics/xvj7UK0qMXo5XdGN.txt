Salt in my eyes
Everything spoken
Salt on my high
All of my fighting, done

Let it fall
Let it hum
Hiding soul
I need one

Why did this come?
Heaven in hiding
Mind into mind
Hold us in light and sun

Oh, letting go

Let it fall
Let it hum
Hiding soul
I need one

Let it fall
Let it hum
Hiding soul
I need one
