Preflight delight
Defaced street lights,
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now

Popcorn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Corn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare!
Dare!
Dare!
Dare!

I want to be, a fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare!
Dare!
Dare!
Dare!

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare!

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare!
Dare!
Dare!
Dare!
