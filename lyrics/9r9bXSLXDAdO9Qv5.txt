It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in

It's quiet company
It's quiet company
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It's quiet company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company
And I can't fall asleep

Without a little help
It takes a while
To settle down
My shivered bones

Wait till the panic's out
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
Company

Its quiet company
Its quiet company
And I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole

I said I would
But then I saw

Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
