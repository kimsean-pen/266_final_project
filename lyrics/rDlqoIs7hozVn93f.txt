I gotta find myself, gonna find it now
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man
They wanna take me down, wanna see me crawl
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man
I gotta find myself, gonna find it now
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man

When I come to town for the last time
Pull up in a fast car for the first time
I'm gonna say goodbye
You didn't see me cry

I got a million on my soul
I go build an army on my own
They put a bounty in my soul
I got a million on my soul
I go build an army on my own
They put a bounty in my soul
Won't you leave me alone more
Oh, leave me alone more
I gotta be a man, I gotta be a man
Won't you leave me alone more
Oh, leave me alone more
I gotta be a man, I gotta be a man

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, hold my fire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, hold my fire

I gotta find myself, gonna find it now
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be a man
They wanna take me down, wanna see me crawl
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man
I gotta find myself, gonna find it now
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man

When I come to town for the last time
Pull up in a fast car for the first time
I'm gonna say goodbye
You didn't see me cry

I got a million on my soul
I go build an army on my own
They put a bounty in my soul
I got a million on my soul
I go build an army on my own
They put a bounty in my soul
Won't you leave me alone more
Oh, leave me alone more
I gotta be a man, I gotta be a man
Won't you leave me alone more
Oh, leave me alone more
I gotta be a man, I gotta be a man

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, hold my fire
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, hold my fire

I gotta find myself, gonna find it now
I gotta be a man, I gotta find him now
I gotta be a man, I gotta be the man
