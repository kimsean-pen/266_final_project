Today has no means
He's alone and anonymous
But written in his cells
He's got the marks of a genius

I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men

One, you lock the target
Two, you bait the line
Three, you slowly spread the net
And four, you catch the man

You catch the man

I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men
Sell him to other men
At ten times his price, at least

Who's able to forget them
To realize my aim

One, you lock the target
Two, you bait the line

Bait the line, spread the net, catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man

Freeze! Shoot to kill or die

I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men

Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man

You catch the man

I'm looking for this man
I'm looking for this man
To sell him to other men
Sell him to other men
At ten times his price, at least

Freeze!

Lock the target, spread the net and catch the man
Spread the net, spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, spread the net and catch the man
Lock the target, bait the line
Spread the net and catch the man
