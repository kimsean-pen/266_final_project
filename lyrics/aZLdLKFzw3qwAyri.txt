You used to have all the answers, and you, you still have them too
And we, we live half in the daytime, and we, we live half at night

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you... you just know
You just do

I wanna find myself by the sea, in anothers company, by the sea
I wanna go out to the pie, I'm gonna dive and have no fear
Because you... you just know
You just do

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you... you just know
You just do
