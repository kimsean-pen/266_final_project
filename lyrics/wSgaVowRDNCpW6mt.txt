This party is old and uninviting
Participants all in black and white
You enter in full blown Technicolor
Nothing is the same after tonight

If the world would fall apart
In a fiction-worthy wind
I wouldn't change a thing
Now that you're here

Your love is a verb
Here in my room
Here in my room
Here in my room
Your love is a verb
Here in my room
Here in my room
Here in my room

You enter and close the door behind you
Now show me the world as seen from the stars
If only the lights would dim a little
I'm wary of eyes upon my scars

If the world would fall apart
In a fiction-worthy wind
I wouldn't change a thing
Now that you're here

Your love is a verb
Here in my room
Here in my room
Here in my room
Your love is a verb
Here in my room
Here in my room
Here in my room

Pink tractorbeam into your incision
Head spinning as free as Dervishs' Whirl
I came here expecting next to nothing
So, thank you for being that kind of girl
Kind of girl
