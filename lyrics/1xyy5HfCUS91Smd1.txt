Let me hear ya now

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
But now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh, baby, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in her arms
(I want you back)

Yes, I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, boy
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following your boy
I didn't even want around

Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Oh, won't you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in her arms, arms

All I want
All I need
All I want
All I need

(All I need is just one more chance)
(To show you that I love you, baby)
Baby
(Baby)
Baby
(Baby)

(I want you back)
Forget what happened then
(I want you back)
Let me live again

Oh, baby, I was blind to let you go
'Cause now since I see you in her arms

I want you back
(Spare me of this cause)
I want you back
(Give back what I lost)

Oh, baby, I need one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?
(I want you back)

(Forget what happened then)
I want you back
(Let me live again)
Oh, baby
