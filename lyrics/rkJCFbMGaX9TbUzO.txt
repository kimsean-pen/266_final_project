There was a house, yes, there was a home
And there in the flesh, despising their own
The boy king of cats, the princess of light
Dress up in the old fields to court the young knights
We would dance with the knights
It's hard to imagine, imagine the laughter
It's hard to imagine, imagine your joy
It's hard to believe in muscle and matter
It's hard to believe that I was a boy, I was a boy

To fashion together a child of our own
To lead us home
It's hard to imagine, imagine the laughter
It's hard to imagine, imagine your joy
It's hard to believe in muscle and matter
It's hard to believe that I was a boy, I was a boy
I was a boy
I was a ...

Oh, if they would show us home...
And they'd show us home...
It's hard to imagine, imagine the laughter
It's hard to imagine, imagine your joy
It's hard to believe in muscle and matter
It's hard to believe that I was a boy, I was a boy
It's hard to imagine, imagine the laughter (I was a boy)
It's hard to imagine, imagine your joy (I was a)
It's hard to believe in muscle and matter
It's hard to believe that I was a boy, I was a boy
(I was a boy) I was a boy
(I was a boy) I was a
