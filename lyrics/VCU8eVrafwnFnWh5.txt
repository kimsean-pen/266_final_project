Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
'Cause you crossed my mind, you crossed my mind

Oh, make my blood thump 7, 8, 9
Make my heart beat double time
Now I'm the only sour cherry on the fruit stand, right?
Am I the only sour cherry on the fruit stand?

Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
'Cause you crossed my mind, you crossed my mind

I'm a penny in a diamond mine
We could be movers or we could be shakers
If we could just shake something out of the blue
And get off the ride

I'm the only sour cherry on the fruit stand, right?
Am I the only sour cherry on the fruit stand?
Am I the only sour cherry on the fruit stand, right?
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?

Go home, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, it's over
G-g-go home, go home, it's over
Go, go home, it? s over

G-g-go home, go home, it's over
Go, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, go home, it's over
Go, go home, it? s over

Now I'm the only sour cherry on the fruit stand
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?
Now I'm the only sour cherry on the fruit stand
Right am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?

G-g-go home, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, it's over
G-g-go home, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, it's over

G-g-go home, go home, it's over
Go, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, go home, it's over
G-g-go home, it's over
