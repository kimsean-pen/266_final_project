Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could, if you just said, "You're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now, I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to night when you said to me
And nothing's gonna change, not for me and you

That before I knew how much I had to lose
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could, if you just said, "You're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow

But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I'd say, "Come back, come back,
Come back to me like you would before you said it's not that easy"

Before the fight, before I let you walk
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie

Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could, if you just said, "You're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Whoa, oh
That you'd be here by now
