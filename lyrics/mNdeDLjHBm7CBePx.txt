Perfect love you will never find
say goodbye to what's left
behind
your release is way overdue
let your tears be a friend to you

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
don't get caught in the middle
thinking 'bout it
if it hurts just a little be glad of it
if you try you will see, what will be
hurts just a little

Silent eyes make your public life
and the lies can be cold as ice
how could you ever be so blind
bet you never ever ever thought
that love could be so kind

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
don't get caught in the middle
thinking 'bout it
if it hurts just a little be glad of it
if you try you will see, what will be
hurts just a little

C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')
c'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')
c'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')
it's a crime of passion
that's just what it means to me

If it hurt just a little be glad of it
don't get caught in the middle
thinking 'bout it
if it hurts just a little be glad of it
if you try you will see
if it hurt just a little be glad of it
don't get caught in the middle
thinking 'bout it
if hurts just a little be glad of it
if you try you will see

C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')
c'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')
c'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
honey (darlin')...
