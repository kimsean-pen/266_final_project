Dealers keep dealin'
Thieves keep thievin'
Whores keep whorin'
Junkies keep scorin'
Trade is on the meat rack
Strip joints full of hunchbacks
Bitches keep a bitchin'
Clap just keeps itchin'

Ain't no use in prayin'
That's the way it's stayin', baby
Johnny ain't so crazy
He's always got a line for the ladies
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown
Get your rocks off
Get you rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown

Creeps a keep crawlin'
Drunks a keep fallin'
Teasers keep a teasein'
Holy joes are preachin'
Cops just keep bustin'
Hustlers keep a hustlin'
Death just keeps knockin'
Souls are up for auction

Ain't no use in prayin'
That's the way it's stayin', baby
Johnny ain't so crazy
He's always got a line for the ladies
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown
Get your rocks off
Get you rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown
Get your rocks off
Get you rocks off, honey
Shake it now now
Get'em off downtown

Get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, honey...
