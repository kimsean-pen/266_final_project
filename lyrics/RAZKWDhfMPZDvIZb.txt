When you need me
Girl I try to hide it
But I can't escape it
oh baby
Please forgive me
When I think of you my thoughts are so x-rated (x-rated)
oh baby
Baby I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight
woah oh
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me tonight
And I say you're right
But first you gotta
Push push back up on it (girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push push back up on it (girl)
Girl I can't go on longer
Push push back up on it (girl)
Go ahead lay it on it (Don't stop)
Don't stop until the morning (girl)
Just keep pushing back on it
Do you want me? (You know it)
Do you need me? (You know it)
Will you please me? (You know it)
Will you tease me? (You know it)
