The 7th time, love sickness and desillusion
This head that won't listen to me, now
There's crumb of a dark night
Burning in your mouth
Till I wake you...

It's three steps too far, this slammed door,
Your damned bed, this white head, beside you,
And there is blood on the stairs,
So keep it nice, I'm broken,

Between skin and sheets, skin and sheets,
I won't disturb you anymore,
Between two lights, I woke you up,
The seventh time, I won't disturb you anymore
I won't disturb you anymore

The 7th time, love sickness and desillusion

This head that won't listen to me, now
There's crumb of a hot night
Burning in your mouth
Till I wake you...

Between skin and sheets, skin and sheets,
I won't disturb you anymore,
Between two lights, I woke you up,
The 7th time, I won't disturb you anymore
I won't disturb you anymore

The 7th time, the 7th time
I won't disturb you anymore
I won't disturb you anymore
I won't disturb you anymore
I won't disturb you anymore
