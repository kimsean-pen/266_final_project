And the sun also rises
When no buds are in bloom
There are always surprises
At the back of the room

We can build a big house
We can drive a big car
I put it to you
Makes no difference at all
To how happy you are

Just let it all through
Just let it all through
And the world will wrap its arms around you

Every ocean is deeper
Than it seems at the start
It will be an adventure
'Til the last beat of your heart

We can build a big house
We can drive a big car
I put it to you
Makes no difference at all
To how happy you are

Just let it all through
Just let it all through
And the world will wrap its arms around you

And the world will wrap its songs around you
And the world will wrap its songs around you
And the world will wrap its songs around you
And the world will wrap its songs around you

Just let it all through
Just let it all through
And the sun also rises
Just let it all through
Just let it all through
And the sun also rises
Just let it all through
Just let it all through
