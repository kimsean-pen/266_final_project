Gipsy please
Won't you give me
The secret key
Of life's mistery
She said

Gipsy girl
won't you unfurl
the flag of life
before my eyes
And she said

Then you read my hands
Then you read my eyes
Said I am a man
Who must learn to cry
Then you took the cards
Then tear a deck of truth
Gazed towards the stars
Said I must learn to lose

Gipsy love
Oh can't you see
That you are the one
I really need
She said I need

First hand experience
In second hand love
I need
First hand experience
In second hand love

Then you read my hands
Then you read my eyes
Said I am a man
Who must learn to cry
Then you took the cards
Then tear a deck of truth
Gazed toward the stars
Said I must learn to lose

Gipsy please
I won't be
Lover of you
Oh tell me please
