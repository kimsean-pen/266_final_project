Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

... ... ...
You open up when you had me in your hands
Slipping far away with the world at your command
You sing me to sleep and then you hit me awake

It's a perfect life, a perfect life
I only wanna be here when you're by my side
Oh, I believe now, I'll love you 'til I die
You will sing me to sleep, you will hit me awake

In a perfect life, a perfect life
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life

Life is all we need
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life

Life is all we need
Little Mikey steps everywhere
Knives in his pockets and bullets in his hair
He has nothing to live for, nothing left to say

He's locking all the doors to keep the older wolves at bay
Spoons and foil are all he needs
A bed and some china, a lighter and some speed
He will sing you to sleep and then will hit you awake

In a perfect life, a perfect life
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need
The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
Is all we need
