I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
And there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
Am lost in your eyes, you make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue and I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around

You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
Am lost in your eyes, you make me crazier, crazier, crazier oh oh...
Baby, you showed me what living is for

I don't wanna hide anymore
You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
Am lost in your eyes, you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier...
