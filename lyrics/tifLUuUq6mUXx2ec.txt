Down in the cellar I'm making my poison for you.
This stuff that I make will stop you and end this for good.
I'm not bitter, I'm just bitter sweet.
Hiding in the shadows I see your defeat!
Down in the cellar I'm making my poison for you. You fool!

I see you running to the woods, running to your doom!
I see you fading out for good, falling down. You fool!
You can't hurt me now!

Down in the cellar I'm making my poison for you.
This venom is, my love, the last gift I'll give to you. You fool!

I see you running to the woods, running to your doom!
I see you fading out for good, falling down. You fool!
You can't hurt me, you can't hurt me now!

I see you running to the woods, running to your doom!
I see you fading out for good, falling you fool.
I see you fading out for good, falling down too soon!
You can't hurt me now!
