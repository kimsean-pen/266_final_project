My love, what did I do
To make you fall
So far from me?

And now, I can't recall
Because of the fall
Selective memory

Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall
So I couldn't see

But if I get off my knees
I might recall
I'm 20 feet tall

Ooh, ehh
I'm 20 feet tall
Mmm, yeah, ooh, yeah
I'm 20 feet tall
