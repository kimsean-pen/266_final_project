Taking on water, sailing a restless sea
From a memory, a fantasy
The wind carries into white water
Far from the islands, don't you know

You're never going to get to France
Mary, queen of chance, will they find you?
Never going to get to France
Could a new romance ever bind you?

Walking on foreign grounds like a shadow
Roaming in far off territory
Over your shoulder, stories unfold
You're searching for sanctuary, you know

You're never going to get to France
Mary, queen of chance, will they find you?
Never going to get to France
Could a new romance ever bind you?

I see a picture by the lamp's flicker
Isn't it strange how dreams fade and shimmer

Never going to get to France
Mary, queen of chance, will they find you?
Never going to get to France
Could a new romance ever bind you?

I see a picture by the lamp's flicker
Isn't it strange how dreams fade and shimmer

Never going to get to France
Mary, queen of chance, will they find you?
Never going to get to France
Could a new romance ever bind you?

Never going to get to France
Never going to

Never going to get to France
Never going to

Never going to get to France
Never going to get to France
