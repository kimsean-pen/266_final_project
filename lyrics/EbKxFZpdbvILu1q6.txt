Back in 95
A little boy from just outside of London
Took a fated trip across the ocean
And little did he know
That he would find
His voice in verse and Making wishes on his broken stereo
Can't shake that noise from his bones
Hear it all play out in distant echoes

So
Long
Soldier
Cruise Controller
Satellite Trajectory
Guide us into reverie
And come down
To voice a generation
Late 2005
The boys got plans
As crazy as his friends
They take their chances
Driving west alone
Give em' six more years
And see what time will do
For Hopeless Dreamers
Singing wishes
To their broken stereo

You can't shake the noise
From their bones
Hear it all play out
In Distant Echoes
Cruise Controller
Satellite Trajectory
Guide us into reverie
And come down
To voice a generation

So
Long
Soldier
Cruise
Controller
Satellite Trajectory
Guide us into reverie
And come down
To voice a generation...
