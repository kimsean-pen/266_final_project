I was walking in the street one night
Just thinking bout the wrong and right
How it all means nothing
In the world you left me

But I wait for the face to come
Back in my face now
Oh I don't care about the sun
Girl I know what it's about (4x)

But the face will come
Back in your night girl
But I just don't care about the sun
The sun
The sun

Back in your night girl
Well I just can't face it
The fact that you can't forget
Won't forget
But the face will come

Back in your night girl
Well I just can't face it
The fact that you can't forget
Won't forget

I was walking in the street one night
Just thinking bout the wrong and right
And I just don't care about the sun
The sun
The sun
