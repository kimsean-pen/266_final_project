As your cheeks have turned so pale
And your eyes have lost their shine
Something must keep you in pain
I wish I could read your mind
Read your mind

Don't let your world shrink into sadness
Don't let the cold widen the distance
Look into your heart to restore the faith in yourself
You're beautiful, you're beautiful today

Would you listen to my voice
When doubts are leading you astray?
Shall life be your only choice
I wish hope to guide your way
Guide your way

Don't let your world shrink into sadness
Don't let the cold widen the distance
Look into your heart to restore the faith in yourself
You're beautiful, you're beautiful today

Don't let your world shrink into sadness
Don't let the cold widen the distance
Look into the dark for the beauty that's hiding
You're not alone, you're not alone, today
