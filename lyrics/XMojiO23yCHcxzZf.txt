Excuse me while I disappear
I think I've overstayed my welcome here
So now I think it's best I go before my heart turns to stone
I've been travelling 100 years
Thought I was close but I was nowhere near
When I asked myself 'Where'd you wanna go?'
I guess I've never known
Oh but baby now I think I've really noticed

I've been looking for a better day for my great escape
Never afraid to go it alone
I'm still looking for a better day for my great escape
Only now it's a better way to get back home

Excuse me while I interupt
All this noise and all this fuss
Working night and day
And all the songs I love to play
They take me further away
Further form the ones I love
I don't know what I was thinking of when I told myself
'Go out and chase your dreams and find out what they mean.'
Oh now I can't wait to quit this crazy scene

I've been looking for a better day for my great escape
Never afraid to go it alone
I'm still looking for a better day for my great escape
Only now it's a better way to get back home

You know the wide burden of my choice
Defines the man I am
And all the pain I feel is in my voice
I hope you understand
I hope you understand

I've been looking for a better day for my great escape
Never afraid to go it alone
I'm still looking for a better day for my great escape
Only now it's a better way to get back home

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
Hey
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
Hey
I'm going home
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey
Hey-oh
I'm going home
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
