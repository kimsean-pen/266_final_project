You know that something inside of you
Still plays a part in what I do always, I'm here for you
I think that if we were all we had
That's more than most people ever have
Anyway, oh, anyway, you can stay here

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything
I know you're still there because you're scared

I'm here if you're scared to go through
Anything, just reach out in front of you, always, won't you stay near?
So close, we played it as if we cared
Don't stop, now that we're almost there, anyway, oh, I'm here for you

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything
I know you're still there because you're scared

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything

I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everybody
I know you're still there because you're scared
That you'll lose everything
I know you're still there because you're scared
