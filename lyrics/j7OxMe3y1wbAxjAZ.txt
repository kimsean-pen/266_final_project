outside the storm clouds gathering
moved silently along the dusty boulevard
where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
so they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky

they are driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someone's calling

i remember when you held my hand
in the park we would play
when the circus came to town
look over here

outside the circus gathering
moved silently along the rain swept boulevard
the procession moves on the shouting is over
the fabulous freaks are leaving town

they are driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someone's calling
the carnival is over

we sat and watched
as the moon rose
for the very first time
