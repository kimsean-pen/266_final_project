I'm alone
Sitting with my broken glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past

I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier standing next to me
Riding on the Metro

I was smiling as you took my hand
So removed we spoke in France
You were passed with shallow words
The years have passed and still a hurt
You were passed as shallow word
Years have passed and still the hurt
I can see it now
Smiling as I pulled away
Sorry

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the Metro

I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned then walked away
Fuck you for loving me
Riding on the Metro
