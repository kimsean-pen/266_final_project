A streak of lightning is shooting through the air
Electric sun lights the sky
His face is frightening, so evil ones beware
Men of disaster hear his cry

And now at last we know he's real
The power of his sword we feel
Thundersteel
Thundersteel

The earth it rumbles, death is in the air
The city crumbles, death is everywhere
And from the burning sky we see the soldier fly
He mounts his horse of steel and now he rides

And now at last we know he's real
The power of his word we feel
Thundersteel
Thundersteel

A streak of lightning is shooting through the air
Electric sun lights the sky
His face is frightening, so evil ones beware
Men of disaster hear his cry

And now at last we know he's real
The power of his sword we feel
Thundersteel
Thundersteel
Thundersteel
