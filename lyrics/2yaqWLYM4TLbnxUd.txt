Falling to the sand
Smitten by the hand that fed you long ago
How the mighty fall
Once you stood so tall
It gave you vertigo
Now the memory of your life is playing out in front of you

Life, death, a prisonner of mortality
Time flies into the mouth of eternity

Crawling in the dirt
Reeling from the hurt
that just don't go away
Longing to be dead
The sickness in your head
torments you every day
Sorrow is your life,
her claws deep into you

Life, death, a prisonner of mortality
Time flies into the mouth of eternity
Into the heart
Into the lungs of God
Into the mouth of eternity

It's too late to turn back
But you can't move on
Your life'snot over
But your life is done

Mourning your former life
Memory is a knife
whose cut you cannot stand
Reckoning the cost
Everything you've lost brought on by
your own hand
This is the story of your...

Life, death, a prisonner of mortality
Time flies into the mouth of eternity
Into the heart
Into the lungs of God
Into the mouth of eternity
