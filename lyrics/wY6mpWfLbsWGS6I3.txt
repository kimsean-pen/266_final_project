inject

the rusty needles pierce my skin
submitting to it's suffering
the currency for pain is flesh
perverted rage corrupts you
brutal rape of innocence
cause when they come for you, there's no, there's no escape

rejected by the ones who loved you
for being tainted with a million sins, satan's whore
neglected by the system
a broken system which controls us all

finger rests on the trigger
submitting to insanity
there's nothing left of you inside this shell
eaten up by the underworld
reason dulled with alcohol
nothing but death can set you free from slavery

rejected by the ones who loved you
for being tainted with a million sins, satan's whore
neglected by the system
a broken system which absorbs our souls

withdrawal

succumbing to temptation, homicidal ecstasy
resistance to the poison has been obliterated
you're a lapdog, a puppet of their compulsive depravity
when finished, they feed the rats your carcass
narcotic buffet

so defiled, no one will recognize your mangled corpse
no one will recognize who you once were
nothing but blood and used syringes
and vicious stains of cum between your legs remain

fucking hypocrites
fighting to maintain all of their pride
fucking hypocrites
preaching superstition
religious minds, left you to rot, left you to die alone
