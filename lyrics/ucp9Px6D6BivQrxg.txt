My little alien, you picked me up
You put a problem inside my heart
It flies, you light up the sky
Oh, you got me high
You took the melancholy from my eyes
You light up the sky

When you go up, up, up, up
Up away
Take me by
I can't stay
Ran out of luck, luck, luck
Ran the race
Feel the smack, run away

My little alien, you picked me up
You put a problem inside my heart
It flies, you light up the sky
Oh, you got me high
You took the melancholy from my eyes
You light up the sky

Before I met you
The Earth was empty, flat
I took it all for granted
I don't want that
You're incandescent
Heart been let astray
You took me to the Milky way

My little alien, you picked me up
You put a problem inside my heart
It flies, you light up the sky
Oh, you got me high
You took the melancholy from

My little alien, you picked me up
You put a problem inside my heart
It flies, you light up the sky
Oh, you got me high
You took the melancholy from

My little alien, you picked me up
You put a problem inside my heart
It flies, you light up the sky
Oh, you got me high
You took the melancholy from my eyes
You light up the sky
