There's a window in my head.
There's a window in my heart.
I look out of them when I'm sleepy
and then I fall apart.
Things are crumbling outside of me
and they're crashing at my door.
There's a crest that keeps arriving.
I strip my face off of the mirror
and then I take another breath.
The animals are still screaming, dreaming
Screaming for a human's death
