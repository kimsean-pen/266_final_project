Something so benign from me
Construed as cruelty
Such a difference between
Who I am and who you see

Conclusions you come to of me
Routinely incorrect
I don't know who you're talking to
With such fucking disrespect
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing, do another
And argue that's not what you did

Your way's making me mental
How you filter askewed interpret?
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I am bound in a straitjacket

Talking with you's like
Talking to a sieve that can't hear me
You fight me tooth and nail
To disavow what's happening
Your resistance to a mirror
I feel screaming from your body
One day I'll introduce myself
And you'll see you've not yet met me

This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing, do another
And argue that's not what you did

Your way's making me mental
How you filter askewed interpret?
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I am bound in a straitjacket
Grand dissonance
The strings of my puppet are cut
The end of an era
Your dis-crediting's lost my consent
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing, do another
And argue that's not what you did
Your way's making me mental
How you filter askewed interpret?
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I am bound in a straitjacket
