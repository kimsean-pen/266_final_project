You use to step, fall manyfull
Amadelle with love
Sporting all control
You use to dress alotfullness
Amadelle with love
Eyes for wide interest

And I'm to blame for but once or more
And I'm to blame for the lost allure
With love it's aimless to make me move
You used to make me move

Bleach white beak
Your poor clown
Is that your crowd
Snow, white nose
Your poor clown
Is that your crowd

You use to lean them very muchly
Amadelle with love
Type of swing does she
You used to twirl far moreable
Amadelle with love
Influence and spell

And I'm to blame for but once or more
And I'm toblame for the lost allure
With love it's aimless to make me move
You used to make me move

Bleach white beak
Your poor clown
Is that your crowd
Snow, white nose
Your poor clown
Is that your crowd

Do you even know who I am love?
Well that's because my shoes are tied
Now it's a who and it's a hem, love?
Well that's because my shoes are tied
Now it's a who and it's a hem, love?
A rumor too profuse for lies
