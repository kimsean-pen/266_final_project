I saw you, in a way
Beyond figure out
These lines of life have been drawn and can't be removed
Our eyes is all it took to know

Open up your eyes
Deep blue, glassy lake
and swim 'til water and sky
Now are one, out of two
Oh, my bloodshot eyes

Open up your mouth
Touch your lips to mine
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death and survive
Your words have branded my mind

Still I hold your hand
Wrapped as if a ring
We of flesh and blood are only carrying
It's so hard to
Well, you know

The seed waits for the reaper to sow
Every breath an art
The dignity to learn it can strain and break your heart
Take all your pieces home
You ask when you're alone, "What is love?"
The blood is love
