Concrete dream
Hey!
I'm gonna make a scene radio
Caught burning gasoline, sleeping in reverse
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

Bombs away
Hey!
It's just another day
And I don't tread
The secret of the day
I wouldn't sweat it
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

Im bouncing off the walls!
Alright

Concrete kiss
Hey!
Come on and do the twist radio
My little exorcist, we're all getting pissed
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

'cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

(Hey, Hey!)

'cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

(Hey, Hey!)
