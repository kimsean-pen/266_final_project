I will tell your story if you die
I will tell your story and keep you alive
The best I can
I will tell them to the children
If we have some, if we have some
But I've always felt a feeling we would die young
Some die young
Some die young

Some, some die young
But you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together

Some die young
But you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young

I will tell you a story if you try
But how long will your thoughts of valleys stay green
When the world you were born in changes with seasons
Will you run with this dream or will you run alone
Or will you run against and finally reveal
Why some die young
Why some die young

Why some die, some die young
But you better hold on (you better hold on)
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together

Some die young
But you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go (don't let me go)
And we said we would die (you said we would die) together

Some die young (but you better hold on)
But you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young
Some die young
