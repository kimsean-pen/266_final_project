Go, run away in distress
Try to hide from what's creeping and crawling and stabbing within
Try to deny the turmoil inside
If you fight yourself hard enough you'll never win any ounce of serenity
Or a calm hope at best (or a calm hope at best)
Can leave you heaving on the floor
Gasping for breath (Are you gasping for breath?)
To be left on the floor gasping for breath

You're either the person you are
Or the person you're trying, trying, trying, trying to be
Don't let the outside sway too far from where you want to be

And at any cruel moments notice
You can ruin the best
As your body is brutally pressed
Against the confines of your tense flesh
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the bad can get in (bad can get in)
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the light can get in (the light can get in)
The light can't get in, the light can't get in

(Boom) You scream as the light hits you
It radiates throughout your whole soul
(Boom) The pain is clarity
It cleanses, and if it still fucking hurts then you still fucking know
That you are still alive
That you are still in control, if you would only take hold
(Boom) The day with both hands
A death-grip and a good chance to outlive your past
Are you living free?
Are you living free?

You're either the person you are
Or the person you're trying, trying, trying, trying to be
Don't let the outside sway too far from where you want to be
You're either the person you are
You're either the person you are
Or the person you're trying, trying, trying, trying to be
Don't let the outside sway too far from where you want to be
