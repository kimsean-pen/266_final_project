It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is won
No colour or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag, no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're fallin' on deaf ears again

Out
In the fields
Out
In the fields
Out
In the fields
Out
In the fields

Out in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away
