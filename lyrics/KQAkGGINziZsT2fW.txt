Like a sucker in the void
A coyote, no path
Like a sucker in the void
All future, no past
Like a sucker in the void
A wolf with no pack
Like a sucker in the void
No going back, no going back

And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
To nowhere now, nowhere now
To, to be found, to be found
On the lone mile

Blind like a plane
Wrapped up in a cloud
Choking on that smoke
Drowning in that sound
Like a sucker in the void
No place to call home
Like a sucker in the void
No one to return

And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
And I'm on my own
To nowhere now, nowhere now
To, to be found, to be found
On the lone mile
On the lone mile
On the lone mile
On the lone mile
