It's a cold and crazy world that's raging outside
Well baby, me and all my girls are bringing on the fire
Show a little leg, got to shimmy your chest
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's burlesque

E-X-P-R-E-S-S
Love, sex, ladies, no regrets
E-X-P-R-E-S-S
Love, sex, ladies, no regrets

Been holding down for quite some time
And finally the moment's right
I love to make the people stare
They know I got that certain savoir-faire

Fasten up, can you imagine what would happen
If I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy, you'll never wanna leave
Baby, that's guaranteed, why?

It's a passion and emotion
It's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move you, going through you
Do what I do, burlesque

All ladies come to flaunt it
Boys, throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it?
It's burlesque, burlesque, burlesque

I tease 'em 'til they're on the edge
They screaming more for more and more they beg
I know it's me they come to see
My pleasure brings them to their knees

Fasten up, can you imagine what would happen
If I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy, you'll never wanna leave
Baby, that's guaranteed, why?

It's a passion and emotion
It's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move you, going through you
Do what I do, burlesque

All ladies come to flaunt it
Boys, throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it?
It's burlesque, burlesque, burlesque
Burlesque, burlesque, burlesque, burlesque

It's a passion and emotion
It's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move you, going through you
Do what I do, burlesque

All ladies come to flaunt it
Boys, throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it?
It's burlesque, burlesque, burlesque
Burlesque, burlesque, burlesque, burlesque
