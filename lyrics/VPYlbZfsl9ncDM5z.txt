There's a drawbridge in the distance
That's where my goal lies
If I slay the wretches
And the stretchers in my path

Arise, arise, keep up appearances
Arise, arise, keep up appearances

I only know that
I was born in prison
Without a penny to my name
When I first came to this country
Had to learn to know my place
Here is Gruesome Castle
Leaning on Filth Hill
Carpets covered with ash
And all your tables bare

Arise, arise, keep up appearances
Arise, arise, keep up appearances

I can show you where my mister leads to
I can show you where my mister leads to

Arise, arise, keep up appearances
Arise, arise, keep up appearances
