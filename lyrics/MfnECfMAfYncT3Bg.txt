Me and my girls napping them picks, like
Boys in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Me and my girls making them trip, like animals
Boys in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow

Feel the [?] is tonight tonight, we break up the rules, okay?
Livin' la vida, we gonna live it
Time to let down our hair
Up up away like a airplane, climbing without a stair
'Cause we are the leaders tonight, tonight you'll never forget our name

Like a million drones
We're dancing

Me and my girls napping them picks, like
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Me and my girls making them trip, like animals
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow

Rolling your speakers, we are the dreamers taking over the floor
We rule the world now, I don't suppose yeah, we came to give you more
Pull up, pull up, and we take over
Better get out, get out our way
All in your speakers, we are the dreamers, we got a lot to say

Like a million drones
We're dancing

Me and my girls napping them picks, like
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Me and my girls making them trip, like animals
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow

Girls, you ready?
Girls, you ready?
Girls, you ready?
Girls, you ready?

Me and my girls napping them picks, like
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Me and my girls making them trip, like animals
Poise in our heels, we so high
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow
Make the trumpets blow
