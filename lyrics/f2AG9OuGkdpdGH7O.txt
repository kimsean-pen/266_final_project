Laying here in your arms
And you hold me tight, tight
Trying not to watch the clock
Tick, tickin' as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishin' I could make you stay
Stay with me for a while

Though your near
Still I want to make it clear
Love, I will always be around

Your leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

Kind of hard for me to let you know
Seldom let my feelings show
How much I will missin' you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak
Without you baby I'm not me

Though your near
Still I want to make it clear
Love, I will always be around

Your leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye
I feel it, already
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye

Your leaving, I'm waiting
Forgive me
I'm always missing you
Before the goodbye...
