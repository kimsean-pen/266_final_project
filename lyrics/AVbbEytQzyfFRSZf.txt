Someday I'll find you
I'll meet you, complete you
Someday I'll dig out my eyes
It's all a painting, a brand new Mercedes
Crashing and burning alive

Today we swam out where the sun hit the horizon
But I kept your head under a tide
It's all compassion, distractions from my actions
Too late I'll never realize, realize

I'm always gonna miss you
I'm always gonna feel you
In everything that I do, I do
To never be with you, oh I miss you so
If only I could see you
I'd tell you that I love you, I do
Someday I'll be with you
Oh, I love you so
