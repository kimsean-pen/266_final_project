Under the autumn tree
The chair where you would swing
A yard so full of leaves
Hum the song that comforts me

A man that resembles me
Watching his young lady sleep
Now i'm off to dream
It's the only ease that comforts me

Is this my old shape, my mind is away,
How long have you been gone
The cold winter aged the soft of your face
And i cant move on

Market morning sun
Fish from an early hunt
I wait but you're gone
Mind tells the heart to linger on

Is this my old shape, my mind is away,
How long have you been gone
The cold winter aged the soft of your face
And i cant move on

Linger on
Linger on
I cant move on
