multinational death camp, and abattoir of greed
and you support the industry from the corpse on which you feed.
A legacy of suffering from a business built on pain
a history of butchery and I hold you to blame
you uphold the slaughter when you support the cause
a tradition wrapped in bloodshed and it's no one's fault but yours.
