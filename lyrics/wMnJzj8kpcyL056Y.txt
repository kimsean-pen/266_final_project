A side of temperance, an appetite for excess
I'm burning down like your cigarette.

(You had me cornered) You had me at goodbye
(I lived to watch you) I loved to see you slip away
(I enjoyed captivity) Starring at a car crash
We kill at weddings and life for funerals.
We're taking steps on the water just to show.
We do whatever we want to.

How
Did I forget who I was
Did I forget just where I came from

Did I just lose who I am
This is the line I stand
A feast of apathy, a shot of angst.
(I brought you to safety)
I carried you away.
(Taking all your blame)

I dropped you in the gutter
(Hid you and protected)
Just to watch you scream.
We save with violence and lie with eloquence.
We're turning wine into water with abhorrence.
We'll save whoever we want to.

How
Did I forget who I was
Did I forget just where I came from

Did I just lose who I am
This is the fine line I stand
I'm not so confident
I'm gonna be the one
Who takes the next step.

I'm a cyclone, passion overblown
Tied to the tides that pull me in the undertow.
Where the wind blows
Is where my body's thrown
And I can't fight it

Maybe we should walk away from this.
Take our proverbial walk into the sunset.
Maybe we are destined to be different.

We were designed for more resilience than this...
But we don't know how and we live in the now.
If we were smarter maybe we would try to fake it.
Maybe we should walk away from this.
And stop being ourselves.
Just stop being yourself
If you want to be happy.
How
Did I forget who I was
Did I forget just where I came from
Did I just lose who I am
This is the fine line I stand
Amid the roar.
This is the fine line I stand
Amid the roar.
This is the fine line I...
