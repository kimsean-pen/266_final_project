I wuv' Trippie Redd
Aye, it was always a, uh, a fucking goal to uh, give all these niggas hell know what I'm sayin'
A love letter to you, two
Ooh, for your boo
Baby wish me well

Baby wish me well (Wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (Well)
To give em' hell, and you know that I live in hell (Hell)
A livin' hell, I'm hell boy, livin' hell

I let the money dance, the diamonds bling's all by itself
Without any help, so that means it shine on it's own
Without any gold, I've been a king without any throne
It's time to take your ass to school, ain't no place, like, home
I'm 1400 with the screw up kid's, don't screw up kid
Or that choppa wet your crew up kid, I'm two up kid
We animals, better zoo up kid
I'm from Canton but the whole country where I blew up big
Who knew us kid, I think I came from under a rock
Was out on the block, my cousin had that shit in his sock
He movin' the work, your bitch all over my cock
I put dick in her mouth, like the whole mother of bombs
And I ain't talkin' Donald Trump, but I'll take Donald out the trunk
And let Donald's ass bust if you keep talkin' down on gang
I just pulled up in a lamb, cuzzo pulled up in a range
And we reloadin' them sticks lil' nigga, we release them things

Hold up, give em' hell, give em' hell
I been on the road wish me well, wish me well
Give em' hell, give em' hell
I been on the road wish me well, wish me well

Baby wish me well (Wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (Well)
To give em' hell, and you know that I live in hell (Hell)
A livin' hell, I'm hell boy, livin' hell
Baby wish me well (Wish me well)
It's all a dream just like a wishing well (Well)
To give em' hell, and you know that I live in hell (Hell)
A livin' hell, I'm hell boy, livin' hell

Baby, wish me well
Baby, wish me well
Baby, wish me well
Ooh, I was like sayonara to you
Ooh, I was like wish me well lil' boo
Ooh, I dropped a love letter to you
Yeah, and gave you another one lil' boo
Yeah, sayonara to you
Ooh, sayin' wish me well lil' boo
Yeah, screamin' wish me well lil' boo
Bitch
