Another morning with the drape down turns to an afternoon
Of doing nothing like I'm getting fucking paid to
Why can't I leave?
What is keeping me?
Do you miss me?
I miss everything
A constant search for something more
Staring at the ceiling while face down on the floor
I'm not one for Reno but I could sure some warmth
I don't know

Save me
I'm calling out to you
But you won't hear me
Too wasted to earn some of your time
I'm not the type to admit I'm not alright
"Be strong, you're fine"
It's all a lie

And then it rained
It washed away all the pain that I've been feeling as of late
Evaporate, condensate, evaporate
'Cause I'm working for this money I don't get to keep
And I buy a fucking bed where I don't get to sleep
Do you ever get this feeling?
I know you get this feeling

Save me
I'm calling out to you
But you won't hear me
Too wasted to earn some of your time
I'm not the type to admit I'm not alright
"Be strong. You're fine"
It's all a lie

Save me
I wonder wherever the world will take me
In the end, I know I'm not the only one who feels alone
I'm not the only one
I'm so alive

Will this end?
Another day on the mend
Will this end?
Will it end, will it end, will it end, will it end, will it end?

Save me
