Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day

Bury me above the clouds
All the way from here
Take away the things I need
Take away my fear
Hide me in a hollow sound
Happy ever more
Everything I had to give
Gave out long before

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me blind, somebody should (Fix me now)
From hollow into light

Crashing silent, broken down
Falling into night
Who gave up and who gave in
I'll go without a fight
You cut me down or cut me dead
Cut me in or out
Kiss me blind time after time
Take away my doubt

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me blind, somebody should (Fix me now)
From hollow into light

Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day

Nowhere, only down from here
Pick me off the floor
Take away the things I dream
One time
One place
One more

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me now, somebody should (Fix me now)
From hollow into

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me now, somebody should
From hollow into light

Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day...

Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day...

Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day...

Things dont have to be this way
Catch me on a better day...
