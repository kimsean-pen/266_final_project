Your confiscating transmission
For liberty, no sympathy
Don't interfere with direct invitations
She's talking of communial love

Woo-wo, woo-wo
If you had what it takes
Well, you wouldn't be afraid
But you got no ID,
No identity
You got no ID,
No identity

Don't break your heart over me, baby
Your body falls, too unpredictable
But I'm dancing
The game is up -
Your contraceptives low

Woo-wo, woo-wo
If you had what it takes
Well, you wouldn't be afraid
But you got no ID,
No identity
You got no ID,
No identity

Woo-wo, woo-wo
If you had what it takes
Well, you wouldn't be afraid
But you got no ID,
No identity

You programme, love, insatiable crime
Imprisons me - in liberty
Your chauvinism's a sensuous smile
Transmission of commercial love

Woo-wo, woo-wo
If you had what it takes
Well, you wouldn't be afraid
But you got no ID,
No identity
You got no ID,
No identity
But you got no ID,
No identity!
But you got no ID,
No identity.
