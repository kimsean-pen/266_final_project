In a bottle of your lies
I was walking through the night
You carefully design
The words I give tonight
In the blink of an eye
It comes as no surprise

All that I see
Is all that I need
It's all you believe

What you need's the light
What you need's the light
What you need's the light
(I don't know what you'll find)
When there's nothing to hide

I'm waiting for a sign
'Cause now I'm in the blind
At the bottom of the high
It comes as no surprise

All that I see
Is all that I need
It's all you believe

What you need's the light
What you need's the light
There's nothing to hide

I know you need the light
I know you need the light
What you need's the light
(I don't know what you'll find)
And there's nothing to hide

What you need's the light (Nothing, nothing)
What you need's the light (Nothing, nothing)
What you need's the light (Nothing)
What you need's the light

What you need's the light
What you need's the light
What you need's the light
What you need's the light
