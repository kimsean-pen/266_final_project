Have you seen the seven oceans?
Or the snowcap of a mountaintop?
Or the Northern Lights set in motion?
Or a heartbeat slow to a stop?

Have you read a book by candlelight?
Or heard a leader's call to arms?
Have you ever felt my love burn so bright Like a fireball in your palm?

And all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
And all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry

Have you felt a revolution?
Do you ever sit to stop and pause Just to take a little moment
To see what's mine and yours?

And all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
And all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry

These are just lines of latitude
That we made up, drawn upon a map
We could be meeting with more demise
We could be woven and intertwined

And all the things that I've seen
You will always be part of my tapestry
And all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry
