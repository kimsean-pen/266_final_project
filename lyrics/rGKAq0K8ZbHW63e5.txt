Having washed my face in a frozen stream,
and having lived in guest rooms for the last 7 years,
and having just doubled in size, admitting animal loving,
I still
must
find
a way
how.
How do I live with the romance of the world?
How do I live with the romance: the lure of scenery?
How do I live with the romance of comfort and closed eyes?
How do I live with the romance?
and admit that this might be the world
where I belong.

How?
I'll sing my song in a parking lot.
