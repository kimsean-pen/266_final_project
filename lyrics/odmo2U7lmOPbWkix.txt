Don't hang me on another problem
I really don't give a fuck if you believe me
I can see that you were not the one to confide in
I cannot abide by you anymore

Can you shut down the funky vibe and (get)
The fuck up, yeah, better believe me
You aren't heard anymore
You weren't able to silence

Resorted to violence
I've seen it before
Now get your ass out the door...
Won't take shit anymore...

You think you know, but you're horribly blind
You think you know how this story's defined
You think you know that your heart has gone cold inside
Fine...

Get off me. You don't know where I've been
I'm all fucked up, Better believe me!
I didn't care anymore, I opened up the device
And I gave into vice with you, little whore

God damn this, no one could believe that
I am this monster you believe in
There's nothing left anymore
You were the one who decided

Our souls were divided
I've heard it before...
Won't take shit anymore...

You think you know, but you're horribly blind
You think you know how this story's defined
You think you know that your heart has gone cold inside
Fine...

You think you know, but it's all in your mind
You think you know just whose fate has been signed
You think you know just whose heart has gone cold this time
Mine...

Well you can blame yourself
And you just might be right
For there is nothing left
Do you think its time to say goodbye?

You think you know, but you're horribly blind
You think you know how this story's defined
You think you know that your heart has gone cold inside
Fine...

You think you know, but it's all in your mind
You think you know just whose fate has been signed
You think you know just whose heart has gone cold this time
Mine...
