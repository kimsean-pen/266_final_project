I saw YOU once again last night
through a sea of sullen faces
admiring eyes following
the path that the spotlight traces

eye to eye
and the miles still divide
eye to eye

what was it YOU saw last night
when YOU gave yourself to me
was it the thread of a common bond
or the touch of cold reality

eye to eye
and the miles still divide
we can move each other to tears
but we can't see
eye to eye
and the miles still divide
each of us alone in silence
when we meet
eye to eye

all we can really share
is the coldness we feel
and the silent memory
of the moment we met

eye to eye
and the miles still divide
we can move each other to tears
but we can't see
eye to eye
and the miles still divide
each of us alone in silence
when we meet
eye to eye
and the miles still divide
we can move each other to tears
but we can't see
eye to eye
