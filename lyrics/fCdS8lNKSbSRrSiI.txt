Hey, hey hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

One more time to the punks not dead
Go on land to the punks not dead
Old heads gone with the punks not dead
Animal toons I'ma punk your ass
Punks not dead is a rise to the rest
Punks not dead is a form of protest
Punks not dead is sign of the fear
Punks not dead is a sound of the year

Heard with a round
Maybe cuz I ain't got a punk hair
I don't really care what they do on radio
Punks not dead rock videos

Hey, punks not dead!
(Hey, hey!)
Punks not dead!
Hey, punks not dead!
(Hey, hey!)
Punks not dead!
(Punks not dead!)
No, punks not dead!
Motherfucker, punks not dead!

Old black hoodie with a white junkers
East punk dead with the white walkers
Punks not dead if you fillin' the bus
Punks not dead if you feel it in us
Punks not dead when we're just gettin' to the stop

One more time to the punks not dead
Go on land to the punks not dead
Old heads gone with the punks not dead
Animal toons I'ma punk your ass
I don't really care what they do on radio
Punks not dead rock videos

Hey, punks not dead!
(Hey, hey!)
Punks not dead!
Hey, punks not dead!
(Hey, hey!)
Punks not dead!
(Punks not dead!)
No, punks not dead!
Motherfucker, punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Punks not dead!
Motherfucker, punks not dead!
