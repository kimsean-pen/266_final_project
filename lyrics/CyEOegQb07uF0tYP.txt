One thing I've got to say, you better not trouble this man
My fears have gone away out of babylon
Cause I already Paid for the wrongs that i've done
so i can safely say I a Rasta son

On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock regg-ae music, playing sweet in heaven
On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock reggae music playing sweet in heaven
The foolish man built up his house upon the sand
but Rastaman built up his temple on a firm foundation
he who knows, knows you better know your self
don't sit aside and criticize, go on and help your self

On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock regg-ae music, playing sweet in heaven
On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock reggae music playing sweet in heaven
Guitar solo
x 4
On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock regg-ae music, playing sweet in heaven
On Judgement Day i'll be playing music for the rebels
Roots rock reggae music playing sweet in heaven
