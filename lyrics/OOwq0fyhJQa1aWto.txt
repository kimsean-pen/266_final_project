If I had one single wish
I'd go back to the moment I kissed
You goodbye, no matter how hard I try
I can't live without you in my life

Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
But baby I can't let you go

I walk around trying to understand!
Where we went wrong and I can't pretend
It wasn't me and it wasn't you
But I'm convinced we gave up too soon

Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
But baby I can't let you go

Nothing left to lose after losing you
There's nothing I can't take
When I run to you, when I come for you
Don't tell me I'm too late

Maybe you'll say you still want me
Maybe you'll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
But baby I can't let you go

No, no, no can't let you go
No, can't let you go
No, can't let you go
No, can't let you go
