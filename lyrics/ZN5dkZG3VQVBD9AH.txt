Farewell my room of lies, Have you gone at last?
I'm lost not paralysed, I may never come back.
There's no answer in the air, Why the lightning struck.
You should have known I would not care, Every diamond's cut, from the dirt.
So I lie alone, And risk each night, I long to let you in.
But there's a life I lost, Drifted out, before
You let me in.
I wrote to you in red, Where the sailors dock.
And from here I have not left, You've become my lock.
Still the boatman never came, Why I cannot guess.
Don't you know it's all the same?
Every myth cheats death, Just the same.
So I lie alone, And risk each night, I long to let you in.
But there's a life I lost, Drifted out, before You let me in.
