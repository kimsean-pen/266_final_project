What I have in me
In my mind is you
I would die if we were through
What I'm feeling now
What I'm having is true
I am lost in pain without you
So cold
So alone

All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you

Now I can't make it through

All the nights I've prayed
Must this all be untrue
I am not prepared to be strong
I just can't believe
I am losing you
Not prepared to carry on
What you see and walk away

So cold
So alone

All I have is you

It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through

I am losing you, forever
I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground, forever (forever)

Distant so far
Destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong
Life is disconnecting me
No
Loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days
You were there
Protecting me
So cold
So alone
All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through
I am losing you, forever
I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground, forever (forever)
All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through
It is all that I'm breathing for
(Breathing for, Breathing for...)
