Save me
From the world
Oh, save me
From your Hell
Oh, save me
From the kindness that will
Save me
From myself

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

I could say
There is no-one there
I could say
That my life is shattered
I could say
That I almost care
I could say
That it almost matters
But I don't know

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Save me
From a life of meaning
Save me
From a death with feeling
Save me
From all those offended
Save me
From what God intended
For me

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
