Undeniable, this shit unrivaled
Better get a rubber cause this should be going viral
High roll, bipolar like Biffy Clyro
I know, I'll burn it to the ground like I'm a pyro

We're banging loud
Our time is now
We're banging loud
We come to wow

Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you
Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you

My Mic maniacal, waxing shit like vinyl

Kamikaze styling, tendencies are suicidal
Primal, hard rhymes while yours are vaginal
We should start a riot, but what the fuck do know?

We're banging loud
Our time is now
We're banging loud
We come to wow

Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you
Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you

Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you

Oh
Don't let it go go go away
Don't it fade fade fade away
I won't let you down
I won't let you
Don't you ever let it go go go away
Don't you ever let it fade fade fade away
Don't you know that I will never let you down
I won't let you
