Just for asking peace
That I ought to be owed

And that's the rent I'm paying
Just like my brother would say it

Out amongst the stars and the stones
Every kinda fortune gets old
Every kinda line is gonna come back to me
Just as I go

And that's the rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay
Rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay

I been losing sleep
And I'm nodding sleep
That I wish that I know'd

Mmmm and I lost all my tapes
Of back masking peace
Just for asking peace
That I ought' a be owed

And that's the rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay

Rent I pay
Like my brother say
That's the rent I pay

Everybody knows just where you been going
Everybody knows the faces you been showing
And if that's your answer no I ain't your dancer
And if that's your answer no I ain't your dancer
