She weaves a dreaming darkness
Upon a still and muted loom
And from it falls such shadows
The Waking world could never know

I dream to awaken
I awaken to dream
I dream to awaken
To form about me
A place of adumbrations
Vestiges arising from the dark of consciousness

It is night
It is night
The night without stars
The night outside of time

Oh, place of desolation
Which I have fathered

I have been here so many times before
And dire circumstance
Which I have engendered
Again and again

A sword of lucidity
I strike into the heart of this place
As a nail to the soil

I affix a moment in timeless time
To awaken my dreaming will
To open the dreaming eye

Cast off soporic bails
Brought forth from ivory gates

Awaken
Awaken
Awaken
In dreams

Awaken
Awaken
Awaken
In dreams

Awaken in dreams

That I may arise above the sea of oneiric darkness
And walk upon its waters

To commune
To commune
To commune

Awaken in dreams

That I may arise above the sea of oneiric darkness
And walk upon its waters

To commune
To commune
To commune
