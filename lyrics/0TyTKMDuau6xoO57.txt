And anything against the right kind of light looks blessed
But all the early evening shadows couldn't disguise this unrest
And the nights in depth are infinite as always
But the days in length are only ever days

So, we take to the waves
And we swallow the salt
And our bodies do swell
But our shadows stay sharp
Still the silence is soft
When the sentences stops

And you were aglow, and I was alone, and so overwhelmed
And were we really leaving shadows hidden behind our past selves
You were so unwell, with arms outstretched whe whole way
But the long limbs fell, in falling found their place
And then at the end of the eleventh day
Elevated only by the grace of an airplane
I became aware of a change

And I slept through the night first
Lighter than a leaf upon a pool of water
Where I sunk like a boulder
Blurry was the line between the deep and deeper
Then I landed on my cold floor
Heavy in the hallway of a house familiar
So I bolted out the back door

Kicked the silver key beneath a mound of black dirt
Then you took me on a long drive
Eyes were all alight and on the road so injured
And you parked us on an incline climbing
Out the window with the words I'd whispered
Holier eyes couldn't hold you away from the light
Holier arms couldnt't hold all the darkness you hide
