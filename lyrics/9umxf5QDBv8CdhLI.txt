Feelings, flash cards
Fake knife, real ketchup
Cardboard cutthroats
Cowboys of information
Pleasure dot loathing dot Huey dot Newton
Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter

Fuckless porn sharks
Toothless, but got a big bark
Live children, blind psychics
Turned online assassins
So Hale-Bopp, Hail Mary, hail Hagia Sophia
Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter

Entombed in a shrine of zeros and ones
You know, you know
Oh, with fatherless features, you motherless creatures you know
Oh, in perpetual night, oh it's terribly frightening
You know, you know
Oh, you got the pop and the hiss in the city of misfits you know
Safe safe and safest, faith for the faithless
Oh, dim dim and dimmer, sucker for sinners

I'm entombed in a shrine of zeros and ones
You know, you know
Oh, with fatherless features, you motherless creatures you know
Oh, in perpetual night, oh it's terribly frightening
You know, you know
You got the pop and the hiss in the city of misfits
Oh, safe safe and safest, faith for the faithless
