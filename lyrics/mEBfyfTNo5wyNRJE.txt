It's not every day we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times, too
So have a little faith in what you do

'Cause you don't seem to realize
The things you've got to face in life
Today you're up, tomorrow you're down
So thank God that you're still around town
Whoa, my brother

Though we have got to work like slaves
Just to eat a piece of bread
But as we go along each day
We'll find happiness to soothe our mind

'Cause it's not every day we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times, too
So have a little faith in what you do, oh yeah

Did you get me, yeah
I want you to understand, yeah things in life
