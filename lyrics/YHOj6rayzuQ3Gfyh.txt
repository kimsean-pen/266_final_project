I was afraid to be me
Be anything you want to be
I don't blame my week
For my not being able to speak
Clearly about things I've said before
And if it's light outside night will fall
And if it's life it resolves
Everywhere you are in a maze is a lie
Anywhere you are on a page you still go to the right
Anytime there's no ground below you you're in the sky
Anytime you're afraid it's gonna be alright
I was a flame in the night
I heard what I wanted to hear
And the moment I disappeared
I grew the size of all outside
Cuz I became one with the night
And if it's real it's not all there is
There's alot in what appears not to be there at all
And you can function as someone besides who you are
