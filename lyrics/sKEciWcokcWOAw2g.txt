(Jonas Renkse:)
Once a world, endless and free
Horizons unbroken
Now a world of bounded frontiers
The elders have spoken... Our home

(Daniel Gildenlöw:)
Once a world, eternal and blue
Floating, escaping
Now a world that's blinding my view
Shadows shaping... Alone

(Magali Luyten:)
Liquid eternity crosses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains
Liquid eternity, a world that does not live
Liquid eternity, a life that does not yield

(Bob Catley:)
Once a world of fear and dismay
Of fleeing and hiding
Now a world that's peaceful and safe
So caring and providing our home...

(Magali Luyten:)
Liquid eternity crosses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains
Liquid eternity, a world that does not live
Liquid eternity, a life that does not yield

(Tom Englund:)
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've learned to dread?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?

(Jonas Renkse:) Our home

(Jørn Lande:) I'm losing my reason to live. The essence of life
(Floor Jansen:) But the system's got so much to give or would you rather die?
(Jørn Lande:) I'm losing my pride and my joy, my will to believe
(Floor Jansen:) Why would you come back and destroy all we have achieved?

(Magali Luyten:)
Liquid eternity crosses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains
Liquid eternity, a world that does not live
Liquid eternity, a life that does not yield

(Tom Englund:)
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've loved to play?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?

(Magali Luyten:)
Liquid eternity crosses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains

(Tom Englund:)
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've learned to dread?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?

(Jonas Renkse:) Our home
