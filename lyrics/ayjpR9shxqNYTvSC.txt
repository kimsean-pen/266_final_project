I don't know if I'm sure
Don't know if I'm sure
I came through the front door
Looking for my passport
I'm going drinking
I'm going drinking

And I don't see a stop sign
So I'll be fine
Got to think quick
Got to look right
I'm going drinking
I'm going drinking

And I'm falling apart
In the back of your car
And I lost all my money
When I paid for your heart
And I'm moving my feet
From the passenger seat
And I said something funny
And then walked down the street
Goodbye
To the good life
Tonight

So I'm walking with my head down
Turn my phone round
Just to see you
On the background
I'm overthinking
I'm overthinking

And I'm looking for a way to
Replace you
So I keep on
And push through
I'm going drinking
I'm going drinking

And I'm falling apart
In the back of your car
And I lost all my money
When I paid for your heart
And I'm moving my feet
From the passenger seat
And I said something funny
And then walked down the street
Goodbye
To the good life
Tonight

And I'm falling apart
In the back of your car
And I lost all my money
When I paid for your heart
Goodbye
To the good life
Tonight
Goodbye
To the good life
Tonight

Goodbye
To the good life
Tonight
