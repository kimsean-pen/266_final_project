Like a stone I'll go down
I'm too far to be found
Got no place for the storm
all the love that I found couldn't turn me around
drift away all alone

Don't say this is the end
I think I'm lost again
thank you for your patience the time that you gave me
think I never knew you were trying to save me
free me from the shadow the light on my shoulder
please don't say it's over, it's over, it's over

I confess I was weak
got my heart full of greed
Wanted more than I need

I'm standing on the edge
afraid of emptiness
don't leave me I'm begging you my friend
thank you for your patience the time that you gave me
think I never knew you were trying to save me
free me from the shadow the light on my shoulder
please don't say it's over, it's over, it's over

Don't say that it's the end
I think I'm lost again
I'm standing at the end
don't leave me im beginng you my friend
save me once again
would you save me once again?
would you save me once again?
