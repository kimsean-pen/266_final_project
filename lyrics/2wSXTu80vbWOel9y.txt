My boyfriend said to me he'd be gone for a little while,
To me.
And he's been gone for long, but it doesn't make me blue,
No.
I still love him so, because every night I know.

He's calling his love to me,
Love to me, hello, baby.
Love to me, I don't feel down,
Because he's calling now, calling now.

The boy is fine.
Is my love on the line.

Though it feels like he left in many, many, too.
I don't fool around, I'll always be true.
When he's on the phone I don't ever feel alone.

He's calling his love to me,
Love to me, hello, baby.
Love to me, I don't feel down,
Because he's calling now, calling now.

The boy is fine.
Is my love on the line.

Hey, hello, girl.
Hey, hello, girl.

He's calling his love to me,
Love to me, hello, baby.
Love to me, I don't feel down,
Because he's calling now, calling now.

The boy is fine.
Is my love on the line.

He's calling his love to me,
Love to me, hello, baby.
Love to me, I don't feel down,
Because he's calling now.
