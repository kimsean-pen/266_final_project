Don't tell me how i had a vison
That this day would come to be
Call it luck, call it intuition
Here I am (here we are), isn't that enough
For a little bit of reality
Fate is good, fate can be real
If you believe it's what you feel

Oh, what a moment
When i looked into you eyes
I knew i got the prize
Oh, baby, what a sweet surprise

It only took a minute, to let you in my life
It only took a minute, for me to realize
It only took a minute, and i knew just what to do
It only to a minute to fall in love with you

Time and time again, boy I've always been
The only one who think things through
You got a hold on me, set me free
Who would've known that out of the blue

I discovered the magic of all my dreams that night
With just one look at you
I knew that everything would be all right

It only took a minute, to let you in my life
It only took a minute, for me to realize
It only took a minute, and i knew just what to do
It only to a minute to fall in love with you

Here I am, isn't that a vision
Here I am, isn't that a vision

Oh, what a moment
When i looked into you eyes
I knew i got the prize
Oh, baby, what a sweet surprise

It only took a minute, to let you in my life
It only took a minute, for me to realize
It only took a minute, and i knew just what to do
It only to a minute to fall in love with you
