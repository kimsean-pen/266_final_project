Finally can see it
I've landed on the ground
Look at all the peace I've found
Better in the mornings
I appreciate the sound
Birds sat in the garden now

If somebody had told me
Then what I know now
I would not have listened
I wouldn't have known how
Would have burned down all the bridges
Put up walls around everything I needed
So nothing could be found

Now I know what I'm praying for
Not to waste anytime like I wasted before
Now I know what I'm staying for
No more

Now I know what I'm praying for
Not to waste anytime like I wasted before
Now I know what I'm staying for
No more

Now I know what I'm praying for
Not to waste anytime like I wasted before
Now I know what I'm staying for
No more
