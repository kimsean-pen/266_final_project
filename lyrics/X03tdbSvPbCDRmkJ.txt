Maha Kali, dark mother dance for me
Let the purity of your nakedness awaken me
Yours are the fires of deliverance which shall bring me bliss
Yours is the cruel sword which shall set my spirit free

Devourer of life and death who rule beyond time
In thy name I shall fullfil my destiny divine
Maha Kali, formless one, destroyer of illusion
Your songs forever sung, the tunes of dissolution

Kalika, black tongue of fire, embrace me
Make me one with your power for all eternity
Awaken within me the reflection of your flame
Kiss me with your bloody lips and drive me insane

Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Make me one with your power for all eternity
Maha Kali come to me

Smashana Kali, I burn myself for thee
I cut my own throat in obscene ecstasy
I make love to abominations, embrace pain and misery
Until my heart becomes the burning ground and Kali comes to me

Oh dark mother, hear me calling thee
Mahapralaya, bring to me
Through all illusions I shall see
I shall cremate this world and set my essence free

Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Without fear I will dance with death and misery
Maha Kali, come to me

Oh Kali, thou art fond of cremation grounds
So I have turned my heart into one, that thou may dance there unceasingly.
Oh mother, I have no other fond desire in my heart.
Fire of a funeral pyre is burning there.
Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika

Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika
Kali Mata, namo nama
Kali Mata, namo nama
Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika
Jai Maha Kali, Jai Ma Kalika
Kali Mata, namo nama
Kali Mata, namo nama
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
At your left hand for endless victory
Maha Kali, come to me
Jai Kalika! Jai Kali!
Mahapralaya will set our spirits free
Maha Kali, come to me
