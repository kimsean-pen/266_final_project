My cold Marigolds attack
My back, a bed of roses
I'm gonna bring my back
With hypnosis

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't been the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I recall on the telephone
I recall when you get mad
I still love you to death
I won't ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't been the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I'm on the other side
I'm satisfied
Oh, I'm a spirit dove
I'm looking for your love

I'm simple as a matter of fact
Punch in the nose, don't over-react
But I'll still love you to death
And I won't ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't been the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

And I know that I won't be the one
To secure that I know when it's wrong
But I hope when I know it's passed
And I hope I'll know when to show you my

Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love

Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love

Ever forget how
