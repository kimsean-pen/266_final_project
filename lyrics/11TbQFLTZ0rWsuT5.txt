Morning, wake up, cold mountain air
Sunrise outlines curls in your hair
Sweet dreams, your face, still half asleep
You stay up late with or without me

The older we get there's an ocean
Of people in places we've chosen
And you know how mama keeps saying
We've gotta stop the games we're playing

Sweet hunnie pie, this ain't goodbye
It's not over
Come on and close your eyes
What's it gonna take to feel my love?
What's it gonna take to feel my love?

Street lights fall down, tremble in your stare
You'll be clean of Washington Square
When you're alone, lying in your bed
Think about those mountains and everything I've said

The older we get there's an ocean
Of people in places we've chosen
And you know how mama keeps saying
We've gotta stop the games we're playing

Sweet hunnie pie, this ain't goodbye
It's not over
Come on and close your eyes
What's it gonna take to feel my love?
What's it gonna take to feel my love?

You see the moon, I see the sun
Your day is gone, mine's just begun
Our time is more than a day
I can't forget with you on my mind
The moment we started to live separate lives
Our love is more than a day

Sweet hunnie pie, this ain't goodbye
It's not over
Come on and close your eyes
What's it gonna take to feel my love?
What's it gonna take to feel my love?
