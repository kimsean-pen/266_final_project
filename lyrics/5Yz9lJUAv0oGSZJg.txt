You see anything you could be
But you don't feel anything
You hold on us sometimes
Can't help It all
In a city that dies
You swep from my mind
???
I will step from your mind
Give It back, tomorrow???
But you doesn't need a thing
You smile and???
Telling goodbye
Doesn't do anything
Doesn't do anything
It doesn't do anything
Doesn't do anything
