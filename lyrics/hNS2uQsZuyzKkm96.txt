The more I teach it, the less I can
Quick out the gates but slower out the pinecone
I took the fish out of the sea
Burnt down our house and asked the queen around for tea

River to valley, coast to coast, and cheek to cheek
Wherever I go, there I am, sat next to me

I wanna love you but it hurts, hurts, hurts
I wanna stay here but the time slips away from me
I wanna stay here in this curse, curse, curse
Black flamingo, black flamingo

Up with the drawbridge, but down the hatch
The thoughts I juggle are made out of glass, oh
Always a pleasure, never a chore
We break our legs and then hit the dancefloor

And it takes it out of me
Wherever I go, there I am indefinitely

We took a backflip and we landed on our teeth
Oh, black flamingo, oh, black flamingo

Give me a leg, give me a leg, give me a leg
Give me a leg to stand on, stand on

Give me a leg, give me a leg, give me a leg
Give me a leg to stand on, stand on

Give me a leg, give me a leg, give me a leg
Give me a leg to stand on, stand on

Give me a leg, give me a leg, give me a leg
Give me a leg to stand on, stand on

I wanna love you but it hurts, hurts, hurts
I wanna stay here but the time slips away from me
I wanna stay here in this curse, curse, curse
Black flamingo, black flamingo
