When the last light

Burns out in your dense skull
I'll inhale the smoke

That comes from your burnt bones

Unrecognizable

Buried along the highway
Though time may separate us

My disgust will stay as golden as the sun

My regret will burn bright

Like the lump of shame that grows in your throat
My will is a cancer on your fucking life
Undying incurable and full of sick

As long as the blood pumps through our fucking veins
The thought of me will sicken you

And I will fucking hate you
My will is a cancer on your fucking life
