This hole is getting deeper by the day
Digging for the words to say
So I can put things in perspective.
Somewhere along the line I lost my way
Everything gets torn and frayed
You can put me in my place but I'll never know where I stand.
I'll never know where I stand.
And in the end we're all just learning curves
And trampled nerves with a purpose to serve
But you'll never get what I meant when I said
"You were mine to adore, I was yours to regret".
