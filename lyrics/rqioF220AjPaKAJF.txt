We're all alone watching shadows on the ceiling
I've gone numb but I can't forget the feeling
And I don't even know if I can close my eyes
Don't want to sleep cause I'm wide and awake and dreaming
Hold me close and catch your breath now
I promise not to leave this bed yet

Cause I feel alive
I feel alive
Cause I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I finally feel alive

I'm lying here whispering the sweetest nothing
I feel your heart beating faster than you're breathing
And I don't even know if I can close my eyes
Don't want to sleep cause I'm wide awake and dreaming
Hold me close and catch your breath now
I promise not to leave this bed yet

Cause I feel alive
I feel alive
Cause I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)

There's a time and a place for you to say what's next
So tell all of the things you dream but never get
There's a time and a place for you to hold your breath
So tell me all of the things you thought but never said

Cause I feel alive
I feel alive
Cause I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I feel alive (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I finally feel alive
I finally feel alive
I finally feel alive
