Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
So please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mama, let me go

Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love
La de da, la de da
No, Mama, let me go

No, no, no

I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were a protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time it was terrible
No, Mama, let me go

No, no, no
