You're something special
Want you to know you are
Your makers must have kissed in cosmic dust
You're something special
You've got to know its true
Could have been anything but right you're you
You're something special
You've got to shout it out
If there are doubts then we will groove it out
You're something special
You are the little fang
You keep on grinning
And this world keeps nagging

And if ever starts to feel bad little fang
It's easy to explain cuz this world's not tame
And if it ever starts to feel sad little fang
Remember that your gifts are your game
And if it ever starts to pour down little fang
The melody sings what the words can't say
But they might laugh and they might be scared
Of the one little fang with the trikes in her hair
With the spikes in her hair
With the trikes in her hair

Hey mrs. creepy head
Hey mr. fuzzy face
Go mash your teeth again
You're in the right place

You're something special
Full moon you'll have no doubt
Just let the astral music root you out
You're something special
Don't hide your wooden face
You keep on creepin let the night be scary
You're something special
We all will sing your name
Embrace your darkness never be ashamed
You're something special
To be a little fang
You keep on spinning
And this world keeps nag nag nagging

And if ever starts to feel bad little fang
It's easy to explain cuz this world's not tame
And if it ever starts to feel sad little fang
Remember that your gifts are your game
And if it ever starts to pour down little fang
The melody sings what the words can't say
But they might laugh and they might be scared
Of the one little fang with the trikes in her hair
With the spikes in her hair
With the trikes in her hair

You're always crashing into teeth And if ever starts to feel bad little fang
It's easy to explain cuz this world's not tame
And if it ever starts to feel sad little fang
Remember that your gifts are your game
And if it ever starts to pour down little fang
The melody sings what the words can't say
But they might laugh and they might be scared
Of the one little fang with the trikes in her hair
With the spikes in her hair
With the trikes in her hair
