You say don't question the day
Only to step out to the sun and wonder why?
The world is turning gray
I face my own ghost in the mirror, looks like I've died
They say don't turn away when there's something that you fear
You don't know what you're missing
The same every day when I'm crouching down in tears
You don't know what you're missing

You don't know what you're missing
You don't know what you're missing
I wish I did believe that I could not know what I was missing
Don't stop to see the everlasting
truth that I am sinking down (the end)

I said I didn't crave the cure to take away my pain but I was lying
Always talking sobriety but we both know I was just crying wolf
I fell in broken glass
Today I slipped right through and lost my place
(I think I'm done trying)
I threw away every loved one in the trash
They're waiting for the call

They're waiting for the call
They're waiting for the call
I wish I did believe in something stopping me from the fall
Just homeless in the streets or stuck behind prison walls
(the end)
I think that I knew nothing but the need to slip away
I found the comfort of drowning within, like there's no reason to stay
There's no reason to stay
