I can feel two spiders in my mind
Tangled thoughts in webs they left behind
I fill my head with misery and smoke
There's no use it seems they have awoke

They crawl, they fall
Those tiny crystal spiders in my mind

I feel them tapping neat against my brain
The sound alone at night drives me insane
The blood runs through my ears and through my eyes
Skull prison has broken from its ties

They crawl, they fall
Those tiny crystal spiders in my mind

I just wish they'd go
Leave me alone
