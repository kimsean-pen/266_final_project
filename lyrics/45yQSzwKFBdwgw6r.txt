Hand of fate is moving
And the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet
And so what are you gonna do

Your tongue has frozen now
You've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn
Is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money
You ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat
As you set up off the track

Nothing you can contemplate
Will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark
Sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
