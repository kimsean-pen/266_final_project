Looking you over,
and you don't know my name yet...
But by the time you looked away
already knew I couldn't fake it

I got this need for you forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away, we only yesterday
were worlds apart

I got this thing for you
if you come closer I can whisper in your ear
and if you wanna walk away
I'll tell you all the things I know you wanna hear.

I'll come closer
to you if you
come over
I know we'll go farther
farther with you
with you I'm in warm water swimming down.

I got this need for you forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away, we only yesterday
were worlds apart

I think I may love you, if you give me some time,
maybe you'll love me too...

I'll come closer
to you if you
come over
I know we'll go farther
farther with you
with you I'm in warm water swimming down.

I'll come closer
to you if you
come over
I know we'll go farther
farther with you
with you I'm in warm water swimming down.

I'll come closer
to you if you
come over
I know we'll go farther
farther with you
with you I'm in warm water swimming down.
