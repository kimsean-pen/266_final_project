Send out a sound for the wood between the worlds
Gently repeat as the boundaries start to swirl
Keep to the call that is twice now liminal
It's not the same where the trails lead to the outer regions

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever presents
Echoes many otherworlds true horizon start to turn
Numberless names withe the force of the ninth wave
Keep to the call that's repeated in the outer regions

Echoes from the otherworld turn the
horizons into endless ever presents

Echoes reflect and change their serenades
Echoes reflect and change their serenades

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever presents
Echoes many otherworlds true horizon makes the endless ever present
Echoes into other worlds true horizons into endless ever present
Echoes many otherworlds true horizon start to turn
Echoes reflect and change their serenade
Echoes reflect and change their serenade
Their serenade
Their serenade
