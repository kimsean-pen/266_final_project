You don't want me anymore
So I'll just walk right out the door
Played a game right from the start
I trust you, you used me, now my heart's torn apart

So I'm sailin', yeah I'm sailin' on
I'm moving, yeah I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on
Yeah!

Try to see if I give up
But there wasn't any luck
It's a fact, a fact of life
That's the games, games of strife, everything is all in stride

So I'm sailin', yeah I'm sailin' on
I'm moving, yeah I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on
Yeah!

So I'm sailin', yeah I'm sailin' on
I'm moving, yeah I'm movin' on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on
Yeah!

And too many years with too many tears
Too many days with none to say
How will we know when there's nowhere to grow
And what's the facts for life to show
