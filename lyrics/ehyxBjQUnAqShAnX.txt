This is an appeal

To the struggling and striving
stakeholders of this planet

This floating rock we call Earth
Alas, that means you

That means everyone of your acquaintance
Every figure your eyes skim past in the street
Every charlatan still to defeat
Every tender face you find solace in

Now mimic the mindset William Wallace was in
Dismount, disembark, descend from your existence
Slacken your angst and decant your hate

'Cause in the long run they're about as useful
As pouring acid onto your dinner plate

To muzzled masses that lead lives
of deafening desperation
With Excalibur aloft King Arthur earned the throne
But it's our minds we got to wrench out of stone

Don't be fooled by it's simplicity
There was never a broadcast made of such urgency

'Cause at no time before us
Did we grasp the scope of this emergency

Ladle out love and logic by the boatload
Equipped with that cargo you can take any road
Now grab life, seize time
This fight is for human kind

I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me

I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me

I will read your mind
I dart through rapids;
through streams of thought
Then suddenly I started losing my mind

Catapulting through the uncharted
I could no longer tell if these were your thoughts or mine

And it was if I held a mirror up to my soul
(Held a mirror up to my soul)

It was if I held a mirror up to my soul
Who was the author?

And who was the observer?
(Who was the author?
And who was the observer?)

For at the last analysis our thoughts coalesced

You are not alone
You are not alone

You have entered volatile territory
You have started a journey,
you're part of the story

And this, this was just a glimpse
Just a glimpse

You've no idea what you've got yourself into
(You've no idea what you've got yourself into)

Eugh!

I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me

I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me

On me!!
