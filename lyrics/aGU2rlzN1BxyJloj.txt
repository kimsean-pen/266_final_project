There was a place that I lived
And a girl, so young and fair
I have seen many things in my life
Some of them I'll never forget
Everywhere

I was sent to prison
For having murdered my wife
Because she was living with him
I lost my head and shot her

I was sent to prison
For having murdered my wife
Because she was living with him
I lost my head and shot her

This was my story in the past
And I'll go to reform myself
I am paying for my mistake
I will never be the same man again
