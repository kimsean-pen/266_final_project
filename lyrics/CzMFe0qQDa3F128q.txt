To your soul
To your soul
To your soul
To your soul
Cry

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

You leave in the morning with
Everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
The love that you need will never be found at home

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk
About around town as they put you down
And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them, just to your soul
No, you never cried to them, just to your soul

Run away, turn away, run away
Turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away
Turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away
Turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Crying to your soul
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Crying to your soul
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Ooh-ooh
