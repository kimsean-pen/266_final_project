Slow down, so I can catch you, slow down, so I can catch you
Slow down, so I can catch you, slow down, so I can catch you

I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you

Slow down, so I can catch you, slow down, so I can catch you
Slow down, so I can catch you, slow down, slow down
Slow down 'cause I can't catch you, slow down 'cause I can't catch you
Slow down 'cause I can't catch you, slow down, slow down

I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, I'm alone with you
