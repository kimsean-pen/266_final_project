Like a ship wrecked mariner
Adrift on an unknown sea
Clinging to the wreckage of
The lost ship Fantasy

I'm at castaway, stranded in a desolate land
I can see the footprints in the virtual sand

Net boy, net girl
Send your signal 'round the world
Let your fingers walk and talk
And set you free

Net boy, net girl
Send your impulse 'round the world
Put your message in a modem
And throw it in the Cyber Sea

Astronauts in the weightlessness
Of pixelated space
Exchange graffiti with
A disembodied race

I can save the universe
In a grain of sand
I can hold the future
In my virtual hand

Net boy, net girl
Send your signal 'round the world
Let your fingers walk and talk
And set you free

Net boy, net girl
Send your impulse 'round the world
Put your message in a modem
And throw it in the Cyber Sea

Let's dance tonight
To a virtual song
Press this key
And you can play along

Let's fly tonight
On our virtual wings
Press this key
To see amazing things
To see amazing things

Like a pair of vagabonds
Who wave between two passing trains
Or the glimpse of a woman's smile
Through a window in the rain

I can smell her perfume,
I can taste her lips
I can feel the voltage
From her fingertips

Net boy, net girl
Send your heartbeat 'round the world
Let your fingers walk and talk
And set you free

Net boy, net girl
Send your impulse 'round the world
Put your message in a modem
And throw it in the Cyber Sea

Put your message in a modem
And throw it in the Cyber Sea
