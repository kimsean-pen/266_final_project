My left side feel so heavy
Feel that it ain't steady
Feels like my heart is gaping out
How come I'm so heart healthy, so forgiving
Forgetting how you bring me down

Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a fuck? Oh
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?

I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love, don't let me down, come back around
Hey, it's like the journals of time

It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under

My vision so misleading
Make believing in things I never saw
Deep inside when I know things got different
Oh, it's not what we thought
Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a fuck? Oh
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?
I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love, don't let me down, come back around
Hey, it's like the journals of time

It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under

Everyday, it's all right
Sinking fast, going down
I just wanna get back right
So I need you out of my life
I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love, don't let me down, come back around

It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
It's like the journals of time
It make me wonder how I keep going under
