When she walks into the room
They look up to see her face
All the glitter falls on her
And the room's her stage

Don't you think you've had enough
Do their claws make sores
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you home

I won't turn around
Can't be afraid
Takin' you all the way back home
Innocence gone
Can't be the same
Takin' you all the way back home
Back home

Will the world still be the same
Even if you're gone
When the pillars start to fade
And the room's just walls

Don't you think you've had enough
Do their claws make sores
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you home

I won't turn around
Can't be afraid
Takin' you all the way back home
Innocence gone
Can't be the same
Takin' you all the way
all the way
all the way

Don't you think you've had enough
What's the gun there for
Take my hand and fly away
And I'll take you home

Don't you think you've had enough
What's the gun there for
Take my hand and come away
And I'll take you

I won't turn around
can't be afraid
Take you all the way back home
Innocence gone
can't be the same
Take you all the way

I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way back
I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way back

I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way
I'll take you all the way home
