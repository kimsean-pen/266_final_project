Im everything you know, you wonder friend or foe
I'm the burning in your throat when you swallow
And then you spit me out, your stomach full of doubt
Now you're faking every word out of your mouth

And when you won't let go, It's all about control
Understand Im born to lead you will follow
Now I don't wanna stay, and I'm running away
Don't you hear me when I say

Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
If you don't like being second
I don't like being wrong
I won't forget, the way you made me feel
I won't regret, running away from here
So I say goodbye again
So I say goodbye again
And now it's there to see, you've forgotten me
Ever since I was the prince among the thieves
So you hold me down, strip away my crown
Can't contain me knowing all the truth I've found

Always thinking small, helping me to fall
Now you're jealousy and hate consumes us all
I don't wanna stay and I'm running away
Don't you hear me when I say

Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
If you don't like being second
I don't like being wrong
I won't forget, the way you made me feel
I won't regret, running away from here
You think you see the world, but you see nothing
You think you see the world, but you see nothing
Time is only gonna make it worse in the end
So I say goodbye again

Don't hit me with your fears, I don't fit with your ideas
You missed what I'm about, I earned my way out
And in the end, I say goodbye again

I won't forget, the way you made me feel
I won't regret, running away from here
I won't forget, the way you made me feel
I won't regret, so I say goodbye again

Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
Goodbye, so long, nice try, I'm gone
