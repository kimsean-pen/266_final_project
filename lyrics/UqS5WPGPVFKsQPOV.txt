I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before...
Seems nothing ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay
Or head on out the door...
Just once
Can we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
Why we never last for very long
What are we doing wrong?
Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
To make the magic last for more than just one night
We could just get to it
I know we could break through it
H-m-m-m-m
I gave my all
But I think my all may have been too much
Lord knows we're not getting anywhere...
Seems we're always blowing
Whatever we got going
And seems at times with all we've got
We haven't got a prayer...
Just once
Can we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
Why the good times never last for long
Where are we going wrong?
Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it just once...
I want to understand
Why it always come back to goodbye
Why... can't we get ourselves in hand?
And admit to one another
We're no good without each other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together
Just once...
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
Whoa
Make the magic last for more than just one night
Know we could break through it
If we could just get to it
Just once...
Whoa
We could get to it...

Just Once...
