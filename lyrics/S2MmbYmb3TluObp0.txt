I've been waking with a sinking feeling
Write down the words lift them from my chest
Again I resolve to give up cigarettes

Ponder the grass and the way it withers
Counting the ants as they march along
I've been falling asleep with the TV on

Drifted away on a sea of someone else's truth
Deep in the dark will I find my way through?

By the light of the moon
By the light of the moon
I'm holding on for a bright day
And her light leads the way
The light of the moon

The nightingale sings a song regardless
The flowers bloom and they don't ask way
Making mistakes, guess the point is that we tried

I've done things that I swore to myself I would never do
Deep in the dark will I find my way through?

By the light of the moon
The light of the moon
I'm holding on for a bright day
And her light leads the way
The light of the moon

How, how did I get so lost?
How, how did I get so lost?
Sun will rise again
Tonight I found a friend

By the light of the moon
By the light of the moon
I'm holding on for a bright day
And her light leads the way
The light of the moon
The light of the moon
The light of the moon
The light of the moon
(The light of the moon)
