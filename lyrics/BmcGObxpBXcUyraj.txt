One more shot, then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Woke up this morning
The room was spinning
And I don't remember what I did last night
Beg the ceiling for forgiveness
'Cause I don't want to remember what I did last night
When I was drunk I might have said some things I didn't mean

There's nothing wrong with you, it's something wrong with me
I'm running dry from now on
How come no one believes me?

Believe me
Step one: Drink
Step two: Make mistakes
Step three: Pretend you don't remember
Step four: Drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry

I need to run dry
My liver's killing me
But willingly I'm going to tell whoever asks that I feel alright
Beg the ceiling for forgiveness

'Cause I don't want to remember what I did last night
When I was drunk I might have said some things I didn't mean, yeah
And there's nothing wrong with you, it's something wrong with me, yeah
Step one: Drink

Step two: Make mistakes
Step three: Pretend you don't remember
Step four: Drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry
I need to run dry
I'm gonna take one more shot

Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
Cross my heart, cross my fingers
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers

Cross my heart, cross my fingers
I get drunk a little too much
For it to be healthy
No one wants to tell me...
Whisky!
I'm trying to cut, cut, cut back back
Wine!
I'm trying to cut, cut, cut back back
They say "everything in moderation"
But I'll drink you under the table
I'm not just drunk
I, I really think I'm in love with you baby

(Okay, I really am just, drunk)
Step one: Drink
Step two: Make mistakes
Step three: Pretend you don't remember
Step four: Drink a little more
Step five: I need to run dry

I need to run dry
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers

Cross my heart, cross my fingers
I'm gonna take one more shot
Then I'm quitting forever
Cross my heart, cross my fingers

Cross my heart, cross my fingers
(Impress me, good luck)
(Impress me, good luck)
(Impress me, good luck)

(Impress me, good luck)
I'm not from williamsburg or silver lake
Does anybody have any other obvious complaints?
Stop trying, to get it empty

Cause I can almost hear you trying to hard, yeah
Just saw a shadow of the freak you're in the night
Something on human feet from the scene of the crime

Those little flashes just wreak havoc on the mind
I don't have to prove myself to you.
I don't have to prove myself to you.
You're standing with your arms crossed
Nose turned up like you're saying "impress me"
(Good luck)
Impress me
(Good luck)

I don't have to prove myself to you.
They got the search party looking for the ghost of the child
But what if it grew up?
He didn't die
And he's all I want to get the evil little feeling

Like you're under dead eyes, yeah
To those who all agree, you just might exist
But come in in the morning if their misconceptions still persist

Some days I may express myself in curious ways.
I don't have to prove myself to you
I don't have to prove myself to you
You're standing with your arms crossed
Nose turned up like you're saying "impress me"
(Good luck)
Impress me
(Good luck)
I don't have to prove myself to you
I don't have to prove myself to you
I don't have to prove myself to you
You're standing with your arms crossed
Nose turned up like you're saying "impress me"
(Good luck)
Impress me
(Good luck)
But I don't have to prove myself to you.
