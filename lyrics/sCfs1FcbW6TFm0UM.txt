They love to tell you what to say, how to make up your mind
Or how to spend your time
If they only know what they have seen, then I would have those eyes
That isn't my reality
We all have a little curiosity
We're so wide-eyed
It gets hard to look at things from different perspectives
What you think is backwards could be inside out
Do you see now?
It's easy to fall into a lie, part of a big machine
Like they will do to me
Is it really so far out to say that they will tell you lies?
Trying to make you be the same
We all have a little curiosity
We're so wide-eyed
It gets hard to look at things from different perspectives
What you think is backwards could be inside out
Do you see now?
Oh my heart it hurts to know that you're automatic
All the thoughts are programmed into your mind
You just need a new idea
I'll ask if you ever wonder what it's like to open your eyes
We all have a little curiosity
We're so wide-eyed
It gets hard to look at things from different perspectives
What you think is backwards could be inside out
Do you see now?
