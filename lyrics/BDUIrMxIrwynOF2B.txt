Truth Or Lie? The Silence Is Revealing
An Empty Sky A Hidden Mound Of Stone
But The CAT Scan's Eye Sees What The Heart's Concealing
Nowadays When Everything Is Known
Maybe Love's An Accident Or Destiny Is True?
But You And I Were Born Beneath A Star Of Dazzling Blue
Dazzling Blue
Miles Apart Though The Miles Can't Measure Distance
Worlds Apart On A Rainy Afternoon
But The Road Gets Dirty And It Offers No Resistance
So Turn Your Amp Up And Play Your Lonesome Tune
Maybe Love's An Accident Or Destiny Is True?
But You And I Were Born Beneath A Star Of Dazzling Blue
Dazzling Blue
Dazzling Blue Roses Red Fine White Linen
To Make A Marriage Bed
And We'll Build A Wall That Nothing Can Break Through
And Dream Our Dreams Of Dazzling Blue
Sweet July And We Drove The Montauk Highway
And Walked Along The Cliffs Above The Sea
And We Wondered Why And Imagined It Was Someday
And That Is How The Future Came To Be
Dazzling Blue Roses Red Fine White Linen
To Make A Marriage Bed
And We'll Build A Wall That Nothing Can Break Through
And Dream Our Dreams Of Dazzling Blue
