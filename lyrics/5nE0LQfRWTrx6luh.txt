I despise you, Everything you do, Inexplicable.
Blind and powerless, Suffering begins, Abduction.

You are taken, forsaken,
Stripped of your clothes, comatose, You awaken.
To a presence that reeks of hatred
Malevolent, Ancient, Immortal, Ageless.

Blood will be spilled, Bodies sacrificed.
Condemned to die through experiments of the fourth kind.

Eternal Suffering.

Tied down, Limbs spread out, Impregnation begins.
Bleeding, intestinal seeping, Your screams are smothered now.
Tearing, As i'm inserting, Reproductive organs.
Into, The human womb. Procreation tomb.

Tied down, Limbs spread out, Impregnation begins.

Tearing, As i'm inserting, Reproductive organs.
Into, The human womb. Procreation tomb.

The monolith revealed it's purpose
You were all born as our servants.
No god will save you from it.

Hurt for me my victims, As I torture your every breath.
The smell of rotting flesh, Keeps me alive in this place of death.
Suffer, Procreate and Die, This has become your life.
Suffer, Procreate and Die, This has become your life.

I despise you, Everything you do, Inexplicable.
Blind and powerless, Suffering begins, Abduction.

The god you cry to doesn't breathe.
He won't help you finally see,
This is all that's left just you and me.

I will grow an army of hybrids.
Half human, Half something of nightmares.
Tearing you from the inside
As you await death for the first time... For the first time.

The breeding process is complete.
I will create, Reanimate.
The god you cry to doesn't breathe.
Hung long ago, By our species.
