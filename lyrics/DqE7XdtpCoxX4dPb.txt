How 'bout you have another drink
So you can pass out in the backseat of my car
Another night I'll have to slap you 'cross the face
So you don't sleep there, the world I star

What a pain it must be to have to always be with me
Every night and every day, it's all the same
Every moment of our lives is like a knife into my heart

I can't live like this forever
Losing to the dark
I won't live like this forever
Losing to the dark
I can't live like this forever
Losing to the dark

How 'bout you write another song
About how fun you are to drink with at the bar
Another night of doing drugs and running off
You're not agreeable, you have no heart

What a shame it must be to have to be in love with me
Every night and every day, it's all the same
Every moment of our lives is like a knife into my heart

Losing to the dark
Losing to the dark
