Squeeze my ass like a teddy bear
Suck my tongue and make it disappear
Dip my lonely days in honey glaze
Maple syrup in our lemonade
Drinking wine at the house, thinking 'bout rehab
Call you up, put some wine in my mouth
Call you up, call you up, ooh, ooh

I know a girl, she's just your type
She's educated, her future is bright
I went to high school and failed one class twice
But it's my time, you're not going, you're living

I'm so terrible, come pick me off the floor
Unrepairable, can't find an open door
I've never found somebody who could want me at my low
Now I'll never let you go cause you love me when I'm terrible
I'm so terrible, come pick me off the floor
Unrepairable, can't find an open door
I've never found somebody who could want me at my low
Now I'll never let you go cause you love me when I'm terrible

I don't think we're done
I feel we've just begun running from the sun
I'm a sweet bitch, but if you're on my worst side
You can take a hearse ride
I can drink the cyanide like it's red wine

I know a girl, she's just your type
She's educated, her future is bright
I went to high school and failed one class twice
But it's my time, you're not going, you're living

I'm so terrible, come pick me off the floor
Unrepairable, can't find an open door
I've never found somebody who could want me at my low
Now I'll never let you go cause you love me when I'm terrible
I'm so terrible, come pick me off the floor
Unrepairable, can't find an open door
I've never found somebody who could want me at my low
Now I'll never let you go cause you love me when I'm terrible

I don't think we're done
