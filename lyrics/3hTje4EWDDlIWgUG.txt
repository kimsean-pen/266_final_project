No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's me and me
And this little masochist
She's ready to confess
All the things
That I never thought that she could feel and

Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know you know

And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
Well if my heart's soaking wet
Boy, your boots can leave a mess
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same

So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And he isn't you
No one's pickin' up the phone
Guess it's clear he's gone
And this little masochist

Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel and
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?

Thought we both could use a friend to run to
I thought I wouldn't have to keep with you hiding
I go from day to day
I know where the cupboards are
I know where the car is parked
I know he isn't you

Hey Jupiter
Never you
Nothing's been the same
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing's been the same
Never you
