(If you're a) bum ass bitch
Then fuck your life
Everything nice
Talk to me nice

Ha-ha-ha!
It's Dream Doll, baby!
Talk nice!

I'm a dog, I'm a freak
Ask your nigga about me
Catching rep in these streets
Screaming mother fuck the fee
What's my tab? Fuck that tab!
I'ma make that shit right back
Fix ya face li'l thot
Why you mad? Why you mad?

Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
If you're a bum ass bitch
Then fuck your life (fuck your life)
Everything nice (everything nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)I rock Christian Loubs, two bands on my shoes
I will fuck your nigga and might give him back to you
Everything nice, pull up foreigns, cocaine white (skurt!)
Talk to me nice, no he didn't fuck, but he tryna wife
What type is you on? I get to that bag cuz' that's all I know
Only rock with baddies that get money lil hoe
I need bands just to pull up for the walk through
You a broke bitch, kill ya self, let it haunt you
He talking like he gon' smash or somethin'
I fill him up with the gas I'm pumping
Run through a check, get it back, its nothing(That's some boss shit)
I run it up in fendi, bitch do not offend me
You're broke, your pockets empty, can't even afford that henny I mean I gotta check for telling y'all bitches
"Talk to me nice or don't talk to me twice"
Now, maybe y'all listen
Because when I say "Talk nice"
I mean show me to the bag
Lead me to the points, not 'tween
What's in that bag, like ah?

I'm a dog, I'm a freak
Ask your nigga about me
Catching rep in these streets
Screaming mother fuck the fee
What's my tab? Fuck that tab!
I'ma make that shit right back
Fix ya face li'l thot
Why you mad? Why you mad?

Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
If you're a bum ass bitch
Then fuck your life (fuck your life)
Everything nice (everything nice)
