There is a house by the sea
Two jealous sisters there waiting for me
And one is laid on the floor
And one is changing the locks on her doors

But I've been buying their time on my knees
And I've been selling them blankets to bleed on

Around the house by the sea
The scent of roses and raspberry leaves
And there is smoke in my clothes
Too much time with just smoke in my nose

But I've been making the meaning they lack
And I've been burning that book they come back to

There is a house by the sea
And an ocean between it and me
And like the shape of a wave
The jealous sisters will sing on my grave

I've been living to run where they've led
And I've been dying to rise from their bed

But I've been sparing my neck from their chain
And they've been changing the sound of my name
And I've been swimming to them in my sleep
But I've been dreaming our love and our freedom
