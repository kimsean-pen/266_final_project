We could try, we could try
oh, but you know
We exist just to live
Body and soul
Have we come here only for an ending?
Ask the sky, ask the moon
How they reflect
Someone else's own mood
I have to relate
We're same as the two
We're someone else's image
I found, i found my gold
Resond, resond my soul
We loved, we learned, we find
We live, we die, resond
And i've seen through distant seas
Where wild nights lose gravity
So race for the shore line
If you want more
Than those revered wild nights
We've expired for more
I found, i found my gold
Resond, resond my soul
We loved, we learned, we find
We live, we die, resond
I can feel it in my bones
So much left unknown
We continue to grow old
At least i have found my gold
I can feel it in my bones
So much left unknown
We continue to grow old
At least i have found
I found, i found my gold
Resond, resond my soul
We loved, we learned, we find
We live, we die, resond
