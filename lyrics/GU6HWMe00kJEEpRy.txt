I'm not too far from you
I can't wait to see you
Again and again.

Lift me up to the highest level
And lay me down once.
I reach the clouds.
I'm not a fiend.
Just persistent in my being.

I've been living up the nights in white
The storm keeps growing.
I can taste the bitter leaf
The high
The blood is flowing
The blood is flowing

My lady winter
Please come and take my soul.
So don't ask and I won't tell
Just relax and let your heart swell.
Take this flask, and kick it back.
It won't be easy until she comes back.
Until she comes back
So don't ask and I won't tell!

I will hold my breath
Until you fill my lungs
I will never give up
Anticipation is the itch to my crave.

Lift me up to the highest level.
Lift me up to the highest level.

I've been living up the nights in white.
The storm keeps growing.

Look in the mirror the red
Is filling in your eyes
Your eyes.

You're getting lost in between the lines,
The lines.

I've been living up the nights in white
The storm keeps growing
I can taste the bitter leaf
The high
The blood is flowing

So don't ask and I won't tell, tell!
So don't ask and I won't tell
