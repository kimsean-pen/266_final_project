The paperwork explosion
The paperwork explosion...
A slob on a slab
A Vegas whale
Pimps and johns and patriot scum
We're an up-dated, out-dated
Ocean full of chum...
The paperwork explosion
The paperwork explosion...
Now!
Holiday shirts and your hedge-fund ghosts
Honest earns, the paper burns [?]
Green interns nobody learns as the buildings blow...
Explosion
The paperwork explosion
There will come a day when the righteous laugh and rejoice
With a pure voice
Bathe your feet in the wicked's blood
EXPLODE!!!
