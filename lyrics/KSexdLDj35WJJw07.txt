It's five o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you were going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended that I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in with me

Put your arm around my shoulder
And it was as if the room got colder
When we moved closer in together
Started talking about the weather
You said tomorrow would be fun
And we could watch a place in the sun
I didn't know where this was going
When you kissed me

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine

Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone, no longer feel alone

I haven't left you for days now
And I'm becoming amazed how
You're quite affectionate in public
In fact your friend said it made her feel sick
And even though it's moving forward
There's just the right amount of awkward
And today you accidentally called me baby

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine

Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone

Let's just stay, let's just stay
I wanna lie in bed all day
We'll be laughing all the way
You told your friends, they all know
We exist but we're taking it slow
Let's just see how it goes
Let's see how it goes

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine

Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone
Let's just stay, let's just stay
I wanna lie in bed all day
We'll be laughing all the way
You told your friends, they all know
We exist but we're taking it slow
Now let's just see how it goes
Let's see how it goes
