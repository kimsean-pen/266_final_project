Bottom of the bowl again
Life taking its toll again
Slept away the day
Nothing ever changes
I only ever see you in dark
Meet me here, two again
Tell me that you're you again
Humble and complete
Blood, bones, flesh and weakness
I only ever see you in the dark
You know I tore out the first page
Hating every word that I say
You know I tore out the first page
Turn up, night time, you're at my door
Holding flowers that you have bought
Just for me
I can't smile, not today
Wrapped up in the view again
Living just for you again
Lost all sense of self
Say you did it for your girl
I ever see you in the dark
Almost found a place to stay and never fell so deep again
Spent your life alone
In lame of love
I only ever see you in the dark
You know I tore out the first page
Hating every word that I say
You know I tore out the first page
Turn up, night time, you're at my door
Holding flowers that you have bought
Just for me
Turn up, night time, you're at my door
You know I tore out the first page
Hating every word that I say
You know I tore out the first page
You know I tore out the first page
Hating every word that I say
You know I tore out the first page
Turn up, night time, you're at my door
Holding flowers that you have bought
Just for me
I can't smile, not today
