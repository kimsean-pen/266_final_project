Think of all the things I do
And I still hold the thought of you
With someone else I know it's true
So far away

And I can only hold my breath
And start to die a lonely death
With you and me and all the rest
So far away, yeah...

Don't say I told you so
One thing you'll never know

You're not the same
You've changed
I don't need you anyway
You're not the person that I believed in yesterday

You're not the same
You've changed
I don't need you anyway
You're not the person that I belived in yesterday

I can't hold it back you see
I know it all comes back to me
You must have practiced hard to be
So far away

Never wanted me to show
Just write me off I let you go
And now there's more for you to know
So far away

Don't say I told you so
One thing you'll never know

You're not the same
You've changed
I don't need you anyway
You're not the person that I believed in yesterday

You're not the same
You've changed
Something's missing anyway
You're not the person that I believed in yesterday
That I believed in yesterday

Don't say I told you so
One thing you'll never know
You're not the same
You've changed
I don't need you anyway
You're not the person that I believed in yesterday
You're not the same
You've changed
I don't need you anyway
You're not the person that I believed in yesterday
That I believed in yesterday
