Why does it hurt so
I'm wrapped in your love and I dont wanna be undone

Why does love hurt so? How do you just know?
How to get to me baby? Words aren't only words
When from you they're heard
When you say, you really love me

Maybe it's a trick, something doesn't click
Maybe it's a spell, that you've got me under
Somethings going down, turn my world around
I woke up and I found, I was spellbound

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could

Metaphysical more than visual
You touch the heart of me
Night turns in to day, shadows fade away
When you say you, really love me

Maybe it's a trick, something doesn't click
Maybe it's a spell, that you've got me under
Somethings going down, turn my world around
I woke up and I found, I was spellbound

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could

I hope I hope it's not a scheme, why you?
How do I know it's not just a game?
You are such a player, but you know
How to get direct to my heart
Do I have to put you in?

Maybe it's a trick, something doesn't click
Maybe it's a spell, that you've got me under
Somethings going down, turn my world around
I woke up and I found, I was spellbound

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could

So wicked
So wicked
So wicked

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could

So
So wicked
And your prison
Feels good so
Your kisses
Against my wishes
I wouldn't help it if I could
