His Name was King
He had a horse
along the countryside
I saw him ridin
he had a gun
I knew him well
Oh I heard him singing
I knew he loved someone

His Name was King
(His Name was King)
He had a brother
(He had a brother)
his only brother
a peaceful guy
One day they found him
His shirt was ragged
Two shiny Bullets
They found his dead

You can't see king
While he's riding
You can't see king
That man is (?)
Guided by anger
Fire in his eyes
Sure to find that Killer
Looking for revenge

His name is King
He had a horse
Along the countryside
I saw him ride
He had a gun
Oh I knew him well
And when he shot
Oh that man he never missed

Ride on King, ride
You'll get your man
