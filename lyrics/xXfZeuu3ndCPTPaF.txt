What ya gonna do when the Angels come?
Get movin', yeah movin'
I'm gonna get your kicks a-from a 911
It's groovin', so soothin'

Your passion to bleed is just lookin' to feed
Your own fancy
The blind side o' you is a bad dream come true
That you can't see.

From an Angel's eye
Kiss it all goodbye
From an Angel's eye
Ain't no place to hide.

Tell me what you see through an Angel's eye?
A halo on fire
You never really know 'till it's "do or die"
Your Devil's desire.

You're running in place like a rat in a race
going nowhere
The evil you speak's from the tongue of a freak
So don't go there!

From an Angel's eye
Kiss it all goodbye
From an Angel's eye
Ain't no place to hide, yeah

What ya gonna do when the Angels come?
What ya gonna do when you come undone?
I'm gonna get your kicks a-from a 911
Get movin', yeah movin'

From an Angel's eye
Kiss it all goodbye
From an Angel, Angel, Angel, Angel's eye!
Ain't no place to hide

From An Angel's Eye
Kiss Your Life Goodbye
From An Angel Angel Angel's Eye
Ain't No Place To Hide

From an Angel
From an Angel
From an Angel!
