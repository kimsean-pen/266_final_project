Waking up this morning thinking this can't be real
But they say there's nothing love can't heal
Why don't you come on down
so you can feel what I feel?

Sitting all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone
but there's something wrong.

Can't you see that I'm stuck here underneath?
and you're making it hard to breathe
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

I know what to say but don't know where to begin
I fear of losing you beneath my skin
is there resolution for this pain that I'm in

Sittin' all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone
but there's something wrong

Can't you see that I'm stuck in underneath?
and you're making it hard to breathe
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

Cuz you'll find me
Whoh-oh-whoh. (2x)

If only you could feel what I dream
Maybe you hear what I mean

There is nothing gone but there's something missing

can't you see?
That I'm stuck in underneath
and you're making it hard to breathe
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

Cuz i'm stuck in underneath
And your making it hard to breath
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me
underneath
underneath
