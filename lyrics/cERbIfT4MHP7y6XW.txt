Battered sore and high on hurt
Out of mind and out of words
Lost for love and lost for air
That is how you leave me here

But no, no longer
(No, no longer)
I am getting stronger
Getting stronger

All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies

I would give the sun for you
Everything I had belonged to you
All my tears and all my joy
That's how much I have
Loved you boy

But no, no longer
(No, no longer)
I am getting stronger
Getting stronger

All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies

So now forget about
All I ever promised you
I am getting out
Spin your lying web alone
Spin the wheel of lies
On someone new
Someone new

All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies (Lies)
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies

All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
No more listening to no more words
No more second hand tries
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
All you ever told me
Lies
