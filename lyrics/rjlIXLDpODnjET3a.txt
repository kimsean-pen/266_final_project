There's something wrong with the words that we're not saying
And the silence we're creating like a ghost note symphony
There's something wrong and the temperature is rising
Ignoring every siren as we're marching towards a cliff
But these are choices that we don't have to make
Block out the voices 'cause they have led you astray
What I've been trying to say to you is that

There's something in the water, there must be something in the air
Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it, it doesn't mean that it's not there

We are all turned on but then we all tune out
As we are hypnotized by the sparkling lies
We fall under their spell
But don't forget that these are choices
That we don't have to make, so many voices
That have led us astray, we can't keep anything down
The room is spinning around

There must be something in the water, yeah there's something in the air
Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it, it doesn't mean that it's not there

You are the grains of sand that slip through my hands again
And we are the hourglass, love like a flame that can't be held
Somewhere beyond the lives we burn, lies the point of no return
Like the sand in the hourglass
But there is something in your eyes that shakes me back to life
And though I can't put my finger on it
Now I know we're gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright

'Cause there is something in the water, yeah there is something in the water
In this life we sink or swim or just float
We all die yeah, but did we live at all?
