Slip away, your vanity is gone
I'm falling out of place
We all fall down, the pain goes on
We bear through the war
And turn the lost away
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the fire that dries the flood

As I fight, for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the devil down
I will stand alone, no longer defeated

Stripped away, we rise above it all
Forgotten and betrayed
We all fall down, the pain goes on
No better than before
Still broken and afraid
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the cloud that hides, the sun

As I fight, for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the devil down
I will stand alone, no longer defeated

I'm falling to pieces, pained and used
I know what I needed, it's not you, it's not you

As I fight, for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the devil down
I will stand alone, no longer defeated
No longer defeated
No longer defeated
