I dare you
To be real
To touch
To touch a flickering flame

The pangs of
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower
Don't cower in night fright

Don't back away yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal

I dare you
To despise
Bureaucracy, I know it's lies
In a void
[Incomprehensible]
May never
May never dare to dare

I dare
I dare
I dare you
You
You
You
I dare you
You
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I dare you
