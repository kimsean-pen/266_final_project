I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
Can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream
Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Fully fed yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted I tell myself yet I still wander
Down, inside
It's tearin' me apart
Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

I'll never fall in
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never
I'll never fall in
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall
I'll never fall in
I'll never fall in love again
It's all over now

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
Can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream
Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

I'll never fall in love
I'll never fall, fall, fall, fall in love
I'll never fall in love
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never
I'll never fall in love again
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's, it's, it's, it's all over now
It's all over now
