Daaaaaa！
Speed of times are messing with our minds
Rise up up！ Push！ Push！ Push！
BOOST！ Acceleration！ Drive！

Noooooo！！
Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-CRASH！！！

Wrong
Don't wanna see no bad sign
My bones feel horrified
I know that it's your life
But what you're doing is not right

They bring you the news on your TV screen
Same as always
Talking of who had an affair with who today
And who's killing who again

Don't wanna hear this evil
And I don't want to see
But, none of it is fantasy
夢じゃない

Taking you out！
From this misery now
孤独の種
奪い取って hide again
And in this broken place

Give love！ (Give love！)
Feel love！ (Feel love！)
Save you！ (Save you！)

愛されたいと叫んで
聞こえるから

Just set this free
Pain's ending once again
A better sky
We're still DRIFTING with lights out
This may look like no hope

Just open your eyes
It's always bright outside
Go slow

Now！ Hear them cry！
Somebody's yell
Pay attention！
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

必要な自信がなくて 幸せを比べてる
基準は誰のものなのだろう
思い出すには
There is time, there is time, there is time

So try to see it right
形の中
Don't believe you're speeding
Here on your own

We have all crashed into one, two
Big walls, in the path of life
Go flying over the top
Top top top top top oh！

Taking you out！
From this misery now
孤独の種
奪い取って hide again
And in this broken place

Give love！ (Give love！)
Feel love！ (Feel love！)
Save you！ (Save you！)

愛されたいと叫んで
聞こえるから

Just set this free
Pain's ending once again
A better sky
鮮やかな この世界なら
