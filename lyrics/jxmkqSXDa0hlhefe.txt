Because it cuts so deep
To see myself wishing
Upon melting stars
I cut the cord
I finally...

Beyond visions of wretched smiles
And the dread that they've befriended
I have seen an end to you and I
When did we begin? (7x)
When... did we... begin?
When?

And a warped sense of being that I embrace...
Must exist
And we with whole hearts, yet broken words we dream of wisdom
But I yearn only for you
You will destroy me with words that you have never spoken
I've drawn a picture of us...
Twisted within yet below this world
I absorb life from portraits

As long as we remain abreast of one another we will never meet...
Each other
As long as we whisper to...
One another we will never fully hear each other
As long as my eyelids are weighed down
By desire

One dying wish

I will never know when you appear
