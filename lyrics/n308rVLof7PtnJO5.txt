This is a calling on you
Your needle drew
The first blood of my war
The needle drew
The life right out of you
Searched the blood
And all I found was you
I had forced you into my veins
We are the blood
We drain
In years of pain
You have been touched
By the hand
Accept your fate
Now lead the way
Ascend
To rise
Above the whole
This is a calling
On you
I will beat you without anger and I will draw from your eyelid a tear
I bare
My arms
Now drive your nails through my palms
When we meet
Drive those
Nails right through my feet
I have given you something real
You thought that you'd never feel
I have given you something so real
A wound
That will never heal
