Someone's waiting to fly with me
Someone's saying goodbye every time she
Says hello 'cause they both
Connect no one to somebody

I'm floating down this airstream
I'm floating and its every dream I've ever had
And I'm so happy and sad
'Cause they both connect me to what I've never been a body

Any house is a frame
Anything real has a brain
We've talked ourselves out of it
And I've reconsidered it and I'm convinced

Everywhere I look has a face
Everyone who's lived has a place
Right here's every world
Every time draws a line to right now

Hold and turn the infinite
Hold and turn the infinite
Someone's taking me all
