She wanna move around and hold on to the dreams
That she's streaming
She wanna loose the frown and turn it upside down
And start living
Ah, ah, ah, don't blame your time
In your risk, for not doing what makes you sick
Don't blame your clock on the wall
For running round for nothing at all

So I say, uh, uh, baby,
Take your feet dancing shoes
And go crazy
And don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Are we having fun or are we dazing, baby?

I wanna go down south and hold on to your feelings lately
I wanna hear you growl but who's gonna be there
To save me?
Ah, ah, ah, don't blame your time
In your risk, for not doing what makes you sick
Don't blame your clock on the wall
For running round for nothing at all

So I say, uh, uh, baby,
Take your feet dancing shoes
And go crazy
And don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Are we having fun or are we dazing, baby?

And don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Yeah it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't baby, don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't baby, don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
Don't you dream in your sleep it's just lazy
