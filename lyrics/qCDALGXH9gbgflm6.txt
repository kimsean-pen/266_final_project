I've never been the kind to hold back
though I'd never felt the burn before
and all these years I begged for vengeance
and was only left with wanting more
but I can't be whole until I let all this anger go,
a silent strain I've carried long enough

I can't be with you, I don't even want to
I just wish your ghosts were gone
cause I'm ready to love
I've been guarded long enough

It's taken a lot to forgive you
oh it's taken me so long
I tried in vain to forget you
oh I tried everything
but I won't be free until I've made peace with never knowing
what went wrong and was the fault in me

I can't be with you, I don't even want to
I just wish your ghosts were gone
cause I'm ready to love
I've been guarded long enough

I've been guarded long enough
I've been guarded long enough
I've been guarded long enough to know I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready now
