What?
Damn you're right
Dare is about obsession
It's something inside
Wounds are bleeding in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever stop this
Self-made decline
Nothing really matters

(He's watching me)
What if I look away and deal with it
Digging in my grave
I won't deny it
Fragile my crystal ball
Shattered on the ground

What?
Damn you're right
Learn is about rejection
There's nothing to hide
Wounds are healing in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever scratch
My own state of mind
Nothing really matters

(He's watching me)
What if I look away and deal with it
Digging in my grave
I won't deny it
Fragile my crystal ball
Shattered on the ground

(He's watching me)
What if I look away and deal with it
Digging in my grave
I won't deny it
Fragile my crystal ball
Shattered on the ground
