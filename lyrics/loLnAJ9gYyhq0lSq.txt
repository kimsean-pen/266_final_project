Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Leave it with a baby sitter
Mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Oohh I'm a rebel, mashin' the pedal
Would you rather dance with the stars or dance with the devil?
Imagine me I'm grabbing the metal when enemies meddle
And my mental is tellin' me this is murder one through melodies

Revin' on the pedal since I balanced on a bicycle
They supplyin' me and my per diem, I don't die simple
Love is all you need, it's only me as I survive hustle
Always on the ground, I'm playin' mine with divine structures

(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Oohh I'm a rebel, mashin' the pedal
Would you rather dance with the stars or dance with the devil?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
