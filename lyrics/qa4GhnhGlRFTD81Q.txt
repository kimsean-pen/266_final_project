I'm falling, I'm falling, falling in love with you

Baby, come closer, closer to me
And listen, listen carefully
Remember all the nights that I told you I loved you
It wasn't true, I used you
And you were just someone new
To thrill this lonely heart of mine
I was lying all the time
Pretending to be falling in love with you
But it's different now
I've kissed you now, so forgive me, forgive me somehow
Hold me tight for tonight, and tell me true
If you still love me
Say that you love me
Don't leave me now, now that I'm falling for you
I'm falling, I'm falling, falling in love
Falling in love with you.
