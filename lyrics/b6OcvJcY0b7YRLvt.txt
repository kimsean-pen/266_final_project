We both lost our innocence
To heaven on Las Vegas
Bedroom rearranged again
Snow out on the pavement

Colors from outside
They've been orange and white
Let's invite your friends for a backseat drive

It's not a crime if you take what's given
It's just a crime if you're paying for it
What's the fun if you know what's coming?
I don't want to escape it

Standing outside of your house
It's pretty dark out
Good thing there's lights
It's pretty cold though
I just need you right here
To warm me up this time

What's done to work off?
You say I'll never get you off
Now when you stand in a crowd
Is your mind in the gutter?
Your head on the run
(Your head on the run)

It's not a crime if you take what's given
It's just a crime if you're paying for it
What's the fun if you know what's coming?
I don't want to escape it

The plant inside that never seemed to die
You cut it down before the leaves were brown
The gate was closed, we know that we're too old
The pool is cold, the pool is cold

It's not a crime if you take what's given
It's just a crime if you're paying for it
Where's the fun if you know what's coming?
I don't want to escape this feeling
And when we tear down the walls completely
Are we left with the same old memories
There's a song that I still hear faintly
It's just a recipe for my love
It's just a recipe for my love
