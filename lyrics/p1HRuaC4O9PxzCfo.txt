Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
And I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest
Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
And the time is moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips

In the center of eclipse

In total darkness I, I reach out and touch
My mind's gone on racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump,
Yeah, I'm ready to swim
Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
New hands need to build them

My mind's gone on running
My hands cut loose

Yeah, but there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do
And I need you to trust

That I'm lost and we must
Get past all these rules
We must choose
To reach out and touch
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, reach out and...
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I reach, I reach out and touch
