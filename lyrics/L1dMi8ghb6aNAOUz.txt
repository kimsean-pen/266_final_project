Some days, I pretend that everything is fine
Right now, I feel crazy and my words won't come out

I'm trying not to feel
But maybe I'm not alone in this constant side
I'm trying not to feel
but baby, am I alone in this constant side?

I wish things were diamonds and daisies all the time
But these feelings lately
Are like a little child

I'm trying not to feel
But maybe I'm not alone in this constant side
I'm trying not to fee
But baby, am I alone in this constant side?

Oooh-oooh
Some days, I pretend that everything's alright
Right now, I feel crazy and my words don't come out
