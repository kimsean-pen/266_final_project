People living in the dark
State protecting life then tear it apart
Cause commotion cause a scene cracking skull expanding seam
Every time there is a choice it's tear it apart

Fall high
Don't ever touch the ground
Know no wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back, come back, come back
Exploding head

Touch by the hand of god
It's a secret that is held now fire the gun
Sit down love and tighten up the pace
Commands close eyes command shoot off the face

Fall high
Don't ever touch the ground
Know no wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back, come back, come back
Exploding head

Lovers, bound by their tongues
Bound by their hands, bound by love
Intentions shadow truth and the motivation's done
The secret was a lie and the truth was never won

Fall high
Don't ever touch the ground
Know no wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back, come back, come back
Exploding head
