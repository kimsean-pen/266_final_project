I'm one man to make a difference
I'm one soul all persistence
In a dark world, just tryin' to make things right, yeah
Choices we weren't given
Any heroes, and our decision
Is to stand up and fight for ourselves, oh yeah

To be free, is all we wanna be
When everything seems so far out of reach
But I know, no matter where we go
I'll never stop believin' in me

Woke up bent and broken
Just to find that, oh, fate has spoken
And I call out, I call out for change
For every moment that remains
For every sinkin' stone to find its place
Long before they're washed away

To be free, is all we wanna be
When everything seems so far out of reach
But I know, no matter where we go
I'll never stop believin' in me

We've been waitin' for too long
We've been givin' into wrong
And we've been broken to pieces one by one

We're gonna know, yeah
We're gonna know
When the moment comes

To be free, is all we wanna be
When everything seems so far out of reach
I need to know, no matter where we go
I'll never stop believin' in me

To be free, is all we wanna be
When everything seems so far out of reach
I need to know, no matter where we go
I'll never stop believin' in me
