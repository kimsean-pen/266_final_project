Watchin' movies on my phone
Whenever I want
I turn it as loud as it goes
'Cause when nobody's home

I'm the king of everything
Make the rules up on my own
I can break 'em if I please
'Cause I make up the police

And everybody's equal
But not me, 'cause I'm the king
I make all the other people
Tell me secrets in my dreams

I wake up when they tell us to
At night, I'll stay with you
I'll take my time
To make you smile
'Cause I know just how you feel when you're alone

And you don't need me, no
I'll take all your time
And I love the way it feels
When you take the wheel
I know
You know

I will take all your time
I will take all your time
