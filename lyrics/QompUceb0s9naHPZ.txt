I'm a...
I'm a...
I'm a Dreamer
Love life and laughter is all I believe
My saviour is pure now
Because my lonely heart would bleed
I never learned how to hold love
And stay strong to love
Now I close my eyes now
And I'm dreaming right where I belong

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling,
I'm feeling
I feel your hands and your lips and the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling,
I'm feeling
I feel your hands and your lips and the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Am I a dreamer
Am I a dreamer

Love life and laughter is all I believe
My saviour is pure now
Because my lonely heart would bleed
I never learned how to hold love
And stay strong to love
Now I close my eyes now
And I'm dreaming right where I belong

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling,
I'm feeling
I feel your hands and your lips and the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling,
I'm feeling
I feel your hands and your lips and the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Am I a dreamer
Am I a dreamer
