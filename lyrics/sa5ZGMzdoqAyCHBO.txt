Went back home again
This sucks, gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now, I turn around
Turn my back on everything
Turn my back on everything

Everything's changing when I turn around
I'm out of my control
I'm a Mobile
Everything's changing when I turn around
I'm out of my control
I'm a Mobile

Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the light
I'm waking up to say I've tried
Instead of waking up to another TV Guide
It's time now, I turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground

Everything's changing when I turn around
I'm out of my control
I'm a Mobile
Everything's changing out of what I know
Everywhere I go
I'm a Mobile
I'm a Mobile

Hanging from the ceiling
Life's a Mobile
Spinning 'round with mixed feelings
Crazy and wild
Sometimes I wanna scream out loud

Everything's changing everywhere I go
I'm out of my control
Everything's changing everywhere I go
Out of what I know

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...

Everything's changing when I turn around
I'm out of my control
I'm a Mobile
Everything's changing out of what I know
Everywhere I go
I'm a Mobile
Everywhere I go
I'm a Mobile
