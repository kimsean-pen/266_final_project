My love
Changes with the weather
And my heart
Red imitation leather

I'd give the world
But the world is never enough
For a girl
With it all
I guess
I'm just tricky to love

And it could be tricky to love

My love
A rush of every season
But vague
As time
A dedicated reason

I'd give the world
But the world is never enough
For a girl
With it all
I guess
I'm just tricky to love

I said all the right things
In all the right times
You never hear me out
I played all of your games
In all of my life
I feel so tricky to love

And it could be tricky to love

I said all the right things
In all the right times
You never hear me out
I played all of your games
In all of my life
I feel so tricky to love

And it could be tricky to love
