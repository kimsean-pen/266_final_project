I was dreamin' we were running from a city burning down, down, down.
Made a break, a new escape, and let the world crash, down, down, down.
Now there's a piece of me

Tells me I shouldn't leave
Everytime I see your face.
(Everytime I see your face.)
Because every time

You come around
Love you take my breath away.
And I just wanna breathe until I take you in.
I never want you to leave until I take you in.

(But the truth is...)
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).

She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
Get a grip, slip and trip, oh the clumsy careless words, words, words.
Paper-thin fingerprints on a softly spoken verse, verse, verse.

Now there's so much of me

Telling me not to leave
Everytime I see your face.
(Everytime I see your face.)
Because every time

You come around
How do you take my breath away.
And I just wanna breathe until I take you in.
I never want you to leave until I take you in.

(But the truth is...)

She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).

She's so close when I'm so far away, when I'm so far away
Let me dream, let me stay.
She's so close when I'm so far away, when I'm so far away

I can sleep, I can dream, I can change...
(Has no idea)
But I'm so far away
(That I'm even here.)

(She has no idea,)
Now I'm so far away.
(That I'm even here.)
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
She has no idea (no idea)
That I'm even here (that I'm even here).
(She has no idea, dea, dea)
She has no idea (no idea)
