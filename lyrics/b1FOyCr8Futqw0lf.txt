Hey
It might never be the same
We might never live those days
Gone by but we can try

Mornin'
Let's kick the babies out of bed
How 'bout you and me instead
Hangin' on, up and gone

Baby, hold on
(Let's start this over)
Baby, hold on
(We're not much older now)

Baby, hold on
(If you still see what I see)
Keep holdin' on
Hold on to me

Baby
It's good to see you smile again
I know we can't escape
So let's pretend we're someplace else

It's a new day
Let's look at all we've got
It's everything we thought
We ever wanted, it's beautiful

Baby, hold on
(Let's start this over)
Baby, hold on
(We're not much older now)

Baby, hold on
(If you still see what I see)
Keep holdin' on
Hold on to me

I look across the room, catch you staring at me
And see the love we almost left behind
So lead me by the hand and let's make up
Let's make up for lost time

Baby, hold on
(Let's start this over)
Baby, hold on
(We're not much older)

Baby, hold on
(If you still see what I see)
Keep holdin' on

Baby, hold on
(Hold on to me)
Baby, hold on
(Just hold on to me)

Baby, hold on
(Hold on to me)
Keep holding on

Hey
It might never be the same
We might never live those days
Gone by but we can try
