I can't let you do this
I don't know if I'm ever
Gonna to be the same
Oh boy, this gotta be more
To this
Just tell me that
I'll hold you in my arms
Again
I know you're telling me
You're leaving
But all I wanna do is
Hold you now
And hear the sound of your
Heart beating
If there's a way
To stop this, show me how
Show me how
Show me how
There's a way to stop this, show me how
There's a way to stop this, show me how
I can't let you do this
I don't know
If I'm ever gonna be the same
Oh boy, this gotta be more to this
Just tell me that
I'll hold you in my arms
Again
I know you're telling me you're leaving
But all I wanna do is
Hold you now
And hear the sound of your heart beating
If there's a way to stop this
Show me how
Show me how
There's a way to stop this
Show me how
There's a way to stop this
Show me how
