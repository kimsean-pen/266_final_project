It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out into the towns
How the heaven's they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain washed histories
When we're do not need to be told

Show me now
Show me the arms aloft
Every eye

Trained on a different star
This magic
This drunken semaphore

We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time
We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time

I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
As the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets
Show me now
Show me the arms aloft
Every eye
Trained on a different star
This magic
This drunken semaphore

We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time
We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time
We are listening
And we're not blind
This is your life
This is your time
