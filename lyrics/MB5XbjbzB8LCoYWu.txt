Well Billy rapped all night about his suicide
Said he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive when you're 25
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freddie's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race

The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man, I need TV when I got T.Rex?
Oh brother, you guessed, I'm a dude now

All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news
All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news

Billy's looking sweet 'cos he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love, oh yes, we can love
And my father's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
He never got it off with that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags

Well I drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
I gotta raise some cat to bed
Oh man, is that concrete all around or is it in my head?
Brother, I'm a dude now

All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news
All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news

All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news
All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news
All the young dudes, carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, carry the news
