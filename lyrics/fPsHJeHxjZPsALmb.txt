I've heard it said that the weight of the world's problems
Is enough to make the ball fall right through space
That it ain't even worth it to live
With all that's goin' wrong
Let me just go down as saying
That I'm glad to be here
Here with all the same pain and laughs
Everybody knows
Some men think they're born to be king
Maybe that's true
But I think passing love around
Is all we were born to do
Let them build their kingdoms
Let them make the laws for this world to heed
'Cause you and I make life worth living
Right here in each other's arms
I'm here to love you, baby
No more loneliness yeah
No more emptiness
I'm here to love you, yeah yeah
Let them build their kingdoms
Let them make the laws for this world to heed
'Cause you and I make life worth living
Right here in each other's arms
I'm here to love you, baby
(I'm here to love you) no more loneliness
(I'm here tolove you) yeah
(I'm here to love you) no more emptiness
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you (I'm here to love you)
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you
I'm here to love you
Just let me go on loving you (Just let me go on loving you)
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way (Don't stop me)
Just let me go on loving you Yeah yehyeah
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way (Just let me go on now)
Just let me go on loving you (I'm here to love you)
Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way (Babe)
