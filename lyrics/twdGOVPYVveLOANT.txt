Every night when I see you play
How it happened well it's hard to say
You're feeling cold inside
Your woman flied now

Going out and she played away
You were the last one is all I'll say
Come on in tonight
Well it's warmer than out there

This can't go on forever, come on

Don't ache too long
For the woman who led your heart to break
Too long
Come on over and we'll roll till the morning
Ache too long
For the woman who promised more than
Wait, hang on
I'm coming over to the hotel

Tell me now it was hit and run
And you know it how it all went wrong
Your woman's real gone now
Better it ended

I'd love to know, about now

Don't ache too long
For the woman who led your heart to
Break too long
Come on over and we'll roll til the morning
Ache too long
For the woman who promised more than
Wait, hang on
I'm coming over to the hotel
