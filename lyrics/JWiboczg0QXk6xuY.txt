How many roads must a man walk down?
Before they call him a man
And how many seas must a white dove sail?
Before she sleeps in the sand

Now, how many times
Must those canon balls be fired?
Before they're forever banned, woah, yeah

Let me tell you that the answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind, woah, woah, yeah

Now, how many years can a mountain exist?
Before it's washed to the sea, yeah
Now, how many years can a man exist?
Before he's allowed to be free

Now, how many times
Can a man turn his head?
And he pretends that he just
Doesn't see, woah, yeah

You know the answer, my friend
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind, oh huh

And let me tell you it's blowin', blowin'
And it's blowin', woah
The answer is blowin' in the wind

And it's blowin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The answer is blowin' in the wind
