Let's Go!
You keep buying me things to try to win my heart, but it's not smart
That's no way to my heart but there's another way, and so I say:
Don't need fancy things
It's not how you're ever winning me
Just be my GameBoy, I'll be your GameGirl
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I-I want you to be my player two
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I'm on my knees, so baby come play with me
Let's Go!
Let's play video games
All night and through the day (Through the day)
Oh, everyday!
Look I'm down on my knees
Oh baby won't you please?
Come play with me!
I just want to play
With you 'till we've beaten every game
Just be my GameBoy, I'll be your GameGirl
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I-I want you to be my player two
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I'm on my knees, so baby come play with me!
Let's Go!
My Pokémon it grows for you
Like mario eating mushrooms
Just touch it and it will evolve
Then put it in your pokéball
Like pac-mans' pills I will eat you
Go down like space invaders do
I'll link your zelda to my tool
Your princes peach takes my toad stool
My angry bird, it will not miss
Yes perfect fit, just like Tetris
And when you Diddy my Donkey kong
Ill mash that key pad all night long
Like Sonics rings I just want more
With you I'll get the highest score
Finish the game, yeah in a Blur
Now im done so:
GAME OVER!
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I-I wan't you to be my player two
Be my GameBoy Yo-o-o-o
Gameboy Yo-
I'm on my knees, so baby come play with me
Play with me, Play with me
Im begging you please!
Play with me, Play with me
I'm down on me knees!
Let's Go!
