It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot

Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and buried

And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless

Well we could be children from the way we're acting
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action
We just breed and we lose our nerve
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world

And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless
Everybody's restless

And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless
Everybody's restless

Restless
Everybody's restless
Restless
Everybody's restless
Restless
Everybody's restless
Restless
Everybody's restless

Restless
Restless
Everybody's just restless out here
