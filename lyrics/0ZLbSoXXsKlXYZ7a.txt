I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor from nine to four
In between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room
I'm talkin to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday my Sunday dreams to dry
Now man is born to come a-lovin'
And a woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And down her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moanin' all the mornin'
Moanin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waitin' for my baby
'Til he come around, 'til he come around
