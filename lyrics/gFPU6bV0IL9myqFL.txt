In the east we love like water
Put the needle in the drawer, see over
A blind eye here takes you for a spin
Shove the past a thimble to shove under
Nothing less till even sins
A blind eye there takes you for a spin

I am secret
I am secret in here
Just like the waves they aracade in
I am secret
I am secret in here
Float on the timber
Draw me in

He ya hey ya heya
Hey ya heya hey ya
Heya heya he ya

Here's how it goes, hold me now
Here's how it's born
Overdraught and overgrown
So the story is

I was secret
I was secret in there
Just like the waves they arcade in
I was secret
I was secret in there
Float on the timber
Draw me in

He ya hey ya heya
Hey ya heya hey ya
Heya heya he ya
