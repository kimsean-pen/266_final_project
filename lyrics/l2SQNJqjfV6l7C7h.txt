Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
See, I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, is ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love

And woah
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
Throw 'em back as I lose count

I, I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I, I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I, I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I said I, I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
Until morning light, until morning light

The sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

And woah
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
1-2-3, 1-2-3, drink
Throw 'em back as I lose count

I, I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I, I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I, I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I said I, I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
