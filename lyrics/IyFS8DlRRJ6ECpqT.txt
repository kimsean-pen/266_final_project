These are all words lost in dreams
Travelling the speed that blood pumps
I feel your breath which carries my hope

In the way ships pass at night
Making the ends of world map
Every word announces storms

It's like stepping from the door
There is no prayer and no war

In the way ships pass at night
Endless looping chains of wombs
Go forever, hurry you're...

Moving streetlights spill out white
I don't want to say goodbye
But as I wake it begins to loosen
