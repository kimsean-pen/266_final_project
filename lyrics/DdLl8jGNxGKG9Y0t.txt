Never know but nothing less
Couldn't see that I have guessed
Couldn't see, couldn't stay away

Never even stopped to dream and
That I'd see anything and
The world is coming out so cold

Oh and it's raining again
Light on your car light, the bullets on tin
Oh and it's raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Nothing here but nothing less
Cold heart is stuck in this
Couldn't say the kindest words we knew

Everything I tried to say
But no one listens anyway
I had to give up everything I knew

Oh and it's raining again
Light on your car light, the bullets on tin
Oh and it's raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Oh and it's raining
Raining again
Oh and it's raining
Raining again

Nothing here but nothing less
Everything we both regret
Couldn't say the kindest words we knew

'Cause it was winter time and
We wanted some more time and
We watched the girls try something knew

Didn't even stopped to see that
That it was breaking me and
The world is coming out so cold

What you want you couldn't get, you
Couldn't wait for something less, you
Had to give up everything you knew

Oh and it's raining again
Light on your car light, the bullets on tin
Oh and it's raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Oh and it's raining again
Light on your car light, the bullets on tin
Oh and it's raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down
Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down

Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down
Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down

Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down
Sadness like water
Raining down, raining down

Oh and it's raining
Raining again
Oh and it's raining
Raining again
