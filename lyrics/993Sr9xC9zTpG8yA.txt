Should I be afraid?
You don't seem to be
All I want to be is you
You don't seem to be
All I want to be is you
Can I make it clear
You are everything, everything is you
You are everything, everything is you

Don't tell me who I am
You know the circles are running
Don't try to be this man
Let me stay, let me stay if I want to
Feeding form your hand like an automatic body
But you tryina be this man
Let me stay, let me stay if I want to

Should I be afraid?
Everything I do is because of you
Everything I do is because of you
Am I standing still?
I can feel my feet moving without me
I can feel my feet moving without me

Don't tell me who I am
You know the circles are running
Don't try to be this man
Let me stay, let me stay if I want to
Feeding form your hand like an automatic body
But you tryina be this man
Let me stay, let me stay if I want to

You are everything, everything is you you you-uuu
You are everything, everything is you you you-uuu
You are everything, everything is you you you-uuu
