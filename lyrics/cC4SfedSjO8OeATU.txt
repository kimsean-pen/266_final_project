In this autumn rain
We're blessed with autumn skies (autumn skies)

I'm doing it for myself
Not somebody else
I'm doing it for myself

Calling out in shame
Silence engrained
Crying out your name
Something wrong but beautiful, so beautiful

In this awesome rage
Rejecting compromise (compromise)

Undoing it for myself
Not somebody else
Undoing for myself

Calling out in shame
Silence engrained
Crying out your name
Something wrong but beautiful, so beautiful

Like the dead fade away
Life a debt... fade away

Calling out in shame
Silence engrained
Crying out your name
Something wrong but beautiful, so beautiful

Calling out in shame
Silence engrained
