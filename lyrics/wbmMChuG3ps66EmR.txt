We're like crystal
(hey)
We break easy
(hoo)
I'm a poor man
(hey)
If you leave me
(hoo)

I'm applauded
(hey)
Then forgotten
It was summer
(hey)
Now it's autumn
(hoo)

I don't know what to say

You don't care anyway

I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed

Here comes love
It's like honey

You can't buy it with money

You're not alone anymore
You shock me to the core

You shock me to the core
(hoo... hey...)
We're like crystal
It's not easy
(hoo)
With your love
(hey)
You could feed me
(hoo)
Every man
(every man)
And every woman
(and every woman)
Needs someone
(hey)
So keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
(Keep it coming)
I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love
It's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
You shock me to the core
You shock me to the core
