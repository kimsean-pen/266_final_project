We started as friends
And then I slept in your bed
Now I'm guilty as sin
We were drinking again
You got under my skin
Now its complicated
You've been swimming in my head
Tidal waves still crashing in
Now it's hard to believe
But I finally see, that my heart was asleep
(Cuz I'm missing you)
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
If you give me a shot
I'll give you all that I got
Do you want me or not?
Do you want me or not?!
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you

I've been drinking too much
I'm a little fucked up
Maybe I wasn't enough
(Maybe I wasn't enough)
Can you show me a sign?
Tell me I'm on your mind
Even if its a lie (even if its a lie)
Cuz I've been blowin' up your phone
Caving in, I'm losing hope
Going out of my head
Spinning up in the air
So tell me this is this end
(Cuz I'm missing you)
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
If you give me a shot
I'll give you all that I got
Do you want me or not?
Do you want me or not?!
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you

You know I'm Missing You
(Missing You)
Don't leave me before
I'm done with tour
Don't leave me love
Because I've got enough
(Cuz I'm missing you)
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
If you give me a shot
I'll give you all that I got
Do you want me or not?
Do you want me or not?!
Now
Missing you, missing you, missing you
You know I'm missing you
