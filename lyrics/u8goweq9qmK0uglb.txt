I was the one
I who could
Pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet
And I gave you my love
(Ain't gon' let you go)

You are the one that got me started
You coulda let me
Love anyone, but I only wanted you
So why did it make me cry?
Why didn't you come get me one last time?

You'll always know
Reason why
We could have had
The moon and the sky

You'll always know
Reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go
(Ain't gon' let you go)

You laid me down, left me for lions
Long, long time ago
You left me there dyin'
(Ain't gon' let you go)
But you'll never let me go

You'll always know
Reason why
We could have had
The moon and the sky

You'll always know
Reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go
(Ain't gon' let you go)
You'll always know the reason why

The song you heard will stay on your mind
It ain't gon' let you go, no
'Cause you have the moon
And I, the endless sky
You'll always know (You have the dreams and I'll always have every star)
Reason why (Every one of them twinklin')
We could have had (And they wonder what you thinkin')
The moon and the sky
You'll always know
Reason why this love
Reason why this love
And I gave you my love
(Ain't gon' let you go)
(Ain't gon' let you go)
You'll always know (You have the dreams and I'll always have every star)
Reason why (Every one of them twinklin')
We could have had (And they wonder what you thinkin')
The moon and the sky
You'll always know
We had the moon and the sky above
