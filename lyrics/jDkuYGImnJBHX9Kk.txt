You act like you're already dead
Looping a dream of a past you'd kill to relive
Worthless sentiment, inward conceit
Years of your life cannibalized

Never forget that it's not what you've done
Or what you've done lately, but what you are working on now

Crimes of denial
Crimes of reverie
Crimes of homage
Crimes of vanity

I can't live like that
I can't live like that
I won't fucking live like that
