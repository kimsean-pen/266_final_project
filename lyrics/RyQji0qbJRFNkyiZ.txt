Golden, Golden, Golden River Run
To the East Then Drop Beneath the Sun
And as the Moon Lies Low and Overhead
We're Lost

Burn Slow, Burning Up the Back Wall
Long Roads, Where the City Meets the Sky
Most Days, Most Days Stay the Sole Same
Please Stay, for This Fear It Will Not Die

If I Had a Boat, I Would Sail to You
Hold You in My Arms, Ask You to Be True
Once I Had a Dream, It Died Long Before
Now I'm Pointed North, Hoping for the Shore

Down Low, Down Amongst the Thorn Rows
Weeds Grow, Through the Lilies and the Vine
Birds Play, Try to Find Their Own Way
Soft Clay, on Your Feet and Under Mine

If I Had a Boat, I Would Sail to You
Hold You in My Arms, Ask You to Be True
Once I Had a Dream, It Died Long Before
Now I'm Pointed North, Hoping for the Shore

Splitting at the Seams
Heaving at the Brace
Sheets All Billowing
Breaking of the Day
Sea Is Not My Friend
And Everyone Conspires
Still I Choose to Swim
Slip Beneath the Tide

Once I Had a Dream
Once I Had a Hope
That Was Yesterday
Not So Long Ago
This Is Not the End
This Is Just the World
Such a Foolish Thing
Such an Honest Girl

If I Had a Boat, I Would Sail to You
Hold You in My Arms, Ask You to Be True
Once I Had a Dream, It Died Long Before
Now I'm Pointed North, Hoping for the Shore
