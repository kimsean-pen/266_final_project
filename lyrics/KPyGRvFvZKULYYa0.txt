If everything you do has got a hold on me
Then everyhting I do has got a hole in it
I've been here before, I should be used to it
But I can't take it no more, I can't take it no more
Oh whoah

Your mangled heart
Your battered love
It's hanging on to memories
You're letting go
Of everything that used to be
I've had enough
You built me up
To let me down

If everything I do has got a hole in it
Then everything you do has got a hold on me
I've been here before, I should be used to it
But I can't take it no more, I can't take it no more
Oh whoah

Your mangled heart
Your battered love
It's hanging on to memories
You're letting go
Of everything that used to be
I've had enough
You built me up
To let me down

I don't want the world
I only want what I deserve
I don't want the world, the world
I only want what I deserve
I don't want the world, the world
I only want what I deserve

Your mangled heart
Your battered love
It's hanging on to memories
You're letting go
Of everything that used to be
I've had enough
You built me up
To let me down
