Don't cry no more
Wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby
Wipe away your tears

And you know, I know
That your love is real
Don't cry, don't cry
I'ma begging
Don't cry no more, baby

I'm begging you
Every tear I shed
Tells me that your love is true

You cried me a river
You cried me a sea
And now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me

Don't cry no more
You cried me a river
You cried me a sea
And now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me

Don't cry no more
Wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby
Wipe away your tears
Don't you know, I know
That your love is real?

Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry no more, baby
Don't cry no more, baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry no more, baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry
