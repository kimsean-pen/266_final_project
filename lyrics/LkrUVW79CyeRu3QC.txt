I guess I'm alright, guess I'm alright
I guess I'm doing fine, guess I'm doing fine
D'you think I miss you? D'you think I care?
D'you think I'll lie here and die?

You never even tried
You never even tried

Now it's about time, it's the right time
If you willed your mind, you willed your mind
So fly on swift now on your journey home
And you've left the nest now and you have flown

Ain't nothing you don't know
Ain't nothing you don't know

Look out to sea
And tell me what we came here for
Is it what they say?
Or is it more than we can know?

And if so, which way am I to go?
Which way am I to go?

I guess I'm alright, guess I'm alright
I guess I'm doing fine, guess I'm doing fine
Can't see no reasons, and not much to do
So make like the wind that's blowing you

Ain't nothing you can't do
Ain't nothing you can't do
Ain't nothing you can't do
Ain't nothing you can't do
Ain't nothing you can't do

Do
Do
Do
