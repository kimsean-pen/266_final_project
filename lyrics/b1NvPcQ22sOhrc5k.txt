Ohhh, baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long, no
Mmm, you makin' dogs wanna beg
Breakin' them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now

Ohhh, see all these illusions just take us too long
And I want it bad...
Because you walk pretty, because you talk pretty
'Cause you make me sick, and I'm not leavin' till you're leavin'

Oh, I swear there's something when she's pumpin', askin' for a raise
Well does she want me to carry her home now?
So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt, my crew, my mind
My father's last name?

When I get you alone
When I get you you'll know, babe
When I get you alone
When I get you alone

Oh, come on
Yeah, yeah

Baby girl you da sh...
That makes you my equivalent
Well you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight, all right
All my dawgs talkin' fast:
Ain't you got some photographs?
'Cause you shook that room like a star, now
Yes you did, yes you did

All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad...
Because you walk city, because you talk city
'Cause you make me sick, and I'm not leavin' till you're leavin'

So I pray to something she aint bluffin', rubbin' up on me
Well does she want me to make a vow?
Check it, well does she want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my voice, my crew, my mind
My father's last name?

When I get you alone
When I get you you'll know, babe
When I get you alone
When I get you alone

Oohh...
When I get you alone
