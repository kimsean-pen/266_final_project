Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked down the football
Mine, something inside
I'll never ever follow
So give… me… some… thing… that… is… for… real
I'll never ever follow

Get your boogie on

Get your boogie on

Hate, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off again no
Why? This st inside
Now everyone will follow
So give… me… noth… ing… just… feel
And all the st will follow
God thanks me

The more I see the lie
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Oh, I say…
God thanks me
They'll never see the light
Didn't want us to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Oh, I say...

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something torn from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside always beating me
You'll never see
So come dance with me

Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!
God thanks me
The more I see the lie
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already Got The Life
Oh, I say…
God thanks me
They'll never see the light.
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
