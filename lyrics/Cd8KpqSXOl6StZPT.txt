Late last night or was it morning
Outside the rain was pouring
I stumbled out I hit the ground
It's a hell of a scene but there's no story
Designed in all it's glory
To set you up and knock you down

Just a reflection on my bitterness
Why plant the seed and not do the rest?
Just a distraction from the meaningless
I'd rather bleed than settle for less

Was told at the time to just keep going
You'll fly but don't stop rowing
Reached for the moon and hit the ground
Is this a chip upon my shoulder?
As heavy as a boulder?
When all the world owes you a crown

Just a reflection on my emptiness
You don't succeed by chasing success
No reputation is worth all this mess
I'd rather bleed than settle for less

Just a reflection on my happiness
Only compete with yourself at your best
A separation from the self I possess
Just let it be and settle for less
