How could you know, how could you know?

That those were my eyes
Peepin through the floor, it's like they know
It's like they know I'm looking from the outside

and creeping to the door, it's like they know
And now they coming, yeah, now they coming
Out from the shadows
To take me to the court because they know
Gotta shut this down, cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the warant cuz' they know
You understand, I got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us

I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous

How could they know, how could they know
What I been thinking?
Because they know, what I been hidin'

They're right under my bed, they're in control
Here they come, yeah here they come
Out of the shadows
To take me to the club because they know
Gotta shut this down, cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up a warant cuz' they know
And I've gotta get out of here
Sink down, into the dark
Keep on running
And I've gotta get out of here, (keep on running)

Sink down, into the dark
You understand, I got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
