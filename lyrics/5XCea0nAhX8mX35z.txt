The party's all right, I might wanna stop drinking
What were we talking about?
My body won't tell my mind what I've been thinking
Before it's out of my mouth
The minute I get upset, that's it, it's over
I'm already out of the room
Why can't I just forget that what I know's gonna hurt?
There's not much else I can do

I'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone else
Well everybody says I oughta get over myself
I'm thinking I can't move
If there isn't somewhere else to go

I've probably made mistakes that I've forgotten
It's all ambiguous now
I've been willing to take the shape of what you wanted
I could just figure it out

I'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone else
Well everybody says I oughta get over myself
I'm thinking I can't move
If there isn't somewhere else to go

I'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone else
Well everybody says I oughta get over myself
I'm thinking I can't move
If there isn't somewhere else to go, whoa, whoa
It's changing my issues as far as I can tell
But everybody says I oughta get over myself
I'm thinking I can't lose
If there isn't somewhere else to go
