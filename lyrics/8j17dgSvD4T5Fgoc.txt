Oh, Mr James Dean, he don't
Belong to anything.
Oh he left before they could get him,
With their ways, their wicked ways.
Oh Marilyn Monroe, where did you go?
I didn't hear all your stories
I didn't see all your glory.

But the footballers wife tells her troubles and strife
I just dont care in the end who is she to pretend
That she's one of them
I dont think so.
And the girl from that show
Yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes you know who you are.
I dont think so. I dont think so.

Oh Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire
Wont you dance for me 'cause I just dont care
What's going on today, I think there's something more,
Something more.
And Im gone with the wind like they were before.
But Im believing myself I think there's something more
There must be something more, I think there's something more,
Something more.

But the footballers wife tells her troubles and strife
I just dont care in the end who is she to pretend
That she's one of them
I dont think so.
And the girl from that show
Yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes you know who you are.
I dont think so. I dont think so.

Oh I dont believe in the telling of your stories
Throughout your life, there's just something unappealing it
Dont catch my eye
It dont catch my eye.
Oh I dont believe in the selling of your glories before you
Leave this life
There's so much more to see, I dont believe this is how the
World should be.

But the footballers wife tells her troubles and strife
I just dont care in the end who is she to pretend
That she's one of them
I dont think so.
And the girl from that show
Yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes you know who you are.
I dont think so. I dont think so.
