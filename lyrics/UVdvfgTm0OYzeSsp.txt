I've been in heaven and underground
maybe now I'm just lost and found
living in a false fantasy
safe from ruthless reality

I'm stranded in this paradise
so tell me what to sacrifice
to get out of this tragedy
out of insanity

Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
behind every choice
Living under a spell
24/7
Lost in confusion
ignorance and illusion

I want out of insanity!

I suffer like a hollow soul
trying to be complete and whole
I'm dreaming like a madman
about things I don't understand

I'm stranded in this paradise
so tell me what to sacrifice
to get out of this tragedy
out of insanity

Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
behind every choice
Living under a spell
24/7
Turn the lights
on tonight

Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?
Living under a spell
24/7
Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?

"Listen to me
What if
we only believe that we can choose our reality?
What if
the truth we know is just a profitable fantasy?
If we view the world with closed eyes
and only look after ourselves
it's easy to swallow all the juicy lies
But who's gonna clean up the mess?
So I ask you one more time:"

Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
behind every choice
Living under a spell
24/7

Is familiar hell
better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
behind every choice
Living under a spell
24/7
Turn the lights
on tonight
