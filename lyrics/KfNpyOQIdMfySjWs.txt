Though I can't put my hands in you I can feel you now
In the bones and the blood flowing needles on the ground
In the ether I sail to you floating on the fumes
Run aground on the shore for you simple wreckage

Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow
I only know I've made it home when I drown in you ghost light

Though I can't put a name on you I will cry it out
In my heart I will hold what my bloody hands have dropped
Run around on the floor for you simple wreckage

Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow
I only know I've made it home when I drown in you ghost light

Taree! Taree! Taree!
