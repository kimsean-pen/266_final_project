Origami (or or or ori o or I ga mi)
Origami (or or or ori o or I)

You got a head full of paper, but baby nothing like origami
Shredded thoughts and make up won't make up for the missing piece of mind
I saw you look in the mirror, the scenery was suddenly boring

It's the end of an era
Forever is just a state of mind
You're last of your kind

I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do
I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do about it (do about it)

You were blessed with precision so I took you to the beaches of Bali
It wasn't fate but decision, luck was choosing sides
Flip the page to a silver age
Life has treated you kindly

The price you pay is your vision
Collision is highly likely

I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do
I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do about it (do about it)

I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do
I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do about it (do about it)

I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do
(Origami)
I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do about it (do about it)

I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do
(Origami)
I stole your diamonds and gold
What are you going to do about it (do about it)
