I think I'm gonna be fine
I got enough stoned food and wine
I think I'm gonna be fine
I'm happy all the time

I think like I'll dress like a ship
I think I'll do it on a trip
Kill everybody who's hip
Shoot 'em from the lip

Mood rider
Hey, mood driver
Alone

I think I'm turning to dust
Love is turning to lust
I think I'm turning to dust
Only as I must

Mood rider
Hey, mood driver
Alone

Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh-ooh
