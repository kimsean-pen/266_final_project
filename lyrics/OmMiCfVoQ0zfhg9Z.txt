Oh, darling
Pick you up just to let you drop
We got started, I was guarded
I almost forgot about you
It was charming
The way we danced around the truth
You were smiling, always hiding
And then I feel we're somehow quickly, slowing

Thought I was healthy, but I'm choking
It must be catching up my smoking
I wish that I never played

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you got something to say, to go
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you got something to say, to go
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You wanna make it okay

What's the problem?
Spilling up some of my guts
One day you're fine, next you're crying
Suddenly your engine just stops going

Thought you were healthy but you're choking
It must be catching up your smoking
I wish that you never played

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you got something to say, to go
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you got something to say, to go
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You wanna make it okay

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
I give us something to say, to go
And he's got a debt to pay back
For something he did way back

You're standing out in the rain, tonight
Like you got something to say, to go
And you got a debt to pay back
For something you did way back
You wanna make it okay
