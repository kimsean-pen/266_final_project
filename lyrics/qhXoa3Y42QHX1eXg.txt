It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the cut of your pretty gown.
Your come-on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose.

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather around
Like it's your birthday.
I don't want to know just what gonna do
I don't care where you're going I'm coming along with you

Walking her home with the grassy field
Falling and laughing at the drinks we've spilled.
Just one of those nights that I have to share
Chasing the death without a care.

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather around
Like it's your birthday.
I don't want to know just what gonna do
I don't care where you're going I'm coming home with you

You know I love the way you curve.

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather around
Like it's your birthday.
I don't want to know just what gonna do
I don't care where you're going I'm coming home with you
