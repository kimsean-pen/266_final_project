Boom, boom, boom, heh, heh
Ready for action, nip it in the butt
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all but see my nigga went to do a little actin'
Now that's for anyone askin', give me one pass em'
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks (thanks!)
So click-it or ticket, lets see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat rasslin'
Speakerbox vibrate the tank,
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the back
But I know ya'll wanted that 808
Can you feel that b-a-s-s, bass
But I know ya'll wanted that 808
Can you feel that b-a-s-s, bass
I like the way you move
I like the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
The whole room fell silent
The girls all pause with glee
Turning left turning right, hardly looking at me
But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore
Specially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination in this world
So keep your hands off my cheeks,
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny, slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember
Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex
Male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Now let me listen to the stories you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the loco
I like the way you move
I like the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
Hey baby, girl don't you stop
Come on, baby dance all around me
You so fine (you so fine) you so fine
You drive me outta my mind (outta my mind, outta my mind) (ooooh baby)
If I could I would, just be with you baby
Ooooooh 'cause you love me and excite me
And you know you gotta leave baby! (oooooh!)
I like the way you move (I like the way you move)
I like the way you move (ooh you so sexy baby!) (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move (I love the way you move)
I love the way you move (oooh you so sexy baby!) (whoo-o-o)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I like the way you move
I like the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move (whoo-o-o!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
