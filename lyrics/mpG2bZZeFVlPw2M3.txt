Seven Thunders Roar
Over flooded shore
Pilgrim have you lost your way

Many lands you've seen
Through the lens of green
Now hangover saves the day

Looks like you're still young
Shining like the Sun
But inside you're almost dead

Searching for yourself
On an empty shelf
Magic potions never help, they never help

Bright Like The Morning
She descends from up above
Sweet like my yearning
She's the One for she is Love

Sailing seas of hope
Climbing up the rope
There's a chance to start again

Things to realize
Hiding in disguise
Pilgrim's journey never ends, it never ends

Bright Like The Morning
She descends from up above
Sweet like my yearning
She's the One for she is Love

Cold like the Knowning
She needs patience, she needs time
Bright Like The Morning
She's the One for she is my Love

Seven Thunders Roar
Over flooded shore
Pilgrim have you lost your way
