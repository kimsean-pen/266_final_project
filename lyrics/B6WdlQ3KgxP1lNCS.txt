Like It's Her Birthday
Tonight I kinda get the feeling
My girl is up to something
Something that is no good.
She said she only had a meeting
But she is dressed for something
Something that is no good.
Now I'm not saying that she's cheating
But seeing is believing
Can't believe it

What I'm seeing when I stepped inside.
She's so wasted
Acting crazy
Making a scene
Like it's her birthday.
Drinking champagne
Going insane

Falling on me
Like it's her birthday.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
This ain't the night I thought it'd be.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
She ain't shy, apparently.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
You can hear the crowd and everybody sings.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Just like it's her birthday.
She turns and says don't be surprised
It's gonna be a good night
A good, good night.
She's showing me a different side
What I've never seen before
That I adore.
Cause when I'm up she's all about me
When I'm down

She spins around me

Now I know I'm one and only
So I might as well enjoy the ride.
She's so wasted
Acting crazy
Making a scene
Like it's her birthday.

Drinking champagne
Going insane
Falling on me
Like it's her birthday.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
This ain't the night I thought it'd be.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
She ain't shy, apparently.

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
You can hear the crowd and everybody sings.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Just like it's her birthday.

Like it's her birthday.
Like it's her birthday.
Like it's her birthday.
Like it's her birthday.
...
She's so wasted
...
Acting crazy

Making a scene
Like it's her birthday.
Drinking champagne
Going insane
Falling on me
Like it's her birthday.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
This ain't the night I thought it'd be.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
She ain't shy, apparently.
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
This ain't the night I thought it'd be.
You can hear the crowd and everybody sings.
Just like it's her birthday
