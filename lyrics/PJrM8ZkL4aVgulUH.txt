Boy, we've had a real good time, and
I wish you the best on your way, eh-eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place
Eh-eh, eh-eh

I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliqu√©es, eh-eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other, and that's money, eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh

I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh

I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, wish he never looked at me that way

Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh, wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, eh-eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Eh-eh, eh-eh, oh yeah
All I can say is "eh, eh"
