Slippin' off the edge
Out of phase
Watchin' you pretend
We're okay
Every weekend, we hitchhike to hell
And you only think of yourself

If we're going down
We're going down in flames
Flying round the highway
We're trying to get away
Don't speak
I'll try to save us from ourselves
If were going down
We're going down in flames
Going down in flames

Burnin' on your tongue
Every minute
We're too young
Couldn't see it
Every weekend, we hitchhike to hell
And you only think of yourself

If we're going down
We're going down in flames
Flying round the highway
We're trying a get away
Don't speak
I'll try to save us from ourselves
If we're going down
We're going down in flames
Going down in flames

Do you dream about me
Looking to buy gold
Do you dream about me
About me
About me

If we're going down
We're going down in flames
Flying round the highway
We're trying a get away
Don't speak
I'll try to save us from ourselves
If were going down
We're going down in flames
Going down in flames
