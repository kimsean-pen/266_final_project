Merry Christmas from the pines
Hallelujah, amen
Just another wish, just another dream
Just a witch who comforts you
When you're dying
When you're dying

America
America
I cry, Lord, to have used you
How could I, of all, to have used you?

If you're already there
Then you're already dead
If you're living in America, whoa
Our heroes are bred
They just got nothing to lose
Because they're all living in America, whoa
In America, whoa

And the movie girl said
You walked in on set
But you only play yourself,
You're Hollywood.
