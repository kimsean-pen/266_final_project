You ask me to be stone again
Been wading out here for awhile
At least the weight could be the end
But not likely

And it's draining
And it's draining

You see my shadow coming in
Dirty sheets pulled to your chin
Maybe we can now begin
But not likely

And it's draining
And it's draining
We're evading
And it's draining

You've asked me before
You've asked me
To consider operating

We've been here before
We've been here
The delivery's no good

We'll leave it alone
We'll leave it
That's when we start repeating

Don't ask anymore
Don't ask me
The delivery's no good

And it's draining
And it's draining
We're evading
And it's draining
And its draining
And it's draining
