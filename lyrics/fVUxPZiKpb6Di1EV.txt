It's 9PM
I'm feeling like myself again as I watch the cars go by
The way it's been
It's kept me close to darkness but now all I see is light

'Cause something always changed
But I don't feel so different underneath it after all
And I still make mistakes
But now I don't need anyone to catch me when I fall
And I fell

Don't need anyone to catch me when I fall
Don't need anyone to catch me

I don't believe
I don't believe in hiding what you know you really feel
That wasn't me
I swear that wasn't me who told you love was never real

'Cause something always changed
But I don't feel so different underneath it after all
And I still make mistakes
But now I don't need anyone to catch me when I fall
And I fell

Don't need anyone to catch me when I fall
Don't need anyone to catch me when I fall

Myself again, myself again
I feel
Myself again, myself again
I feel like
Myself again, myself again
I feel
Myself again, myself again

Don't need anyone to catch me when I fall
But now I don't anyone to catch me when I fall
