Outside somewhere the shadows roll
I only know what I am told
So hurry, slowly all of you
So hurry slowly through the truth
Our grooves are set in another life
An open trail of falling signs
Uncertainty but all mine

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade
Don't be the hand that pulls
Different aims from different bows

Through mist and sun and gales and showers
No season to where my love begins
But maybe I'm not ready for
But maybe you weren't ready for
The big wheels trip you up inside
Nothing can trip the changing sign
Uncertainty, but not mine

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade
Don't be the hand that pulls
Different aims from different bows

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade

Just let me be there one more time
We'll go together one last time
There may be other chances, but I
Know darker thoughts seep in and overtake

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade
Don't be the hand that pulls
Different aims from different bows

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade
Don't be the curtain fall
Another cursed gathering ball

Don't be the hand that takes
Lulls my forest serenade
