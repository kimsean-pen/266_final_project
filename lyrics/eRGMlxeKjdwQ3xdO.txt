I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
We keep the fuckin' lights on

Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple colored lipgloss
Room with the saguaro

Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
'Fore I get way too adamant about it

Love the way you shiver
Dig into my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrison and Juliet
Legends never die

The TV hasn't worked in ages
Prolly got a shorter cable
Way too busy falling off the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy
You look like you're someone famous

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for, yeah

'Cause you're something like the summer
Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain
Finally wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby but it worked

The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could prolly read the label
Way too busy falling off the counter or the coffee table
Am I hallucinating
Why do you look hella famous

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for

I wanna make
Every single moment for you great
Fly away to Cairo or L.A
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time, waste time

I wanna make, yeah
Every single moment for you great, yeah
Fly away to Cairo or L.A, uh
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for

You're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin'
What I'm loving you for
