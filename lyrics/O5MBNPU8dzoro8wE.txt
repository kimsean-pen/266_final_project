Let's Not Forget This Place
Let's Not Neglect Our Race
Let Unity Become

Life On Earth Be One
So Let Me Take Your Hand
We Are But Grains Of Sand
Born Throught The Winds Of Time

Given A Special Sign
So Let's Take A Stand
And Look Around Us Now
People

Let's Take A Stand
And Look Around Us Now
People
Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah

To A Different Beat
Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah
Humanity's Lost Face
Let's Understand It's Grace

Each Day One At A Time
Each Life Including Mine

Let's Take A Stand
And Look Around Us Now
People
Let's Take A Stand
And Look Around Us Now
People Oh People Oh People

Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah
To A Different Beat
Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah
I've Seen The Rain Fall In Africa
Africa
I've Touched The Snow Of Alaska

Ta Da
I've Felt The Mists Of Niagara
Now I Believe
In You
Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah
To A Different Beat
Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh Eeeyay Oh By Yah
To A Different Beat
How Far We've Come
How Far To Go
To A Different Beat
Rain Does Not Fall
On One Roof Alone
To A Different Beat
