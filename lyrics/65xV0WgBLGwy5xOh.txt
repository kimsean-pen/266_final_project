See, I learn to keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
I learn to keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask
Gotta learn to keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on that rap-pap-pap-pap, target

Side (?) old car
Niggas gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got that yapa on him right now
And he ready to pull up right now
Shot up a nigga with the scope
Fuck that pussy shit, we sellin' dope
Turn the hood into Iraq
On the corner, flippin' that pack
AK-47 and lortabs
Drugs, a pound of fuckin' percocets
Feel asleep and woke up with that yapa
And he playin' with it right now

See, I learn to keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
I learn to keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask
Gotta learn to keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on that rap-pap-pap-pap, target

Trapped in that 44 camouflage
They are in (?), that's a real mirage
Jump out the side of a caravan
Flippin' that work, you the middle man
Got that penthouse with the dogs off it
You take that Roxies with some alcohol
You rob in the daytime
My choppas a gold mind, nigga
Pour the four and cut the four
You play with that dog food
You play with that, play with that
These niggas are runnin' a gun store
They come and kick in your front door
Those (?) got hoodies and money
Frank Lucas, a role model
Hit 'em and hit 'em and lick 'em up
And go get your own bottle

See, I learn to keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
I learn to keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask
Gotta learn to keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on that rap-pap-pap-pap, target
