And, behold, a cowboy came into town, dirty and worn
He had black eyes, long hair and lines that cut deep into his frown
He had the right hand of the devil strapped tightly to his side
And you could tell fear abandoned this outlaw in a previous life

Why? Looking but never seeing
Why? Searching but never finding
Why? For the kiss to bring his
Cold dead heart back to life

I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Last stand
I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Catch me if you can

He had the story of whisky on his breath and death in his eyes
You never heard him say a word, but the pistol shot straight through the lies
Looking for the new world going from dead town to town
But his compass is cracked and north is six feet underground

Why? Looking but never seeing
Why? Searching but never finding
Why? For the kiss to bring his
Cold dead heart back to life

I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Last stand
I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Catch me if you can

I towed the line for you

I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Last stand
I am, I am searching for you
Waiting, I am coming
First light, I am coming for you
Catch me if you can

If you ever cross a shadow in a wasted void
You tell him I'm here waiting for the last cowboy
