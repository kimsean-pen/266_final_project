white bird in a black cloud
you flap
eyes rolled back

medicine gave you a heart attack
big fight for a small right
first flight
into white light
pull the trigger love at first bite
big plan for a big man
tough change
for a tough guy
twitchin out the corner of your eye

white bird in a black cloud
rain comin down
thinkin "hey maybe we should turn this boat around"
heaven maybe freedom
whats the word
right i forgot
quiet is the closest thing we got
