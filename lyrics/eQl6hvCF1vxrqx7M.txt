An outlaw stand in a peasant land
In every face see Judas
The burden of love is so strange
The stubborn beast and the whiskey priest

Are hiding from the captains
The burden of love is so plain
Are they happy to see you? No
You always bring trouble

Cast a shadow on Mexico, denial doesn't change facts
Like most I'll come when I want things done
Please God don't let that change
The anguish of love at long range
Should've been a doctor, oh
Then they can see what they're getting

Oh no, don't blame Mexico
That's the feast that the whiskey priest may yet have to forgo

They ask for more than you bargained for
And then they ask for more
Oh no, don't blame Mexico
That's the feast that the whiskey priest may yet have to forgo

Rob me a color, make the sound duller, but never go away
Through teeth of sharks the autumn barks, and winter squarely bites me
Don't ever do this again

Dawn breaks in the southern states
And blindfolded he rests
The burden of loves last request

That's the feast that the whiskey priest may yet have to forgo
Oh no, don't blame Mexico
They ask for more than you bargained for
And then they ask for more

Oh no, don't blame Mexico
That's the feast that the whiskey priest may yet have to forgo
They ask for more than you bargained for
And then they ask for more
Rob me a color, make the sound duller, but never go away
