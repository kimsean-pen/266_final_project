Gently lay my head against the wall and listen
For the footsteps, outside, to fade out and disappear
Hold my breath, a pause suspended dust in silence
Exhale, relief, that's one less enemy
Or a saviour lost

I threw my eyes
So far into the void
A wager for the blind
I threw my eyes
So far into the void
Hours after hours

Waiting for the emptiness
To cultivate the night
The emptiness
Will soon deliver, soon deliver
Emptiness
A serenade to revelation
Emptiness will soon deliver me

Softly run my hands across the ground beneath me
Any trace of fabricated pride is washed away
Turn my faceless head against the raining skies
The dignity and power of this solitude
I am here to stay

I threw my eyes
So far into the void
Now all I see if you

I threw my eyes
So far into the void
And now I know
Now I know

Emptiness
Will cultivate the night
The emptiness
Will soon deliver, soon deliver
Emptiness
A serenade to revelation
Emptiness
Will soon deliver me
