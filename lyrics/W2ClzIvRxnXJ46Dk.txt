All day I think of you, what can I do?
Counting days away, while I hope you stay.
I thought this was the end of days that we'd spend.
I know it's hard to see another way, but darling.

Well is it too late to say that I wanted
to stay a little while longer?

And now all I see, are different parts of you.
We were so damn free, and it was just us two.

Well is it too late to say that I wanted
to stay until the end?

Elastic hearts, you bend but you don't break
you stretch, you give an inch, and then you take back what was mine before.
Elastic hearts, you burn me up inside.
You take me way too high just to shun me far away from the light.
