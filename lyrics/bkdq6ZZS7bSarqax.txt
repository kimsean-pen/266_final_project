Oh, Tom is young and tom is bold
Tom is as Bold as a night of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing we won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's lead
Then he rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed.

Oh, Tom's old mum is a dying lass
Soon they reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But she's still got enough strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses himself for the life he's lead
Then she rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed.

Oh, bless your taxman bless his soul
He may take some, but will never take it all
If I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I have enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've lead
Then I roll myself a harry rag and puts myself to bed.

Oh, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
Then they light one up and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
Then they light one up and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Hey, harry rag, harry rag,
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've lead
Then I roll myself a harry rag and puts myself to bed
