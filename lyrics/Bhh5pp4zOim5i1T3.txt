Shadows follow me, but she is always out of reach
But she's my favourite thing to see
Her hook is my escape, a reflection of my fate
And she's everything I need, yeah

So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me
Only for you, you, you, I'll bleed
Can't you see, that you can set me free
So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me

Without her in a groove, cold sweating in my tomb
If she was only here with me
She used the pale blushing moon to cast sun into my room
She is the only light I need, yeah

So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me
Only for you, you, you, I'll bleed
Can't you see, that you can set me free
So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me

Hear me call
I will wait, it's you I wait for
Hear me call
I will wait, it's you I wait for
Hear me call
I will wait, it's you I wait for
Hear me call
I will wait, I will wait

So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me
Only for you, you, you, I'll bleed
Can't you see, that you can set me free
So sink your fangs, fangs, fangs, into me
