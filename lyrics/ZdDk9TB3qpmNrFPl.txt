C'mon, c'mon

The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone

So c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
It ain't no way of walking out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby

The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do

So c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
It ain't no way of walking out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby

Every step I take
I feel it more and more
She's calling out
She's a lucky girl
My heart is racing
She's turing around
I reach for her hand and I say

Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby
Yeah, the music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby

C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon and dance with me, baby
