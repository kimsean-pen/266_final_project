While we have oceans*
Rivers that still bring us life
Reasons to live in the moment
Hold onto your time
Let your heart go where the wind takes it
Pure like the raindrops of time
Follow the path where it takes you
Straight down the line
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
How can one sit back and dream it
I'd have no peace in my life
Climbing these walls in an hourglass
Prized in our strife
And I have seen worlds filled with wonder
Lost on my own lonely mile
Lessons I wish that I had mirrored
Time after time
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
While we have oceans
Rivers that still bring us life
Reasons to dance in the moment
Hold onto your time
Come fill up your souls with our blessings
Hold up your hands to the sky
Let the whole world know you're out there
High in our highs
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
