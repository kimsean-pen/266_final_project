I make you so sad, I know that I do
You came across blind, You came across blue
I treated you bad, neglected your mood
You nearly went mad, so I cut your ass loose

La la la la la la, la la la la
I cut your ass loose
La la la la la la, la la la la

There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do.
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do.
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth

I make you feel trapped, I broke it in two
You settle for less, I settled on you
I'm tryna relax, I'm tryna stay cool
You nearly went mad so I cut your ass loose
I cut your ass loose

There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)

I was just a baby when you met me
Like an incompassioned maybe
Livin' in a daydream, misbehaving
Thought that you would come to save me
I wanna see you again

There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
There's no IOU, It doesn't matter what I do
You're gonna hit me with the truth (Wi-wi-with the truth)
