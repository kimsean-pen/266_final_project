How ya, how ya feel? how ya feel
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
How ya, how ya, how ya feel
Now what are ya feelin'
I got bigger, I used to be little
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
They used to cuss, they used to diss (skrr, skrr)
Now they ask me how I feel

Seven girls fit in the five-seater, wind 'em up, do it
Actin like your friend won't leave her, gyal go snaky for the clique
You already know what is it, E gang, them man take shots and miss
I pree it, beat it, delete it, maybe it's cause of my p's
But I was broke, still getting blows, still make your gyal love beef
They like me for some reason, tap that then leave it
Just let me be, just let me be, with my team

How ya, how ya feel, how ya feel (skrr, skrr)
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
How ya, how ya, how ya feel
Now what are ya feelin'
I got bigger, I used to be little
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
They used to cuss, they used to diss, used to fight (skrr, skrr)
Now they asking me how I feel

Mmm, go higher, get that bitch in a car
She go mmm, yah, stepped in there like rah
We're on JD and la, they go mmm, yah
Phone 'dem E's over here, that's cause only g's over here
For the p's in the air, told em that '17 was the year
We've been here a year, crep check, ohh-la-la, they go "umm yah"
How we step so clean, with my team?

How ya, how ya feel, how ya feel
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
How ya, how ya, how ya feel
Now what are ya feelin'
I got bigger, I used to be little
My belly got full, now I've got that meal
They used to cuss', they used to diss, used to fight (skrr, skrr)
Now they asking me how I feel
