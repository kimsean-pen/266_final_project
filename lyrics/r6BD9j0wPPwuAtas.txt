I hope you are a dreamer
Dust on your knees
Give us one or two whispers
Then give us forty screams

Is this the future
Standing over me
Will it grow
Will it burst
With flower blooms
Or can it rise from such a seed

I can't bear another day like this
I can't bear another day like this
If I can't bear to see the dark
Can you

I know just what you're feeling

So throw a rope around the morning
Tie it tightly to your chest
And while you pull for something bright and something golden
Split infinity into forty breaths

'Cause I had wanted a better world for you
I had wanted a better world for you
Oh, if I can't bear to see it through
Will you

I had wanted a better world for you
I had wanted a better world for you
Oh, if I can't bear to see it through
Can you

A young ghost
In an old body
Caught in between
The throat and the lungs
Speak love, speak love, speak...

An old ghost
In a young body
Caught in between
The throat and the tongue
Scream love, scream love, scream love
