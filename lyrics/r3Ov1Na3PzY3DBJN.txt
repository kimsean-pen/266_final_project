It's easy to be distracted, to be led astray
Even if it's just a little bit
And once you go down
It's just line of sight, you know
"We're gonna go to the moon
It's big, and just straight-"
Yes, but if you're a little bit off here
Then you've traveled for a ways
All of a sudden you realize
"Oh my gosh, I'm way off course."
You missed the moon
That's how it is, and until the end
It's so subtle, you don't even see it
That's why, um, my biggest wisdom
I can give you is always have a
Close relationship with God
Be sensitive to the spirits
Spend time, that's a must
Yeah?

"To be or not to be" ain't even a question
I'ma live free
I'ma lift hearts, I'ma love hard
Born in the House of the Rising Sun
Yeah, I'm an animal, yeah, I'm radical
Yeah, sign of the horns up, I'm radical
Yeah, I'm awesome, so awesome
Watch me flourish, watch me blossom
Watch me, yeah, just watch (Watch)
Time flies when you work so hard (Watch)
I get so caught up (Watch)
Forgive me if I seem out of touch
Yeah, I just be in the cut
More often than not, you can catch me in the cut
Yeah, I just be in the cut
More often than not, you can catch me in the cut
Can't explain, no one to care
As much as y'all stay on alert and stay aware
I need y'all out here, out here (Yeah)
I don't know what to believe
But I could trust me, me, trust me
God knows, only God knows what I see
Me, me, just me (Run wild, wild and free)
God knows, only God knows what I see
And I

Run wild, run free, yeah (Run wild, wild and free)
