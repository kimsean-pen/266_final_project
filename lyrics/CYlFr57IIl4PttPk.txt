Sleep, baby, sleep, what are you waiting for?
The morning's on it's way, you know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep, baby, sleep, I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

I could be the one to give you all that I have
With a gentle touch
And a foolish love
And you could be the one to carry all my troubles away
With the words you say
All I need to hear, so

Sleep, baby, sleep, what are you waiting for?
The morning's on it's way, you know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep, baby, sleep, I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

Ignorance is torture, but your love is right
Tip to tip a gentleman of the night
You feed my fascination the way your skin likes silk
And I'm so filled with wonder you could fool me easily, so

Sleep, baby, sleep, what are you waiting for?
The morning's on it's way, you know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep, baby, sleep, I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you

So lay here
And rest up next to me, 'cause we'll be alright
We'll be alright
But when we leave, I know it's hard, 'cause it's all we know
But we'll be alright
We'll be alright, right?

Sleep, baby, sleep, what are you waiting for?
The morning's on It's way, you know it's only just a dream
Oh sleep, baby, sleep, I'll lie next to you
The beauty of this mess is that it brings me close to you
