Where will you be when it all falls down?
Where will you be when it all comes back around?
Where will you be at the end of our days?
Just following the footsteps let the liars lead the way

I can talk about love,
I can talk about hate,
I could try to teach a lesson but I doubt it penetrates,
I can give you all excuses till I'm blue in my face,
I can talk about serenity, but it doesn't mean a thing anyway

Who will you blame?
Who will you blame?
Who will you blame?

Who will you blame for the servile days?
Who will you blame for the hurricanes and tidal waves?
Who will you blame for the riots and the anger?
And just cryin in the corner wishing you would have had a say

I can talk about love,
I can talk about hate,
I could try to teach a lesson but I doubt it penetrates,
I can give you all excuses till I'm blue in my face,
I can talk about serenity, but it doesn't mean a thing anyway

Like a monster hides in your closet
It's creeping closer but we don't care
Are we all insane?
If it's just a game well I don't want to play

I can talk about love,
I can talk about hate,
I could try to teach a lesson but I doubt it penetrates,
I can give you all excuses till I'm blue in my face,
I can talk about serenity, but it doesn't mean a thing,
I can talk about problems, I can talk about sin
I can talk about trial, but what do we really win?
I can talk about forgiveness, though I'd probably be condemned
Or I can talk about...
