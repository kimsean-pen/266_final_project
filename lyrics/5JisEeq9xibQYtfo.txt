Baby get lost in this moment
Burning bright in the night sky
Said we could get lost in this moment
Coming alive in the night time

Baby get lost in this moment
Burning bright in the night sky
Said we could get lost in this moment
Coming alive in the night time

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
Burning bright in the dark sky

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
We're coming alive in the night time

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
Burning bright in the dark sky

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
We're coming alive in the night time

Baby get lost in this moment
Burning bright in the night sky
Said get lost in this moment
Coming alive in the night time

Baby get lost in this moment
Burning bright in the night sky
Said get lost in this moment
Coming alive in the night time

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
Burning bright in the dark sky

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
We're coming alive in the night time

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
Burning bright in the dark sky

And ohh now close your eyes
Let it all out
Right out your mind
We're coming alive in the night time
