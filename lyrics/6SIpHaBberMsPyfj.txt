Why don't you write me?
I'm out in the jungle, I'm hungry to hear you
Send me a card
I am waiting so hard to be near you
(La, la, la)
(Why don't you write?)
Something is wrong
And I know I got to be there (Yeah)
Maybe I'm lost
But I can't make the cost of the airfare
Tell me why (Why, why)
Tell me why (Why, why)

Why don't you write me?
A letter would brighten my loneliest evening
Mail it today
If it's only to say that you're leaving me
(La, la, la)

Monday morning, sitting in the sun
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come
Tuesday, never got a word
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign
Drank a half a bottle of iodine
Friday, woe is me
I'm gonna hang my body from the highest tree
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
