She don't laugh at everything but when she does the planet swings around her
She don't step on sidewalks seams, her teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the vegas lights, she blow a kiss and leave it spinning' like a tilt-a-whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up, she's a pony tail no make-up saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in the summer rain, she could catch the eye of a hurricane
In blue jeans and pearls

I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world

She turned around and it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing I could say was "hey", and I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her, I can't believe I get to be here in her world
I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

I met a girl
