Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution

Bang bang, it's a hold up
You about to give it up
In the boot they're slipping up
We've been patient long enough

It's a hold up
Rebels gonna play it tough
Wreck the deck and needle off
Shut it down and turn it off

Face to face
It's murder on the dance floor
Cut to the chase
Just give us what we came for

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Bang bang in the club crowd
Better off or down and bow
Chaos holding, what a wow
Tearing up the sound now

Oh, shout it out loud
Now we're warming up the ground
Rip the deck and needle up
Shut it down and turn it off

Face to face
It's murder on the dance floor
Cut to the chase
Just give us what we came for

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight
Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight

Bang bang, it's a hold up
Bang bang, it's a hold up
Get on the revolution

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Get on the revolution
Wreck this club tonight

Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight
Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight

Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight
Own me, own me, own me
Own me, own me, own me
Wreck this club tonight
