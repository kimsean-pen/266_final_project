Love is just a spinning wheel
Darling, like the tumble leaves
But in the cobwebs of my heart
And take all that you can from me
I'll not pretend to be
Anyone who's always not in love
And I am back to yesterday
Savoring my sorrow days
I'll pick up the pieces and rewind
Love is just a spinning wheel
Darling, like the tumble leaves
But in the cobwebs of my heart
And take all that you can from me
I'll not pretend to be
Anyone who's always not in love
And I am back to yesterday
Savoring my sorrow days
I'll pick up the pieces and rewind
Television, call me princess
Television, take him away
Television, won't you say my name?
Love is just a spinning wheel
Darling, like the tumble leaves
But in the cobwebs of my heart
Take all that you can from me
I'll not pretend to be
Anyone who's always not in love
