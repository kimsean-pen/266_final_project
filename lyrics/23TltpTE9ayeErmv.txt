Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still

Smell her on you

Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything you need

I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield

I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Truth covered in security

I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To make you a deal
We've made a pact
To learn from who
Ever we want
Without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still
Smell her on you
Smell her on you
