You've been targeted in the night
By violent mercenaries
Your identity's been confused
With one that looks like you
You're a simple man living life
You are an electrician
But the bounty's on your head
A thousand unmarked traveler's checks

Run

Find your way deep into the woods
The dogs can smell your path
Try to find your way out of this
There seems to be no chance
Bounty hunters closer to you
Start to remember back
When you studied biology
Back in your high school class
Wait now, what did they say?
About the human body and
proportions of things
Blood is an energy conductor.
I am full of that All I need is an outlet

They're getting closer
But now you have a plan
Lead them to the generator
Where there's solid land
The concrete floor will do just fine
And electric outlets
Open up your veins and splash the blood
and hit the power-lines

BLOODROCUTED
BLOODROCUTED

You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED right NOW

You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED
You'll be BLOODROCUTED right NOW

Enemies stand dead in your blood
The stench of cooking skin
All of them with their hair on end
Their eyes exploded in

You stand with your arms bleeding still
You cannot stop the flow
Though you are the victor tonight
Your time has come to GO
Go, go, go, go

Your time has come to GO
Go, go, go, go

Wait now, what did they say?
About the human body and
Proportions of things
Blood is an energy conductor
I am full of that
All I need is an outlet

BLOODROCUTED
