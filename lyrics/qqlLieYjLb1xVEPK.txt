I still talk to you in my sleep
I don't say much cause the hurt runs too deep
I gave you the moon and the stars to keep
but you gave them back to me

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep

I still lay on my side of the bed
I dance alone when the last bottle's spent
memories like a river runnin through my head
I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep

I still whisper sweet words to you
and when I'm busy, or have nothing to do
I pray to god, that my words ring true
and that your words might reach me too

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it...

My hearts in pieces so please understand
I've tried to jump, but I've nowhere to land
so give me your heart and I'll give you my hand
and I'll try as goddamn hard as I can

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
