It slip between your fingers, out of grasp
You are vain
To hold yourself so high - you'd never match
Far from sane

I would like to know

I would like to know where you've been
To know where I'll go
And I'll lay down my arms
If you open up yours

Even when you write an honest song
You are vain
You try and pick only the greatest words
It brings you pain

I would like to know

I would like to know where you've been
To know where I'll go
And I'll lay down my arms
If you open up yours

When you like what you see
You don't countenance me
If you're all in your head
Then I'll never be near

A crow rests in the tree, swinging by the balcony
It's staring right at me, I can't believe
I'm starting to break down
Just another sip, anormally, it offers me
Some liquid... bitter, dark.
A starry night surrounding thee
No, it cannot be, my enemy, what I've become
Voices in my head, I'm seeing red, it's made me numb
The fall I am about to face is now
the only thing that has any beauty left
In awe with all of this break down

It takes so much to see within ourselves
We are vain
Vain for living life far from our self
We have no names

I would like to know...
