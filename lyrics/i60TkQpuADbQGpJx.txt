On and on and on
We'll stay together, yeah
On and on and on
We'll be together, yeah
You and I will try
To stay together, yeah
On and on and on
We'll be together, yeah

Please don't cry
We're designed to die
Don't deny
What's inside
On and on and on
We'll stay together, yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on

One day we'll disappear
Together in a dream
And whether short or long
Our lives are going to be
I will live in you
Or you will live in me
Until we disappear
Together in a dream

Please don't cry
We're designed to die
You can't deny
Even the gentlest tie
On and on and on
We'll be together, yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on, we're going to try

Please don't cry
This world of words and meanings
Makes you feel outside
Something that you feel already
Deep inside
You deny
Go ahead and cry
On and on and on
We'll stay together, yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on

You and I
We'll stay together, yeah
You and I will try
To make it better, yeah
