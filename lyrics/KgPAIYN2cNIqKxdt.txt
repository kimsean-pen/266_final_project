Oh south spirit
Remove the sea wind
Recall the first flame
Awake the beast under the snow
In three shades
The sign of evil existence
Engraved in rain
Above the circle where tyrants dwell

Summon Glohithia
Appear in the snake shape
Bring down upon me
For last time all forest's (secrets)

The sign of evil existence
In the four points of horizon
The secrets buried under smoky land
It'll take ages and ages come back
The wind is here now
The see is divided
The flame reburn inside me
The beast return in the snowy land

Summon Glohithia
Appear in the snake shape
Bring down upon me
For last time all forest's (secrets)
