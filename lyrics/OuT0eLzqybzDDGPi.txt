I'm thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

I have to speculate
That God Himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

True it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

And you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now, come down now
'Cause everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now, come down now

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You'll hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
(This is guiding you home)

They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now, come down now
'Cause everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now
(Come down now)

They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now (Come down now)
Come down now (Come down now)
They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now (Come down now)
Come down now (Come down now)
'Cause everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now (Come down now)
Come down now (Come down now)
They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now (Come down now)
Come down now (Come down now)
