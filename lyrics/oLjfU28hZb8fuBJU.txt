I wipe my memory
Clean like a white board
I've seen every color inside
Sacrying forward
I reach for the table and try to remember myself
Once you have been fooled
You know every trick
But I guess this one time I was blind
You wrapped us in glory
You smiled at my story
Pretending to know how to feel

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior

This should be heaven
I say to myself as you cover your body in me
These days are not long enough
Nights are too cold
And sometimes I just need someone
In nights when we both wake up
Stare at our faces in mirrors not ready to love

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior

It's heaven when you call
Heaven when you're calling me out from under
Heaven only knows
Heaven has a hold on me
Oh, my savior
