Think you're in control until you're not
And you're so in love until you're not
Find a place where we can be alone
Find a place where we can be ourselves

So aim high
And aim true

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm falling

Like a feather falling past your cheek
Feel the breath of heaven on your face
And we all die trying to get it right
We're all gonna die trying to get it right

So aim high
And aim true

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm falling
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm falling

Aim true
Won't you aim true?
Aim true
Won't you aim true?
