Baby
I've known you for a long, long time
I never thought that we would find
What were holding in our hands
Lately
Ive been thinking I should make you mine
Been thinking that we shold define
What we are, What we are
oh oh

And you know I love to be in control
But recently I dont know what to do
I'm losing it over you
ohhhhh

Ooh la Ooh la
When you say my name
I can feel the flame
Getting stronger
Oh let me hear you say
Ooh la Ooh la
We both feel the same
And I can't play this game any longer

Oh boy

You Touch my heart like you dont know
And Imma show you, yeah

And you know I love to be in control
But Recently I dont know what to do

Yeah girl, I think about you
All of the time
I love your smile
And the way you shine
Wondering How
I'm gonna make you mine
When it turns to night
I will make it right
So many thing I've been
waiting to say
Held in my heart
For a day like today
I wanna hold you till the
light fades away
I wanna hold you till the
light fades away

Ooh la Ooh la
When you say my name
I can feel the flame
Getting stronger
Oh let me hear you say
Ooh la Ooh la
We both feel the same
And I can't play this game any longer
