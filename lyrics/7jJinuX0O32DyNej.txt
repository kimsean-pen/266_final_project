It's alright
It's okay
To try and hide your feelings today
Been around
Been away
But I won't let it stay the same

(pre-)
I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up baby
You fill me up right up x2

I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you

I believe in many things
(I believe in, I believe in)
All of which account to faith
(I believe in you too)
You been here on different counts
(you been here on different counts)
So I'm steady counting away

(pre-)
I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up baby
You fill me up right up x2

I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you
I guess I'm
Still in love, still in love
Still in love, still in love with you

(Bridge)
I, I
Still in love, still in love with you x2
I
Still in love, still in love with you x4

(SPZRKT harmonies)
Just saying I really want you babe

(pre-)
I remember when you lit me up with your touch
The fire within me
When I'm feeling empty
You fill me up right up baby
You fill me up right up x2

Can't let it get to me
Oh no, lord knows
The way I let it get to me
Saying I
Want you baby
Just saying I really
Want you baby
Cause I remember when you
Lit me up with your touch
I remember when you
Lit me up with your touch
