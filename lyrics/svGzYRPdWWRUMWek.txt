The dust is clearing, the desert is calm.
The skies are all quiet and I can't make a sound.
And I just wait for you.

I'm calling for a savior to show me where to start.
And all who still remain are whispering in the dark.
And we just wait for a sign.

So this is my once upon at time.
So this is my star-crossed wasteland.

The wolves are ascending, the vultures are near.
And I'm still here waiting for you to reappear.
And you just wait for a sign

So this is my once upon at time.
So this is my star-crossed wasteland.

And you'll never know what it is you've done to me.
You'll never know what is is you've done to me,
And we all wait for a sign.
And we all wait for a sign.
And we just wait for a sign.
