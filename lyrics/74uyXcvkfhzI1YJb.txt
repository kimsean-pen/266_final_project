I need to walk by the flowers with someone who could share my face
Looks like nobody could take your place
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have

Don't let it go to waste

I could show you memories to rival Berlin in the thirties
I understand your dating-bar ways
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have

Don't let it go to waste

Say something warm, say something nice
I can't stand to see you when you're cold
Nor can I stand being out of your life
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have

Don't let our youth go to waste
