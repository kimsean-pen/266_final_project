Yeah, ha
Na na na, na na na na
Yeah

Faded off of that bottle
Livin' like no tomorrow
I like you 'cause I'm lifted
And you like me 'cause I'm gifted
Buttoned down in designer
That Dolce and that Gabbana
Painted just like an angel
I thank the Lord that he made you

I see it in your eyes
Passion you can't deny
Girl, we can live that life
I see it all

There we are
Smokin' on rolled cigars
Hollywood boulevard
I can see it all now
You could be
Bigger than your fantasies
Standing right next to me (oh oh oh)

I see it all now
You're a star
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh oh
I can see it all now
You look

Like you straight out a movie
Naked in the jacuzzi
Stuntin' like you Madonna
That beautiful persona
Energy go crazy
I might have your babies
And I don't usually say this
I swear it's not 'cause I'm faded
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

I see it in your eyes
Passion you can't deny
Girl, we can live that life
I see it all

There we are
Smokin' on rolled cigars
Hollywood boulevard
I can see it all now
You could be
Bigger than your fantasies
Standing right next to me

I see it all now
You're a star
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh oh
I can see it all now
You're a star
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, star
Oh, oh oh oh
I can see it all now

There we are
Smokin' on rolled cigars
Hollywood boulevard, yeah
See it all now
You're a star, ooh, oh oh ooh, yeah
