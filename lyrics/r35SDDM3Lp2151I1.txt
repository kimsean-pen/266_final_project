Couples are so primitive
I can't find myself
Till the end of your love note
Put me in a box, the edges so you
Can take me out to play
Can take me out to play

I'll make up my own kind of family
You can't be part of it
I'll fit us all in a box
So we can get out
I'll take us out to play
I'll take us out to play

I make my own family so you can
Come play with me, come play with me
I'll make my own family
Just so you can, just so you can
Just so I can play

We'll build a house
So tight that we might choke inside
Let's build a house so wide
Enough to fit our world inside

I make my own family so you can
Come play with me, come play with me
I'll make my own family
Just so you can, just so you can
Come play with me, come play with me
I'll make my own family
Just so you can, just so you can
Just so I can play
