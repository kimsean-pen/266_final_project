I don't know, but I believe
That some things are meant to be
And that you'll make a better me
Everyday I love you

I never thought that dreams came true
But you've shown me that they do
You know that I learn something new
Everyday I love you

'Cause I believe that destiny
Is out of our control (Don't you know that)
And you'll never live until you love
With all your heart and soul

It's a touch when I feel bad
It's a smile when I get mad
All the little things I am
Everyday I love you

I love you
Everyday I love you
Everyday I love you

'Cause I believe that destiny
Is out of our control (Don't you know that)
And you'll never live until you love
With all your heart and soul

If I asked, would you say yes?
Together we're the very best
I know that I am truly blessed
Everyday I love you

And I'll give you my best
Everyday I love you, yeah
Oh yeah
