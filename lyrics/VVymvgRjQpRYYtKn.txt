I wait too long 기대해 난
그대와 날 잠겨오듯
닿은 채로 더 밀려와
어쩌면 날 다 가진 듯
천천히 열을 세봐
그 안에 너의 자릴 잡아

And let me play again
Just fly me to away
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again

I want it all 그려봐 난
그대와 날 처음인 듯
솔직히 말을 해봐
바램은 너의 죄가 아냐

And let me play again
Just fly me to away
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again

천천히 열을 세봐
그 안에 너의 자릴 잡아
And let me play again
Just fly me to away
솔직히 말을 해봐
바램은 너의 죄가 아냐

And let me play again
Just fly me to away
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
I, I want you
Cause I can touch you
And I know I same as you
Like never live again
