I can see it in your eyes
You're scared
All these things they force you to do aren't fair (whoah)
I'm here to chase away these tears
Baby, we can chase away these fears

Because sometimes baby
You fall on your back
But girl, you're three times the lady I'll ever have
And you know, you know it's true
This is a fight I refuse to lose

And I'll run
Have a little faith in me
You're scared and alone
And I'll run
This is where we both break free
I'll bring you home

I can hear it in your voice
You care
Let me run my fingers through your hair
I'll keep you company at night
Baby, I'm here to make this right

Because sometimes baby
You fall on your back
But girl, you're three times the lady I'll ever have
And you know, you know it's true
This is a fight I refuse to lose

And I'll run
Have a little faith in me
You're scared and alone
And I'll run
This is where we both break free
I'll bring you home

Believe me, don't think twice
And don't leave me, or say goodbye
Believe me, believe me tonight
Baby, believe me and don't think twice
Believe me

And I'll run
Have a little faith in me
You're scared and alone

And I'll run
Have a little faith in me
You're scared and alone
And I'll run
This is where we both break free
I'll bring you home, you home, you home

If you have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
If you have a little faith in me
