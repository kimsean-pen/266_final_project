Fled vice like you told me
Seeking answers
Facing the blind death stone
Lost in the wild
I'm down at my heels glancing over the earth
Controlling the besetting sin
A sink of iniquity, I seclude myself
I walk alone upon land
Pleasure in the pathless woods
Where I am, you may also be
Rather than faith give me truth
Rapture on the lonesome shores
Where I am, you may also be
Fled vice like you told me
Hollowing out my mind
All possibilities die as I feed on reason
I'm down at my heels glancing over the earth
Caliginous nights consorting me
Where I am, you may also be
Rather than love give me truth
Rapture on the lonesome shores
Where I am, you may also be
Walk alone upon land
Pleasure in the pathless woods
Where I am, you may also be
Rather than faith give me truth
Rapture on the lonesome shores
Where I am, you may also be
