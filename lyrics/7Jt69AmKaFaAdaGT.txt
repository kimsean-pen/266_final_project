You say my vision's not a vision at all
There's no degree in rock and roll
Say it's a waste of time
Say I'll never get a real shot
I'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots

I'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots

I feel the energy from my head to my feet
I said I got a passion empowering me
I know talk's not cheap, I'm done grinding my teeth
Time to slap you in the face with reality

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener

We've been decieved by the powers that be
We're sold future perfection but it will not come cheap
Maybe I love it
I'd rather believe
I'm just breaking the surface
And you will never stop me

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener

You say my vision's not a vision at all
There's no degree in rock and roll
Say it's a waste of time
Say I'll never get a real shot
I'll be banging my head 'til my brain rots
