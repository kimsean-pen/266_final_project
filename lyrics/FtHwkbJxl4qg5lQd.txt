Looking into your eyes
I know I'm right
If there's anything worth my love
It's worth a fight

We only get one chance
And nothing ties our hands
You're what I want, listen to me
Nothing I want's out of my reach

(I'm free)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
Love's the only thing that keeps me here
(I'm free)
You're the reason that I'm hanging on
My heart's staying where my heart belongs
(I'm free)

Running away will never make you free
And nothing we sign is any kind of guarantee

I wanna hold you now
I won't hold you down
Shaking the past
Making my breaks
Taking control
That's what it takes

(I'm free)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
Love's the only thing that keeps me here
(I'm free)
You're the reason that I'm hanging on
My heart's staying where my heart belongs
(I'm free)

I wanna hold you now
I won't hold you down
You're what I want, listen to me
Nothing I want's out of my reach

(I'm free)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
Love's the only thing that keeps me here
You're the reason that I'm hanging on
My heart's staying where my heart belongs
(I'm free)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
Love's the only thing that keeps me here
You're the reason that I'm hanging on
My heart's staying where my heart belongs
(I'm free)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
Love's the only thing that keeps me here
You're the reason...
