The bright light is lying down
Earth and the sea and the sky
Is at rest with the ocean
And the days go by
They go into the seas that have no shores
Haunted by that same closed door
Looking up at skies on fire
Leaving nothing left of us
To discover

And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear, out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be, no light

No doubt, no pain
Come ever again, well
Let there be light in this lifetime
In the cool, silent moments of the nighttime

And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
We will never change again, the way that we are changing
Well, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain

Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream, no
I still wish you gone
And I will live alone
Yes, I will live alone

And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear, out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be, no light

You will never love again the way you love me
You will never rule again the way you ruled me
You will never change again the way you're changing

You will never rule again the way you ruled me...
