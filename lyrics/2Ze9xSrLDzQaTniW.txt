I'm so bored I could quit
To melt away all the blame
Drag me out of this pit
Cause I killed all my innocence

Born like this
No more of it
Cause I'm born like this
No more of it

I'm so cold I should split
To wash away all the shame
Drowning in my own spit
Cause I conquered my sinfulness

Born like this
No more of it
Cause I'm born like this
No more of this
