I've never felt so alive
I've never had to run and hide
The things I want I cannot have
The things I need are all so bad

What'd you say?

I coulda been
I coulda been
I coulda been
I am, I am

You coulda been
You coulda been
You coulda been
You are, you are

My best excuse is that I'm drained
From everything that keeps me sane
My sickness keeps me in control
From everything you'll never know

What'd you say?

I coulda been
I coulda been
I coulda been
I am, I am

You coulda been
You coulda been
You coulda been
You are, you are

Does it make you happy?
Does it make you mad?
Why am I still laughing?
Look at what you had

Does it make you feel good?
Does it make you sick?
That you knew that I would
Be the one to trip

I coulda been
I coulda been
I coulda been
I am, I am

You coulda been
You coulda been
You coulda been
You are, you are

No control
No control
No control
