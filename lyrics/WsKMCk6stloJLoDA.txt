So I'm writing this letter to you, baby
Just like my mother told me
She always said
"Say yes before you say no and say maybe"

See I never sugar coat any life lessons for you
'Cause I wanna make you equipped for the best
And I can't always be here to rescue you when life gets crazy

But I love you more than you'll ever know
With you, love never dies
With you, love never dies
'Cause I love you more than you'll ever know

I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know

No, I can't promise to have all the answers
To all of your questions
But I'll never lie and I'll raise you without not an obsession

See I never sugar coat any life lessons for you
'Cause I wanna make you equipped for the best
And I can't always be here to rescue you when life gets crazy

But I love you more than you'll ever know
With you, love never dies
With you, love never dies
'Cause I love you more than you'll ever know

I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you more than you'll ever know

You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try, try
You can do it if you try

You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try
You can do it if you try, try
You can do it if you try
