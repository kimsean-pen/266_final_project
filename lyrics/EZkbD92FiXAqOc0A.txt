So here we are
After all these years
Mesmerised by all thats nothing
Or anything to do with what we started
Or with who we are
Was is what you always wanted?
To believe in something
Well I believe in you
To believe in something
To believe in something
To believe in something
Is what I crave
To remember how this all began
And who I was
Oh when you found me for the very first time
Then I think of all
And does it matter anymore
I believe in you

I believe in you
I believe in you
After all these years
I believe in you
After all these years
I believe in you
Its the woman I was
That reminds me
To Believe in Something

Its the woman I was
That reminds me
Of all you have given
Of the strength and trust and ability
To Believe in myself
To Believe in myself
Cos I believe in you
I believe in you
