Bad bi***, bad bi***, bad bi***, bad bi***, bad bi***
Some candy, palm trees and sandy

We had compromise, over nights with Marvin Gaye
Only took a day to build our own
In our Batmobile where Mary Jane was our alibi

Sayin' we couldn't make it to Mexico
We are no anomaly
We, we had our heavy hearts
And our silhouette up we could no longer see

I-I-I-I, I was lookin' forward to June
I, I was ready for Cancun

Happy, candy, palm trees and sandy
Happy, candy, palm trees and sandy

And these breaking news consume my mind
Couldn't wait to leave the London smoke
Make a boat to stay at home and pass the time

Sayin' we couldn't make it to Mexico
We, oh no, are no anomaly
We had our heavy hearts
And our silhouette up we could no longer see
Oh no

And I-I-I, I was lookin' forward to June, yeah
Oh I, I, I was ready for Cancun

Oh we, are no anomaly
Oh mama, we had our heavy hearts
And our silhouette up we could no longer see
But they could see
And you, I

And I-I-I, I was lookin' forward to June
I, I was ready for Cancun
