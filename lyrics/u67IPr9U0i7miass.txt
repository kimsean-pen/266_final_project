Great cup, a love that had me maybe that could bring my passion back.
What's that?
I stumbled on a careful line on my track.
Wa-ooh.
One time, moment is madness, the thrill of it was all I saw.
But suns rise and the shift of the tides and the glory days were no more.
When you work so hard, say what's the point in having all that gas?
When you work so hard, say what's the point in doing all that trash?
You say I need help cause I'm dreaming too much cause I'm drifting with my mental health.
Well good luck with made of some back but I think we might want something else.
When you work so hard, say what's the point in having all that gas?
When you work so hard, say what's the point in doing all that trash?
And you cry your eyes out.
Hey come on baby, wants a second chance.
And you cry your eyes out, hey come on tell me when it's time to dance?
The beat goes on, the streets go cold.
You can't go home.
Try the people, the beat goes on.
And on, the big bad world, you can't go home, the streets go cold.
Alone, you try the people but the beat goes on.
Can you tell me when it's time to dance? Someday I'll love what I've found in you.
I'll be so much in love, what does it do?
Hey come on baby, let your hair down.
I'll be the faults on.
