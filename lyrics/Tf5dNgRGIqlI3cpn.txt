Any time, that you like
Gonna give you my heart to break
Angel eyes, tell me lies
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control?
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
That's why I give you my heart to break

Butterflies, every time
Gonna give you my heart to break
Devilish, every kiss
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control? (Ahh)
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake (No)
'Cause no one else could do it
Better (No one else, better, that's why I)
That's why I give you my heart to break

Every time
Heart to break
Woo-ah!
Every time
Heart to break
Yeah

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control? Ahh
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more (more, more)

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break
I tried to fight, but I can't help it (I tried to fight, help it)
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better)
That's why I give you my heart to break
