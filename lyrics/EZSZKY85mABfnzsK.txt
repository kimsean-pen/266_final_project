Your life is a matinee
In a galaxy far, far away
And your debut is a sold out show, yeah
It's a blockbuster movie and you play the lead role

And right out at the opening scenes
The whole crowd's on the edge of their seats
Your worse critics are sitting up front
And they're giving you two thumbs way, way up
You'll be in a league of your own
You'll be stealing their hearts taking Oscars home

So go get 'em and give it some passion
Quiet on the set
Lights, camera, action!

With all your heart and soul
Dream big and you can feel the magic
Let the camera roll
Woah, your charm is automatic
