My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
The fixture in the city of lust

What the hells your name?
What's your pleasure and what is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, "We're fucked up"
But we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the states of mind is my own private suicide

Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
'Cuz she had enough and he had plenty

Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

So far away, I don't want to stay
Get me outta here right now
I just want to be free, is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
Right!
This life like dream ain't for me

I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone 'cuz no one's here
Left me here alone and I should've stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee, I'm thinking

(Where'd you go?)
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun

(Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
(Where'd you go, go, go, go?)

Geez
I got a rock' n' roll band
I got a rock 'n' roll life
I got a rock 'n' roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife

I got a rock 'n' roll house
I got a rock 'n' roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar

I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over 22 days
So get off of my case, off of my case
Off of my case

Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feets

There time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat

The world is spinning round and round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letter bomb and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touch ground
We're back in the barrio
And to you and me, that's Jingle town

Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
We're coming home again
We're coming home again
We're coming home again
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
