Pressure on me, can't get out
Situation, it's a melt down
Nine to fivin', wanna shout
New direction, got to get to high ground

I've got to get back to the floor
Just grab my keys and pop the door

Gonna give it up, get on down
Little by little going to turn it around
Gonna give it up, get on down
Little by little going to turn it around

Wash the week out of my mind
Slap my face on, and then I feel sublime
Put some sounds on to unwind
Caught the moment just about the right time

I've got to get back to the floor
Just grab my keys and pop the door

Gonna give it up, get on down
Little by little going to turn it around
Gonna give it up and get on down
Little by little going to turn it around

Make my heart sing like a wild thing

Give it up and get on down
Little by little going to turn it around
Give it up and get on down
Little by little going to turn it around

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
