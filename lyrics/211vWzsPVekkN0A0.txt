Hopeless times approach
Just give in to the chaos
Strangely I find comfort here
Impatient and curious of what may come

And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win
Drain me

Keep me in the dark
Don't want to take part
Prefer to be forever numb

Nothing great can come out of this
But I'm a hostage to myself
I fear I might collapse on the razor's edge
And I fear I'll realize when it's too late

And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win
Drain me

Keep me in the dark
I don't want to take part
Prefer to be forever numb

Sleepless again

I need to ease my mind
And kill what burns inside

Sleepless again

I can't wait

Keep me in the dark
I don't want to take part
Prefer to be forever numb
