Longing, waiting, now we here in the space
Souls glow, holding, body shaking in the space
Honey, you the sweetest and the most
laid back human being that I've ever had
Inside out got me smilling back, yeah
They say love is stress but I'm okay
Right now, baby, I can see your worth
Tell 'em that I said I'ma put in work

Spotlight [?]
Tell me I'm your queen
Stage [?], each night, make my body peak
One time, then it's twice 'til you sugar sweet
Honeywheat, honeywheat

If I wanted, if I needed
I'm gon' call you, anytime, anywhere, baby
If I wanted, if I needed
I'm gon' call you, anytime, anywhere, baby
If I wanted, if I needed
I'm gon' call you, anytime, anywhere, baby
If I wanted, you're sweet honeywheat

Chillin' in your house, watching anime
Layin' on the couch [?] picture say
[?] is your favorite, uh
Everytime I'm [?] I shoulda hear your "uh"
Both lanes [?] 'cause they are old case
Nothing feels better than your warm pace
Nothing looks better than your face to make

Spotlight [?]
Tell me I'm your queen
Stage [?], each night, make my body peak
One time, then it's twice 'til you sugar sweet
Honeywheat, honeywheat
