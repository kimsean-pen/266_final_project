Oh, I'll go for miles
Until I find you
Now you say; you want to leave me
But you can't choose

I've gone through pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
A blank expression
Recovering your face

Oh, I'm looking for directions
For out of this place
I start to wonder
If you'll come back

I feel the rain's storming after thunder
And I can't hold back
Don't leave me
Don't leave me

Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I'll go for miles

Until I find you
Oh, you say; you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone through pain and
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Oh, don't leave me
Don't leave me, yeah
