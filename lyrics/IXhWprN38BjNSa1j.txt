She was always something special
Diamond shining bright in the rain
Everybody dreams of angels
No one would ever know

How much I loved ya so
Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne
You were always on my mind

Shine like a summer days in the sun
Slowly wishes turn to sadness
Time dont heal a broken gun
I wish I never let you go
Even now I just want you to know
That it all seems funny, kinda like a dream

Things aint always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne
Instrumental
Now shes breakin hearts in heaven
Shinin bright in the sky

I still hear her voice in the wind
I still think of you in the night, oh yeah
Well I guess youll never know
How much I need her so
Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things aint always what they seem

What a shame, what a shame
What happened to Jayne
Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things aint always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne
What happened to Jayne
