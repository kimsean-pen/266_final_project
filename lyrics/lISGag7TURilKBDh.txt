Come on Iz Rite
Take me to you life
Streaming one more shine
It's all I know
It's all I know

Come on it's real
You know how I feel
You give me something here
And it's all I know
It's all I know

So don't look down, I won't let go
You bear my mind, sting my soul
Stars aline plus search you all the way

When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till all the love remains
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again

Come on it's great
Take me to your place
You make me worth the wait
And I wanna know
I wanna know

Come on Iz Rite
Take me to you life
Streaming one more shine
It's all I know
It's all I know

So don't look down, I won't let go
You bear my mind, sting my soul
Stars aline plus search you all the way

When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till all the love remains
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again

When you call my name
It takes away my pain
Till all the love remains
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
