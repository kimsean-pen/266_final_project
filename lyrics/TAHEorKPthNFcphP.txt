On another day, c'mon c'mon
With these ropes I tied, can we do no wrong?
Now we grieve, cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young

With my teeth locked down, I can see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve, cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young

Is it safe to say? C'mon, c'mon
Was it right to leave? C'mon, c'mon
Will I ever learn? C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

As I make my way, c'mon c'mon
These better nights that seem too long
Now we grieve, cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young

With my teeth locked down, I can see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve, cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young

Is it safe to say? C'mon, c'mon
Was it right to leave? C'mon, c'mon
Will I never learn? C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Is it safe to say? C'mon, c'mon
Was it right to leave? C'mon, c'mon
Will I never learn? C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

And know this day, these deepened wounds
Don't heal so fast, can't hear me croon
Of a million lies that speak no truth
Of a time gone by that now is through
