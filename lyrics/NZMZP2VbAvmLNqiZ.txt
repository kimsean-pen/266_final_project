It hid and it hid in his bedroom
Psycho killer teen dream action film
Gonna show you how we get down
in my hood

Bubbling bubbling cheap champagne
Leyendecker hole wrecker feel no pain
Lying face down when I swing your way
And what?
What's my name, what's my name?

Mary Anna said it's a no-go
She don't feel like, she don't think so
I don't know why I feel like a crap
Well come on, come on
Say come on, come on

They ran and they ran from his classroom
Roll another 40, make them scream
Gonna show you how we do things
in my hood

Tripping and a-tripping, erase all tapes
John Wayne, Rob Roy feel no pain
This is the point where you look the other way

You don't
Lost your mind

Mary Anna said it's a no-go
She don't feel like, she don't think so
I don't know why I feel like a crap
Well come on, come on
Say come on, come on

Mary Anna said it's a no-go
She don't feel like, she don't think so
I don't know why I feel like crying
Well come on, come on
Say come on, come on
