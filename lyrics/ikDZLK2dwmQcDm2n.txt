My wife ran off with the butcher again
So now i'm sleeping on a train and I'm
Wearing blue because I'm feeling blue

I'm dreaming of a place I cannot explain
So let me sleep on my train
So the world, so the world goes by

If it all were to go, I would not complain
But let me sleep, on my train
So the world, so the world goes by

Yeah soon I will wake to another pain
So let me sleep on my train
So the world, so the world goes by
So the world, so the world goes by
