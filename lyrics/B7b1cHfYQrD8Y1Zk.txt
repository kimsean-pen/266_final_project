All I know is the weight on my shoulder
Wont hold me down,
down.
I just hope when i'm wiser and older
that you're still around,
around.
Always overthinking thats my waves,
If you don't wanna listen that's okay
I'm okay
Gonna get up out of here
someday
Maybe wind up somewhere near L.A
That's cliche
Well,
I get stuck in my head
Where have i been
People tell me let it out
But i can't just let them in
To my mind
Oh my
Too many thoughts at a time
Always running around in circles
Never stay in line
They're always kind
Saying you're alright
Well i don't think I am
They say nah you'll be fine
Guess i'll be fine
Maybe they're right
Maybe i'll be fine
All i know is the weight on my shoulder
Wont hold me down
Down
I just know when i'm older and wiser
That you're still around
Around
Around
If you're feelimg down these days
Confide in someone, somewhere, someplace
If you're feelong lonely, you're not alone see
You know everyone had their share of bad days
you know everyone had their share of bad days
The end.
