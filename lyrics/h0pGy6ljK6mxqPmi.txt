Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
We can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
Yes please

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With a snap of your fingers you can made your bed
That's what I said

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble
If you go to extremes, because
Everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems

When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess
With the balance of things
Because everything is not
What it seems
