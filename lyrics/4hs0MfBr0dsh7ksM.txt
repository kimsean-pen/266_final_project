Every night,
Before I sleep a shiver down my spine
Thoughts alive
What can I do to make you listen?

Like a northern light,
You're dancing over every borderline
Passing every sign
Between reality and fiction

Every single promise that you ever made
Spinning in my mind like a hurricane
Baby as I hear your mayday
Mayday...

I'll be your icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water
Icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water

You go astray
Just like a polaroid you fade away
I'll be your partner
And liberate you from your prison

Baby as I hear your mayday
Mayday...

I'll be your icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water
Icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water

We're too young to say goodbye
Whenever you lose faith just hold the line
It takes a lot of nerve to save a life...
Icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water
Icebreaker!
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water
