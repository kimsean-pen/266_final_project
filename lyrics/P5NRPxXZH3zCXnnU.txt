I feel it rotting away
My world of decay
It's taking over
I need to break free
What's happened to me?
When nothing else matters

Burn bright, child raped
Something's coming over
Speak by heart rate
Now it's taking over

I'm a million degrees burning sky
Light will kill the disease that's inside

How could I ever repay
What's fading away
Still I wonder
The trouble with me
I cannot just be
'Cause nothing else matters

Burn bright, child raped
Something's coming over
Speak by heart rate
Now it's taking over

I'm a million degrees burning sky
Light will kill the disease that's inside
I'm a million degrees burning sky
Light will kill the disease that's inside

(I'm a million degrees burning sky)
I'm a million degrees burning sky
Light will kill the disease that's inside
I'm a million degrees burning sky
Light will kill the disease that's inside
