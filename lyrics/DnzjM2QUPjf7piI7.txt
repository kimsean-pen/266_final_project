You all know the fucking score
Everybody on the floor
Put your hands where I can see them
We're not playing around
One little move
And you're in the ground

We live on our own set of rules
Take everything and everyone down with you
We are a desperate kind
But this is a ruthless time

When I hit rock bottom
I go looking for friends in the filthiest places
Yeah, x2
I make ends meet cause I'm a bad bad man
When I hit rock bottom, the party has arrived
We won't be taken alive

We live on our own set of rules
Take everything and everyone down with you
We are a desperate kind
But this is a ruthless time

What if they just shut the lights out
So caught up in your digital world
What happens now?
What if they just shut the lights out
And all the city lights go black
What happens now?
What if they just shut the lights out
So caught up in your digital world
What happens now
Lights out. x2

You all know the fucking score
Everybody on the floor
Put your hands where I can see them
We're not fucking around
One little move
And you're in the ground
Lights out. x50
