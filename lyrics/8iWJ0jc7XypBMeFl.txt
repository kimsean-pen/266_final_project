Into this void I will give my Self-Control.
Inside this noise is a weak and godless soul.

Give me what I know.
Feel this ego.
There's a rusty halo on my head.
It must have been something that I said.
This is the dome of my betrayal.
This is the final broken nail.
Fill this hole,
suck this soul.
I'm the thing that I can't control.
Press My Flesh!

These eyes are twitching like a cup of squirming flies.
When i'm on my knees you can do just what you please.
