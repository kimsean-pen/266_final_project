No reason why I can't understand it
Open your mind, we can understand it
Please let me know
もし答えがあるなら
Let me know
教えて欲しい

時を超えて
僕らは行く
まばゆい光の中で

僕らの声
僕らの夢
僕らのあの場所へ

We are the one
Together we're the only one
You are the one
Forever you're the only one
We are the one
Together we're the only one
You are the one
Forever you're the only one

I feel it now
The time has come for us
Believe it now
It's time to get ready
Tell me why
もし終わりがあるなら
Tell me why
教えて欲しい

We stand in a circle pit
Side by side
We stand in a circle pit
Raise your hands

僕らの声
僕らの夢
僕らのあの場所
かなたへ

We are the one
Together we're the only one
You are the one
Forever you're the only one
We are the one
Whenever we are on your side
You are the one
Remember always on your side

We are the one
Together we're the only one
You are the one
Forever
