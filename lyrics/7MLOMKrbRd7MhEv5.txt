I read somewhere that every wall's a door to something new
Well if that's true-why can't i get through?

Cause I'm not who I thought I was
And I can't explain

But it feels like... I'm falling through a hole in my heart
Just falling through a hole in my heart
Don't try to reach for nothing at all

I could walk around--fall in love with a face or two
But it wouldn't be you--no it wouldn't be you

Cause you're not who I thought you were

No I can't explain
No, no I can't explain

But it feels like I'm falling through a hole in my heart
Falling through a hole in my heart.
Don't try to reach for nothing at all.

I can't, I can't explain.
