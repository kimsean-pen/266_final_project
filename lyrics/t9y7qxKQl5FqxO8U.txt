Time is a hole in my head
Tomorrow might be sleeping in
Time is a hole in my waterbed
(In my head)
(In my head)
Some kind of cardinal sin
Tomorrow might be sleeping in

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm terribly erased
I'm terribly erased

People used to dance, why don't they dance again
The pretty pants tell the neighbors how you've been
Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat

People used to dance, why don't they dance again
The pretty pants tell the neighbors how you've been
Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat

Time is a hole in my head
An unrecognizable town
In the surf, in the sound

Time is a hole in my waterbed
(In my head)
(In my head)
Some kind of cardinal sin
Tomorrow might be sleeping in
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm terribly erased
I'm terribly erased

People used to dance, why don't they dance again
The pretty pants tell the neighbors how you've been
Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat

People used to dance, why don't they dance again
The pretty pants tell the neighbors how you've been
Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat

Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat

Electric blue like the mayor's blazer
Burning to the beat
Burning to the beat
