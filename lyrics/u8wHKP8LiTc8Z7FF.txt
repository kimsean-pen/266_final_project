In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil on a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the Cheez Whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body piercing)

Yo, bring it on now

I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen sie Deutch, baby)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
