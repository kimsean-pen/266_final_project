Loosen yourself
I don't mind
A little lie
Goes deeper still
We build a wall
Close in the pain
I shed my skin
It goes deeper

Hold it inside
That little lie
It is enough
Before I come undone
What i've become
So innocent
I'm all messed up
And it goes deeper

It goes deeper

Come find a way
Fragile build a wall around it
We find a perfect place
And i'm watching see you on the other side

Are you loose enough
We build it up
Walk in the fire
It goes deeper
Close enough
