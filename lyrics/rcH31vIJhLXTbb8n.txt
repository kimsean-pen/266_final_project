Before the war I had no need for traveling
Indeed, I do not know what made it so important to leave
And after all this time I found that I'm avoiding me
For nothing more or less then fear
of what I have to gain from staying in the clear
All though it's only coming home that brings you near

Master Dough, my brother, is a sailor
Upon this ship of light we are the master sails in the wind
And you can understand, we need a hand to guide us in
So many claim to be the one
But like a shadow on the sun they fade and spit
And we are scattered on the ocean once again

Before the war I had no need for traveling
Indeed, I do not know what made it so important to leave
And after all this time I found that I'm avoiding me
For nothing more or less then fear
of what I have to gain from staying in the clear
Although it's only coming home that brings you near
Although it's only coming home that brings the tears
