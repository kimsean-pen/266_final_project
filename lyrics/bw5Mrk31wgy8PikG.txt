Forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have done you wrong.
For I have hurt beyond repair,
And when tears occurred no I didn't care.
Forgive me, Lover, for I have sinned
For I have loved you wrong.

But there's a strange door grown in my chest it
beats for you it will not rest so,
Meet me in our secret place
When the time has come

Rest your head in my lap and I'll
Beat you out of your own trap and I'll
Show you how much you have missed truth in
Time we were in right

Ah...
Ah...

So forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have let you go.

But you've been
every now and then on my mind,
You're every now and then on my mind (7x)

You're on my mind,
On my mind (7x)

(Acapella)
On my mind. (7x)
