i see you couldn't catch your breath
believe me it's all that it must be
you see i never said my piece
if only you left it that easy
fractured we have been since sometime sixteen
failure was on me cause your ideals bore me

does it take the fireworks to make you look in wonder?
would you give reaction to the cause i'm under?
so coloured by you but your money messed it up
surrendered by you your monkey's longwhile had enough

you're like scissors in my coat
you're like splinters in my cup

i know you couldn't care me less
keep hoping it's all only token
you know i never had my say
if only you'd keep it that open
loser may have been but its so lost on me
splintered i will be when your peace breaks cheap
does it take the fireworks to make you look in wonder?
would you give reaction to the cause i'm under?
three colour blind you but your monkey messed it up
surrendered by you your monkey's longwhile had enough

you're like scissors in my coat
you're like splinters in my cup
