Six weeks since I let you go
And I still feel the same
Hard to believe that a feeling this strong
Will every really change

I hold my head up steady
Both hands heavy
Oh just like the sky
It's so full of tears
Waiting to cry

Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
You never had nobody
Have you found someone
Who makes you feel
Like you're not alone
Yes you're going home
Going home

You're flying high like a Superman
Just like you've always dreamed of
Tell me now, are you finally free
From the troubles of life and love

I got your records playing
And I can hear you saying
This is where we belong
And I know I've got to carry on

Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
You never had nobody
Have you found someone
Who makes you feel
Like you're not alone
Yes you're going home
Going home

All this time watching you
There was nothing I could do
I know your heart was crossed
All those times that I tried
Light the light in your eyes
I couldn't see you were lost

Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
Coz you never had nobody
Are you on your way
Have you finally found some place
You can call your own
Going home

Are you on your way
Yes you're going home
Going home
Never had nobody, nobody
Have you found someone
Who makes you feel like you're not alone
Yes you're going home
Going hime

Six weeks since I let you go
And I still feel the same
