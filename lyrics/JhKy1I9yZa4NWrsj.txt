You said you won't
I bet my neck, I bet you will
I'm gonna check my love
You I'm gonna thrill

You can't imagine what you've missed
Can't go on
Meet me at midnight in the light
That starts the love

Since there's was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of goin' on, I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up

You came into my life
And now I realize
Today we love, we might
But it is for sure at midnight

Since there's was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of goin' on, I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up

You came into my life
And now I realize
Today we love, we might
But it is for sure at midnight

At midnight
At midnight
At midnight
...
