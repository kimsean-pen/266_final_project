This is a world of dreams
And reverie
Where I felt the stars
Explode around me

A grass blade flashed with a gleam
As it slashed open a moon beam
Then I stared back breathlessly
As mountains of fruit tumbled out
I barely had the chance to shout
A strawberry avalanche
Crashed over me

Staying awake that night
Was rather harsh
Deep in a sleeping bag
In your back yard

When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically
It could've been just another dream
But I swear I heard you scream
"A strawberry avalanche crashed over me"

Oh, there's a citrus constellation
In the galaxy, scratched
On the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see

If you were a beautiful sound
And the echos all around
Then I'd be your harmony
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Beneath the candy coated clouds
Oh, strawberry avalanche please crash over me

(This is a world of dreams)
(And reverie)
(When I felt the stars)
(Explode)
(Around me)
