In class, it's not so bad.
But when school's out and the
others go off to enjoy themselves, well...
If you're what they call a shy guy, that's when you really feel it.
The odd loneliness of being new in town
You don't know how to make people like you
And you find yourself holding a grudge against them
You're standing on the outside, looking in.l
You might have something to contribute to their conversation
But nobody cares whether you do or not
There's a barrier, and you don't know how to begin breaking it down
You imagine they keep watching the way you look
The way you act
They think you're different
So, you head for home
What else?
But still, you can't forget that you're alone
An outsider
