Snatched from my world
I lay wounded from the strike that you gave me
Venom flows through me now
Killing every vein
Sank your fangs in me
Ignored my every plea
Rotting away at me
Revenge is all I seek
Curse of the serpent (carry the burden)
Piercing me deeply (constant burning)
Death to the serpent (evil incarnate)
Swinging thy tongue with a venomous outlook

Wretched serpent infecting my surroundings
Rear your vile head
Succumb to my blade

Curse of the serpent (carry the burden)
Pierced me deeply (constant burning)
Death to the serpent (evil incarnate)
Swinging thy tongue with a venomous outlook
