Kiss me goodbye pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
'the shallow drowned lose less than we'
The strangest twist upon your lips 'and we shall be together...'
'and we shall be togheter...'
'kiss me goodbye bow your head and join with me'

And face pushed deep reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And dissapear the ripples clear
And laughing break against your feet
And laughing break the mirror sweet
'so we shall be together...'
'kiss me goodbye' pushing out before I sleep

It's lower now and slower now

The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently my hands
Before my fading eyes and in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go...
I will kiss you I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you I will kiss you
And we shall be together...
