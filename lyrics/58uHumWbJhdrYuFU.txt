We were both young once
Young and proud to feel so carefree
Days of innocence
But people can change and they do so easily
And now you've grown up
I'm so surprised at how little time it takes
And how you've changed now
I'm always amazed at what a difference money makes.

What's happened to you?
What's happened to me?
Now I'm confused
What am I supposed to do?
Then I look at you
And I can't comprehend
What's happened to you,
My dearest friend.

And now you've won yourself
A position and sense of responsibility
You're in the best of health
Living with friends and staying so happy
As long as you're content
As long as this is what you want to be
I'm very pleased for you
But what you are means nothing now to me.

What's happened to you?
What's happened to me?
Now I'm confused
Who am I supposed to be?
Then I look at you
And I can't comprehend
What's happened to you,
My dearest friend.
