I'm folding your love in my heart
By the dawn I'll be gone
The road keeps us apart
For some time I'll be gone

You promise to swallow your tears when I leave you
You promise to follow the leads I will give you
You said you would crawl in the dark from the laughter
You said you would long after me ever after

My love will grow black if your heart gets stolen
Just promise to keep your heart
One day I'll come back if the door's still open
Just promise to keep your heart broken

Days go by like the wind
And this life is too short
It makes no sense to give in
To release you from my thoughts
I promise to write you, I'll always remember
I promise I'll try to be back 'til December

I said I must go, I must face this disaster
I said I would come after you ever after

My love will grow black if your heart gets stolen
Just promise to keep your heart
One day I'll come back if the door's still open
Just promise to keep your heart broken

If you just promise to keep your heart
Promise to keep your heart broken
If you just promise to keep your heart broken
Broken
My love will grow black if your heart gets stolen
Just promise to keep your heart
One day I'll come back if the door's still open
Just promise to keep your heart broken
Forever and after my love
Just promise to keep your heart - broken
