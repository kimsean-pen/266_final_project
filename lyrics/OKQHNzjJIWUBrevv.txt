Late night, telephone,
calling all the wallflowers I'lI know,
out the dark, and used to the light

Half love, half regret,
just enough for polaroids and cigarettes.
Socialize, we're meant to size life-ife.

Throw me on my low key vibe.
Throw me on my low key vi, vi, vibe.
I don't even it like high,
I'm throwing on my low key vibe.

Bulletproof passengers
on the road to sex, drugs, etcetera.
Get out the dark and used to the light.

Everywhere I go I know that I dont wanna be,
part of something I will never leave.
Your social lives were meant to size life-ife.

Throw me on my low key vibe.
Throw me on my low key vi, vi, vibe.
I don't even it like high,
I'm throwing on my low key vibe.

Out of touch in harmony,
designer drugs from dead end streets.
Break the air to feel the fall or just feel anything at all.

Throw me on my low key vibe.
Throw me on my low key vi, vi, vibe.
I don't even it like high,
I'm throwing on my low key vibe.

Throw me on my low key vibe.
Throw me on my low key vi, vi, vibe.
I don't even it like high...
(I'm throwing on my...)
