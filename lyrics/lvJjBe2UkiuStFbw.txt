rotted fruit bleeding
spilling over their wooden tables
gritting teeth, rusty forks raised, betrayal smile
river over wood falls towards the floor
flesh falls
where once there was, there is no more
tastes odours flattened stretched
strobing panic increases
in the flesh that's eternally falling
through the cracks
dying to capture that which is lost
lost beneath the ground
panic becomes despair
sinking
scratching
flowing
in the cracks
unreachable
panic forever becoming despair
