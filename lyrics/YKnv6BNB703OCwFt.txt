A book in her hands, a smile on her lips
The eyes full of hope, she looks at me
I don't know how to tell her
This is no longer reality

I would like to show her the green of the spring
I would like to make her dream
I want her to smell the flowers
To lay on the grass, and climb the trees

I wonder how I could have been so blind?
Cities are burning, trees are dying
What did I have in mind?

This is the end
This is the end
I see this is the end
This is the end

It's easier to live in ignorance
This way you feel invincible
It's time to explain to your children
The real face of humanity

You will tell this great story
That you were aware but didn't want to see
That you destroy every single piece of beauty
Just for money

I wonder how you could have been so blind?
Cities are burning, trees are dying
What did you have in mind?

This is the end
This is the end
I see this is the end
This is the end

Now the earth is collapsing, swallowing the Human Being
Without a doubt the world will forget
Engaging in a reset

This is the end
This is the end
I see this is the end
This is the end

This is the end
This is the end
I see this is the end
