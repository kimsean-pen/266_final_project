Back in early '96 in
North-West Australia
I wondered why you
Were lying on the street
Accidents inflicted on
An innocent child
In the home, while
I was on the see-saw
I was in the garden
Reading Papillion
Telling myself real people
Couldn't be so cruel
She said, "Honey, what's wrong?"
I said, "Babe, what's right?"
I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I'm lucky just to sleep at night
So we linked arms, and
We staggered off into the night
Drunk, but overjoyed
Just to be employed

By the boys
The boys are killing me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
I'm coming as I even
If you tell me I'm a liar
The boys are killing me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
Mantajarra Walyakarra
Take a deep breath
And hold your fire

Gesticulating wildly and
Passionate at cars
Parked in the dark on the street
I would've fallen in a hole
If you didn't have
My shoulders tight
I was swaying like a see-saw
If that's what it is to trust
Another then you got it all
But I don't know if
I can trust my country anymore
She said, "Honey, what's wrong?"
I said, "Babe, what's right?"
So we staggered off into the night
Drunk, but overjoyed just to be employed

By the boys
The boys are killing me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
I'm coming as I even
If you tell me I'm a liar
The boys are killing me
I'm just a sailor and a miner
Mantajarra Walyakarra
Take a deep breath and hold your fire
