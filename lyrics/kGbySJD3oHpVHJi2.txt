I guess I made a bad decision
I laid it on the line
I'm hard wired, tunnel visioned
How do you like your grind?
I've overshared, I don't know why
We're in a room, this is doomed
What did I say I'd do?
What did I say I would do?

Take it, take it all the way
What am I looking for?
Why do I need more?
What do I really want want want want want?

Let's do it, I go all the way
I want a Roman holiday
I know it's just a game we play
I know it's just a game

I'm not opposed to humiliation
I hold my breath until
I wiggle out of a bad position
I call it TopBrazil
T-O-P-B-RA-ZZZ-IL (Take it, take it, take it all the way)

What am I looking for?
Why do I need more?
What do I really want want want want want?

Let's do it, I go all the way
I want a Roman holiday
I know it's just a game we play
I know it's just a game

All the way (I know it's just a game)
Take it all away (I know it's just a game)
All the way
I know it's just a game we play
I know it's just a game
All the way
