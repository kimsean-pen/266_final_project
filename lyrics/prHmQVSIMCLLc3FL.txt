You've got me wasted
I don't need it, I don't need your time
I know I'm not dating
I've searched all over, I don't have the time
I can't stop dreaming
Wake me up, I need to tell your truth
And tell me what season
Life left over and I feel brand new

You've got me wasted
I don't need it, I don't need your time
I know I'm not dating
I've searched all over, I don't have the time
I can't stop dreaming
Wake me up, I need to tell your truth
And tell me what season
Life left over and I feel brand new
