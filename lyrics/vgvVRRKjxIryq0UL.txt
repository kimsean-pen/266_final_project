At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again, again, again
It's the end of an empire

A start, an end, a rise and fall
No system eternal and no one immortal
Creation; all must ends in destruction
We cannot change the fate of civilization

Start, end
We build up the symbols of power
Rise, fall
Constructs of a mortal mind
Life span
Conquer in our brightest hour
Mortal
But then we all must fall in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again, again
It's the end of an empire

Time of
Kingdoms, each of us reigning
Dreams, death
Over the realms of our hearts and minds
Takes mine
Conscious that death is awaiting
Scene end
But even death will end in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again, again
It's the end of an empire

In the death of a desire
It's the end of an empire
At the close of a lifetime
It's the end of an empire

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again, again, again, again
It's the end of an empire
Again
It's the end of an empire

We're falling into the unknown
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
We're falling into the unknown (It's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
It's the end of an empire

We're falling into the unknown (It's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
It's the end

We're falling into the unknown (It's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
It's the end of an empire
It's the end of an empire
