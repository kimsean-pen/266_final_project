you got my heart working overtime
i let you in, let you cross the line
you want my trust, boy you have to try
give all your love if you wanna keep me
you got my heart working overtime
i let you in, let you cross the line
you want my trust, boy you have to try
give all your love if you wanna keep me high

if you want my heart
if you want my trust
don't play with my heart
give me all your love

boy i'm gonna get right to it
i don't know if we should do this
you into something dangerous
cuz i'm little but i'm furious
i better be in the front seat
when we cruising down love street
don't waste this opportunity
i'm letting you get close to me

you got my heart working overtime
i let you in, let you cross the line
you want my trust, boy you have to try
give all your love if you wanna keep me
you got my heart working overtime
i let you in, let you cross the line
you want my trust, boy you have to try
give all your love if you wanna keep me high

if you want my heart
if you want my trust
don't play with my heart
give me all your love

hey i don't know what i'm doing
but ooh don't wanna get ruined
damn can i get something for something
boy show me you're worth trusting
i'm the frosted side of a mini wheat
you know that i'm so sweet
if you want me to slow down
i'm not gonna hang around
