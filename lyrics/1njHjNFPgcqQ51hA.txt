I'm in a van
and you're holding my hand
You were travelling with me
through forests and sands
I've been innocently learning your language
and you've been taking full advantage
Haven't you?
Oh, don't say it's true.
I lost a friend
I'm the saddest again
And we kissed once
Hey, but that was in lust
I know you need more than given moments
and sentimental sorrys and words only spoken
seem lame
And I won't win your heart that way
Oh, it feels
like none of this is real
I pretend
that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze
like the river in Toronto
then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm
said I made you feel warm inside
Oh, it feels
like none of this is real
I pretend
that my heart and my head are well
But if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze
like the river in Toronto
then I'd be pleased
You said I made you feel warm,
said I made you feel warm inside.

If the blood
could freeze
I'd be pleased
I'd be pleased
