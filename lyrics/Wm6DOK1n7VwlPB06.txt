She could never be closer
...
And ever closer then tales can tell

...
But I can't fail
...

She could never be closer
...

And who's the one who casts the spell
...
Oh I can't tell

...
Pieces falling in the games we play

...
And even castles couldn't get away
...
Her lips are around you
You feel the sweat against your skin
...
Oh the mess you're in
...
Pieces falling in the games we play
...
And even castles couldn't get away
...
Pieces falling in the games we play
...
And even lovers could not get away
...
