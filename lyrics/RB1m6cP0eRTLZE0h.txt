It's only natural
They're looking at you
Like you must not be from here kid
Better move on up

Night in the city
Its getting in me electricity everywhere
And I'm falling in love

They wanna hold you
Pin and control you
They won't control anything
But they never give up

They want you quiet
Not too excited by the natural energy
Of falling in love
With everyone and everything

Its only natural
You wanna live downtown
Where you can be a little louder
And you're still just getting drowned out
Its only natural

Its only natural
You wanna live downtown
Let your freak flag fly a little higher
I like it when you let yourself lose control
