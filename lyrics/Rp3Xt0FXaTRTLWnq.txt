I'm not used to wanting to go so slow.
Nights go faster now that I'm with you,
but I'd die just to get stuck here forever,
you're the light of the tomb.

In the dark you don't need to know the way.
Scrape the rails with every turn that we take.
No more time to lose, there's too much at stake.
Submerge and come find me,
'cause nothing else calms me.

I'm not used to wanting to go so slow.
Nights go faster now that I'm with you,
but I'd die just to get stuck here forever,
you're the light of the tomb.

You're on fire but I'm turning to stone.
Maybe we're just drowning but at least we're alone.
Endless black dissolves the skin from our bones.
We'll never go deep enough,
because nothing can calm me.

I'm not used to wanting to go so slow,
nights go faster now that I'm with you.
But I'd die just to get stuck here forever
you're the light of the tomb.

And you know it feels right
(to get lost 'til we find)
to get lost 'til we find.

Suddenly I fail to see myself in your eyes.
Heaven is an endless hideaway.
Never is the air and there is nothing left to
separate the earth from the sky.

And you know it feels right
to be lost 'til we find.

I'm not used to wanting to go so slow.
Nights go faster now that I'm with you.
But I'd die just to get stuck here forever,
you're the light of the tomb.
When I close my eyes
I feel our surroundings fade and slowly let us die.
I know that we're buried
innocent and true.
When you're in my arms
I know we'll turn nothing into something tonight.
(Tonight)
