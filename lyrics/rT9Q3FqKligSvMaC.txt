I'm hanging on to the precipice
As it crumbles at my feet
Oh how long, til the great abyss
It takes me in its teeth

For the first time in my life
A space has opened up
Between tomorrow and tonight
Saturn will return us back to 1985
When we was just a spark
In two star crossed lovers eyes
Saturn have you turned to us once again?

At first strange but then at last
I thought I saw your face
But things have changed
And now the past is just another place

For the first time in my life
A space has opened up
Between tomorrow and tonight
Saturn will you turn us back to 1985
When we was just a spark
In two young starstruck lovers eyes
Saturn have you turned to us once again?
once again

You're the one I want
Let the others go and come out
With your Hands Up
With your Hands up

Be the change you want
becaus it belongs to us
It belongs to us

it's mine and yours
Mine and yours
Mine and yours
