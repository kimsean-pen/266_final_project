You swear you recall nothing at all
That could make you come back down
You made up your mind to leave it all behind
Now you're forced to fight it out

You fall away from your past
But it's following you
You fall away from your past

But it's following you
You left something undone, it's now your rerun
It's the one you can't erase
You should have made it right, so you wouldn't have to fight

To put a smile back on your face
You fall away from your past
But it's following you
You fall away from your past
But it's following you, now
You fall away
You fall away
Something I've done that I can't outrun
Maybe you should wait maybe you should run

But there's something you've said that can't be undone
And you fall away from your past
But It's following you
You fall away
It's following you, now
You fall away from your past
But it's following you
You fall away from your past
But it's following you
But it's following you
But it's following you
But it's following you
