Over the past few years
To the traditional sounds of the English summer
The drone of lawnmowers
The smack of leather on willow

Has been added a new noise
What were the skies like when you were young?
They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona
And the skies always had little fluffy clouds in them and, er.
They were long and clear and.

There were lots of stars at night
And, er, when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful
The most beautiful skies, as a matter of fact
Uh, the sunsets were.
purple and red and yellow and on fire
and the clouds would catch the colors everywhere

That's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little
You don't see that

Layering different sounds on top of each other

Layering different sounds on top of each other
Little fluffy clouds and, er. little fluffy clouds and, er.
Little fluffy clouds and, er. little fluffy clouds and, er.

You might still see that in the desert

The most beautiful skies, as a matter of fact
Purple and red
Purple and red and yellow and on fire and.

The clouds would catch the colors
