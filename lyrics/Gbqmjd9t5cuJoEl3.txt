Dived off the roof, they yelling suicide
I can't decide, I do too out of time
You say you gotta work out what you mean
You like to chase so you pretend like you tryna leave me
It's cool with me

Put that phone back in your bag
No service in the hills where we at
Got the shrooms, moon and the tax
This a night that you ain't getting back

It's 5 A.M., don't wanna leave
You changed your plans to be with me
The simple things, that's all we need
Get lost with me

Dived off the roof, they yelling suicide
I can't decide, I do too out of time
You say you gotta work out what you mean
You like to chase so you pretend like you tryna leave me
It's cool with me

Paper airplane in the bag
It feels like the haze where we're at
Look up at the sky, take a drag
Tell your friends that you ain't getting back

It's 5 A.M., don't wanna leave
You changed your plans to be with me
The simple things, that's all we need
Get lost with me
Get lose with me, babe

It's 5 A.M., don't wanna leave
You changed your plans to be with me
The simple things, that's all we need
Get lost with me
Get lose with me, babe
