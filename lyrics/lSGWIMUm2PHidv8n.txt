They found an empty bottle on her window sill
The day her mother lost her sleeping pills
She was sick and tired of being invisible
Hard to see in colour when you're miserable

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough, to hold onto us
We're still right here by your side

No one ever thought that she was capable
And the damage done is irreversible
Now she clings to life inside a hospital
Like she's trapped inside a frozen waterfall
Always said her life was never meant to be
Stuck here living someone else's dream
Well beyond your window there is so much more
Even every prison has an open door

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough, to hold onto us
It's just not your time to die

And while the angels sleep all of the devils are awake
Waiting to steal your love right outside of Heaven's gate
And all the sacred hearts can't numb the feeling from the pain
'Cause when the drugs don't work you're gonna curse His holy name

Damn God! Yeah!
God! Yeah!
Damn God! Yeah!
God! Yeah!

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
We're still right here by your side
So be strong enough, to hold onto us
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
It's just not your time to die
