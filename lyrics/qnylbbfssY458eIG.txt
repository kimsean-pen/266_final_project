Can you know what's true?
Living lies that kept me close to you
Lying is letting you go

Replay a miserable script full of words that I won't say
And I'm tired of trying to outrun a promise I should have never made
And I changed the locks so I could get through the days and nights I never asked you

Can you know what's true?
Living lies that kept me close to you
Lying is letting you go on
Lying is letting you go
Can you know what's true?
If lying is leaving, truth is just believing

Last night I came around to the truth whispered in my ear
In the light of day this sleight of hand romance is cold and crystal clear
So I waited long enough to show you
That I could change the way I know you

Can you know what's true?
Living lies that kept me close to you
Lying is letting you go on
Lying is letting you go
Can you know what's true?
If lying is leaving
If lying is leaving
Truth is just believing

Can you know what's true?
The regret in your eyes tells me there's nothing left to lose

Can you know what's true?
Living lies that kept me close to you
Lying is letting you go on
Lying is letting you go
Can you know what's true?
Lying is letting you go
