Tell me I'm worthy of you
Oh, tell me, I'm ready now
Here I stand, make me come back
Hear my call, I want you bad

Nation, they put names upon you
I trust you know you're being fooled
Tell me, is it too late for us?
For every truth found, two are lost

Nation, when did it get so cruel?
Nation, I'll have none of that
My nation. So small, so frail
Nation, you smell of betrayal

For throughout all these years
You only ever offered us tears
Nation, I'm not who I was
And what was the rush
Why cry out to be crushed?

And did I ever shorten
What I ought to have lengthened?
Did I only weaken
What I should have strengthened?

Nation, I fear for you
Nation, I'm dying too
Nation, it's said, it's done.
I found my nation in the legion
I found my nation in the legion...
