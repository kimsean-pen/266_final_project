I will be the one that will be beside you
Even when the stars don't seem so bright
Any obstacle that life throws I'll fight through
I will be the one
I will be the one that can show you hope here
Even when the night drowns out the light
You will hear my voice even through the darkness
I will be the one

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want you to feel alone
I'll do my best to make you right at home
All I want, all I want is for you to be okay
I know that soon there'll be a brighter day

I will be the one, I will be the one
I will be the one, I will be the one
Who will love you, who will feel you boy
Who will hold you, who will bring you joy

Don't you know my soul is bruised and bleeding?
When I know that you might be in pain
I will find whatever it is you're needing
I will be the one
And when there are no words to heal you
Cause at times you know they can't be just
All my empathy will try to feel you
I will be the one

I don't want, I don't want, I don't want you to feel alone
I'll do my best to make you right at home
All I want, all I want is for you to be okay
I know that soon there'll be a brighter day

I will be the one, I will be the one
I will be the one, I will be the one
Who will love you, who will feel you boy
Who will hold you, who will bring you joy

I will be the one, I will be the one
I will be the one, I will be the one
Who will love you, who will feel you boy
Who will hold you, who will bring you joy

I will be the one, I will be the one
Cause you're everything
You're my everything
Cause you're everything
You're my everything

I will be the one, I will be the one
I will be the one, I will be the one
Who will love you, who will feel you boy
Who will hold you, who will bring you joy

I will be the one, I will be the one
I will be the one, I will be the one
Who will love you, who will feel you boy
Who will hold you, who will bring you joy
