I'll take you on a ride
As a part-owner to my pain
Our ideals they collide
Coerced coexistence

I fought the world today - postpone my birth again
We stumble on and one - but bound to die alone

Pain - I'm selling my soul today
Pain - I need some sympathy

This infiltrates my brain
"in the sunshine the sun is mine"
Pitiless wanderer
Close your eyes and bow your head
Grotesque thoughts in a line
threw my wings onto the blazing sun
Smile stretched on old trees
Eternal Grining jester masque

Pain - I'm selling my soul today
Pain - I need some sympathy

Don't hurt a fly they all sing
We're just ants in a great big play
