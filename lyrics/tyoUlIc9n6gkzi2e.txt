If you feel up, you're about to get down
(Don't put trust in...)
The world spins round 'til I wanna pass out
(So don't put trust in...)
Was gonna put it off but you said, "No Now"
(Don't put trust in...)
I've bitten too much
Now I think you trust
Do I trust in you?

Since we've got to be here
Trust in me
"But if you ain't said it by now...
If you ain't said it by now...
You're not kneeling"
Trust my love in you
(Hear me go insane—) Right now
(Here me go...) Right now
I'm bleeding rust
Don't trust in me

So we let the gunmen clear the room
(Don't put trust in...)
Pointed out the innocent, and us too
(So don't put trust in...)
The sum of body parts =
Summer of our lives
And the grass won't get cut
Where we die
So you can't judge me

(Hear me go insane, here me go...)
Since we've got to be here
I'll trust in you
"But if you ain't said it by now...
If you ain't said it by now...
You're not kneeling"
Mistrust your love in me
(Hear me go insane—) Right now
(Here me go...) Right now
I'm bleeding rust
Don't trust in you

Don't trust in me
I will let you down
I won't trust in you
You will let me down
But we're born to lose
Well at least we're all in this together

Don't trust in me
I will let you down
I won't trust in you
You will let me down
But we're born to lose
Well at least we're all in this together

Don't trust in me
I will let you down
I won't trust in you
You will let me down
But we're born to lose
Well at least we're all in this together

Since we've got to be here
Trust in me
"But if you ain't said it by now...
If you ain't said it by now...
You're not kneeling"
Trust my love in you
(Hear me go insane)
(Here I go) Right now
You're bleeding rust
Don't trust in me
