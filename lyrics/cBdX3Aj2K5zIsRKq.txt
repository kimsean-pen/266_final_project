Already over trying to be alone
And brushing up on feeling free
Cellphone's a weapon of surveillance
All the distractions I don't need
Your naked body in my dream last night
It was like you never left
There was a stranger in my bedroom
I thought she never would leave

I'm always watching
I need to see you
I'm always watching
If I can't be with you
I'm always watching
Call it voyeurism or masochism
I'm always watching

Follow you down digital rabbit holes
Who you like, where you've been
So I continue to pine for the time
When you were somewhere with me
I wanna follow you into your sleep
and gently wake you up
Maybe you're naked on his bed right now
Maybe tonight you give him a shot

I'm always watching
I need to see you
I'm always watching
If I can't be with you
Cause I'm always watching
Call it voyeurism or masochism
I'm always watching you

Watching me watching you watching me watching you watching me watching you

I feel so stupid and spun-out and spoiled
All of my deficits unmasked
This game is torture but it's all I've got
since I got what I asked

I know you're watching
I need to see you
I know you're watching
And I keep doing this to you
Cause I'm always watching
Call it voyeurism, or masochism
At a coward's distance, voyeurism
I'm always watching, I'm always watching
I'm always watching, I'm always watching

Watching me watching you watching me watching you watching me watching you
