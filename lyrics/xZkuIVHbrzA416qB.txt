hey percy
the beauty hidden in the pain
i smile and i bleed
body rain

between the scenes
you should hold someone
every piece is time
you've undone

pretty boy
everything lost and still a sound
of mother's arms and soul
can be found

between the scenes
you should hold someone

between the scenes
you should hold someone
every piece is time
you've undone
