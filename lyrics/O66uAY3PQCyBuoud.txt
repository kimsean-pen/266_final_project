Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right"
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

Thinkin' of you's workin' up a appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite
And the thought of lovin' you is gettin' so excitin'

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this mornin' feelin' so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waitin' and I think I might
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waitin' for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of lovin 'fore the sun go down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up a appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is gettin' so excitin'

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
