II was on hold
Tired and getting cold
So I put my love to bed
Everything told
Scared to be alone
So you took my hand and said

Come inside I'll make your mind up
All this pain is gold
Come inside you'll be surprised at all there's yet to know

I was on hold
High becoming low
But it helps to kill my time
Out of control
Tied to what I'm told
So you match your step with mine

Come inside I'll make your mind up
All this pain is gold
Come inside you'll be surprised at all you have to hold

Come inside I'll make your mind up
All this pain is gold
Come inside you'll be surprised at all you have to hold
