Come on, E
Try to go easy
We can do anything, anything, anything
Come on, E
We got it covered
We can stop anytime, anytime, anytime
Come on, E
It's just a party
Lets go to party town, then we can party down
Come on, E
Check out my party hat
My name is Randall, I wrote you this song

Can't you see that all we need is
One night to release
It's bound to be the last in all of history

Come on, E
Raise your glass to the sky
Drink to those solid grays, olden days, whatever
Just want to get radical
Don't be a bummer
Look at the summer day
The sun is rising once again (yay)

(Can we have just one night without
All this self distruction?
I just love my husband; I can't live without him)

Come on, E
We're goin' easy
It's just a party
Time to get gnarly
Come on, E
Tryin' to go easy
My name is Randall, it's nice to meet you

We are always here to make you laugh

common, e!
