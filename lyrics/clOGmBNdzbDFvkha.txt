I'm looking for a way out
For a place that no one knows
Please take me away now
Somewhere it don't feel so cold

Troubles on my mind
Troubles on my mind
For the rest of the days I've cried
For the rest of the days I've cried

I'm searching for a paradise
That I just can't seem to find
I'm searching for a paradise
For the time of my life
I'm searching for a paradise
That I just can't seem to find
I'm searching for a paradise
Come and go where the spirit guides
All alone

My silhouette is fading
Past the point of safe return
No my body's aching
As both ends of the candle burn

My heart is beating slow
My heart is beating slow
It's worn to the pull
It's worn to the pull

I'm searching for a paradise
That I just can't seem to find
I'm searching for a paradise
For the time of my life
I'm searching for a paradise
That I just can't seem to find
I'm searching for a paradise
Come and go where the spirit guides

All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

I'm searching for a paradise
That I just can't seem to find
I'm searching for a paradise
For the time of my life
