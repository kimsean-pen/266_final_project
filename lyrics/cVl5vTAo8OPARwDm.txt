When you were just young
And you sang so high to the angels
And you just dont want to come home
Cause you sang so high to Hollywood
Down where your mother used to go so low
Oh colored marigolds you go so low
Through the window, oh you go
Hollywood is tumbling down
And when you sing so low, watch out or you'll that you know
And when you sing so low Hollywood is tumbling down
When you were just young
And you sang so high to the angels
And you just dont want to come home
Cause you sang so high to Hollywood
Down where your mother used to go so low
Oh colored marigolds you go so low
Through the window, oh you go
Hollywood is tumbling down
