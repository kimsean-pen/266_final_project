Just when I think everything's alright
That's when I overanalyze
I'm still runnin' away from you
and I don't know why (don't know why)
I start to think I am right for you
But deep inside, I know the truth
It's like my heart already beats for you
and I don't know why (don't know why)

What should I do? What should I say? Why's it bothering me?
Should I leave or should I stay? It's on repeat.
Moving on, I won't let it get the best of me.

I'm over over over overthinking
you you you
over over over overthinking
you you you
you-ou-ou
you-ou-ou
over overthinking you you you
I'm over over over overthinking
you you you
over over over overthinking
you

Na nananana nanana na nana
Na nananana na hey hey hey hey
Tryin' to find something wrong in you, but I'm runnin' out of reasons to
You give me feelings I never knew and I don't know why (don't know why)

What should I do? What should I say? Why's it bothering me?
Should I leave or should I stay? It's on repeat.
Moving on, I won't let it get the best of me.

I'm over over over overthinking
you you you
over over over overthinking
you you you
you-ou-ou
you-ou-ou
over overthinking you you you
I'm over over over overthinking
you
I don't wanna be afraid, to let things fall into place
Never been more certain that it's right
Cause I'm

Over over over overthinking
you you you
over over over overthinking
you you you
you-ou-ou
you-ou-ou
over overthinking you you you
I'm over over over overthinking
over overthinking you)
