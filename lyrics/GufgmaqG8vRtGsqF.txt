Oh my heart's so tight
And you're so wide
I cannot let you in
Please oh show me now
How I could make those flexible moves you do

You don't have to say that you love me
Just show how flexible you are
You don't have to say that you need me
Just show how flexible you are

So if you can show how I could see your secret ecstasy
My heart could learn to feel the limits of its flexibility

You don't have to say that you love me
Just show how flexible you are
You don't have to say that you need me
Just show how flexible you are

Stretch flex reflex

Oh my heart's so tight
and you're so wide
I cannot let you in
Please oh show me now
how I could make those flexible moves you do

You don't have to say that you love me
Just show how flexible you are
You don't have to say that you need me
Just show how flexible you are
