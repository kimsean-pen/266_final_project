...and still your voice is heard
...heard...

...and still we are shaken
...shaken...

...your voice... still here...

And so you say unto all
"I am all, we are one.
Go forth and bring them down"

War is waged, blood is spilled
Not in rivers, but in drops

Heaven's gate is in my hand
The key is your acceptance
