La, la, la, la,

Yeah
I could've been the one you noticed
I could've been all over you
I could've been like all the others

Is that what I'm supposed to do?
It would've been really stupid
If I would've went out with you
To give you everything you wanted

It would've been way too soon
I try to be sensitive, I try to be tough
I try to walk away
I try to be innocent, I try to be rough

But I just wanna pray
You're my
Daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you

Lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain how I feel inside
I can't get away,
You're my

Daydream
La, la, la, la,
Yeah
If I tell you what I'm thinking

And I let myself trust you
Can you give me what I'm missing?
Can you make my dreams come true?
I try to be sensitive, I try to be tough

I try to walk away
I try to be innocent, I try to be rough
But I just wanna pray
You're my

Daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you
Lately
And every time I look at you

I can't explain how I feel inside
I can't get away,
You're my
Daydream
I've always wanted someone
I've been waiting so long

Could you be that someone?
Are you mine?
You mine?
You're mine
YOU'RE MINE!
Daydream
You know that I've been thinking about you
Lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain what I feel inside
I can't get away
You're my
Daydream
You're my Daydream (You know and you know, and you know)
You're making me insane
You're my Daydream (You know and you know, and you know)
You're doing it again
You're my Daydream (And you know and you know, and you know)
You're making me insane
You're my Daydream (And you know and you know, and you know)
You're doing it again
