Is everything just right
Don't want you thinking that I'm in a hurry
I won't stay afraid
I have this vision and it's got me worried
'Cause everyone wants someone
That's one clich√© that's true
The sad truth's I want no one
Unless that someone's you
It looks like you
Feels like you
Smiles like you
I want someone just like you
Through and through
I'm forever blue
'Cause there's no one else like
I hope that you're not mad
You always said you want a man of action
I'm not the hottest lad, no
There's more to life than physical attraction
You got your special someone
But between me and him, guess who
Will spend their whole life waiting
For someone just like you
That looks like you
That feels like you
That smiles like you
I need someone just like you
Love me true
I'm forever blue
'Cause there's no one else like
Woo, woah, woo-hoo
I want you in my arms
I see you in my dreams
I'm gonna make you mine
As crazy as it seems
Girl, you, yes you
I need someone just like you
Love me true
I'm forever blue
Because there's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else I need
'Cause you're so fine
You're so fine
'Cause you're so fine
You're so fine
Cause you're so fine
You're so fine
'Cause you're so fine
You're so fine
'Cause you're so fine
You're so fine
