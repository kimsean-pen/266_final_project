"We were dancing
And there were people everywhere,
But no one could see us
No one else could hear the music
The people disappeared
And the music stopped
I was trying to say things
But the only thing that
Would come out was just your name
Over and over, just your name
And then you just smiled at me
Like you do
It felt so real
Just felt...
I don't wanna be rushed
Did you dream about anything last night?
I don't care"
