Whoa, yeah!

I'm always thinking of you
And all the things that you do.
Self-centered satisfaction,
No more will I run from you!

Dysfunctional family values,
I'll die but I will not fear.
Stop talking words of wisdom,
You fool, I'm standing right here!

The world is on your shoulders,
The weight, it's crushing me.
Now we're all getting older,
Take it out,
(Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!)
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Vent your frustration on me!

I feel so much destruction
In everything that you do.
Anger is creeping in me,
Watch I don't explode on you!

My rage, it comes so quickly,
One spark and I will ignite.
Self-harming mutilation
Cuts deep but the pain feels so right

The world is on your shoulders,
The weight, it's crushing me.
Now we're all getting older,
Take it out,
(Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!)
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Vent your frustration on me!

(BREAK)

This fire burns inside,
(This fire burns inside)
There's nowhere left to hide.

This fire burns inside,
(This fire burns inside)
This rage can't be denied!

(SOLO)

The world is on your shoulders,
The weight, it's crushing me.
Now we're all getting older,
Take it out,
(Take it out! Take it out! Take it out!)
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Take it out on me!
Vent your frustration on me!
Take it out!
