I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be
Tell me your story, I'm all ears to listen
Don't spare no details, go on, get specific
I know we just met but I already miss you, honestly

I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

I wanna be your Fridays, baby
And Tuesdays too
Introduce me to your friends
Wanna shake your daddy's hand
Be your all the time kinda man

I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be

But I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only, oh
Yeah, one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
Yeah, one night only
