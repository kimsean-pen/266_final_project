Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask you
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask you
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

And there's two white horses followin' me
And there's two white horses followin' me
I got two white horses followin' me
Waiting on my buryin' ground

Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Means another poor boy is underground

Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Have you ever heard that church bells toll?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Means another poor boy is dead and gone

Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Now I believe what the Bible told

There's just one last favor I'll ask you
And there's one last favor I'll ask you
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
