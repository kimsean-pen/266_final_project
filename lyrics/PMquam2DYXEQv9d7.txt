We rush through our lives
Just to feel some kind of pride
Dismissing actualities is making matters worse
The ink will fade but it won't go away

A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in

You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this

I live in the middle of a lake
And I don't know how to swim
I've isolated everything
Everywhere I go I am consistently alone

A baggy shirt hides my hollow frame
Lie down and get sucked in

You act as if I have this healing touch
As if I was keeping a secret from you
You could throw out your line
A call in temporary clarity
It'll never stop
It'll never stop this

Cautions only ever made me worry
You know that cautions only ever made me worry
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Because cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
Cautions only ever made me worry
