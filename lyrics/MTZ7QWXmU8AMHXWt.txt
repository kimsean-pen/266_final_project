Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, I know what I'm doing
Gotta feeling I should be doin' all right
Doin' all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow?
Anyway, I should be doin' all right
Doin' all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There a time in all the world

Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway, I've got hideaway

Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, God knows what I'm doing
Anyway, I should be doin' all right
Doin' all right
Doin' all right
