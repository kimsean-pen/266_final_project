I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips
I've lost all hope
I want nothing to do with this

If we don't leave
We will burn with this town

If everything was everything
I would never have to worry about anything

I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips

"And I worry about you"
"And I worry about you"
"I don't know why you're doing it"
"But it's not good and it's not healthy- it's not right"
"Not that I'm saying you don't have it together, I'm sure you do"
"You're a genius, you really are. You're a genius"

"I know"
