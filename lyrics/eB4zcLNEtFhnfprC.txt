There's nothing to do
There's nothing to say
This love sweet life proves the case
I spit it on like a forsaken Monday
I took a breakie at home
And do what my mama say

I'm sittin' alone
Sippin' a latte
I hate every single time I wake up
The Gorgon on me shake up
Farewell her waiste up on me
Now I found there's nothing to say

Why does she cry?
'Cause these social sites
These places cristalize
Like total night eye
Need a place to sing
My own instinct said
If you realize...

I have a girl
She's the best
She used to get the train
From South West

When she hits clapper
Hope that I wasn't in hers
All her friends will tend to lend
Funds but she knows it's not just girls
Who want to have fun

That is why, why...
Does she cry?
'Cause these social sites
These places really nice
But I need a light, I
Need a place to sing
My own instinct said
If you realize...

There's nothing to do
With a slimy day
I lost my baby
Oh I'm fading away
There's nothing ruthless
I just tend to be useless
And truth gets something inside of the way

I'm sittin' alone
Sippin' a latte
I hate every single time I wake up
The Gorgon on me shake
Farewell her waiste
Now I found there's nothing to say

Why
Does she cry?
'Cause these social sites
These places cristalize
Light all over my eyes
I need a place to sing
My own instinct said
If you realize

And if you realize
And if you realize
And if you realize
