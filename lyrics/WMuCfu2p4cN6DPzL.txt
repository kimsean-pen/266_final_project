Don't lose my breath
Don't change your mind
No need to find out who you are

Don't lose my breath
Don't catch my fall
No need to find out what you are

Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside out there with you
Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside now

Don't lose my breath
Don't break my heart
No need to find out where you are

Don't lose my breath
Don't let this all
Come crashing down on everyone

Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside out there with you
Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside out there with you

Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside out there with you
Over the hillside, out in the water
I'd be over the hillside now

Don't lose my breath
Don't change your mind
