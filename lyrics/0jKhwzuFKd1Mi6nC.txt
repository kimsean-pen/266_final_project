Drunk in the morning sun
I could be talking to you dear or anyone
This is my hiding place
I'd found a focus
You were a light on the shadow of a darkened path
Its an empty world now you are gone

Tell me what it's all about
Shed tears for God's rejected
Cut the cord, rewind the ending
Take my life back to the start
Pick up the pieces of my heart
Let it be over
Smoke another cigarette
Draw into the cavern of my failing
Lungs with heightened senses
Scattered ashes
All that's left of a lifetime that we had planned
I am here and you are not

Tell me what it's all about
Cruel Gods of intervention
Cut the cord, rewind the ending
Take my life back to the start
Pick up the pieces of my heart
Let it be over

Scattered ashes
Someday we might find a way back to each other
But for now
