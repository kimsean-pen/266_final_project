You got yourself a bunch of bad habits.
Not hard to see that love is a weakness.
Seems to me, the way you understand it,
is that you're never gonna make it happen.

I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
to look you in the eye.
Do I even know what your face looks like
or just the cloud of smoke in it's place?
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before...

You got a dollar in your pocket.
You got a pebble in your sock and
you've got a mind of gold you keep secret.
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it.

I get tongue-tied every time I try
to tell you what I think is right,
cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
looking like a toy in the lost and found.
I am telling you something you might've heard before
and forgot on the spot.

You're a strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool.

I see the blood rushing to your head.
Your words are slurred and your cheeks are red.
You'd do anything to stop pretending.
Can't have regrets when you can't remember them.

You are one of a kind, I cannot lie.
You're wild when your body's in overdrive.
And I'm more surprised every time you're alive
when I check for your breath in the morning.

You're a strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool.

I thought you'd hit rock bottom,
but I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
cause you've been falling for so long
and you haven't hit anything solid yet.

I thought you'd hit rock bottom,
but I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist

and you haven't hit anything solid yet.

You're a strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
strange torpedo on the loose,
and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool.
