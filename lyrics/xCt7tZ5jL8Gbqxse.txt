There is nothing in your soul tonight
I only see darkness
And there is nothing in your soul tonight
I only see darkness

The past, how thick it grows
Shakes up what you didn't know
Proceeding, try a little bit harder, baby
You're indifferent
You're a stranger to what makes you feel good

I love you more than you love yourself
I love you more than you love yourself

On top of it
Pulling out the nails
In a moment of calm
Still feels good
But it's been so long

There is nothing in your soul tonight
I only see darkness
And there is nothing in your soul tonight
I only see darkness

The past, how thick it grows
Shakes up what you didn't know
Proceeding, try a little bit harder, baby
You're indifferent
You're a stranger to what makes you feel good

I love you more than you love yourself
I love you more than you love yourself
