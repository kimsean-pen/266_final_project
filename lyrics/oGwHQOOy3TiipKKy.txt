I can feel it coming
In the air tonight
Oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh lord, oh lord

Well when you told me
You were drowning
I would not lend a hand

I've seen your face
Before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

Well I was there
And I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes

So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a path of lies

I can feel it coming
In the air tonight
Oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh lord, oh lord

Well I remember
I remember
Don't worry

How could I ever forget?
It's the first time
The last time
We ever met

But I know the reason why
You keep me silenced up
No you don't see me

'Cause the hurt doesn't show
But the pain still rolls
No stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming
In the air tonight
Oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh lord

I can feel it
In the air tonight
Oh lord, oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh lord, oh lord

I can feel it coming
In the air tonight
Oh lord

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh lord, oh lord
