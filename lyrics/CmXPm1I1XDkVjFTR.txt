Winter's setting in again
And it feels like the end is near
Senseless sense and I'm alone
Watching the seconds passing by
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath for a promise sworn and broken
All that's gone
Away
On Monday morning you can't wake up
Still dreaming of what could've been
Something good has gone and left you
It's another tear
One more denial
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath
Another promise sworn and broken
All that's gone
All that's gone before you've changed

When Monday morning you don't wake up
Still dreaming of what could've been
Something good has gone and left you
It's another tear
One more denial
Come January, I swear this world
Won't be the one that we once lived on
Took an oath
Another promise sworn and broken
All that's gone
All that's gone before
All that's gone before
All that's gone before
It's changed
