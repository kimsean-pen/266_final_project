You're blind to what's in front of you
What do you know about the truth
Devalued as, as soon as we're cast
We were never made to last
Just bodies made and fabricated
We're fighting towards our life extension
We're living for our expiration

Under the surface we're not machines
Under the surface we're living dreams
Death lives just one breath away
Somewhere my heart beats in silence
I made my way through the violence
Nobody lives forever

It's a shame you won't live
But then again, who does?

My endless will for resolution
Echoing since my creation
I'm living for my expiration

Under the surface we're not machines
Under the surface we're living dreams
Death lives just one breath away
Somewhere my heart beats in silence
I made my way through the violence
Nobody lives forever
Under the surface we're not machines
Under the surface we're living dreams
Death lives just one breath away

It's a shame you won't live
But then again, who does?
All these memories will fade in time
Like tears in rain
Time to die
