You say the things you say
And you're dreaming like you do
You know, sometimes, circles run around you
Hey now, let's be honest
I really think it's true
You know sometimes we all bend the rules

You run with life, you've been around,
You love, to live, to hate this town
And I hope and dream just like you do.
Yeah, we've been here twice before
You want it to mean so much more
And I hope that everything goes through

She goes to California, oh
California's not so far
When I close my eyes and wonder where you are
And you wish upon a star
Two thousand miles doesn't seem so far

You play the games you play,
You win, sometimes you lose
You know, sometimes walls run into you
Now you've got me thinking
And I really think it's true
That the sun shines sometimes just for you

You run with life, you've been around,
You love, to live, to hate this town
And I hope and dream just like you do.
Yeah, we've been here twice before
You want it to mean so much more
And I hope that everything goes through

She goes to California, oh
California's not so far
When I close my eyes and wonder where you are
And you wish upon a star
Two thousand miles doesn't seem so far.
(So far, so far, so far...)
