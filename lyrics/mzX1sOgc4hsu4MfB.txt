I kick it root down

I put my root down
I kick it root down
I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it?

Gonna kick it root down
Yeah how you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how you gonna kick it?

Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it all down
Gonna kick it root down
It's not a put down, I put my foot down

And then I'm makin' some love, I put my root down
I'm like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
Everybody know I'm known for dropping science
I'm electric like Dick Hyman

I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So Mike, get on the mic and turn it out
We're talking root down, I put my boot down

And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down
I said it's root down, it's time to scoot down
Until I step up to the mic in my goose down
Come up represent from the upper west

Money makin' put me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
'Cause I'm doing what I want so I never rest
Well I'm ain't coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys

Just strutting like the meters with the lookin in py py
'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is falling then I'm gone
You do might think that I'm a fanatic

A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So bring it to the root where we kick it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man I want to give him a pound
I kick it root down

I put my root down
I kick it root down
I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it?

Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it?

Gonna kick it root down
Break it all down
Gonna kick it root down

Ad Rock, don't stop, just get on the mic with the tic and the toc
I'm gonna fill you with the f******' rim like brim
I'm walking down your block and you say that's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound
The Beastie Boys you know we come to get down

Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick and say
"Oh my God that's the funky shit"
So I'm a pass the mic and cause a panic
The original nasal kid is doing damage

Every morning took the train to the high street station
Doing homework on the train, what a f****** up situation
On the way back up hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes

It's like Harlem world battles on the Zulu beat show
It's kool moe D'vs busy bee there's one you should know
Enough of that just want to give some respect due M.C.A.
Grab the mic and the ma bell connect you

Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
If dancin' prays to the Lord then I will feel alright
I feel a good to play a little music
Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it

And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone
I'll take a little shout out to my dad and mom
For bringing me into this world and so on
I kick it root down
I put my root down
I kick it root down
I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
How you wanna kick it?
Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna rock it?
Gonna kick it root down
Break it all down
Gonna kick it root down, down

And that's a record, that's a record And that's a record, that's a record And that's a record, that's a record Oh now that's a record
