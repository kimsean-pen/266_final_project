I told you what to tell you again
You really are my very best friend
But I, but I have to go, to go
Every time I think of you now
I get so blue somehow
'Cause I, cause I still love you, love you

Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine

I can feel the days grow cold
Boy, I'd love a hand to hold
It's yours, it's yours still for me, for me
Though I don't deserve you babe
But I really like it like that
Would you, would you like it too
You do

Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
