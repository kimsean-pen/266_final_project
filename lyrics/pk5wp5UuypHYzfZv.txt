Check, yes Juliet, are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside
Check, yes Juliet, kill the limbo

I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight
Lace up your shoes, a-o-a-o

Here's how we do
Run, baby, run don't ever look back

They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby, run forever will be you and me
Check, yes Juliet, I'll be waiting
Wishing, wanting yours for the taking
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye

Check, yes Juliet, here's the countdown
3, 2, 1, you'll fall in my arms now
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind
Lace up your shoes, a-o-a-o
Here's how we do
Run, baby, run don't ever look back

They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby, run forever will be you and me
We're flying through the night, we're flying through the night
Way up high!

The view from here is getting better with you by my side
Run, baby, run don't ever look back

They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby, run forever will be
Run, baby, run don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby, run forever will be you and me
You and me
You and me
