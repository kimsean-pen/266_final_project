His master's name was Don
They shared a life in Rottenrun
Their lair was full of scales
Way beneath the fallen log

No fear, no love alive
If Don would call, the Snat would rise
No fear, no love alive
Between the two, their tears ran dry

Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again

A painting of his face
Placed there by the master Don
Reminds him of the tale
Of when he dies, the Snat lives on

No fear, no love alive
If Don would call, the Snat will rise
No fear, no love alive
Between the two, their tears ran dry
