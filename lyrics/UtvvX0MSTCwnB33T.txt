Take all of the love you're given
Through that gap in the wall,
See the type with the light blue ribbon
Then unlock the door
But you ego won't let you love
When your fear is your downfall
If you won't take the love you're given
Then at least let me go
Please let me go, please let me go
Please let me go, please let me go
Please let me go, please let me go

I've been trying to give you my love
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to give you some space
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to save you the trouble
But you won't let me, won't let me

I've been trying to give you my love

Don't feed the solace within you
And allow it to grow
'Cause when the leaves, the blossom become you
They'll turn black and they'll fall
I promise you if you're gonna lock me out
I will stand as your ghost,
If you take the love you're given
I will leave you alone

I will leave you alone
I will leave you alone

I've been trying to give you my love
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to give you some space
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to save you the trouble
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to give you my love
But you won't let me, won't let me
