Enuma ilu awiluma
Ardu Shamash apkallu baru
Nergal ina ramanisu
Annu ki-utu-kam ilu...

Parak simati
Muballit mitte...
Nergal allatu mellamu mesaru
La tapallah Annuaki
Kettu Puluthu qillatu...

Erset la tari etimmu...
Ina ramanisu melammu
Baru dinau...
Allatu Nergal...
...Sar kissati...

Nergal allatua...
Allatu Adapa...
Ina ramaniusue...

Translation from Akkadian:

When God's human being
Shamash's slave, wise men, saw
Nergal in himself
This Earth-stomped land became God's.

At a decent throne
Of life and death
Nergal comes glowing,
Not stopping at Senior Gods
As he was fear's bride.

In the land with no return
In it's glory
The look upon judgement
Gave birth to Nergal
The king of underground.

Nergal was born,
Adapa suffered,
of what was in himself
