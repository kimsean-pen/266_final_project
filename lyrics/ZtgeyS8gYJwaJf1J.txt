Crushing me and your eyes again
Angels breathe and decide our fate

Laugh at me
And say we are free
Again

Golden hours of love
Inhaled

Instead of disease
They are sending me
Eternal breed
Break my arms and legs
In my dreams we cry

Laugh at me
And say we are free
Just say
Laughing loud
But i'll sing you a chant

Will I save your heart again
Will I save you heart again
Will I save your heart again

Crush your face
And my eyes, breakGo, decide what you want to take
Wipe those tears
And when you're here
Have respect for the love we had

Instead of disease they are sending me
Eternal breed
Break my arms and legs
In my dreams we cry

Laugh at me
And say we are free
Again
Laughing loud but i'll sing you a chant

Will I save your heart again
Will I save you heart again
Will I save your heart again
