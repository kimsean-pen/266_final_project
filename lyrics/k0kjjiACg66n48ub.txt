Why me Lord?
What have I ever done?
To deserve even one
Of the blessings I've known

Why me Lord?
What did I ever do?
That was worth love from You
And the kindness You've shown

Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it
So help me Jesus
I know what I am

Now that I know
That I've needed You
So help me Jesus
My soul's in Your hand

Try me Lord
If You think there's a way
That I can repay
What I've taken from You

Maybe Lord
I could show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You

Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it
So help me Jesus
I know what I am

Now that I know
That I've needed You
So help me Jesus
My soul's in Your hand
Jesus, my soul's in Your hand
