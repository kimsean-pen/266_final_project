Don't speak my name!
Like it belongs in your mouth!
When everything's the same!
I just want something else
What makes you better than me?!
If you still end up all by yourself
What makes you think that I want to help you now?
Don't come back to me!
I'll show the world that I can finally breathe
Without...
These...

Words!
It's just a story that goes untold!
It's just a feeling I've never known before
I won't forgive you for this
So just know that you won't be missed
So don't come back to me
Now that you're gone I can finally breathe again

And I won't forget you

These days here without you are
The best that I've ever had
So don't come back to me
Now that you're gone I can finally breathe again
And I won't forgive you for this
So just know that you won't be missed
What makes you better than me?

Look at the person that you've become
I know you never tried at all

Don't ever speak my name again!
It won't be long until we reach the end!
It's just a story that goes untold!
But I can breathe and there's room for me to grow!
I won't forgive you for this

So just know that you won't be missed
So don't come back to me
Now that you're gone I can finally breathe again

And I won't forget you
These days here without you are
The best that I've ever had

So don't come back to me
Now that you're gone I can finally breathe again
And I won't forgive you for this
So just know that you won't be missed

(You won't be missed)
Don't speak my name again
I won't forgive you
I won't forget
(You won't be missed)
Don't speak my name again
It won't be long until we reach the end.
