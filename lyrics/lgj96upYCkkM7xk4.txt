We don't know but we're made of
The same thing we're afraid of, might improve us
Stay up all night just lie up
Lose half but it's paystub
To make moves with or all of it of course

But there ain't no room in Paris
We can still fly high then crash it
Just make sure you pass it
No you can't imagine
Ooh it's automatic
The life we live is lavish
We don't have to be here
If we stay, we don't have to leave
If we go, roll some mo

And we ain't too high
To see eye to eye
Know you feel the rush
From a simple touch, baby
Roll some mo

Throw some K's and lift it up to your vision
Want me on my knees you're my religion
Speak in tongues I know your body well it's listening
Tap out on you that's just a mission or you givin'
Can't let no time go wasted
This moment can't replace it
Sitting around so lazy
Comfortably we'll fade away

But there ain't no room in Paris
We can still fly high then crash it
Just make sure you pass it
No you can't imagine
Ooh it's automatic
The life we live is lavish
We don't have to be here
If we stay, we don't have to leave
If we go, roll some mo

And we ain't too high
To see eye to eye
Know you feel the rush
From a simple touch, baby
Roll some mo

Oooh, ooooh, ooooh, oooh
Oooh, ooooh, ooooh, oooh
