I'm at the point of almost breaking now
I've knocked on every door in this cold town, yeah
And the higher you go, the harder you fall
If I want to be safe then I just stay small
Wanna grow to the sky where it's beautiful
But I can't see that from the forest floor

How can I hold it together
When nothing I try makes it better
I just wanna lay here forever
'Cause if I don't get up then I can' t fall down

There is no manual for a broken heart
I want to use it but it's all in parts, oh
And the more you fall in, the harder to see
But this time it's different though I want to believe
And I don't know if I have it in me
To laugh again in the face of defeat

How can I hold it together
When nothing I try makes it better
I just wanna lay here forever
'Cause if I don't get up then I can't fall down

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
And if I don't dare love
It can't let me down

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hope is irresistible
(Whoa, whoa)
Hope is irresistible
(Whoa, whoa)
'Cause if I don't get up one day I will somehow

How can I hold it together
When nothing I try makes it better
I just wanna lay here forever
'Cause if I don't dare love then I can't fall down

Whoa, and if I don't dare love it can't let me down
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
No, no, no
(Whoa, whoa)
If I can't get up now
(Whoa, whoa)
One day I will somehow
