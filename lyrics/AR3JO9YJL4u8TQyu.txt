This magic Winter Night I see a Light
Again I hear that Tune, some Sort of Croon
Oh No No No, Oh My Brain

I see them Gypsy Waggons left in the
Snow
Oh I must see that Lady, I have to know

Gypsy Woman let me inside

Solo: M.D.

They say you know the Secret, Secret of
Time
So gaze into your Crystal and tell me All
you see
Gypsy Woman let me know

"Oh my Son you were never Gone
You are the Devil's Child, and so am I"

Solo: M.D. Solo: H.S.

Gypsy now I know you're not my Mother
You are a Part of my Soul, it's clear for All
to see
Oh No No No, I Am You
Gypsy You're Inside of Me
