Waking up, got somewhere to go
I'm making sweat fall
Step in line, do it hard enough
To bring your color back
Got no time to waste
'Cause I'm poor and
If I get something good
I'm gonna take it
I shouldn't laugh but I feel it
I'm inside
I am moribund
It's what you want: torpidity
But I sigh
Got no time to waste
'Cause I'm poor and
If I get something good
I'm gonna take it
I shouldn't laugh but I feel it
I'm inside
I am moribund
It's what you want: torpidity
But I sigh
Got no time to waste
'Cause I'm poor and
If I get something good
I'm gonna take it
I shouldn't laugh but I feel it
I'm inside
I am moribund
It's what you want: torpidity
But I sigh
What if we were alive?
What if we were alive?
What if we were alive?
He knows, it's true
I believed in nothing before
I've been living in a garden
Distant, I was in a fortress
Those tough walls crumbling and I think I see
How we've been cheated, the lies
It's like we were alive
It's like we were alive
It's like we were alive
Doctor, what's the cure for apathy?
Come and pick me up
It's like we were alive
