'Cause I know it's you
When my phone rings at night
Let's get away from here
There's this house we could share
Let's find a car and drive it away
Get away today
Let's get away from here
There's this house we could share
A beach house
Where the sound of the ocean
Is all you can hear
Come on, come on
Let's get away from here
