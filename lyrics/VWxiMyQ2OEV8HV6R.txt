You're close to me
I'm under you
Such a little girl
A woman too
She comes cause she needs it

A dress in black stand in the back girl
Matter of fact she's a good bad girl
She's there when I need it

We're changing forms
I'm losing you
You're black and blue

Don't look back, she's just a sad girl
Matter fact man, it's a mad world

...

You're trembling, I like it, too
And we're never gonna get us enough of it
What did we uncover

Dress in black remember that one
Can't take it back like I never had fun
If only I could touch her

We're changing forms
I'm losing you
You're black and blue
Only when I touch her

Let me sink
Let me sink my teeth in
Let her sink
