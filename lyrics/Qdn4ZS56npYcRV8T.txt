Blood on the corner
Love on a dead end street
You heard them warn her
When you first heard of me
You stopped at nothing
Shots rang rang in the night
I'd stopped a little short
A little short of something right

Well I've got a growing got a growing list
All the names to kill, all the same to kiss
And if you look deadly you'll make it
Yeah and I've got a growing got a growing list
And the skin you're in is infinite
And if you've got flesh to spare you're there
We're in, infinite skin
We're in

Love on the corner
Blood on a dead end street
You had to find her
To tell to tell of me
You stopped at nothing
Threw down your favorite knife
I stopped a little short
A little short of something right

Well I've got a growing got a growing list
All the names to kill, all the same to kiss
And if you look deadly you'll make it
Yeah and I've got a growing got a growing list
And the skin you're in is infinite
And if you've got flesh to spare you're there
We're in

Never really growing
Closer than this
There's a distinct chance
You'll make my list
I watched you make a killing
Near me tonight
You stopped a little short
A little short of something right
Well, well, well

I've got a growing got a growing list
All the names to kill, all the same to kiss
And if you look deadly you'll make it
You'll make it
Yeah and I've got a growing got a growing list
And the skin you're in is infinite
And if you've got flesh to spare you're there
You're there! Yeah!

Well I've got a growing got a growing list
All the names to kill, all the same to kiss
And if you look deadly you'll make it
You'll make it
Yeah and I've got a growing got a growing list
And the skin you're in is infinite
And if you've got flesh to spare you're in, infinite skin
