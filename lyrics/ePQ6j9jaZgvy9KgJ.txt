No more late thunders
Sitting in sin
Come open the grudge
I'm here to breathe
Center of all the treason
The veil, the pain
I'm close to crystal dream
To cross in your sky

There no song my dove
In this often fluent night
Descended with the wings
Of the unhappy's head
The soft wind caresses your shiny memory
My sweat flows into the walls
It's pure exulery

Everything I try
Is to fill my hands with your warm light
Everything I try
Falls from the blade that gave us all the right

Seeing is nothing, no restraint
My shoulder remains deeply inside your waist

Everything I try
Is to fill my hands, make me whole this time
Everything I try
Falls from the blade that gave us all the right

A flower of your own faith
That tied this open door
Never ending summer
I find you in your way
The future is steep
In the rain it lives
I know it ain't for sure
But love does

Everything I try
Is to fill my hands, make me whole this time
Everything I try
Again, again, everything I try

Everything I try
Is to fill my hands with your warm light
Everything I try
