Nobody said it was easy
But if was so easy
To stand alone
A breeze in my hair
The wind in my hair
A black fly coming round the bend

Is it a high dive you're looking for
Or a 24 hour convenience store?
Buzzing like a black fly

It's a two-way street
They're always talking about
And you're coming straight up
Only two ways
And you're looking down
A gaze, trying to figure it

Is it a high dive you're looking for
Or a 24 hour convenience store?
Buzzing like a black fly

Was it what you want, what you want
What you wanted was something to eat?
Was it what you want, what you want
What you wanted was something to be?

You're buzzing round
Below you can see the town
All the little people in their little lives
Looking down, if they just could
Look up and see
You're not the black star they want you to be
You're just a black dot in the sky
