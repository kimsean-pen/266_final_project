We were dancin barefoot on the moonlit sand,
We were makin music we don't need a band,
I can't believe we only met tonight!
Cos we won't let each other out of site.
Maybe I should feel a twinge of shame,
Were almost lovers I don't know your name.

A voice inside shouts like a traffic cop, stop!
I'm gonna love you after all,
On a summers night, who cares about tomorrow, baby,
All on a summers night, and everything will turn out right,

The nights so young we danced all through the night,
Your even better in the morning light,
?,
It maybe love or maybe just the wine,
?, turn your head around,
Or is it you that makes my? found?

A voice inside shouts like a traffic cop, stop!
I'm gonna love you any way,
On a summers day, who cares about tomorrow, baby,
All on a summers day, and everything will turn out right,

You, and me, all alone on here on the beach tonight,
With the moon and the stars, and the sand, and the waves.
Oh! I know this night will never end,
I love you darling, always.

Were barely seen out in the burning heat,
The evening tide is washed up on our feet,
Were all alone on the beach again,
The faitless? washed away the sand,
I feel like celebrating finding you,
Were often running the whole night through.

A voice inside shouts like a traffic cop, stop!
You say you loved me after all, on a summers night,
The greatest things can happen, baby, all on a summers night,
And everything had turned out right, all on a summers day.
Who cares about tomorrow, baby,
All on a summers day, I'm gonna love you anyway,
All on a summers night, the greatest things can happen.
