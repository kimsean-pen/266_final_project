Spring has sprung in the summer
All the girls take off their clothes
The warmer weathers so much finer
Winter it goes so slow
I went to have just a little but
I had a little too much
I was planning on just chilling out
Now wanna have some fun

I found a feeling that feels too real
Nobody knows just how good I feel
I took a pill now I can't stay still
But I'm too fucked up for romance too
