Well, alright
One, two, three, four

Fight for the black shark, see what evil brings
Can't you see we're out for blood?
Love from a shotgun, license to kill
Can't you see we're out for blood?

The kids scream in fright through the night
Loving every bite with delight
And we blow out our minds with your truth
Together we stand for the youth

Ooh, red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot
Red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot

Shout at the Devil, we've laughed at your wars
Can't you see we're out for blood?
Runnin' with the pack now, always ask for more
Can't you see we're out for blood?

The kids scream in fright through the night
Loving every bite with delight
And we blow out our minds with your truth
Together we stand for the youth

Ooh, red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot
Red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot

Ooh, red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot
Red hot, red hot
Oh, to the top we are red hot

Red hot, red hot
Red hot, red hot
