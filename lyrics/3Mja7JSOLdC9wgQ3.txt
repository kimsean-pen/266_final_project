Run away and play your games
Hide well so I can't find you
I will wait for summer to come
Then laugh as the trees burn down around you

Your body was just a test for me
If I run as fast as I can
The thought of your memory
Will catch up with me, will catch up with me

I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared
(You always misled me)
I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared
(You always misled me)

You always got the worst of me

It's a shame, but you're still lying broken here
In this moment, everything just seems so clear, because
Her body was just a test, you see
If you run as fast as you can
With the thought of my memory
(Thought of my memory)
Will catch up to me
It will catch up, you see

I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared
(You always misled me)
I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared at all

When summer passes, I'll let go
And if you don't feel me, just dig yourself out
When summer passes, let me know
So I can find a meaning to live

I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared
(You always misled me)
I'm always late with my words
(I tried so hard, I tried so hard)
Should have told you, but I never really cared
(You always misled me)

You always got the worst of me
