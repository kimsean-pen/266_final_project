Guess I need some education
Grab some whilst I have the chance to free
Twice upon a time hear yea hear yea hear yea
Plastic bow wow no can't remember... can't remember No...!

In my arms she's warm and smooth
All the bones in heaven will...
I'm just a dipstick yes I like that frying but...
That cop, that cop, hey! that cop's from
That cop's from MARS! Aaaaaaough baby
Ha. Mars. Mars

Fried bones, in the air (? who knows, it might be right)
Fried bones, everywhere
Hot bones, made of light
Someone's pulled my skin on my, on my oh Oh OH

In my arms she's warm and smooth
All the bones in heaven will...
I'm just a dipstick yes I like that frying but...
That cop, that cop, hey! that cop's from
That cop's from MARS! Aaaaaaough baby
Ha. Mars. Mars

I'm just a dipstick searching for truth

Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling time again time again
Must have some coffee Let's have some caw-fee
I die a coupla times for you
I die a coupla times a night for you, Aaaaaargh

In my arms she's warm and smooth
All the bones in heaven will...
I'm just a dipstick yes I like that frying but...
That cop, that cop, hey! that cop's from
That cop's from MARS! Aaaaaaough baby
Ha. Mars. Mars
