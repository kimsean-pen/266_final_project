Freedom's just a word today
Freedom's just a word
When someone takes your word away, it's seldom ever heard
So take a sentence full of things you're not supposed to say
Carry on
But don't write 'em down
Or you'll be gone

Love is just a song today
Love is just a song
When someone takes the song away, you seldom sing along
So take those lyrics serious and sing your life away
Carry on
Don't write 'em down
Or they'll be gone

All we ever do is talk
We like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy we get bored
Why can't anybody see
What's good for you is good for me?
I can't take your sillyworld
I can't take your sillyworld no more

Peace is just two fingers now
Peace was just a phase
When someone put it on a shirt, you knew to count the days
So take those fingers
Tape 'em up and shove 'em up your ass and carry on
But don't try it now
Cuz peace is gone

All we ever do is talk
We like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy we get bored
Why can't anybody see
What's good for you is bad for me?
I can't take your sillyworld
I can't take your sillyworld no more

We fight our instincts
We go to extremes
We fight our instincts
We go to extremes
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
We fight our lives, we fight our lives
