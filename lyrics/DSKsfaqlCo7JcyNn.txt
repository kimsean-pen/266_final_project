We were kids smoking up
wildfire in our lungs
burnt the world just because we could
dirty knees, summer dress
stolen liquor or our lips
heels in our hands
walking home with you
now your hate saying my name
fading in and out of your waves
i'm a song you don't wanna play.
I hope you hear this on your radio
frequency feelings
i keep peaking i'm out of control
sending singals i just can't decode
got me back and forth
Lost in your stereo.
I always thought you and i
would be like the stars at night
permanent, never drift, apart.
you drew line in the sand
that divided all our plans
never meant to let it get this far.
I'm a song you don't wanna play.
I hope you hear this on your radio
frequency feelings
i keep peaking i'm out of control
sending singals i just can't decode
got me back and forth
Lost in your stereo.
frequency feeling i get
when you play your games in my head.
you got me watching my step
but i keep running back in the end
Yeah!
Fading in and out of your waves.
I'm a song you don't wanna play.
I hope you hear this on your radio
frecuency feelings
i keep peaking i'm out of control
sending singals i just can't decode
Lost in your stereo.
Lost in your stereo.
Lost in your stereo.
