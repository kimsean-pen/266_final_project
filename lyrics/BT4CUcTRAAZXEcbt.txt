No one dared to show for that shower,
When nobody turned out to be clean,
Was not even touched by the water,
Just another Nazu scheme,
The Bit Takeover.-Chorus

All throughout this so called nation,
Prepare yourself for the final quest,
Your world is doomes with our own interrogation,
Just another Nazi Test

Chorus

So understand me when I say,
There's no hope for this U.S.A.,
Your world is doomed with our own interrogation,
Just another Nazi test.
