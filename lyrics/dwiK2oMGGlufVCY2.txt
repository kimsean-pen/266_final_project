You looked like a princess the night we met
With your hair piled up high I will never forget
I'm drunk right now baby but I've got to be
I never could tell you what you mean to me

I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie

The song that the trees sing when the wind blows
You're a flower, you're a river you're a rainbow
Sometimes I'm crazy but I guess you know
I'm weak and I'm lazy and I hurt you so
And I don't listen to a word you say
And when you're in trouble I turn away

But I loved you,
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
