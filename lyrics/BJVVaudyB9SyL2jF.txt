From the inside of my corpse, 30 seconds is like a century
Imprisoned in necrotic flesh, cognizant beyond my death
Paralyzed and frozen in this carnal penitentiary
Lucidly projecting hellish spectres, ghoulish architecture
Enveloped in a darkness far beyond my mind can measure
Suffocating violent pressure. tt just goes on forever,
Are these electro-magnetic hallucinations?
Is this everybody's afterlife or something I've created?
Abandoned and dismissed in a flaccid impotence
With the cold illumination that I no longer exist
In a grave within a grave it was the first time I prayed
No one there to tell me that I shouldn't be afraid
Falling endlessly deeper, yet immobile and still
In this infinite aethyr washing over my filth
Neither angels or reapers or ghosts were fulfilled
Just a cavity to soak up my guilt in my depravity
The flowers up above me wilting down so they can laugh at me
To think we spend our lives convinced we understand agony
A familiar voice: "He's finally at peace"
Shrieking through the silence to remind me I'm deceased
I tried to answer but the dead can't speak
The biggest prison in the world's underground six feet
In a grave within a grave within a grave
It was the first time I prayed, in a grave within a grave
No one there to tell me that I shouldn't be afraid
