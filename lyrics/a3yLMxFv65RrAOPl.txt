I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Want to grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shopping alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window, any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a superstar"
But I tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive, ooh
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive

Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive, ooh
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive, ooh
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive, ooh
You take my time and take my money
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive, come on, come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money, honey
You'll survive
