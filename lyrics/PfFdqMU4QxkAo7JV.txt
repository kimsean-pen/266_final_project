Staircase lying face up
The stair cat sat on the mat looking down
Looking down, ooh

Slide down the bannister
Take the escalator
Slide down the bannister
Or try the elevator

I was standing on the landing
Now I'm standing in the hall
Looking up, up, up, up
When someone upsets me
Solved this mystery
Somebody upsets me
Arrange the cemetery

Muffled footsteps on the carpet
Spiral steps that's bending around me
Which floor?
Which ceiling?
You're off balance
Which floor?
Which ceiling?
It's all upside down

Staircase lying face up
The stair cat sat on the mat looking down
Looking down, ooh

Down...
