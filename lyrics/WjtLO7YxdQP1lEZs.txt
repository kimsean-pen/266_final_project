They'd call it a wasteland
auslander plates
you know its armor was human
drove stakes into the main camps
eyesockets sank into
the back of its head again
this frequency was jet lagged

with the owner's manual
with the owner's manual

Frequent flyers in denial
and all the while
emergency is evident
revenants were the statues
radar learning of huddled masses

sutured all the patients
of this nursing home
omitted from the pages
of this burial ground labor concentrated
in this sheepless chapelthey call it a wasteland
they call it a wasteland, baby
they call it a wasteland
they call it a wasteland, baby
they call it a, they call it a, they call it a, they call it a
