I feel so sorry
Am I all, all to blame?
For keeping you around
When the pain took you away

I feel so sorry
Was it all a mistake?
For keeping you around
When the pain took you away

Be, be gone
And be, be gone
Be, be gone
And be, be gone

Blood on this bed
No more worries in my head
God knows how this pain
Takes me away

Well you see I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you at all
So let me be with you
While this pain takes us away

Be gone
To this pain that I feel
Be gone
To this pain that I feel...

I feel so sorry
Am I all, all to blame?
For keeping you around
When the pain took you away

I feel so sorry
Was it all a mistake?
For keeping you around
When the pain took you away

Be gone, to this pain that I feel
Be gone, to this pain that I feel
(god knows how this pain takes me away)
Be gone, to this pain that I feel (takes me away)
Be gone, to this pain that I feel (Never meant to hurt you at all)
Be gone, to this pain that I feel
(god knows how this pain takes me away)
Be gone, to this pain that I feel (Never
meant to hurt you at all, takes us away)
