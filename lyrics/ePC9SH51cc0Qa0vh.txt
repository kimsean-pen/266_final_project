Sitting here alone
With nothing left to say
Staring at the walls
Won't make them go away

I need to show
The world that I'm alive
I have to break this silence
Empty out my lungs

I will be heard
Don't hold me back
Don't try and pacify
This might be hard to hear

Don't try and heal me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
Don't try and fix me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything

I need a darker place
To go and find myself
I don't wanna hate
Or live with my regrets

I have to show
I'm strong and I'll survive
I need to break this silence
Better mark my words

I will be heard
Don't hold me back
Don't try and pacify
This might be hard to hear

Don't try and heal me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
Don't try and fix me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything

I need to break this silence
Better mark my words, I will be heard

Sitting here alone
With nothing left to say
Staring at the walls
Won't make them go away
Don't try and heal me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
Don't try and fix me when I'm broken
I need a hurt for me to feel
Feel anything
