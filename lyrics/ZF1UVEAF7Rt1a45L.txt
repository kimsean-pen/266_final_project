Absinth colored eyes
Staring back within disguise
At the hallways of my room
The magician was in bloom

But to breathe for you, beat for
You know that you want me to
Go on and get you some
Batwings on those shoulders!

Call it a warning
And it will light you up right on the floor
Move it, go do it, prove it -
The magic that you're asking for!
Call it a warning
'Cause it won't let you stay reserved no more
Call it a yearning
'Cause it is magic that you're asking for

As he stumbled onto light
Tried to grasp all of his might
New found glory
Out of spite
Craving sparks of pure delight

But you need something
That is more true than the
Tricks that you do
Something that could get you flying

Reality is just a game
Oh come on now, alleviate!
Reality is just a game
The bats were just bait
The bats were...

Call it a warning
And it will light you up right on the floor
Move it, go do it, prove it -
The magic that you're asking for!
Call it a warning
'Cause it won't let you stay reserved no more
Call it a yearning
'Cause it is magic that you're asking for
