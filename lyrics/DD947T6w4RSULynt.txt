Come to me and cry
I know, I know, I know it's not easy
Your heart is aching
But so is mine
But so is mine
How can I tell you

Why
For so long, so long, so long
I've been thinking
Now I know
I can't live a lie
Can't live a lie

They say true love lasts forever

If we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance
Baby but now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising
My baby
A second chance
Baby but now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand
Where we went wrong

'Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising

Go
I must let you go
Don't stop, don't stop
'cause it's better now

When I still love you
Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye

They say true love lasts forever
If we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance
Baby but now we need time
Time to learn
Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising
My baby
A second chance
Baby but now we need time

Time to learn

Time to understand
Where we went wrong
'Cause I feel so strong

We are cruising for bruising

So long, so long, so long...
So bye for now, don't let it die
'cause we can try some other time
So bye for now, don't let it die
'cause we can try some other time
So bye for now, don't let it die (A second chance)
'cause we can try (Where we went wrong, 'cause i feel so strong)
Some other time (We were cruising for bruising)
]So bye for now, don't let it die
'cause we can try some other time
