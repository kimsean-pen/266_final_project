I believe in desperate acts, the kind that make me look stupid
Look like a fool
Just keep reinventing myself, it's move or die
I change my form

These days the people I love are spread so far apart
All out of reach
It's a thin sheet across the face
Cover me now

That's pretty old
That's pretty old
I never felt like this before, I say that every hour
I never felt like this before, I say that every hour

It's never going to be like it could have been, now it's just this room
Window looks back
You're a big part of it but I don't care
You take the load

And can you really see me now like I made me?
Made me anew
Just like anyone at all
Safer alone

That's pretty old
That's pretty old
I never felt like this before, I say that every hour
I never felt like this before, I say that every hour

So right, so wrong, another winter's coming on
You win, you lose, it's the same old news
These things go wrong so often
Pick up the phone and punch your code
Somewhere, sometime, let me make you mine

Lean your head on mine like you used to
Used to your lean
I don't mind if you're faking it
Make it seem real

I'm not asking the questions, I'm not demanding the answers now
Take what you give
Right or wrong, just take me, lead me on
I'm going, I'm going

So right, so wrong, another winter's coming on
You win, you lose, it's the same old news
These things go wrong so often
Pick up the phone and punch your code
Somewhere, sometime, let me make you mine
