Every night I dreamin' about freedom
I can't find a safe place where I can fly

It's a place where you see my divine creation.
Way to yourself -
Never come back
You loosing your dream world

My scream and pray to you - Please help me, save me! X2

I trying hard to stay with you
No one listening
My own story

My scream and pray to you - Please help me, save me! X2

That's all I'll die
This one way.
I Cut of memories in me

This world not for
This song without your
Voice and wickedness in me

You wanna say
That you love me
You wanna see
I believe it
You wanna say
That you love...

You must always see the lights
Surrounded million shades of lie

I will never see the lights
(I will never see the lights)
Surrounded million shades of my own fears...
(Surrounded million shades of my)
I don't want this
I don't need this

You wanna say
That you love...

You say - "No way!"
I am not listenin', you tellin' the same.
It'll never come back and never be close.
Your feelings will used, behind the doors. But,
Not me. But we
Are Looking througt this.The words that I see.
Don't give up and feel the voice
But just looking up now on the walls man.

My scream and pray to you - Please help me, save me! X2

That's all I'll die
This one way.
I Cut of memories in me

This world not for
This song without your
Voi—Åe and wickedness in me

That's all I'll die...(This one way I)
This world not for...(This song without you...)
