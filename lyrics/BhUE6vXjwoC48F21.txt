Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go

Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop, nobody knows, knows

Yeah, where we go, we don't need roads
And where we stop, nobody knows
To the stars, if you really want it
Got, got a jet-pack with your name on it

Above the clouds in the atmosphere
Could say the words and we outta here
Hold my hand if you're feeling scared
We flying up, up, outta here

Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go

Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop, nobody knows, knows

Baby, we can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo, get you fly kicks
Girl, you always on mind, got my head up in the sky
And I'm never looking down, feeling priceless

Yeah, where we're at, only few have known
We're on to the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, cardio
'Til then let's fly, Geronimo

Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer, let's go

Yo, now I ain't never been to space before
But I ain't never see a face like yours
You make me feel like I could touch the planets
You want the moon, girl, watch me grab it
See, I ain't never seen a star this close
You got me stuck by the way you glow
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly
(Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop, nobody knows, knows
