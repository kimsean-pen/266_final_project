It came to the end it seems you had heard.
Cause we walked the city streets,
You never said a word.

When we finally sat down
Your eyes were full of spite.
I was desperate, I was weak
I could not put up a fight.

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

You were strangely less than pain
Than you were cold.
Triumphant in your mind
Of the logic that you hold.

You said no one would ever know
The love that we had shared.
As I took my leave to go
It was clear that you didn't care.

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

And I hear of your coming and your going in the town.
I hear stories of your smile,
I hear stories of your frown.

And the darkness can descend,
We can relish all the pain.
But I know that's what you love,
Cause you know I love the same.

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
