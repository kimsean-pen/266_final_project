Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost

Now I'm gone in your photograph
I bet you wish you could get me back
Now I'm stuck in your memory
A mistaken identity

What's her name, what's she like like?
Does she know that you'll never treat her right?
What's her name, what's she like like?
Do you leave her in the middle of night?

You act like you just saw a ghost
I watched you getting way too close
Now I know why you're never there
Now I know so it's my turn to disappear

You act like you just saw a ghost
I caught you, caught you, now I know
Now I know why you're never there
Now it's my turn watch me disappear

Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost

The only gift that you ever gave
Is that you let me just get away
I hope I haunt you in every dream
And you feel a little misery

What's her name, what's she like like?
I should warn her that you'll never do her right?
All your games, all your lies, I need to tell her
Maybe I can change her mind

You act like you just saw a ghost
I watched you getting way too close
Now I know why you're never there
Now I know so it's my turn to disappear

You act like you just saw a ghost
I caught you, caught you, now I know
Now I know why you're never there
Now it's my turn, watch me disappear

Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost
Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost

Now you see me, now you don't
You must've thought I'd never go
I'm dead to you
I'm taking back my soul

You act like you just saw a ghost
I watched you getting way too close
Now I know why you're never there
Now I know so it's my turn to disappear

You act like you just saw a ghost
I caught you, caught you, now I know
Now I know why you're never there
Now it's my turn, watch me disappear

Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost
Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost

Just like a go, go, go, ghost
Watch me go, go, go, ghost
