Don't figure out, figure out my mind
Don't let me clinch my ring, I don't wanna swim
Gonna hold my sails down
Gonna hold them through the night
From up my rude, don't let it fade
Gonna hold my hinches down

Just because I can't stay
Help me to go to the desert station and [?]
Just because I can't stay
Finally I find my destination
There's a station out of lust

Gonna hold my sails down
Gonna wave them through the night
Gonna hold the sails down
Just because I can't stay
Help me to go to the desert station and [?]
Just because I can't stay
Finally I find my destination
There's a station out of lust

Swim to the dark blue lakes
Where we should not collide
Where guilts can hold us stade
Where we would say it's fine
Then we could ever see
That we could run to the
Wasteland unknown
My hands unsure

Just because I can't stay
Help me to go to the desert station and [?]
Just because I can't stay
Finally I find my destination
There's a station out of lust
