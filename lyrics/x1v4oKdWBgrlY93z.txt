Make the call and leave it all
Your back is up, against the wall
Make the call, 'cause you can leave it all

A fortuneteller's dream
A well maintained machine
That's me

A future set in stone
The super average drone
That's me

Feel my racing heart
Craving for a new start
We'll see

In every woman's eyes
I see a brand new life
Oh no, yeah, no, yeah

Make the call and leave it all
Your back is up, against the wall
Make the call, 'cause you can leave it all

It's life inside a bowl
Circling is my goal
That's me

Staring through the glass
Seeing seasons pass
That's me

Feel my racing heart
Feel me fall apart
Oh no

And yet another day
Of swimming through the same old same
yeah, no, yeah

Make the call and leave it all
Your back is up, against the wall
Make the call, 'cause you can leave it all

Make the call and leave it all
Your back is up, against the wall
Make the call, 'cause you can leave it all
