Waves crashing down sing the sound of his demise.
Salty waters rise. His eyes read the end.

Suddenly, he finds himself sat on the head of a giant squid-like beast.

"Hey you what are doing sailing these waters?
Haven't seen your kind around for years"

The young man responds:
"if you're gonna eat me, no need to be friendly.
I'm so weak it won't take me long to break."

Don't stray your path, what you're searching for will come.
There's no need to run. It's fine to wait.

Lift your head, all the birds are flying home.
Now you're not alone. Follow their lead, save your energy.
