I need you now
You know just what you do
Light shows the way
It's too much to contain
It's not an even trade

So just watch what you say
You fool?
When words don't mean enough
Keep your mouth shut

I've known it all along
You keep on fading out
You speak so loud it's too much too contain
It's not an even trade

So just watch what you say
You fool?
When words don't mean enough
Keep your mouth shut

All I wanted is dead
You can't keep on acting like you didn't care
All I wanted is dead
All I, all I...

So just watch what you say
You fool?
When words don't mean enough
Keep your mouth shut

Keep your mouth shut
Keep your mouth shut

All I wanted is dead
Keep your mouth shut
