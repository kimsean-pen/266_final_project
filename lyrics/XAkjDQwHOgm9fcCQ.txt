Now it's time
To wrap our fears in the night
And on the first day
I'll dress this city in flames
After the things you say
You hate me for being this way

Still you won't let go (of old ideals)
There is no headline (to read at night)
When the record skips (and you're not)
Holding the needle

We all sing the songs of separation
And we watch our lives
Bleed out through our hands
That's how it was on the first day
When we saw Paris in flames

Rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain
I think it's gonna rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain, rain down
I think it's gonna rain

Here in this collapsed lung of a borough
There is no sunlight
The sunlight is manufactured in a windowless room
Distant and incoherent
Businessmen hang themselves

We all sing the songs of separation
And we watch our lives
Bleed out through our hands
That's how it was on the first day
When we saw Paris in flames

The lower east side is a jukebox
Playing the dead man's crescendo
The needle is a vector
An intersection that we all must cross
A dimly lit hallway where shadows of moths decorate the walls
Discard this message
Discard this message
Discard this message

(Burn your city down
Down
Burn your heart
Now burn it with this song
You were on the first day)

Discard this message
Throw this bottle back into the ocean
Rip this page from the history books
Smash all the street signs
Erase all the maps
Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Because it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
And it never ends

We all sing songs (rain, rain down)
Of separation (I think it's gonna rain, rain down)
(I think it's gonna rain, rain down)
And watch our lives
(I think it's gonna rain)
Bleed through our hands
(I think it's gonna rain, rain down)
That's how it was
(I think it's gonna rain, rain down)
On the first day
(I think it's gonna rain, rain down)
(I think it's gonna rain)
We saw Paris in flames
