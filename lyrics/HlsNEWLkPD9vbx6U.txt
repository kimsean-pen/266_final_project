Long gone intuition to assume are gone when we try
Dream of living jungle heed my way
Back home when we die

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone
West of the fields

Dreams of Elysian to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming when we try
Listen with your eyes, oversimplify

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone
West of the fields

The animals how strange, try, try to stick us in
The animals how strange, try, try to stick in

Dreams of Elysian to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming when we try
Listen to your eyes when we die

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone
West of the fields

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone
West of the fields
