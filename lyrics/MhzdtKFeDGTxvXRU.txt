Nothing left to make you feel high
Nothing left to turn you on
Laughing in your childish disguise
You rule the night

Follow me back home
'Cause the night is young
And I'm tired of being alone
Follow me back home
Give me just one more
To send shivers to the bone

Nothing left, the magic is gone
Pallor face in morning light
Someone close the curtains
Oh how it hurts your eyes

Follow me back home
'Cause the night is young
And I'm tired of being alone
Follow me back home
Give me just one more
To bring shivers to the bone

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you make it on your own?
Nothing left
It's time to breathe
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left to make you feel high
Nothing left to turn you on
Dwelling in your dreams every day
Disturbs your nights

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you make it on your own?
Nothing left
It's time to breathe
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you follow me back home?

Nothing left
It's time to leave
Nothing left
It's time to leave
Can you follow me back home?
