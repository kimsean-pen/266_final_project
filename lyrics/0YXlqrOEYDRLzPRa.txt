So, there they stood at the top of the stairs
Miriam in the mood, Jonathan was scared

Gazing into the dark
Jonathan saw this glow

For a second, he turned his back
And she was there like a ghost
She pushed him hard and clean
To the bottom of the stairs
To the bottom of the stairs

"Now we're finally alone, Miriam
Abigail is here to stay!"

The birth of Abigail would soon be realized
The second coming of a devil in disguise
And the moon did not shine
It was darker than ever before

On this sacred night
The soul of Miriam was crying out in pain
Remembering the day
Arrival in the rain

The pain of labour was so strong that Miriam died
Her final seeing was a pair of yellow eyes
You can still hear her screaming
If you're walking the stairs in July

Riding from beyond
The seven Horsemen would arrive before the dawn
Servants of The Count
When Abigail was born the first time

Oh, no!
They found her in the sarcophagus
Baby Abigail was eating
Oh, I cannot tell you
Take her... And bring her
To the chapel in the forest
So go now... The ceremony!
And the coffin's waiting

The Black Horsemen

That's the end of another lullaby
Time has come for me to say goodnight
