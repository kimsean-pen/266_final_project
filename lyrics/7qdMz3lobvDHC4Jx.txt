my love my star and soul
Your words they keep me warm
At night,
What's crazy is
You always know exactly what to do
When you're with me
We can be free
You and me
Baby
The way you walk and strut and step enchants me

Oh girl, I love the way
I love the way you operate
Oh girl, I love the way
I love the way you operate

Oh girl, I love the way
I love the way you operate
The way you sing and sway
Oh girl, I love the way
I love the way you operate

You may get real shy
And then go ghost (damn)
I'd still be that guy that
You'd want to hold

(limbo & i)

What makes you say the things you say to me
My love ain't free
I've been hurt before
So speak gently to me

Oh boy, I love the way
I love the way you operate
Oh boy, I love the way
I love the way you operate
Oh boy, I love the way
I love the way you operate
The way you sing and sway
Oh boy, I love the way
I love the way you operate

You my love my star and soul
Your words they keep me warm
At night,
What's crazy is
You always know exactly what to do
When you're with me
We can be free
You and me
Baby
The way you walk and strut and step enchants me
