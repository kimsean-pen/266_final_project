Whenever she's weary, she climbs up hill
And crosses a dark trail and there she finds the fox
In the wooden glade
She lies by a rock and she's red
She smells of violets and picea
She flicks her ears as I whisper

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother
And I want to bear a fruit for you
And I've carried your fears and your hopes, father
It's so heavy on my back, oh you should know
Catch some sleep

I wanna find the eagle's nest
Oh take me with you, (Oh oh...)
And I've been waiting a lifetime for this
And I'm ready, (Oh oh...)
It doesn't leave me, I've been up all night
They call me crazy, (Ooh ooh...)
But I wanna see what the sky looks like
From your view, (Oh oh...)

But I saw your face carved in clay
And I saw (she saw) it outlined against
A purple sky, it goes loud and deep in me
Loud and deep,
My home is on that cliff

I wanna find the eagle's nest
Oh take me with you, (Oh oh...)
I've been waiting a lifetime for this
And I'm ready, (Oh oh...)
Born of a wanderer, I wandered all my life,
They never knew me, (No oh oh, no oh oh)
I wanna see what the sky looks like
From your view, (Oh oh...)

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother
And I want to bear a fruit for you
And I've carried your fears and your hopes, father
I'll conquer them for me and you

I've grown a handsome tall tree, mother
And I want to bear a fruit for you
And I've carried your fears and your hopes, father
I will conquer them for me and you.
