I'm in your way, and I know I drag you down.
I've leached myself, but I plan on moving.
Need a leg to stand, always crumbling.
When I come down, I know that you'll be there.
Knew all along, that you there to pick me up.
I'm down again, that's just part of my bad luck.
I'm barely afloat, you keep me from drowning.
But as time goes, the more and more I worry.
Is this not for me? Are you sick of this?
Every time I leave I come back right where I left.
Knew all along, that you there to pick me up.
I'm down again, that's just part of my bad luck.
I've been a drain on all the things that you worked for.
So many years, and we're so close to giving up.
You push me along to keep me going.
You hold me up, when I start to fall.
Knew all along, that you there to pick me up.
I'm down again, that's just part of my bad luck.
