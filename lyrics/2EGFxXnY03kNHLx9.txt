I've been dreaming for so long
To find a meaning
To understand
The secret of life
Why am I here to try again?

Will I always
Will you always
See the truth when it stares you in the face?
Will I ever
Will I never
Free myself by breaking these chains?

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
It's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back and then
At last I'll be on my way

I've been living for so long
Many seasons passed me by
I've seen kingdoms through ages
Rise and fall
I've seen it all

I've seen the horror
I've seen the wonders
Happening just in front of my eyes
Will I ever
Will I never
Free myself by making it right?

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
It's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back and then
At last I'll be on my way

Our dream ended long ago
All our stories
And all our glory
I held so dear
We won't be together
For ever and ever
No more tears
I'll always be here
Until the end

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
It's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone

I'd give my heart
I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back and then
At last I'll be on my way
