I know you vie for the good ol' days
and with less of us around, we were a cinch to sway
does it feel like it's the end of the world
well maybe it is, but when was it not,
cause it's true, me and you
we are all tomorrow's food today

there's no such thing as the good ol' days
the older we all get, the better we all were
there's no such as the end of the world
(but just in case!) you'd best batten down and button up
cause it's true, me and you
we are all tomorrow's food today
