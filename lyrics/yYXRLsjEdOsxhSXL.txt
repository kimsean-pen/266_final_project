Sitting in an armchair with my head between my hands
I wouldn't have to be like this
If you'd only understand
Too many misunderstandings causing such delay
And if it doesn't work like this
Well, I'll try another way

Oohh-oh, if this is the way you wanted it
Oohh-oh, I didn't understand
Oohh-oh, if this is the way you wanted it
Oohh-oh, I didn't understand

You know that all I wanted was to be there by your side
And if you didn't want it
Well, you shouldn't have denied
You knew that you were someone special
Right form the start
But if you treat me badly
We'd be better off apart

Oohh-oh, if this is the way you wanted it
Oohh-oh, I didn't understand
Oohh-oh, if this is the way you wanted it
Oohh-oh, I didn't understand
