my weak resistance, of yer flower
got me infected, coz I was to blind to see
everyone told me, but did I listen
no I was sick'n tired of the same reply from thee

you lead the game, i followed...
you were the bait, I swallowed...

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
it's a miracle I stand beside you
yer like a plague in awide'n open show
you pass it on like I need it the most

I smelled yer rose'n craessed yer petals
never bothered by the thorns that made me bleed
coz I longed to feel you so deep inside me
bt now I'm stukk with you forever without remedy

you lead the game, I followed...
you were the bait, I swallowed...

you knew my pain...
you lead the game...
and I followed yeah I followed
your lies, your play, yer all the same to me
