Off to the races and we let ride, what's changed us in our time
I'll take the wheel but it's the
hunger that drives and fades us and our kind
Sometimes this place is a prison and
sometimes a palace, I'll be the king in my crown
And sometimes the blood and the love is what I'm drinking of
I'm going to drag through the whole town

Everyday I'm fading away again, It's my kind
Every night I come back to life again, it's my time to shine

All fire, all fire, all fire on me, just standing in the sun
And off to the races, I'll let it slide, all fire in our time
Sometimes your love is the thing that I,
is the blood that I'm just drinking though towns
And sometimes the night is a prison and sometimes a palace
I'm still the king in my own crown

Everyday I'm fading away again, it's my kind
Every night you know I come alive again, it's my time to shine

And everywhere you, I'm going to find, and everything we...
Nothing's going to stop us
And everywhere you, I'm going to find, and everything we...
Nothing's going to stop us, nothing's going stop

Everyday I'm fading away again, it's my kind
Every night you know I come alive again, it's my time to shine
