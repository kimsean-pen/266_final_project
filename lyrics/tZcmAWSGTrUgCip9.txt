Set adrift on memory bliss of you
baby you send me baby you send set adrift on memory bliss of you
The camera pans the cocktail glass behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring

then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those deja-vu things
or a dream that's trying to tell me something
or will I ever stop thinking about it

I don't know I doubt it suberranean by design
I wonder what I would find if I met you let my eyes caress you
until I meet the thought of Missess Princess who
often wonder what makes her work

I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
assuming that there are some out there they're probably alone solitaire
I can remember when I caught up with a pasttime intimate friend
she said: Bet you're probably gonna say I look loveley

but you probably don't think nothing of me
she was right though I can't lie she' just one of those corners in my mind
and I just put her right back with the rest that's the way it goes I guess
Baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you

baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
The careless whisper from a careless man a neutron dance for a neutron fan
marionette strings are dangerous things I thought of all the trouble they bring
an eye for an eye a spy for a spy rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh

tell me that she's not dreaming she's got an ace in the hole
it doesn't have meaning reality used to be a friend of mine

'cause complete control I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate you gotta put me on
guess who's piece of the cake is Jack on
she broke her whispers in my heart were fine

what die she think she could do I feel for her I really do
the next day I had the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
but I had to put her right back with the rest that's the way it goes I guess
Baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you

baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me
baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
