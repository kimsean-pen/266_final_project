The problem with me is
I was always a big fish in a small, stale pond
Til I moved out to the city where I really got stung
I'm a young
Lazy bum who feels 106
Sometimes I wonder on the down low why I even exist

Should I go tell it to a shrink?
I'm startin' to think
That maybe I'm the only sane one in a world on the brink
Can't relax, got my facts
A [?] nihilist
It bothers me that I'm not bothered oh I really need

A new attitude
I need to get out my room
Just want to play my guitar
But it hasn't gotten me far
I know it seems kinda sad
Coz things have gotten so bad
Does someone know who I am?
Coz I don't know who I am

Yeah maybe I'm the hypocrite
Walking contradiction bursting out like a cyst
I'm reading Tolstoy at the moment craving a set of bliss
I quit my job and drive my friends to clubs to down one more drink
I try to fit in but the people here are making me sick
Hey surely I can't be alone
Please someone hold the phone
I see atrocities on T.V but I'm still too scared to go
I put my neck on the line oh
Where's my spine?
I'm wastin' my time and I'd love it if you gave me a sign

Get outta my room
I've got a bad attitude
Just wanna play my guitar but it hasn't gotten me far
I need to taste a success
Maybe I'd feel less depressed
Sometimes I wanna grow up, sometimes I wanna give in

Could everyone get off my back
Cut me some slack
I took my shirt off in the arm my shoulders were no longer golden
Had a panic attack
I'm still my worst enemy
It's not as bad as it seems
If you wanna come and stick a building [?]
Drag me

Outta my room
I need a good attitude
Don't wanna play my guitar
Coz it hasn't gotten me far
They say it pays in the end
But I'm still stuck in a spin
Sometimes I wanna grow up, sometimes I wanna give in

Who would have guessed, I was a tiny kid
Who would have thought, I'd make it past [?]
Who would have guessed, I was a tiny kid
Who would have thought, I'd make it past [?]
Who would have guessed, I was a tiny kid
Who would have thought, I'd make it past [?]
