I'm a chemical reaction and my elements are aligned
Baby if I hadn't known you, then I couldn't even start the fire
You're still scaling the walls, looking for a way in
Wrap me up inside you, warbling soft words, wandering eye...

I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it

A bag of flesh is a magnet, a scent, a sound corrupt
You took all my dignity, replaced it with a hand
Handle me with ardor and I'll shudder
But my chills are warm
Delusion is persuasion
Tenderizing me inside

I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it

The fever grows
Incandescent, does it show?
The fever grows
Incandescent, does it show?
