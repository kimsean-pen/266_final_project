Heaven's waiting for you
Just close your eyes and say goodbye
Hearing your pulse go on and on and on

I live my life in misery
I'd sacrifice this world to hold you
No breath left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling

Say Goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say Goodnight

Flowers laid out for you
So many colors leave me blind
Seeing your face reflect from our babies' eyes

I live my life in misery
I'd sacrifice this world to hold you
No breath left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling

Say Goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say Goodnight

So here I am,
You're inside of me!
So here I am,
Our world is over!

So here I am,
You're inside of me!
So here I am,
Our world is over!

Here I am with you!
I'm there till the end!
Memories are calling!
So farewell my friend!
(Farewell my friend!)

Here I am with you!
I'm there till the end!
Memories are calling!
So farewell my friend!
(Farewell my friend!)

My Friend!
My Friend!
My Friend!
