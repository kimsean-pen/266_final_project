You turn him away, you tell him you're mine
You make him believe you're but one of a kind
You give him a cold look, you tell him a lie
You turn him away girl, you know you're mine

And you're back
You're back for more
You turn away
You're back for more

You gave him an inch, he took you a mile
He made you believe, you're society's child
Then get in his new car, get in his style
I told you his way, he won't take you far

And you're back
You're back for more
You turn away
You're back for more

And you're back
You're back for more
You turn away
You're back for more

And you're back
You're back for more
You turn away
You're back for more

And you're back
You're back for more
You turn away
You're back for more
