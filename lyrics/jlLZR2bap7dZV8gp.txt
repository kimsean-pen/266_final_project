There is a flame
When we let it show
I hope you see it
Don't let it go
We are the same
That dark is all we know
Taking our picture
Our faces glow

How could I leave your side
I just had a revelation
I'll come by, let the flame burn through
And if it's coming down to me
When I reach your destination
I'll ignite into flames for you
All will fall in place

The flashing lights
The first night that we roamed
So many faces
We were alone
You ripped me up
Inside our vacant club
We burnt the place down
They'll never know

How could I leave your side
I just had a revelation
I'll come by, let the flame burn through
And if it's coming down to me
When I reach your destination
I'll ignite into flames for you
All will fall in place

And it's all in the back of your head
In mine as well
It's temporary
We are the same, we are the same
And it's all in the back of your head
In mine as well
I'll treat you fairly
Just call my name, just call my name

How could I leave your side
I just had a revelation
I'll come by, let the flame burn through
And if it's coming down to me
When I reach your destination
I'll ignite into flames for you
When you show me the way
All will fall in place
