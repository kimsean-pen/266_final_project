With Venusia I awake to the scenes of cotton lake
It's peculiar where we stay taking flowers everyday
Amber has already taken half of the control
As we wander swimming holes

You see a thousand images
The gap between the stars as we wonder

Venusia, peculiar
Nothing is out of synch
Venusia, peculiar
You make so much sense to me

No confusion dear one
No distractions ever come
It's peculiar where we are
Waking moments in so far

I see your conversation giving energy to me
As we wander how did we?
Ever get to notice the whole part
Of who we are as we wonder

Take me by the hand
Venusia
