I'd mount a cloud and escape
Just to see the way your moon is shaped
May I ask you dearly
Has true friendliness survived over there

Invite me to your country
What does it look like
How do the fir trees smell
Invite me to your country
Is the trees
Are the oaks doing well
Invite me today
Would it be awkward if I said
I'd like to stay

I'd bulid a boat and sail
Just to feel your rain on my hair
Leave my illusions to me
Say some sensitives survived over there

Invite me to your country
Just because I know that you care
Times are fast and unsafe
And my melodies ever so grey
Invite me to your country
Just to talk to you once again
