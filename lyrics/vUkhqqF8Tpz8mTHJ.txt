I'll stop talking to myself.
Doesn't matter if that helps.
It's a difference when I'm there in front of you.
Bellies must dance just in case,
I would fall into my place.
It's a difference when I'm there in front of you.

So you push me with your hands to wake me up.
So you push me with your hands to wake me up.
So you push me with your hands to wait for you.

Doo, doo, doo, doo.

I'll stop talking to myself.
Doesn't matter if that helps.
It's a difference when I'm there in front of you.
Bellies must dance just in case,
I would fall into my place.

So you push me with your hands to wait for you.
