Yeah
Hey, baby
Why you treatin' me bad?
Hey, darlin'
You're making me mad
I'm going crazy
Trying to figure out why you are leavin'
Give me a reason
Say that you need me
I know you're deceiving
The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone

Oh, oh

Trying to figure out why you are leavin'
Give me a reason
Say that you need me

The lies that you're feeding will leave you alone

Please don't ask me to go
I'm already gone
I'm already gone

Please just leave me alone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
