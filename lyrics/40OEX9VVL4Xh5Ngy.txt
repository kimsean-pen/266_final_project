Now diamonds are falling,
(?.) In the sky.
Obsessions being children
they are let out in the light
they are screaming,
they are polluting,
they are demanding,
they are alive.
they are calling the red leopard of time.
I love you. I need you.
Oh show me how to shine.
I love you. Your flower.
Now give me what is mine.
