You're not alive until you start kicking
When the room is spinning and the words aren't sticking
And the radio's all about a runaway model
With a face like sin and a heart like a James Joyce novel
Saying sister, sister how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist
And take the skin off of my blister

If you're a rock star, porn star,
superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car
Get out of here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

The driver's got names for fish into barrels
He spits out "Brits out!", always smokes Carroll's

Now we're refreshing the world in mind, body and spirit
Mind, body and spirit
You'd better hear it and fear it
Oh that's the spirit

Saying sister, sister how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist
And take the skin off of my blister

If you're a rock star, porn star
Superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car, get out of here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

The driver's got names to fill two double barrels
He spits out "Brits out!", always smokes Carroll's

Now we're refreshing the world in mind, body and spirit
Mind, body and spirit
You'd better hear it and fear it
Oh that's the spirit

Saying sister, sister how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist
And take the skin off of my blister

If you're a rock star, porn star
Superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car, get out of here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
