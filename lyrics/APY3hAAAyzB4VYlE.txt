Searching for words
Embracing their meaning
Starving for hurt
Erasing your feelings
Replacing comfort
With a false sense of sacrifice
Waiting your turn
For a guarantee to roll the dice

Why can't you fake me a reason why
You choose to blame me for all the times you hide
You can't mistake me for the enemy tonight

How does it feel
What does it mean to you
Your heart is real
It isn't bulletproof
You can't conceal all of the things you do
On your way down

Harboring thoughts
Of doubt and confusion
Fearing what's lost
A selfless conclusion
You're awaiting the fall
Creating your own appetite
You're saving it all
You'll do anything to win the fight

Why can't you fake me a reason why
You choose to blame me for all the times you hide
You can't mistake me for the enemy tonight

How does it feel
What does it mean to you
Your heart is real
It isn't bulletproof
You can't conceal all of the things you do
On your way down

Why can't you fake me a reason why
You choose to blame me for all the times you hide
You can't mistake me for the enemy tonight

How does it feel
What does it mean to you
Your heart is real
It isn't bulletproof
You can't conceal all of the things you do
On your way down
