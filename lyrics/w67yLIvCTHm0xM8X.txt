Go

I've heard enough, no more, no more
You've had your time in the sun
Keep your head down kid, your fifteen seconds are done
I know it hurts, I wanted it this way
All these years, I'm still the voice you can't destroy
I know how this one ends
Lying in the gutter spitting teeth at the sidewalk
I know how this one ends
So bite your tongue if you can't tame it

Let's get this straight while you're listening
In my world, you count for nothing

Bow, you'll be the one to drown
With the rats and the snakes
Bow, you'll be the one to drown
Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder, bottom feeder

I've heard enough, I've heard enough to know
Who talks the talk, who walks the walk and who's for fucking show
I know it hurts, I know it cuts
That I'm still standing, I'm everything you're fucking not
I know how this one ends
Running from the world as your lies begin to cave
Yeah, I know how this one ends
Your hollow words make shallow graves

Let's get this straight while you're listening
In my world, you count for nothing
Let's get this straight while you're listening
In my world, you count for nothing

Bow, you'll be the one to drown
With the rats and the snakes
Bow, you'll be the one to drown
Bottom feeder
Bow, you'll be the one to drown
With the rats and the snakes
Bow, you'll be the one to drown
Bottom feeder

See I feel no guilt like I feel no pain
Like I feel the fire running through my veins
You can't draw blood when my heart beats cold
And I'll take your word like I take your name
An ego lost in the valley of self-disdain
Pride cometh before the fall and you'll break as I watch it all collapse

No mercy, no peace
You can't escape this beast
No mercy, no peace
You can't escape this beast
No mercy, no peace
You can't escape this beast
No mercy, no peace
You can't escape now snap your neck to this
You snap your neck to this, oh

No mercy, no peace
You fucking bottom feeder
No mercy, no peace
You fucking bottom feeder, fuck
