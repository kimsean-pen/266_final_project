I want to be seen
Yet I want to be invisible
I want everything
Yet I want nothing at all

All of these thoughts I have
Negate each other
I keep trying to understand
How to make it better
But I can't make it better

I am confident
Yet I always seem to doubt myself
I am intelligent
Yet I know nothing at all

All of these thoughts I have
Negate each other
I keep trying to understand
How to make it better
But I can't make it better

I want to be seen
Yet I want to be invisible
I want everything
Yet I want nothing at all

All of these thoughts I have
Negate each other
I keep trying to understand
How to make it better
But I can't make it better
All of these thoughts I have
Negate each other
I keep trying to understand
How to make it better
But I can't make it better
