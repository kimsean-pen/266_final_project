Glass and smoke
Shifting shadows
Hands like drums
Searching for battles

I'm face down in the dark
With eyes in broken glass
'Cause it's always you
It's always you

I inhale this smoke as you burn through all my veins
With my lungs still warm as you stand right next to me
'Cause it's always you

My mind falls into your hands
My heart falls into your soul
My mind falls into your hands
My heart falls into your soul

'Cause it's always you
It's always you

I inhale this smoke as you burn through all my veins
With my lungs still warm as you stand right next to me
'Cause it's always you
