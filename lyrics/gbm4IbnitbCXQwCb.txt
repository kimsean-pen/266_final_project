Hi
Scars will heal soon
You shrug it off
Except that you don't

Better, it surely
It don't fall out
Said I live low
I lisp, I die

Sugar shooting, bled with deadbeats
Only crawl, so your eyes
Sad eyes, quite Christian blood

Drop it, it's dead
We dropped it
And took the body home
Sad eyes

Scars, I'm chopping dagger
See you'll never walk, only stagger
Sad eyes, quite Christian blood
