Yeah, yeah
Based1 got them bands, ho
They said I got next, nigga
But I got now, ayy

They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares
Something that we run around
No, they cannot compare us
when we come through, shut it down
They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares,
Something that we run around
No, they cannot compare us
when we come through, shut it down

My whip is like a spaceship, it's like ten feet off the ground
The plug don't speak no English, all he do is give me pounds
I'ma grab the chopper to let off a couple rounds
Nigga think he ready 'til he see what we about
You can miss me with that weak shit
Ain't no talkin', ho, let's get right to it
Nigga thought I was a bitch and wasn't living all of my music
Get the bag and just ran through it
I don't care, I truly do this
Try to feel me like I'm Truman
Pay attention, I ain't stupid
We a long way from home, we still goin' up
Shorty came in with her man
And she still tryna fuck
Like I don't care, I cop a foreign like a Ford truck
Still never sober, smokin' clover, come and try my luck
Never know why they hating
Tryna get the best of me
In the 'yo cookin' with a master recipe
Leave me with the rock
And I'm scoring from the three
Overseas, smoking weed, I can't feel a thing

They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares
Something that we run around
No, they cannot compare us
when we come through, shut it down
They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares,
Something that we run around
No, they cannot compare us
when we come through, shut it down
