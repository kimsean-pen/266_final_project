Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna roll inside your soul
To know the things that you need and feel
Every time that you're by my side
I can't get serious, because you got me

Cold chill down my spine
No, no more tears, show me a smile
Cold chill down my spine
No, no more tears, give me a smile

Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay together?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Why can't we just stay forever?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Deep inside I know you need it
Just let it out and get it on, you gotta feel it
Every time that you're by my side
Just think it over, I'll make you glad

Cold chill down my spine
No, no more tears, show me a smile
Cold chill down my spine
No, no more tears, give me a smile

Baby, baby
