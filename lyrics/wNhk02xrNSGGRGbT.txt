Prepare your shoes
not to come back soon,
prepare your heart
not to stop too soon.
You cannot walk with us.
One step inside doesn't mean you understand,
one step inside doesn't mean I'm yours.
In your world
my feet are out of step,
and my arms won't move,
my hands won't grab.
I will never read your stupid map,
so don't call me incomplete,
you're the freak.
