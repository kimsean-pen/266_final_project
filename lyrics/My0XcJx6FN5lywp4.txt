Hello, mirror
So glad to see you my friend, it's been a while

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought had torn me
Revealing hurt for shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the begin of the end

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are half way through
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it

We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone
We will see how our experience can benefit others
That feeling of uselessness and self pity will disappear

We will lose interest in selfish things
And gain interest in our fellows
Self seeking will slip away
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change

Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us
We will intuitively know how to handle situations
Which used to baffle us, we will suddenly realize that
God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves

Misinterpreted promises, we think
Helping for any one's touch
For that to portray, I'm sure
You're only one

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free
The truth is the truth
All you can do is live with it
