You will say you're dreaming up a way
You're dreaming up a way to explode
There's a time you'll seek out a disguise
When you think people hate you the most
And it gets worse before it gets better
That's one thing that I have come to know
Just so you know

Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

All the things you don't wanna let go
You wanna look back on in the cold
All the times that feel like everything
When nothing really happens at all
They're still here
All in that important room
You've got your pictures up on the wall
Up on the wall

Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

Make a promise to your ex (Nothing happens)
He was terrified of sex (Nothing happens)
Most times, humiliating (Nothing happens)
Something you'll wanna forget (Nothing happens)
Your parents will eventually separate (Nothing happens)
Don't stop the trash bags in the pool (Nothing happens)
Oh, guess what? You have a sister now (Nothing happens)
And as you go on and shit gets hard, don't worry about me

Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there (You're ready and you know it)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there (Something you'll always remember)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait (Your parents will end up where they belong)
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there (Never hurt you to talk to them, though)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait (And guess what? She's obsessed with you)
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there (When shit gets hard, don't worry about me)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
