Pocket watches
Felling fascist
I, know you don't love it so

Falling over
After tire
I, I, I know that it seams divine

This garden is growing over
This heart has some room in your home

Watch out
Fat chance that you'll ever get another
Chance to be a color.la
Out here and what a fellow

Falling over
Aeroplanes and
Wanting to be a derelict

What to cover?
Love each other
I, know, lie lie lie

This garden is growing over
And nothing can ever be said
For you and thats just
Here's your answer
'Why bother'
I've never been nothing other
Than the boy with the words that lose control
