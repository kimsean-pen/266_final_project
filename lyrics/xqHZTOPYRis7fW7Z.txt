The sun shone pink on white walls
And the trees stood so tall
Defiant, proud, loud against the sky

There's no sign, there's no plan
There ain't even a helping hand
Just the bitter tang of sweet virtue

Don't waste your time, don't hesitate
Oh life is but a moment, you can't wait
Go and have your fun, go and lose your mind
Can you get back to the ones you left behind?

The sun shone pink on white walls
And the trees stood so tall
Defiant, proud, loud against the sky

Yeah when it comes, it comes quick
When you're least expecting it
But the top's the bottom, the bottom is all you got

Don't waste your time, don't hesitate
Oh life is but a moment, you can't wait
Go and have your fun, yeah go and lose your mind
Can you get back to the ones you left behind?

And sun shone pink on my wall
And the trees stood so tall
Defiant, proud and loud against the sky

Yeah when it comes, it comes quick
When you're least expecting it
But the top's the bottom, the bottom is all you got
The sun shines pink on my wall
And the trees stand so tall
I'm empty now, funny how
Defiant, proud, loud against the sky.
