Maybe if I spell it out
Big boy will take me on proper
You nailed my heart to your wall
You never dusted off after, oho

You're making me feel awkward
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me

Maybe if I'm a broken wing
Big boy in my nest
You nailed my heart to your wall
And disposed of the rest of me
With your push and shove, oho

Like was love ain't love
But it's love to me, oh!

My boy is not a man yet
My boy is not a man yet
But boy do I love it when you kiss my neck
Oh boy last night was perfect
You're changing your mind
Like what's mine ain't mine
Be mine to be

Maybe if we try again
Big boy we could have it my way
You nailed my heart to your wall
But it was damaged anyways, oho

You're making me feel, oho
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, oh
You're making me feel, oho
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, oho
