I saw you in my dream
With your desire
Oh Maia
You don't tell us what you rely on
You knew me in a dream
I was a liar
Dripping with fire

Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire,
Who you rely on
You
Liar
Fire

My feet are planted low
Down in here in the shadow of you
You've become a danger to me
But from down here, I see
That you are a liar
Dripping with fire

Fire, fire
Fire,
If you rely on
Fire, fire
Liar
If you rely on
Fire

Dripping with fire
(fire)
Dripping with fire

(ooh, fire)
(fire)
(fire)
