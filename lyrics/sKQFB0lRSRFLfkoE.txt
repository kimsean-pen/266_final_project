Yeah,
I dont believe in destiny.
I just do whats best for me.
Don't listen to my enemies.
They're just full of jealousy.
Girl.
This legacy.
You 'gon see what's left of me.
You 'gon see success in me.
You ain't seen the rest of me.

I just wanna be the best at what I know.
Better than the rest just watch me grow.
Put me to the test and watch me go.
This is my quest Imma make it known.
They call me obsessive oh I know,
Call me selective with my notes.
Call me agressive with my flow.

Call me offensive even though.

So we ain't gonna lie, life's tough.
Tryna get by, life's rough.
Try to do it right.
Its not enough.
Even though you try you still mess up.
But I'm still gonna fight for what I love.
Still gonna die for what I love.

Still gonna try I won't give up.
Still gonna fight until I've won.

They say I'm way too obsessed.
And I've got nothing left.
And I'm not quite there yet.
But those words they'll regret.
Cause I've got something left.
And I'm not giving in.

I will not let them win.
I won't stop till the end.
No.

I've been through some injuries.
Mentally and physically.
Studied them religiously.
So I don't repeat history.
And people won't admit to me.
They don't want a victory.
Bad enough to get a seat.
They'd rather just go leave it be.
And oh.
This journey.
I've been on since thirteen.
Working hard and learning.
Never stopping searching.
Yeah.

Its burning.
All this passion hurts me
I took action working.
Writing down these words he:

No, I'm not okay.
I just wanna be something.
I don't wanna be nothing.

Living all alone.

No I'm not alright.
I'm just barely getting by.
But I'll tell you I'm just fine
So you leave me alone.

They say I'm way too obsessed.
And I've got nothing left.
And I'm not quite there yet.
But those words they'll regret.
Cause I've got something left.
And I'm not giving in.
I will not let them win.
I won't stop till the end.
No.
