You made me tough, you made me numb
You are the maker of what I've become
And now I am strong where I was weak
And I am unafraid of being me
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocain
A heart of Novocain

Once upon a time you had control
And on and over my poor soul
And the trust in you but now I see
You never knew the real me
And now I'm angry and you wonder why
You see a fire burning in my eyes
Once you had me but you lost me now
And there's no going back
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocain
A heart of Novocain

My fear has died
My tears have dried
I don't feel afraid and I won't run away
I believe in me
And now I see
Right through your lies
Hiding being your eyes
Because of you I'll make it through
And nothing can hurt me like you did anymore

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Now there's nothing you can say to wash it all away
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocain
A heart of Novocain
A heart of Novocain
A heart of Novocain
