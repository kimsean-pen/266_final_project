Yonder and forlorn
Lies the arctic thunder
Beneath the astral fires
Again the moon expires

Forgotten tomb sayer speaks
Here, above and under

(The) night shifts, sudden drifts
The destroyer
Paralyzed
Rest my eyes

Wallowing shores asunder
Arctic thunder

Piece these things together
Bear mark of atomic strength
Find those piercing ripples
Defy wretched lands and aws

Bring the thrive of glorious mornings
Bring sacrifice to life
Tear up the clouds at sunset
Merge the slow divide

For the arctic thunder

Beneath the astral fires
Again the moon expires
Forgotten tomb sayer speaks
Here, above and under
