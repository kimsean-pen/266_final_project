Wanna play me like a fiddle
I'm not so brittle
Come diddle my skittle 'cause there's only one peach
With the hole in the middle
There's only one peach with the hole in the middle

There's only one peach with the hole in the middle
You think I'm little
Wanna play me like a fiddle
I'm not so brittle
Come diddle my skittle 'cause there's only one peach
With the hole in the middle
There's only one peach with the hole in the middle

You think I'm little
Wanna play me like a fiddle
I'm not so brittle
Come diddle my skittle 'cause there's only one peach
With the hole in the middle
There's only one peach with the hole in the middle
Hole in the middle

You think I'm little
Wanna play me like a fiddle
