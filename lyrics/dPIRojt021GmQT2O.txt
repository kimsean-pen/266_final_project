I could have just held my tongue
I should have just filled my lungs
Breathe in, breathe out and repeat
But you know me well, or at least in as far as I can tell
You should have known better than telling me I should have
Held it together for us, when I'm barely together myself
I'm barely together myself

I'm overthinking, everything I say and I do
Just reminds me I don't need you
'Cause there's nothing left for me to hang on to

Well, if you just kept your word
And listened instead of just heard
Instead of just waiting for your turn to speak
Then you'd know I was weak, but you don't
No wonder reality hurts
No wonder reality hurts

I'm overthinking, everything I say and I do
Just reminds me I don't need you
'Cause there's nothing left for me to hang on to
I'm overthinking and I'm done with feeling empty
And pretending like you get me, I'm overthinking
I think I'm through

Beating myself black and blue
Beating myself black and blue
Beating myself black and blue
(Stop beating myself black and-)

I'm overthinking, everything I say and I do
Just reminds me I don't need you
'Cause there's nothing left for me to hang on to
I'm overthinking and I'm done with feeling empty
And pretending like you get me, I'm overthinking
If I'm through, stop I'm beating myself black and blue
(Beating myself black and blue, beating myself black and blue)
Beating myself black and blue
(Beating myself black and blue)
But it won't make no difference to you
