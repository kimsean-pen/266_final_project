I had a dream that someone came to find me again
Wondering (?) I am dreaming, how do I let go?
The only light on will pass by
Oh we're still (?)

Calling on shadows
And calling on shadows
(?)
(?)
We move in circles of light

Carry your shape in the light of the cold
Let us return to the edge of the storm
Give us a way to bring all our bodies home
Let us return to the edge of the light
In circles
