A million lies that now define
Us all together
A new ideal, all so real
Like I remember

And sometimes I
Get lost in time
Sometimes I fear
I'm lost in here

All these little strings
Holding us together
All these precious things
Can make them last
All these little strings
Keep holding us together
All these precious things
Make them last forever

So very slow
You'd never know
The moment fading
We watch the end
Over again
And keep repeating

I feel like I'm
I feel like I'm
I feel like I'm
Just disappearing

All these little strings
Holding us together
All these precious things
Can make them last
All these little strings
Keep holding us together
All these precious things
Make them last forever
