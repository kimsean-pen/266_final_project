I found a place full of charms
A magic world in my baby's arms
Her soft embrace like satin and lace
A wondrous place

What a spot in a storm
To cuddle up and stay nice and warm
Away from harm in my baby's arms
A wondrous place

Man, I'm nowhere
When I'm anywhere else
But I don't care
Everything's right when she holds me tight

Her tender hands on my face
I'm in heaven in her embrace
I wanna stay and never go away
A wondrous place

Man, I'm nowhere
When I'm anywhere else
But I don't care
Everything's right when she holds me tight

Her tender hands on my face
I'm in heaven in her embrace
I wanna stay and never go away
A wondrous place

A wondrous place
A wondrous place
