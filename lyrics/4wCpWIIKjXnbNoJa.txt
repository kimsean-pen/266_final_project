Death march, death march
Death march, death march

This is a new world order and it's changing the game
So step right up to go down in flames
I want your sons, want your daughters
All creatures of the night
So wave your flag if you're ready to fight

Bringing insects to their knees
Catching them in webs I've weaved
You were in my dream last night
Begging me to take a bite

I insult the hypocrisy and light your fire with your pain
I give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
I control my own destiny and I won't suffer in vain
My enemy will not be the end of me, no no

Death march (No, that's not how I go)
Death march (Let everyone know)

This is the new disorder, it's the unsolved case
That is bringing the rage straight to your face
So set in the crowns, add fuel to the fire
They cut your throat just to preach to the choir

All is fair in love and war
Out your mouth into the core
So won't somebody stop this shit
Fuck 'em all, I'm over it

I insult the hypocrisy and light your fire with your pain
I give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
I control my own destiny and I won't suffer in vain
My enemy will not be the end of me

It's getting hot up in my head
My demons are my best friends
Ashes, ashes, we all fall (Down)

There's just hate in the hole where my heart used to be
There's just hate in the hole where my heart used to be
I want you and you, and you, and you

I insult the hypocrisy and light your fire with your pain
I give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
I control my own destiny and I won't suffer in vain
My enemy will not be the end of me, no no

Death march, death (That's not how I go) march
Death march, death (Let everyone know) march
