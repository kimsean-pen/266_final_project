Spearmint Rhino was taking our money
when Gran was robbed of her own life honey
The driver-less hornet last post on the trumpet
His blind, crippled crumpet don't like it but lump it
The engine won't start without him
The engine won't start without

So I went down to Sherry's mod suits and Paul Weller
All pork pies and drainpipes to wear in all weather
All of us shed a tear thinking of yesteryear
Raise whiskey, raise beer, the old boy is not here
The engine won't start without him
The engine won't start without
The engine won't start without him
The engine won't start without

So he's left us done to the nines with satin for lining
And a coating of pine and the engine is broke I can't
fix and I've lost all the coals and we're running quite low
And the engine is broke I can't fix and I've
