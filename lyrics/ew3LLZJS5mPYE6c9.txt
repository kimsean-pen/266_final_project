Try to fall asleep tonight
Lay awake and dream of a life
Where we thought that we could make it
We wasted all our time
And I wouldn't change a single thing, I know
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish that it could be the way that it was
But it's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
Two wrongs don't make it right
Two hearts are on the line
Maybe we could have made it
Have waited
Done this right
In the end, I'm a friend
But that's all I am to you, oh
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish that it could be the way that it was
But it's over
There's no one to blame
No, it'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same
(No, no, no, no)
We get closer and closer again
But we're falling apart
I'm losing, you're losing a friend
It's always over before we start
You're asking for love
And I wish I believed you
But it's easy to see that it's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same
No, it'll never be the same
It's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
It's over
There's no one to blame
It'll never be the same
