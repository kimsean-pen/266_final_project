My father said, don't be so scared
Driving home all alone
You're in a hospital bed
I close my eyes
Ignore the sun
Try to wake up from the dream
It's not working this time

I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life
I said your name 27 times
Would that bring you back to life

Do you remember your lucky number
Your superstition has me buried six feet under
