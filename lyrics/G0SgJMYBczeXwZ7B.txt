Charlie's enormous mouth, well, it's awright
The girl's got a very large mouth, but it's awright
Her teeth look okay
She must be brushin' 'em quite a bit
'Course her mouth is extra large
'N we can only assume as to how
She's been usin' it

Charlie's enormous mouth, well, it's awright
The girl got a very large mouth, but it's awright
She got lips all around the hole
Where she puts her food in
They call it THE MOUTH
They call it THE MOUTH
They call it THE MOUTH
Which is as good a place as any for a tongue
To include in, that's why
They call it THE MOUTH
They call it THE MOUTH
They call it THE MOUTH

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

(Kinda young
Kinda wow...)

Charlie's enormous nose, well, it's all white
The girl's got a very large nose but it's all white
It once was okay
But she's been blowin' it quite a bit
'Course her friends are extra large
'N we can only assume as to how
She's been choosin' it

Charlie's enormous nose, well, it's all white
The girl's got a very large nose, but it's all white
She got stuff all around the hole
Where she puts her spoon in
They call it THE NOSE
They call it THE NOSE
They call it THE NOSE
And when it finally rots away I guess you'd
Prob'ly drive a truck in... they used to
Call it THE NOSE
They called it THE NOSE
They called it THE NOSE

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

(Kinda young
Kinda dead...)

Charlie's disgusting brain, well, it's all black
The girl's got a very dead brain, it won't come back
She used to convey
But then she took an extra hit
'Course her friends are extra dumb
'N they were terribly excited while they
Watched her doin' it

Charlie's disgusting brain, well it's all black
The girl got a very dead brain, it won't come back
She's got dirt all around the hole
Where they dumped her box in
They call it THE GRAVE
They call it THE GRAVE
They call it THE GRAVE
Which is as good a place as any for a
Chump to repose in... that's why they
Call it THE GRAVE
They call it THE GRAVE
They call it THE GRAVE...
