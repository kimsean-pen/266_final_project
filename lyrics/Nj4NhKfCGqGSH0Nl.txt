I'm born upon the cusp of revelation.
A consciousness awakened by the dawn.
A primitive undying fascination.
Moved the hand that carved into the stone.

Faces change, thought returns to dust.
Ashen countenance, holy rust.
I am compendium.

Trapped inside the cultish hall of mirrors.
Taught to worship self-destructing flaws.
Running now, the ravens getting nearer.
Fighting off the gnashing of the claws.

This is the weight of heartbreak.
This is the weight of life.
A thunder at the temple.
Silencing endless strife.

Faces change, thought returns to dust.
Ashen countenance, holy rust.
I am compendium.
