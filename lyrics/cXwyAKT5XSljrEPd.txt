It's patience trying,
when you tell me how to live
well you don't know anything
your expectations are wearing thin
you won't even take a look,
to see another way
you aren't even listening
take your ideals and go away
I'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
don't know who you think i should be
i'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
done with yours,
i'm living my life for me
Tell me father,
did i turn out so bad
didn't i look up to you
took every piece of advice you had
go to school and get a job
send me on your way
you aren't even listening
take your dreams and go away
I'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
don't know who you think i should be
i'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
done with yours,
i'm living my life for me
for meeeee(repeated a couple of times)

for so long i tried to understand,
the qualities you thought made up a real man
now it's time for me to find out for myself,
i'm getting fed up,
i don't need your help
you never listen to both sides of the story,
you never listen,
you won't listen to me
I'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
don't know who you think i should be
i'm not cut from the same mold,
i don't read from the same old story
i'm not cut from the same mold,
done with yours,
i'm living my life for me!
