Standing down the edge of the cliff
Didn't think it would come to this
A dead calm before the storm
Not a sound from their engines
From the other side, saw a shooting star at 4: 22am

A warning shot from the rhythm demons
Or from the guitar preacher
I've been touched by both
And by the Holy Ghost
From the other side, saw a shooting star at 4: 22am

Underneath the stars above
I said, "No, stop"
I am not giving up on us
And I am not going anywhere soon
Annie, grab your bass guitar
Help me bring in the October moon
And you shout, run for cover
I scream, rev the Thriump's engine
You say baby we're too late
From the cloud riders, no escape
Darling, what's the blanket for?
Riding out this storm
We'll be riding out this storm

Carved a sain against the grain
At the nine doors to get
The secrets of dreams
The ones I could hear them singing
From the other side

Back then, the thunder gods
They used to cast out lights
But then I lost touch
Close to when her chariot
From the other side

A chariot pulled by cats
Purring will be returning
From the other side
Girl, it's time you take back your light

Underneath the stars above
I said, "No, stop"
I am not giving up on us
And I am not going anywhere soon
Annie, grab your bass guitar
Help me bring in the October moon
And you shout, run for cover
I scream, rev the Thriump's engine
You say baby we're too late
From the cloud riders, no escape
Darling, what's the blanket for?
Riding out this storm
We'll be riding out this storm

Leaving here, this storm
Leaving here, this storm
Leaving here, this storm
Leaving here, this storm
Leaving here
