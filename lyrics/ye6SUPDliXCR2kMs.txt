Pour more drank, drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Pour that lack on 'em
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor, brown liquor
Brown skin, brown face
Brown leather, brown sugar
Brown leaves, brown keys
Brown zippers, brown face
Black skin, black braids
Black waves, black days
Black baes, black days
These are black-owned things
Black faith still can't be washed away
Not even in that Florida water
Not even in that Florida water
In that Florida water
So pour more drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
I pour my drank on 'em
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor
Brown sugar, brown face
Brown liquor
Brown sugar, brown braids
Black skin
Black Benz, black plays
Black molasses, blackberry the masses

We just sittin' here foolin' around
We just sittin' here coolin' around
We just sittin' here high, comin' down

Pour my drank on 'em (Baby, my mind fuzzy)
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Still can't be washed away
Not even in that Florida water
Pour my drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor
Brown sugar, brown face
Brown liquor
Brown sugar, brown face
Black skin
Black Benz, black plays
Black molasses, blackberry the masses

We just sittin' here foolin' around
We just sittin' here coolin' around
We just sittin' here high, comin' down

All black coupe (Holup, yeah)
Now I want you (Holup, yeah)
Now I want you (Holup, yeah)
What you wanna do? (Holup, yeah)
Tell that boy screw (Holup, yeah)
Young nigga, too cool
Young nigga, big bool
Smokin' that dope, that is strong
I get that choppa, that dumb
All of my diamonds, they lumps
All of my diamonds, big lumps
I get that cash, got a bunch
I'ma die lit, bitch, I'm pump (Holup)
Tear the bitch up, bring her heart
Young nigga, fresh from the start (Holup)
Young nigga, fresh from the start (Holup)
Badass bitch from the start (Holup)
Young nigga, fresh from the start (Holup)
When I come around, they don't talk down
Diamonds they shine in the dark now
Diamonds they shine in the dark now
Diamonds they shine in the dark now
They takin' me in, what I done? (What?)
They takin' me in, what I done? (What?)
