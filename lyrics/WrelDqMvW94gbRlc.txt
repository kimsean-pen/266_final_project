I'm on my own now
You've gone and left me
I bet you don't know
How you've upset me

'Cause I've nothing left at all
At all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
I've nothing left at all

Did you love me?
I'd like to think so
But I was blameless
So why did you go?

'Cause I've nothing left at all
At all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
I've nothing left at all

I've lost a lover
And I am certain
I'll get another
So why'm I hurtin'

'Cause I've nothing left at all
At all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
I've nothing left at all

'Cause I've nothing left at all
At all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
I've nothing left at all
