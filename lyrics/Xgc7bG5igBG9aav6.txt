I'd like to walk around in your mind someday
I'd like to walk all over the things you say to me

I'd like to run and jump on your solitude
I'd like to rearrange your attitude to me

You say you just want peace and you'd never hurt anyone
You see the end before the beginning has ever begun

I would disturb your easy tranquility
I'd turn away the sad impossibility of your smile

I'd sit there in the sun of the things I like about you
I'd sing my songs and find out just what they mean to you

But most of all I'd like you to be unaware
And I'd just wander away
Trailing palm leaves behind me,
So you don't even know that I've been there
