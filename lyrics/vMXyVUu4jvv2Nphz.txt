I want... to tell
If I am or am not myself
It's hard... to know
How far or if it all could go
Waited far... too long
For something I forgot was wrong
I don't know all the answers I think that I'll find
Or have it within the time
But it's all that I'll have in mind

Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I won't keep you waiting long
Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I don't know what to do anymore
Until I fall away (until I fall away)

My fear, pretend
That I'll never be in love again
It's real... to me
But not like these fools and not like this scene
I won't... find
Or have it within the time
If it's all rusted and faded in the spot where we fell
Where I thought I'd left behind
It's loose now but we could try

Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I won't keep you waiting long
Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I don't know what to do anymore
Until I fall away... (until I fall away)

When there's no good answers
And new questions
Another personal disaster
There's nowhere to go but down...

Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I won't keep you waiting long
Until I fall away (until I fall away)
I don't know what to do anymore
Until I fall away... (until I fall away)
