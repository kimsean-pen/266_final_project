I survive on the scraps you don't burn
Maybe love's something I'll never learn
This whole house all cut from red stone
If I disappear would you even know

The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive

So far under
Far I've never fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under
Too much pain to tell
And now I've reeled us under
So far under

All my words start screaming to the boy
Same black hole where my heart was destroyed

The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive
The trap is time and no one gets off of this ride alive

So far under
Far I've never fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under
Too much pain to tell
And now I've reeled us under
So far under

So far under
Far I've never fell
Now forever dwell
So far under
So far under
Too much pain to tell
And now I've reeled us under
So far under
