A fervored image of another world
is nothing in paricular now
And imitation comes naturally
but I never really stop to think how
And everyone is a clever clone
A chrome covered clone am I
So in the absence of a way of life
Just repeat this agian and agian and again

Hey hey come out tonight
Hey hey come out tonight
Popscene
Alright

I'm leaving town to run away
Run into your twisted arm
No queues an there's no panic there
Just dangling my feet in the grass
My lack of natural lustre now
seems to be loosing me friends
So in the absence of a way of life
I'll repeat this again and again and again

Hey hey come out tonight
Hey hey come out tonight

Popscene
Hey hey come out tonight
Hey hey come out tonight
Popscene
Alright
Hey hey come out tonight
Hey hey come out tonight
