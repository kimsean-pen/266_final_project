When you smile, I can taste baby you don't even know
You don't even know
And my heart skips a beat, darling everytime you go
Everytime you go, everytime you go

When you walking to the room
I can't speak, and I can't move
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good

I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it nice and make it slow
I'm afraid that you misunderstood
Every day is just a wish I could
And why you gotta make it hurt so good

And why you gotta make it hurt so good

All the girls on the block
They go knocking on your door
Knocking on your door
You just stare out the window

What you waiting for
What you waiting for
Is it too late, or too soon
I'm right outside you, wanting you

You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it nice and make it slow
I'm afraid that you misunderstood
Every day is just a wish I could

And why you gotta make it hurt so good, so good
Imagine you, imagine me
Together so, how lovely
Imagine me, imagine you

Inside a dream, how good for two
When you walking to the room
I can't speak, and I can't move
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good
I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it nice and make it slow
I'm afraid that you misunderstood
Every day is just a wish I could
And why you gotta make it hurt so good, so good
And why you gotta make it hurt so good
