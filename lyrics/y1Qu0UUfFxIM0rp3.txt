Somwhere out there in the vast nothingness of space.
Somewhere faraway in space and time.
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidan sky.
We're marooned on a small island.
In an Endless sea.
Confined to a tiny spit of sand.
Unable to escape.
But Tonight.
On this small planet, on earth.
We're going to rock civilization
