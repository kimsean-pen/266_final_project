And now I know, I know the truth.
It's just a matter of inspiration
And it all was just a combination
Of the drugs that I did tonight.
It's safe to say that I'm in your head.
It's safe to say that I'm doing a good job.
Pretty sure that you won't forget.
It's safe to say I'm becoming an outlaw.
I wrote a poem just to give to you,
But it all turns to fake words and sounds.
It's safe to say that I'm in your head,
And that's the reason you've been feeling your temples pound.
And now I know

Now I know what I'm up against,
I'll forget in the morning
Like some dream world story, that I wish that I wrote down.
I wish you could teleport and be in my bedroom.
That would make me feel just like new,
That would make it go away.

I made a plan, devised the scheme,
It's just a matter of preparation,
And you know it's just a combination
Of the things that I felt tonight.
I wrote a poem just to give to you,
But it all turns to fake words and sounds.
I wonder if you'll remember me,
When I f*ck this up and you're not around.
And now I know

Now I know what I'm up against,
I'll forget in the morning
Like some dream world story, that I wish that I wrote down.
I wish you could teleport and be in my bedroom.
That would make me feel just like new,
That would make it go away.

Three thousand miles till I'm sleeping in your bed.
You're not next door,
You're not down the street.
You're three thousand miles so teleport to me.
I never thought that I would put you through this,
Teleport to me.
You're in pieces, how did I do this?

Now I know what I'm up against,
I'll forget in the morning
Like some dream world story, that I wish that I wrote down.
I wish you could teleport and be in my bedroom.
That would make me feel just like new,
That would make it go away.
Now I know what I'm up against,
I wrote a poem just to give to you,
That I wish that I wrote down.
That I wish that I wrote down.
