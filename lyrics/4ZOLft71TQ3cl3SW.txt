Easy stays the heart in the cold
They're making me believe in ideas.
Run back into the city
You and me ...
You said that watch is changing
With ...is built us together

Chorus:
You see .tell me those lies!
Tell me those lies!
Don't believe what you find inside
You only see, you arrived just in time!

I'm gonna keep back to the city
Cause that's where our fate is
...the rest will seem so unpleasant.

Chorus:
You see .tell me those lies!
Tell me those lies!
Don't believe what you find inside
You only see, you arrived just in time!
