Made you over
Made you colder
Rewrote your book
Held a mirror to your error
Made you a crook
Candy and Cake
Dished up we ate
Worshiped the cook
Vice-president of everybody
Vice-president of everybody
Ladies and gentlemen!
Deerhood would like to bring chaos to you!
Play your ears
Let them go free
Feel it
Turn it up
Vice-president of everyone
And nobody

Made you over
Make you colder
Rewrote your book
Held a mirror to your error
Made you a crook
Candy and Cake
Dished up we ate
Worshiped the cook
Vice-president of everyone
And nobody
