I'm on the phone while I'm driving,
take my hand off of these wheels
to keep my legs from shaking,
moving to the crashing of cymbals, growing into themes,
near to "mesmerize",
but never right on time.
You say that you mean it this time more
Last time turned to nothing, this I'm sure,
but I've been wrong before,
and how this feels,
and how Liz sings
"I won't decorate my love"
has got me thinking,
it's got me dreaming
of imaginary times
on an imaginary couch
listening to imaginary records
and with imaginary mouths
saying "boy, this is it,"
"this must be it".
Please, can't this just be it.
