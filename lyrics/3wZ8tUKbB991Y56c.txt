Long time it gets always blurry
After a while the same old story
And if you think you understand me
I guess your eyes all it can be

I know all along
What i see
What i need
Nothing in between
Everything
Tangerine
Tangerine

Deep in the hours after midnight
Skating on beneath the street light
Line down together when we get high
Right to the waterfall of sunrise

All I need
Tangerine
Tangerine

All I need
Tangerine
Tangerine

All I need
Tangerine
Tangerine
