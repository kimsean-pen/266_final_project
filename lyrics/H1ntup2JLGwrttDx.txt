Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
It halved it in half
And went gushing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing
And in hand a little hand
It halved it in half
By taking it forward
It went gushing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
When gushing gust winds
Turned just up north
Wheezing and sneezing
In hand a little hand
By taking it forward
It went gushing gust wind

Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and

Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
