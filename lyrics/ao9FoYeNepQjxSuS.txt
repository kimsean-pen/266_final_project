Hey, you motherfucker
What you looking at?
Born a fuckin' loser
Acting like a twat
Talking abirato
In a life you chose
Walking like a loser
Gonna bust your nose

Yeah yeah yeah
Dark night of the soul
Oh fuckin' yeah
You've got no control

Yeah yeah yeah
Dark night of the soul
Oh fuckin' yeah
You've got no control

Run from your life
Pitied and crying
Cold and dismayed
On your knees and pray
Ugh!

Troublemaker, undertaker
Dealer faker, fire maker
Light it up and take a bow
The dark night takes you out

Lonely at the bottom
Like a piece of shit
Reaper comes a-knockin'
Time to get a grip
Digging ever deeper
Ready for a fight
Desperation seeker
Lucifer is light

Yeah yeah yeah
Dark night of the soul
Oh fuckin' yeah
You've got no control

Yeah yeah yeah
Dark night of the soul
Oh fuckin' yeah
You've got no control
