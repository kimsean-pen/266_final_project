Yeah...
I hear melodies in my head
Find little notes in my bed
I got songs tangled up in my head
I see pianos keys everywhere

My heart is a beating drum
Repeating my favorite song
I hear Beethoven number 9
All the time

And it's kinda like do-re-mi
About as easy as a-b-c
Beautiful like a symphony
I'm talking about you and me

I hear melodies in my heart
Hear melodies in my head
I was little odd keep and you
Never die me and I'm better than ever

I hear melodies in my heart I hear melodies in my head
I have to be wrong but
I got a new song now

So I put my headphones on,
Plug into you
Plug into you
So you're my favorite song
Plug into you
Plug into you

You're so wrong
That it makes you right
Keep me, wide awake at night
I can't sleep now I know you're around

I'll la-listening and singing every sound
I love it when I hear your voice
Baby, I don't think we really had a choice
Mozart is in the air, and I'm right here

And it's kinda like do-re-mi
About as easy as a-b-c
Beutiful like a symphony
I'm talking about you and me

I hear melodies in my heart.
I hear melodies in my head
I was little odd keep and you
Never die me and I'm better than ever

I hear melodies in my heart
Keep the melodies in my head
I have to be wrong but
I got a new song now

So I put my headphones on,
Plug into you
Plug into you
So you're my favorite song
Plug into you
Plug into you
Ow ow ow
I wake up in the middle of the night
Can't stop for the melodies that I hear,
The melodies baby I hear
Melodies all the time, and I'm about to go crazy

Keep on singing I'm about to see you baby,
You're my melodies
And I - I hear melodies in my heart

I hear melodies in my heart
Keep the melodies in my head
I was little odd keep and you
Never die me and I'm better than ever

I hear melodies in my heart
Keep the melodies in my head
I have to be wrong but
I got a new song now

So I put my headphones on,
Plug into you
Plug into you
So you're my favorite song
Talking to you
Talking to you
