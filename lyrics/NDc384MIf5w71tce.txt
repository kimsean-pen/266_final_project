Heavy humid night. Corner of Park and Main.
Cast that first glance: your smile, my veins
at maximum capacity, blood pumping so fast.
My girl, if looks gave heart attacks.
The dangerous men in the shadows were like an audience,
and even the meanest among them
had a special little shine in their eyes when they saw us walk by.
Walked about twenty blocks talking about good bars and better towns than this one.
Kissed that first night,
then the rain opened up the sky to get
One last kiss, I love you like an alcoholic.
One last kiss, I love you like a statuette.
One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken leg.
I was getting off the late shift, attempting to recover.
Crumpled up the bus pass and tossed it into the gutter.
Some handsome dark stranger, you were standing there on the corner.
You had those compelling magnetized eyes that you must have lost when you got older.
Seven blocks in, my fingers brushed your hand;
I blushed, you laughed, but you seemed a little sad.
I ain't one to jump a ship, but I absolutely knew
I was six steps in when I fell into you.
One last kiss, I love you like a broken pot.
One last kiss, I love you like a pack of dogs.
One last kiss, I need you like I need a gaping head wound.

One last kiss, I love you like an alcoholic.
One last kiss, I love you like a negligee.
One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken leg.
