you're living but you've got no soul
you captivate but you hold no weight at all
so watch as I start to smile

your dumber than you think you're deep
you aggravate but you always stop to speak
so watch as I start to smile

after every party I die
after every party I die

the morning breaks us up inside
payback, execution, killing time
so watch as I start to smile

there's something that you think you need
trying your best to sleep at cocaine speed
so watch as I start to smile

after every party I die (die, after every party)
after every party I die (die, after every party)

you're living but you've got no soul
you captivate but you hold no weight at all
so watch as I start to smile

smile, smile, smile, smile
smile, smile, smile, smile
smile, smile, smile, smile

after every party I die (die, after every party)
after every party I die (die, after every party)
after every party I die (die, after every party)
after every party I die (die, after every party)
I die after every party
I die after every party
