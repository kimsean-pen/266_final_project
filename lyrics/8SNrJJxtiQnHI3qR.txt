Head bangers in leather
Sparks fly in the dead of the night
It all comes together
When they shoot out the lights

50, 000 watts of power
And it's pushin' overload
The beast is ready to devour
All the metal they can hold

Reachin' overload
Start to explode

It's your one way ticket to midnight
Call it Heavy Metal
Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal
Desperation on a red line
Call it Heavy Metal noise

Tight pants and lipstick
She's riding on razor's edge
She holds her own against the boys
Yeah, cuts through the crowd just like a wedge

Ooh, can you feel the static
So many contacts being made
We've got up front fanatics
Tearing down the barricade

To reach the stage
Can you feel the rage?

It's your one way ticket to midnight
Call it Heavy Metal
Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal
Desperation on a red line
Call it Heavy Metal noise, ah

It's your one way ticket to midnight
Call it Heavy Metal
Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal
Desperation on a red line
Call it Heavy Metal

Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal noise
Heavy Metal noise
Heavy Metal noise
Heavy Metal noise
Call it Heavy Metal
