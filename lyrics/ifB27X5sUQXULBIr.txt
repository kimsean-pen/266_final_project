Neither books nor wise men
Will give me an answer
No hatred, no envy,
No cynicism, no bravado

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?

What is the order?
Spirit, soul and body
Deep and surreal
An answer comes and disappears

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?

Tell me is it hard
To love each other?
