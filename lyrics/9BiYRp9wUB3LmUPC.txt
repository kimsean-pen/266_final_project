A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back plazas
And ate all your razors while pullin' the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walkin' on snow white
New York's a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greene

Ohh
Hoo, ooo, ooo
Give up now

Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous
(Jean Genie)
He screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go
Ooo, oww

Sits like a man but smiles like a reptiles
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
So, scratch in the sand won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
Keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greene
Hoo, ooo, ooo

Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous
(Jean Genie)
He screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go
Ooo, oww

So simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
(Aah)
Loves to be loved
(Aah)
Loves to be loved

Aaa, ooo
Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous
(Jean Genie)
He screams and he bawls
Jean Genie, let yourself go
Ooo, oww
Go, go

Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous
(Jean Genie)
He screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go
Ooo, oww
Go, go, go
