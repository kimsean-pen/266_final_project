Parachute stretched
Pulled tight
Under cross
The sand and water
Comes closer
Dangerous
Sand stayed
Colder
Stretching
Wind
Water rushing

Parachute stretched
Pulled tight
Under cross
The sand and water
Comes closer
Dangerous
Sand stayed
Colder
Stretching
Wind
Water rushing

Watching you from the port across the sea
But how I long to see you in my dream
And oh, what can I do?
I wanted to tell you and show you and give you everything
And are you underneath your parachute
Twisting the day away
I know how you enjoy it
