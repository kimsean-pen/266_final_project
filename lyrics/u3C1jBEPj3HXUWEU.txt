Raven hair
Aspen eyes
Flicker fire
I wish I found you sooner
I could've loved you longer
Long black car
Cool green grass
Sullen choir
I wish I found you sooner
I could've loved you longer

This old sleepy town
never even knew you were around
Now your setting stone
will lie under the sun, the rain, the snow
Do you know
I'll lay with you until I go?

Sable skirt
made of dirt,
worn by weather
I wish I found you sooner
I could've loved you longer

This old sleepy town
never even knew you were around
Now your setting stone
will lie under the sun, the rain, the snow
Do you know
I'll lay with you until I go?
Do you know
I'll lay with you until I go?
Do you know
I'll lay with you until I go?
