I'd like to love you with all of my heart
You've had me on your trip
Right from the start
And when you looked at me
With love in your eyes
I knew I'd want you, oh, yeah

I'd like to hold you if you want me to
I've found something new, girl
Just by lookin' at you
And it's in your smile
And it's in the way
I knew I'd want you, oh, yeah

I meet so many people I feel I don't know
But I felt so close to you when you said, "Hello"

I'd like to love you and together we'd find
The place we've been lookin' for
Where we'll have peace of mind
And there we'll be happy
And there I'll know why
I knew I'd want you, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
