Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life.
Loving you is entire.
And loving you is the one thing that I need right now...

Center the morning light where the world's so bright and high.
Where even the gods outside can wait a moment guy...

And loving you is entire.

Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life.
Loving you is entire.
Loving you in the morning is a warning...

Say we will wallow away in a world so mild and high.
Stay till the morning and that world just might get by...

'Cause loving you is divine!
If only the morning would come and the world would be old and wise!
Love in the morning with this halo all one size.
'Cause even the gods outside can wait a moment guy...
Loving you is divine!
