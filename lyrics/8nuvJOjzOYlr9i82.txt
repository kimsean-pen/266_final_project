An inner vision

Emancipate my soul
Through knowledge
A truth of one and all
The source of our vision
Can eviscerate the lies that bind us
A mental prison
Manipulation

Emancipate my soul
A world on fire
Desire
We can't control the flame
Confusion
Illusion
We're trading on our hearts and souls
God help us all
As we watch it fucking fall

Inner vision is where I did see
The horrors of the world
They are meant to be
Inner vision is where I did find
The answers to our problems
Reside in the mind

Woh-oh-oh
The answers to our problems
Reside in our minds
Woh-oh-oh
Knowing yourself is
The way to break free
Go

This world's on fire
Desire
Yeah we're the ones to blame
Our vision
The solace
That eviscerates
The lies

Pushing and shoving
I'm tested again
Forever knowing that
We're in the end
