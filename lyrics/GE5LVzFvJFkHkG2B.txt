I wanna die in Los Angeles
Under an overpass
A walking blackout fading
My last breath gasped

I wanna die in Los Angeles
Where people Ask the Dust
More sad than scandalous
And sweating rust, and I know...

It all feels like a cheap parade
In the sun I'm gonna beg for rain
If I'm (Oh I)

In the middle we got no way out
At the end was it all about some lie?
I wanna die, die, die in Los Angeles!

I wanna die in Los Angeles
Under a blood orange sun
In a fugue state hated
By the ones I love

And when I die in Los Angeles
They're gonna say they knew
Like he was almost decent
But I'm glad he's through, and I know...

It all feels like a cheap parade
In the sun I'm gonna beg for rain
If I'm (Oh I)

In the middle we got no way out
At the end was it all about some lie?
I wanna die, die, die in Los Angeles!

Die! Die in Los Angeles!
Die! Die in Los Angeles!
Die! Die in Los Angeles!
Die! Die in Los Angeles!
