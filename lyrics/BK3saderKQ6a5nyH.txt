Back then you and I was broke
All we used to do was fuck and smoke
Massage my back while I roll
That's why everything a nigga did was dope
That's why I got down for a dose
That's why you and I so close
Don't you see we gotta do the most
All them haters we gon' make a toast
Till I die I'm Ph but you make me feel some way
Speechless don't know what to say
Grab my dick lets party babe
Grab the weed and party faze
Fuck no we will not behave
To your rules I'm not a slave
Don't you trip I got this babe

Girl you know I really like your features
I might go down by the bleachers
Just tell me if you see any teachers
Girl I know your father a preacher
And later this ship might eat ya
But I do anything to get ya
When you cross my mind i miss ya
I gotta have you in my picture

Baby you and I should
Honey we should chill sometime
Baby you and I should
Baby we should chill sometime
Everything that I do
I do with you on my mind
Babygirl I got you
God damn you so fine
Baby you and I should
Baby you and I should
Maybe we can chill sometime
Everything that I do
Babygirl I got you
God damn you so fine

Oh no I cannot believe it
Nah that's not Azizi you must've mistake him for breezy
Talking like this shit is easy
Nah this shit is greasy just have Stevie b do a meme
But this shit ain't like whats on TV
Yeah ain't nothing here geechy unless you like 2 people screaming
Please, let out your semen don't let out your demons unless you're prepared for the sequence
Cause love is relentless it kills with no question
It could give a shit bout your defense
You best count your blessings not worry 'bout mentions
You just buildin' up your tension
I'm here to prevent it and lend you my pennies and then take yo ass out to Denny's
Go sip some henny, fuck if she let me, give you a night to remember

Baby you and I should
Honey we should chill sometime
Baby you and I should
Baby we should chill sometime
Everything that I do
I do with you on my mind
Babygirl I got you
God damn you so fine
Baby you and I should
