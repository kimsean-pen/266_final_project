(INTRO)
Gimme... er
Gimme... er

Give me just a piece of time
'Cos you took a long time to find
Call me up on the phone
Colour me with all you know
Give me just a piece of time
Find a window in a dirty mind
Baby can you bear the truth
I wanna come clean for you

(CHORUS)
Give me just a piece of time (Tell me if your heart is ready)
Give me just... time (I'm waitin' won't you tell me)
Give me just a piece of time (I'm coming now)
Give me just a piece of time (I need you now)

Give me just a piece of time
'Cos you took a long time... to come
Call me up on the phone
Colour me all you know
Gimme gimme, piece of time
Gimme dirty dirty piece of ****
Baby can you bear the truth
I wanna come... for you-ou-ou

(CHORUS)
Give me just a piece of time (Tell me if your heart is ready)
Give me just... time (I'm waitin' won't you tell me)
Give me just a piece of time (I'm coming now)
Give me just a piece of time (I need you now) x2

Tell me (tell me) if your heart is ready
Tell me...
Tell me (tell me) if your heart is ready

(CHORUS)
Give me just a piece of time (Tell me if your heart is ready)
Give me just... time (I'm waitin' won't you tell me)
Give me just a piece of time (I'm coming now)
Give me just a piece of time (I need you now) x2
