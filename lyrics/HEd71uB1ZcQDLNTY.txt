Like children they play
I wanna feel at home
I want to feel at home

You know I can't stay
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home

You know I can't stay
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home

Nah at night
and in the day light
come on broken boys
let's stay tight

So when the morning comes
and were all dead
we can live free
just like my brother said

He said
"don't stay, go out and play,
you can't live until your dead."
"don't stay, go out and play,
you can't live until your dead."
"don't stay, go out and play,
you can't live until your dead."

But you know the freedom that my brother saw
it deep down
it in your heart

Nah the children play like my brother say
and I wanna feel at home
and it's the beautiful sight at the break of day light
that makes me feel like ill find a home
so to the girls and boys calling out wolf noise
one day you'll find a home
And if the world unites
sets the mounatin alight
then outside your house will become your home

Like children lets play
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home

Come on don't stay
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home
I wanna feel at home
