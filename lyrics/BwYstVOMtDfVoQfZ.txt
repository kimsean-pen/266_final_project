My veins are the roots of this tree
I would die inside if you ever stopped nurturing me

With your breath
Oh, when you breathe
I feel like my eyes turn green

If there's a God
I wonder what she looks like
I bet she looks like you

I bet she looks like you
I wish that life would release the tree
And you could put me to sleep
Forever and ever
