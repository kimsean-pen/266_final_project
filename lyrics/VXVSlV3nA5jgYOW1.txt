Haven't seen me lately
Staying hard to find
Well I know it ain't easy
But you know I don't mind

I always know where you are
You never know where I am
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone
You've gone and done it again
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible man
Goin' once, goin' twice, three times I'm gone

You've been looking for days now
Oh but Im not around
I've been finding new ways how
To see that I am never found

I always know where you are
You never know where I am
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone
You've gone and done it again
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible man
Goin' once, goin' twice, three times I'm gone

You can see right through me
Outta site, outta mind
Can you see why it's easy
To be the hardest to find?

I always know where you are
You never know where I am
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone
You've gone and done it again
You've got me sneaking around
Like the invisible-ble-ble

Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man
Like the invisible man

Like I'm invisible
Goin' once, goin' twice, three times
That's it I'm gone
