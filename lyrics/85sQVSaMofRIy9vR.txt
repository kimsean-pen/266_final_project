The day that I knew, I wasn't an artist
Just another drunk who could play a guitar
Brought it to light, how I say that I'm honest
But I've never done a single thing from the heart

But I can try to show you how I let you down
Oh and it's harder, it's harder now
To stay so up when I break you down
Oh and it's my fault, my fault now

I didn't plan to become narcissistic
And never mean a single word that I said
But I guess when I poison myself till I get sick
It's hard to tell what's real and what's in my head

But I can try to show you how I let you down
Oh and it's harder, it's harder now
To stay so up when I break you down
Oh and it's my fault, my fault now

Wish I could fall apart, get up and start again
It's hard to find a purpose, that I really believe in
I've spent so long just wishing to myself
Nothing wrong with our love, always leaves me

But I can try to show you how I let you down
Oh and it's harder, it's harder now
To stay so up when I break you down
Oh and it's my fault, my fault now
