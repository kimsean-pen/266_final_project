When it goes around
we're settled in your town
and you fear you're up
on a wall, being magnified.

Can it be:
You and me, lady,
two or three babies
A billion bucks
in the trust and we're on top
We're way up top

I feel like being the ones
who are up to no good

We'll be the ones they talk about
when they sit down
American dreams,
deceiving smiles
I feel like being the ones
who are up to no good

I'm a baby, I want to cry

Sew this seam so it's so tight that it won't die
And in my dream when we meet eyes we can't die
Sew this seam so it's so tight it just won't die
Creative beings in big lies
Oh, we will lie

Should we be more uncivilized?
Don't apologize,
pretend I'm yours
and you are mine
