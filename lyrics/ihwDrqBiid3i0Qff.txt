I noticed in the morning
That your smile was out of place
What can I say?

You wander in the bedroom
Was it something I could have said?

There are a million, billion things that
I want to say to you

Please don't turn around and walk away
From me

I called you on the phone
But you never, ever hold
What can I do?

I wanna say how much I care
I wanna tell you everywhere
How much I Love. You

There are a million things
That I want to say, baby to you

So please don't turn around and walk away
From me

And I know that in time
That we'll soon be fine and you'll
Change

I've been thinking about you girl
I know the way you are so why don't you
Wait

There are a million things
That I want to say, baby to you

So please don't turn around and walk away
From me

A million things to say
