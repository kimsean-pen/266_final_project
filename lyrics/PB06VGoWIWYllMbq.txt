And in the middle of a dull-lit weightless street
Stands a shadow of a man shaped just like me
My curiousity keeps me confused
But still I stand here on my own
With nothing left to lose

And will the rain I don't accept wash away my sins
Or simply trouble my walk home and my spirit
Because I never said 'no' or put up a fight
And I'm emotionally impaired
When I look at you

And I'm trying to keep these bones inside my skin
But my body is in a hole my shadow digs
And as I struggle to maintain my position
The oil's dried from this heart of rusted tin
And I wonder if I'll survive this
Without you
