You and I appear awake
Even in the summer days
You hang on to the things I say
But you couldn't see
What's in my head

You come alone, I'll be down
Like a nightmare, like a nightmare
You come alone, I'll be down
Not the first one, not the last one

To do it all again
To do it all again
Do it all again
Do it all again
I'll cry, I'll cry
When the movie's over
I'll cry, I'll cry

I don't mind for you favourite things
In the catalog, of your memories
You hang on to the falling leaves
Like the leaves themselves
You were born to claim

You come alone, I'll be down
This time you're wasting
This time we're wasting
You come alone, I'll be down
Like a nightmare, like a nightmare

Do it all again
Do it all again
Do it all again
Do it all again
I'll cry I'll cry
When the movie's over
I'll cry I'll cry

(Outro)
I'll cry I'll cry
When the movie's over
I'll cry I'll cry
