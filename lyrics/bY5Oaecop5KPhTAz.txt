Just one kiss
is enough to get me drunk right from your lips.
I would swim
through the deepest oceans just to hear your name.
(I would, I would, I would)
I thought I knew right from wrong,
but the blood upon these hands has proved me wrong.
My mistakes can't be covered up
you should cover up
Won't you cover up?

Just hold on
and dance like there's no tomorrow.
Let's hold on.
Cause without you there is no me.

I would run
through the darkest forest just to taste your skin.
Melt the sun
if for just one second I could stop the pain.
(I would, I would, I would)
I thought I knew right from wrong,
but the blood upon these hands has proved me wrong.
My mistakes can't be covered up.
You should cover up.
Won't you cover up?

Just hold on
and dance like there's no tomorrow.
Let's hold on.
Cause without you there is no me.

You seem to think you're bound and gagged and here all just for me.
You can leave what could I do?
I though I learned right from wrong.
I though I learned right from wrong.
I though I learned right from wrong.
I though I learned right.

Just hold on
and dance like there's no tomorrow.
Let's hold on.
Cause without you there is no me.
Just hold on
and dance like there's no tomorrow.
Let's hold on.
Cause without you there is no me.
