I've said this before no matter how hard I try
I can't help be bored while this world passes by

SO! This revelation's got no meaning
We've lost it all in hopeless dreaming

AM I JUST LOSING GRIP?
Paint it black and just forget me
THIS WORLD'S A SINKING SHIP!
'Cause our baggage is too heavy

I can't stop believing there's something to be said
What are we achieving with the bullshit that we're fed?
I know I'm not gonna stay, or live to see the day
This world comes to be, here's a resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me

I've said this before no matter how hard I try
I can't help be bored while this world passes by

Don't tell me we're close to something
That we don't even understand

WE'RE PRISONERS TO OUR HOMES!
Some might say we're all to blame
THE OUTSIDE'S SO UNKNOWN!
I don't want you to complain

I can't find the answers to save humanity
I can't fight the anger, here's a resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me
