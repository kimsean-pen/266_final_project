It feels so pointless
Is anyone there
Where is your faith
That keeps you moving
Who decides how far we go
Who walks behind us incase we
Trip over, the smallest crack

Am I Unworthy?
These things can only be said so many times
Before they become our fears

And I find myself swimming farther,
Than I ever planned to go
Out in this lost ocean, this lost ocean

Perfection will never over power us,
Perfection will never over power us,

Don't hide from the light
They can't burn bright forever

And I find myself swimming farther,
Than I ever planned to go
Out in this lost ocean, Ocean

I still feel hate reaching out to save me.
It's deep down oh but it's there.
