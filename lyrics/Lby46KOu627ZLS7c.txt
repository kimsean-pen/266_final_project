Well he caught the whole things that you always think
He said it mean no harm
Well it was a big to-do
But nothing else was new
His passion for the drink, it was a central part
He could look good in the light and the bad in the dark
Good men are always scarce and few
But always passing through

Oh you mirrored sea
Your waves are haunting me
They're all I see
Let me be you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Out in the sea, you'll feel

Born every chance that I've been ready
It takes more to risk it at the end of the rope
Bounce off the wall so your team's
Like in a pinball machine
Slipups in this town are like a sentence to life
Like overheard that so and so's a cheating wife
And then it's down for the count
It was not only a foul

Oh you mirrored sea
Your waves are haunting me
They're all I see
Let me be you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Out in the sea, you'll feel

And it was alone, and it was alone
and it was alone, and it was alone
And it was alone, and it was alone
and it was alone, and it was alone...

Oh you mirrored sea
Your waves are haunting me
They're all I see
Let me be you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Out in the sea, you'll feel
