Chaly got the power, John Boy got the amps to match
He's climbing up the tower to tap in to make our scratch
Good standing card carrying Jersey boys crank it up to a higher level
U-haul cross the state line, don't fuck with a Jersey devil

Welcome to the Garden State
Come on in the water's great
We're out of line and we got no time for you
Welcome to the Garden State
The best damn place in the U.S.A.
You may not agree, you bitch and you moan
I've been everywhere but it's never like home

We loaded up the Pacer, liquid gold in a twelve ounce cans
We're heading down the shore with Proc, Cheetah, Evan and the band
Out there where the medical waste and the water meets the sand
Watch your mouth, want a fresh one or you'll get the back of my hand
Big haired, gum chewing, Jersey girls. Good manners is what I hate
She said, this is Billy from Philly. Ok, get the fuck out of my state

Welcome to the Garden State
Come on in the water's great
We're out of line and
We got no time for you
Welcome to the Garden State
The best damn place in the U.S.A.
You may not agree,
You bitch and you moan
I've been everywhere
But it's never like home
Been everywhere but
It's never like home
Been everywhere but
It's never like home

Backed up down the parkway,
Dead on 195
Turnpike has been crawling
South and so is route 35
I got a taste for the best
And it's better than the rest
So pull it over if you please
And I died on the side
WIth my Jersey Pride
Wanna follow my lead

1 2, 1 2 3 4
