Shape shifting high
and a haunted eye.
Falling plastic and paper demons!
No trace of time,
I'm branded sly,
I am your ghostmaster baby free me.

All you know,
is alone,
you see a,
Phantom Stranger!
Down you go,
all alone,
you love my,
Phantom Stranger!

My sinister sounds
Sweep the grounds
Still-born I Lie beneath it
I throw it away
the freaks all stay
Deformed and laughing screaming!

All you know,
is alone,
you see a,
Phantom Stranger!
Down you go,
all alone,
you love my,
Phantom Stranger!

A wretched heart
in the dark decay,
dominate forever...
Destroy the things you love
and see if I remember

All you know,
is alone,
you see a,
Phantom Stranger!
down you go
all alone
you love my,
Phantom Stranger!
