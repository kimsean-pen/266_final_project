sleeping is believing, breathing is deceiving.
watch your heart, let it bleed, don't have faith in anything
corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose
the drawback to living is finding yourself
watch your heart let it bleed, don't have faith in anything
corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose
don't believe it if you see it, got to see it, to believe it
corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose corpse pose
don't belive it if yo see it, don't belive it if you see it,
got to see it to belive it.
