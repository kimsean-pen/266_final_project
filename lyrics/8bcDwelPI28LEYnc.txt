Where I walk, the shadows hide
Do they have to see us naked
To remember where we're going?

I don't even care that much
Call it evil to my face
Tell me how they always listen
Never gonna be erased
What could go wrong
Panopticon
Looking for a smoking gun
I really gotta take this call

Now the officers arriving
They never got invited
I don't think that I can buy it
No, I'm not going quietly

I don't even care that much
Call it evil to my face
Tell me how they always listen
Never gonna be erased
What could go wrong
Panopticon
Looking for a smoking gun
I really gotta take this call

Whoa
Yeah
Whoa
Who's back to see
Your face on the wall at the federal police
Who's back to see
Your face on the wall at the federal police
To run to, to run to
To run to, to run to
To run to, to run to
To run to, to run to
Hey, to run to, to run to
To run to, to run to
Oh, to run to, to run to
To run to, to run to
To run to, hey to run to
To run to, to run to
Oh, to run to, to run to
