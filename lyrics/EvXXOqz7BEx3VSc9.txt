A wire! Oh watch out!
Hours away
Sounded like something you would say
We tend to walk a tight rope
Oh to appear in brilliantine
And I am grateful you would think of me
A wire! Oh watch out!
Save all the bees
Close your eyes
Slung haphazardly upon the bed to dream
Even when you were right, you were wrong
It don't matter, don't matter to me
Even when you were right, you were wrong
It don't matter, don't matter to me
Show me how life can be
Entrust the key
Hold on, you'll soon regret
A wire! Oh watch out!
Whole body weight slowing you down
Disintegrate
And I don't know what that means
Oh what's my name compared to your assemblage of me
You would drink stars
And raise a glass to me
Even when you were right, you were wrong
It don't matter, don't matter to me
Even when you were right, you were wrong
It don't matter, don't matter to me
Show me how life can be
Entrust the key
Hold on, you'll soon regret
Change my heart
Whirl to start
Change my heart
Learn to start
Somewhere
