I was getting lost in your quicksand
Looking around for your hand
When I noticed falling where I once stood
If I was blind you were heartless
I feel for you in the darkness
Where I once was standing
Where I once was standing, standing

I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
Word

From your mouth you were foaming
Don't wake me up in the morning
All I heard was silence
All i heard was silence
Silence

I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
Word, keep his word, word

All I heard was silence
All I heard was silence
All I heard was silence
Oh

I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his word
I was a fool who lost his herd
I'm just a child who can't keep his silence
