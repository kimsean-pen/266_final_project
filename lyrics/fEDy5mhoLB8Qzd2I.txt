Ever since my baby left me you
Know this ghost town ain't no
Fun no more she stole my heart
Away from me and then she
Dropped it on the floor my
Outside's tough, hellbent
Leather overcoat of what was
Once a man but inside's a little
Broken hearted boy whose
Feelings he cannot stand.
chorus:
I've got these ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the
Gallows in the wind
I've got these ghost town blues
I feel like an undertaker dressed
In black but no one left for dead
She left me in a heartbeat
And now there's no one left to
Sleep in my bed where laughs and
Cries and memories were once
Now lie and tumbleweeds and dust
And an empty graveyard
Feeling that began once just as a
Childhood lust
chorus:
I've got these ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the
Gallows in the wind
I've got these ghost town blues
My pontiac spit back feelings of
Contempt out the exhaust
A hundred miles an hour down a
Highway. Well I'm beat up and I'm
Lost she's gone and I know it,
Like an outlaw she ran for the
Hills and I'll start a brand new
Life with a new girl and these
Same old ghost town thrills.
chorus:
I've got these ghost town blues
With nothing left to lose
The noose swings high up on the
Gallows in the wind
I've got these ghost town blues.
