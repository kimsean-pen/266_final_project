A lesson learned is easier said than done when you're living in a world without the sun
My mind keeps struggling to remember
I wish I could find a way to make up for all that I've done
I know the choice was mine but, can you blame me?

Yeah, the choice was all mine
But I never thought that I'd be the last man standing alone
I miss you here by my side
But darling, I can't help but feel like love has died

Operator, is there anybody at all
That can explain why I'd give everything and more up for her
I know it's unbelievable but something about her I can't resist
But she doesn't even know I exist

So yeah, I pulled the plug
But I swore the spark would still be there buried beneath the promises and lies

We suffocated in all our own filth
I swear I only wanted what was best but you just left
I was just lonely, you were in love
But now it seems that the table's have turned and I feel so alone

Yeah, the choice was all mine
But I never thought that I'd be the last man standing alone
I miss you here by my side
But darling, I can't help but feel like love has died

Operator, is there anybody at all
That can explain why I'd give everything and more up for her
I know it's unbelievable but something about her I can't resist
But she doesn't even know I exist

Darling, won't you forgive me?
I'm just looking for a little bit of love in this heartbreak city
Darling, won't you forgive me?
I'm looking for a little bit of love but she doesn't even know I exist

All I wanted was to be your love
But now you've left and I can not fill the void
All I wanted was to be your love
But now I'm finally moving on

Ha ha ha ha, I don't give a fuck

I waited all this time to watch you jump out of my life
If I knew you'd only wanted me for just a single night
I would've left and never returned
But you had to beg me to fall in again and now I'm just your slave

Operator, is there anybody at all
That can explain why I gave everything and more up for her
I know I sound so gullible but something about her just drew me in
But that bitch didn't even notice me (Yeah)

Operator, is there anybody at all
That can explain why I'd give everything and more up for her
I know it's unbelievable but something about her I can't resist
But she doesn't even know I exist

Darling, won't you forgive me?
I'm just looking for a little bit of love in this heartbreak city
Darling, won't you forgive me?
I'm looking for a little bit of love but she doesn't even know I exist
