Hey ho on the road again
Moving on, forward
Sticks and stones, won't break the bones
We're in the car... on a highway

It's so magical feeling, that no one's got a hold
You're a catalyst to your own, happiness you know

Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
It's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
...
And it's whistling
...
Hey ho on the run again
Drive is strong, onward
Stick and stones won't take his course
Sky got the part, in the front seat

It's the best of world's feeling, like nothing can go wrong
You're the decider of the world you'll get to know

Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
It's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
...
Hey ho on the road again
On the highway, on the highway
Hey ho on the road again
On the highway, on the highway

Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
...
And it's whistling,
And it's whistling,
And it's whistling
