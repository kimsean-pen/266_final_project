Forgiveness was never an option
Left fighting blind with half a chance
What did you expect?
What did you expect?
My intentions haunt me
The motive is clear
A hammer to break the bone

I am the monster you fear!

So savour every moment while you can

I am oblivion

Screaming out
Forgive and forget me
Inside you're begging for mercy
Now you are not the one calling the shots
When will you learn?

I clench my fists around your eyes
To finally realise
The dream is alive!
The dream is alive!
But you won't live to see it

Forgiveness was never an option
Left fighting blind with half a chance
What did you expect?
What did you expect?
My intentions may haunt me
The motive is clear
A hammer to break the bone

I am the monster you fear!

Restrained, try and point the blame
I'll savour this one, fear my name
Take one last look at me, the face of hatred

I clench my fists around your eyes
To finally realise
The dream is alive!
The dream is alive!
But you won't live to see it
