Weren't you there when the carousel burnt down?
The fire and confusion, the smoke and the sound
I swear you there when the carousel burnt down
We were all around

The rings charred and tarnished all over the ground
And our heads hung down
And we all left town
The next day

The children all cried when the carousel burnt down
The old ladies sighed as the carousel burnt down
The rest of us lied as the carousel burnt down
And the flames did fly

The pipes steamed and shrieked out a blazing goodbye
As the boiler died
And they melted down
The midway

And we all left town the next day
And we all left town the next day

And we all left town the next day
And we all left town the next day
And we all left town the next day
