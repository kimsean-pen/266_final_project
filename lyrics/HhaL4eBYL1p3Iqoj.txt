Guess I'm the bad boy now
Still the only one for you
You need me baby, want me but my
My loving leaves you turbine blue
Suppose I should just leave town
Now look who's talking who
I see you, when I see you darling
I see you when its overdue
Couldn't make up my mind till now
I said I've never screwed the crew
But I never felt so peaceful baby
Now I thought that is too true
I guess she's my raven now
And not the dove that I'm used to
But I need her and I want her cause our
Our loving leaves me turbine blue

Ask me if I want you
I skip for I want romance but
Ask you a stupid question
Gonna get a stupid answer
Cause I'm tryna tell you something true
I need you baby, want you cause
Your loving leaves me turbine blue
If you need me and I'm all messed out
Need me in a proof and through
And we're spinnin as you hit me baby
Cause you got me in the turbine blues
If you hit me and I'm screamin' out
Cause there's nothing left that I could do
Cause we're finished and I'm achin' darling
Now I'm rolling with these turbine blues

Guess I'm the bad boy now
Still the only one for you
You need me baby, want me but my
My loving leaves you turbine blue
I guess she's my raven now
Not the dove that I'm used to
But I need her and I want her cause her
Her loving leaves me turbine blue
Loving leaves me turbine blue
Her loving leaves me turbine blue
Loving leaves me turbine blue
Loving leaves me turbine blue
