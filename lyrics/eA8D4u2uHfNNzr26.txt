Fuck the voice of a generation
I just wanna be who I am
No one can change or guide me
I'm content with where I stand
So fuck the voice of a generation
You can stand on your own two feet
Hooligans from across the nation
Sing my songs when you mob the street

This is who we are, we are
A product of...
This is who we are, we are
A product of war

In the grain of our skin, we think this is it
Portrayed by a stigma that won't let us out
By choice it's a sin, if not I'm just dead
Alive isn't free when your lies cost me this

Smooth talker and a heartbreaker
But you are nothing but a cheap thinker
Buying them off for lower than you're worth

This is who we are
This is who we are
This is who we are
A product of war

I just wish that this itching I have
To be different somehow, would escape me
'Cause all these obstacles make it difficult
When you're just trying to change me

At least when we stand together
I'm not the only soul trapped in limbo
By this breed of prima donnas

Smooth talker and a heartbreaker
But you are nothing but a cheap thinker
Buying them off for lower than you're worth

This is who we are
This is who we are
This is who we are
A product of war

Why do they wanna make us conform?
Worship their words, I'll admit that I'm sold but
The fact that you consider yourself a god
Is the very reason you should fall the fuck off

Smooth talker and a heartbreaker
But you are nothing but a cheap thinker
Buying them off for lower than you're worth

This is who we are
A product of war
