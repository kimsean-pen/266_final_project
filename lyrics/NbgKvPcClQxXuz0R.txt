I'll sit here a while
I'm waiting lonely like a shadow in the night sky.
You sit here a while
And wait beside me 'till the next star rises.

I came and I saw
I saw the end of the world we know
You came and you saw
You'll disappear before the next star rises.

Out of time...
It changes so very easily
Changing over and again and again and again.

So you
You go feel the Son
I'll watch you knowing all your cheaters and liars.
