Been having bad times
And I've been paying dues
Got shoes and money
And good friends too

Always play to win
But always seem to lose
That's why I think I got
A rich kid's blues

That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues

And I know what is going on
And I know, but I'll wait til dawn
And I know just exactly what is on your mind
Jumping back, I know if I'm still gonna lose you

But I'm wondering why, girl
Did I ask your name?
And all the people standing by
Oh, they're in my game

Love's just a story
A story without words
Words are almost never seen
And never even heard

I know what is going on
And I know that I'll wait til dawn
And I know just exactly what is on your mind
Jumping back, I know it's all a rut, you want me to prove it to you

Though my good times
Are just paying dues
I've got shoes and money
And good friends too

Though I always play to win
I always seem to lose
That's why I think I got
A rich kid's blues

That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues

I know what's going on
I know what's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
