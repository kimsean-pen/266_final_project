Something these days in the air
I'm afraid to sing this song
'Cuz no one answers me
Got in the way of this one chance of mine
I throw it back
It wasn't gonna last
I jumped ahead
There was a slipstream
One good feeling there
I got out quick
Lower than I go
I'm a pinball
Sticking through alot
Then down the side wall
The drop
I must have been alone
In the mean time
Nothing comes my way
I'm proud to say
I crossed a line
I said goodbye
This state to recreate
Is the drain of time
I lead you on
There were no days to wait for
No carrying on
Life's still a disease
Help it along
It's a sure thing
Everyone I meet is a laughing star
Who dropped
You all ought to walk through a poster
You should see how things align
Change how you see a decline
See how high you really climb
The drop
