Cue to your face so forsaken
Crushed by the way that you cry
Cue to your face so forsaken
What a surprise!

You try to break the mould
Before you get too old
You try to break the mould
Before you die

Cue to your heart that is racin'
Stung by the look in your eye
Cue to your heart that is racin'
What a surprise!

You try to break the mould
Before you get too old
You try to break the mould
Before you die

Cue to your face so forsaken
Crushed by the way that you cry
Cue to your face so forsaken
Saying, "Goodbye"

Sing for your lover like blood from a stone
And sing for your lover who's waiting at home
If you sing when you're high and you're dry as a bone
Then you must realize that you're never alone
And you'll sing with the dead instead
Said, "You'll sing with the dead instead"

You try to break the mould

Then you must realize that you're never alone

Said, "You'll sing with the dead instead"
Instead
