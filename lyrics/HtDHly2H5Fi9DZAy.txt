Diving into worlds unknown
Drawn in by wondrous light
Off to solitary places
Stepping onto grounds so pure
Under endless skies
Desires for a long lost cure
Rise up inside (rise up inside)

Close your eyes
Create your space and time in here you know
Where you can draw the line
One with yourself
And no one else
And feel alive
Travelling in timeless spaces
With feet as light as air
Seeing the stranges places
Become a secret lair
Floating beyond gravity
No weight to hold you down
Come clarity
In waves of dreams you drown
Close your eyes
Create your space and time in here you know
Where you can draw the line
One with yourself
And no one else
And feel alive

Just close your eyes
Create your space and time in here you know
Where you can draw the line
One with yourself
And no one else
And feel alive
Close your eyes
Create your space and time in here you know
Where you can cross the line
One with yourself
And no one else
And feel alive
