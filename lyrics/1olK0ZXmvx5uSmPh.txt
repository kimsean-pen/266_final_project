You just walked out to the main street
I just walked into the edge of the bridge
you're not came to the our place
and my tears will came down
yeah I'm cried yeah I'm cried
I watched the way you ran away from me

Collapse my pride
please come into my bed
let's drifting away
Oh collapse my pride
please come into my bed
let's drifting away
let's drifting away

Try try try try try try
try to be your host
It's time time time time time time
you know well that what I want
hold tight tight tight tight tight tight
even more than I know you before
don't lie lie lie lie lie lie
we're suffering here
alone alone

I just walked out to the mountains
you just walked into the city sign
you're not came to the our place
and my tears will came down
yeah I'm cried, yeah I'm cried
I watched the way you ran away from me

Collapse my pride
please come into my bed
let's drifting away
Oh collapse my pride
please come into my bed
let's drifting away
let's drifting away

Try try try try try try
try to be your host
It's time time time time time time
you know well that what I want
hold tight tight tight tight tight tight
even more than I know you before

alone alone

Try try try try try try

It's time time time time time time
you know well that what I want
hold tight tight tight tight tight tight
even more than I know you before
don't lie lie lie lie lie lie
