the good thing about this cast,
is i can still hold a knife,
so if you ever twist my arm again i'll be sure to put up a fight
you see i just don't wanna do the things that you want me to do
but i'm a sucker, so i do them
because i am still in love with you

She said "Honey, you gotta learn that love is simple, just like mud.
If you play the dirt and I'll play the water, all we gotta do is touch."

Cuz i was young, i thought i didn't have to care about anything,
but i'm older now and know that i should

And it's freezing,
and i'm watching you shovel snow, off a driveway across from my parent's home.
now it's summer, and you were laying out on your lawn
You look so sexy Chelsea, with your polka dot bikini on.

C'mon Chelsea, speak a little french to me.
Heard you spent two whole semesters drinking wine.
While i was stuck in Jersey, trying to save some money.
I guess i'm just another thing you left behind.

But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
but you're older now and wish that you could.

Cuz you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
but you're older now and know that you should.

It's funny you should ask, cuz I don't remember.
It's funny you should ask, I coulda been a contender.

One two three, everyone say cheese.
Thought you got the best of me, turns out it was a video of me and my best friend, me and my cousins,
sitting there smiling, turns out it was a video.

But i was young, i thought i didn't have to care about anyone,
but i'm older now and know that i should

It's funny you should ask, cuz i don't remember.
It's funny you should ask, i coulda been a contender.
It's funny you should ask, no i will not surrender.
It's funny you should ask, cuz i don't remember.
