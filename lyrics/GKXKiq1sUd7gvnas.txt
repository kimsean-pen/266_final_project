've set sail in her eyes
Vapour trails reign tomorrow
I can't see another day without her
Failure rides on the line
Exhale sighs, chain Lazaro
I can't see another day without her

Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow
Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow

We collide in your eyes
Time defies our tomorrow
I can't see another day without her
Love on high, I surmise
Dante cries for us to follow
I can't see another day without her

Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow
Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow

Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow
Lost monument of sorrow
I can't find this lost monument tomorrow
