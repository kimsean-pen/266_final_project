A finite line that's hard to see
And it always moves away from me

I don't want to wait for everything
Waste away instead of vanishing
Time will die and love will bury it
Time will die and love will bury it

Aimless strives to try and reach this
Will not stir me from this sickness

Stay wondering
With this reckoning
Watch it go by, just to give in

The rush of waves
I'm flooded in the running
Drifting with this one constant

The wish to change is washed away
The outer bounds are out of reach
Is it true it's...
Everlasting?

Stay wondering
There's no place for peak

Everything I thought could be
Shouldn't be within my reach

It comes in waves
I long for it and I feel empty
I watch it go by and I feel nothing
Floating in hope
Persisting to glow
Give flight to this fever or don't

At fate's command
What could we become
When desire is all undone?

At fate's command
What could we become
When desire is all undone?
