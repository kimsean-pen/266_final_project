He was going
For hours
People
Crying showers
No one ever really
Telled how it is
I sang
About hopeless
Cause everyone
Knows it, knows it
And it was
So honest
Finally breathing
Some clean air
Been through it
And seen there
I put my star
To fame
Now the spotlight
Was faiding
He just kept
On playing
Play me a song
About heartache
I promise
I can sing
Every word
Play me a song
About love lost
