Oh God I'm going insane
Chasing after you
Please don't leave me
I see your heart watching away
Eh eh eeeeh
And that's how you left me in the cold

It's pitiful how you let me lose
You better run, better run
Your time is out
Nothing you can do
Better run better run

I can't remember
When you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn
Apocalypse is coming
I can't remember
When you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell
And Angels could be bad

Some say I'm losing my faith
But I know I'm just living on a prayer
Time keeps slipping away
Yeaaaaah
I'll watch you burn down
This house that we made

It's pitiful how you let me lose
You better run, better run
Your time is out
Nothing you can do
Better run better run

I can't remember
When you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn
Apocalypse is coming
I can't remember
When you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell
And angels could be bad

Oh God I'm going insane
But I know I'm just living on a prayer
I see your heart watching away
Eh eh eeeeh
And that's how you left me in the cold

Oh God I'm going insane
Chasing after you
Please don't leave me
I see your heart watching away
Eeeeh
Better run, better run

I can't remember
When you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn
Apocalypse is coming
I can't remember
When you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell
And angels could be bad
I can't remember
When you hurt me so bad
But now the tables turn
Apocalypse is coming
I can't remember
When you left me so sad
But in the end I learned it rains in hell
And angels could be bad.
