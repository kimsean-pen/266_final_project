As I lay dreamin' in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returnin' on the tide

And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Oh, my Grimsby
Oh, England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby

Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands, boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the skinners arms

No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the key

Oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Oh, my Grimsby
Oh, England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby

Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands, boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Grimsby, oh, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Oh, my Grimsby
Oh, England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby

Grimsby, oh, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Oh, my Grimsby
Oh, England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
