It's honest, I'm ticking those boxes
Make out like Speedy Gonzales
Finito, a lier
Iya iya think I'm on fire
Flawless, look at your faces
Two sides don't make me hate this
I'm on it, I call it, lier lier your words expire,

You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny only got so much for me
You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny can't help me no more
Hey now, hey now now, Sonny won't get me down
He aint' got my soul he ain't got my anything now now

Wall paint, crawling on elbows
I make you a little no-show
On tip-toes, behind, spin around around around and I'll find ya'
Forecast, this is a heatwave
I'll make you a banging headache
Controlling, so lonely
Lier lier jump in the fire,

And you can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny only got so much for me
You can hit me down Sonny
But Sonny can't help me no more
Hey now, hey now now, Sonny won't get me down
He aint' got my soul he ain't got my anything now now

Honest, I'm packing those boxes
Kicking you out like Speedy Gonzales
Finito, you lier
Iya iya your things are on fire
Flawless, sick of your faces,
Two sides don't make hate this,
I'm on it, I call it, might aswell make the mo-ost of it,
Did you ever think you'd see me,
Like this?...
Like this?...
Like this?

HEY

Like this?
