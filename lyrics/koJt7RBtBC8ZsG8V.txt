I want you to move to California for yourself
I want you to find whatever your heart needs
I want you to move to California for yourself
But not for me

I want you to go out there and find somebody else
I want him to treat you like I know he should
I want you to find somebody new for yourself
If not for me

All of the feelings that I know you've never felt
And all of the simple words you never said
I want you to keep them like a secret to yourself
They're not for me

I want you to wander silent past my outstretched arms
I want you to hide yourself from all I see
And though my heart will fight until its dying breath
You're not for me

I want you to move to California for yourself
I want you to find whatever your heart needs
I want you to move to California for yourself
But not for me
