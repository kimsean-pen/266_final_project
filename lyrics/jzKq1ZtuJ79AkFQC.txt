I used to dream I was a poster in a bedroom
Or the pictures that get cut out of the fancy magazines
Some tortured genius went to leave the planet too soon
Livin' on champagne in the back of limousines

Tryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why
Tryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies

Tradin' where I'm at for some future destination
Workin' for attention I'll eventually resent
Tyrin' to ignore some of the darker implications
Of smilin' for the camera with my hands in wet cement

Tryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why
Tryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies
Tryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why
Tryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies

There's someone in my reflection that's been hauntin' me my whole life
There's a world outside my window I can barely even hear
And I wonder to myself as I am straightenin' my bowtie
How could I look so perfect on the screen and so awful in the mirror?

Tryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why
Tryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies
Tryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why
Tryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies
Hopin' that it dies
Hopin' that it dies
Hopin' that it dies
