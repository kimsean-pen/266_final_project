We've all been robbed by someone
But Steve got robbed twice in one night

I haven't died yet, I'll be alright and
I'll be a little bit behind paying my rent
I haven't died yet, I'll be alright and
I'll be a little bit behind paying my rent

We've all been robbed by someone
But Steve got robbed twice in one night
Out at a show in San Francisco
Steve got robbed, it was a San Fran shit-show
Steve got robbed walking home from West Brooklyn
Back station with the tombstone

We're getting stole from at every second
But they won't ever like to steal what's most important
So put your hands up and make a fuck sign
And point it at the bureaucrats who wanna control your life

I haven't died yet, I'll be alright and
I'll be a little bit behind paying my rent
I haven't died yet, I'll be alright and
I'll be a little bit behind paying my rent

Out at a show in San Francisco
Steve got robbed, it was a San Fran shit-show
Steve got robbed walking home from West Brooklyn
Back station with the tombstone
Out at a show in San Francisco
Steve got robbed, it was a San Fran shit-show
Steve got robbed walking home from West Brooklyn
Back station with the tombstone

We've all been robbed by someone
But Steve got robbed twice in one night
(We got motherfuckin' robbed, we got motherfuckin' robbed)
We've all been robbed by someone
But Steve got robbed twice in one night
We've all been robbed
(We got motherfuckin' robbed, we got motherfuckin' robbed)
We've all been robbed
We've all been robbed
We've all been robbed
Jesus Christ, I'm really fucking blown
I think they got my social security from my phone
Jesus Christ, I'm really fucking blown
I think they got my social security from my phone
