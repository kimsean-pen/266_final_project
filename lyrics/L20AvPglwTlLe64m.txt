You say you'll wait for something better
You're gonna rest for a while
I bet you'd bet it all to get her
All the world for a bitter smile

If you're staying I should leave
Get my things and I'll be gone tomorrow
If you're leaving I will stay
Thank-you for the heart you let me borrow

What did I ever say to send you
What have I ever done but love you
I wonder what I'll do without you

She'll never make you a believer
I hope you're saving all your tears
You've gotta have so much to keep her
Cry a river in a hundred years

If you're staying I should leave
Get my things and I'll be gone tomorrow
If you're leaving I will stay
Thank-you for the heart you let me borrow

What did I ever say to send you
What have I ever done but love you
I wonder what I'll do without you

If you're leaving I will stay
Thank-you for the heart you let me borrow

What did I ever say to send you
What have I ever done but love you
I wonder what I'll do without you

I'll never make you my believer
I'll never hear you say the words

If you're staying I should go
Get my things and I'll be gone tomorrow
If you're leaving go before I stay
Thank-you for the heart you let me borrow
