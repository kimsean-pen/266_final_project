Aly, walk with me in the summer
Aly, walk with me
Aly, walk with me in Portland
Aly, walk with me

Aly walks with me in my dreams
So strange and true
Can I walk with you in Portland
Walk next to you?

Aly, walk with me in New York City
Aly, walk with me
Aly, walk with me in the summer
Aly, walk with me

Aly, walk right out of my dreams
Into my arms
Aly, walk with me in the city
Aly, walk with me

Aly, step right out of my head
And kiss me goodnight
Aly, walk with me in my dreams
All through the night
