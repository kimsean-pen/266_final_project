Da da da da da da da da da da
Another song about getting drunk
I know you've heard it all before but honey loosen up
Roundabouts and ups and downs
Yea, we've all been on a journey but we're here right now

It's too late for conversation
My mind is on vacation
I've been counting seconds to the weekend (weekend)
Cheap wine in public places
Good friends and bad locations
Tell me what do you want

So tonight, lets get high
Pass that joint and kill that vibe
We might laugh, we might cry
Middle fingers to the sky
Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this
I don't even know how many girls I've kissed
Tonight, lets get high
Middle fingers to the sky
We'll be fine

Da da da da da da da da da da
Golden days may have changed
But the boys down in the valley always stay the same
Another line to pass the time
We've been singing here for hours now it's closing time

Now lets wake up and make that money
Laugh hard when shit ain't funny
Gotta miss the days when we were younger
You feel the way I'm feeling
Glasses up to the ceiling
We're gonna be alright

So tonight, lets get high
Pass that joint and kill that vibe
We might laugh, we might cry
Middle fingers to the sky
Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this
I don't even know how many girls I've kissed
Tonight, lets get high
Middle fingers to the sky
We'll be fine

We never know what we got til it's gone
Nights looking crazy but that makes us strong
Tell me you love me
I'll tell you you're wrong
Ladies, fellas, let me hear you sing along
Da da da da da da da da da da (woo there we go)
Da da da da da da da da da da

So tonight, lets get high
Pass that joint and kill that vibe
We might laugh, we might cry
Middle fingers to the sky
Oh, I don't even know if I've had nights like this
I don't even know how many girls I've kissed
Tonight, ... I don't even know if I've had nights like this
I don't even know how many girls I've kissed
Tonight, let's get high
Middle fingers to the sky
We'll be fine

Da da da da da da da da da da (we'll be fine)
Da da da da da da da da da da
