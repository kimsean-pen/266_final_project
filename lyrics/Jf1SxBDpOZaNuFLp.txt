Run, run like you do
I'm chasin' you
I'm on your tail
I'm gaining fast
You're going nowhere

Try, to fix what you've done
Turn back the sun
The night is calling and we're falling faster now

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

Stop
Tell me the truth
'Cause I'm so confused
Spinnin' round, these walls are fallin' down and I need you
More than you know
I'm not letting go
I'm getting close, so take my hand
And please just tell me why

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away

You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

(Ooah)

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push-push
Pushin' me away
Pushin' me away
