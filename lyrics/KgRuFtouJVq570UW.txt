I was swallowed
Taken in the dead of the night
If only it was just a dream
And not a ghost coming for me

Pathetic feeble creature
Divert your wandering eyes
The cosmos lay their judgement
We study from the sky

Dissection
Oppression
Nothing more than a futile observation
Infect them
Erase them
A lesser life you could never expect no less from

Dissection
Oppression
Infect them
Erase them
A lesser life you could never expect no less from

We reign from the dark realm
To send your souls straight to hell

Dissection
Oppression
Nothing more than a futile observation
Infect them
Erase them
A lesser life you could never expect no less from

Dissection
Oppression
Infect them
Erase them
A lesser life you could never expect no less from

You were warned, but nobody listened
