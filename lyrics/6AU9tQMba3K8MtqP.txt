It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
I've cried so much since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I sit and cry just like a child
My pouring tears are runnin' wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh yes, in my own tears

I know it's true, mm hmm, into each life
Oh, some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue here without you
It keeps a-raining more and more

Why can't you come on home
Oh yes so I won't be all alone
If you don't think you'll be home soon

I guess I'll (drown in my own tears)
Oh, don't let me (drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby (drown in my own tears)
Oh let me in, don't let me (drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Woh, mmmmm
