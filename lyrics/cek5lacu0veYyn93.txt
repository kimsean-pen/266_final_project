Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain in waves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Be perfusion, search the waters

Last oasis
It's like a fresh flower in the
Necropolis
A lonely discoverer covers the world
Last oasis
Floating like a lost astronaut
Pack the jeep on
We have nowhere to go

Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain in waves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Be perfusion, search the waters

Last oasis
The whisperer of
Rara avis
Shedding your feathers one at a time
Last oasis
Whirlpools in the desert sands
[?] now
In the prison, trapped in their hole

Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain in waves
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain in waves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Be perfusion, search the waters
Optical illusion, [?]
To be [?]

Last oasis
Like a flag beating in the wind
World has wasted and
Last oasis
Shines a beacon like a lighthouse
Over lonely
Countries of death like a black sea
