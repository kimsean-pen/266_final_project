Shout-out my mucus, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause you know that be my slime
Shout-out my mucus
That nigga, that be my slime
That nigga, that be my slime sli-sli-slime sli-sli-slime slime
Okay, what, watch this pussy, ayy ayy, okay

Naruto nine-tailed fox coat fur
I feel like a Gucci ad lib, burr
Colder than Coca-Cola mascot, polar bear
Put my sauce on lasagna it could make Garfield purr
I ain't really fuckin' with these niggas like a dyke
You Kellogg's tiger I tell 'em earn yo stripes
You tryna be me but bitch could never in your life
Even if you had on my sneakers like Bow Wow in Like Mike
Like Gotti nigga, watch me be disgusting
I'ma do 'em dirty like a ringworm
Why they be talking like they might know something
I'm Madagascar, I'm royalty like lemur king
Told her be careful, my penis drive like limousine
And I don't want any pussy if you just smell like Hennessy
Star Wars confederate rifle shoot like ray-beam
Watch me spin around 360 quick scope or something

Ayy, yuh, ayy, water!
Ayy ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy
It's Doktor Avalanche
(Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it!)

Diamonds on me fatter than Peter Griffin's big stomach
Stove on me too, uh-huh, old news, uh-huh
Cook a nigga, uh-huh, like stew
They say my flow that gas might burp, excuse you, uh-huh
Where I'm going, oh, I think your bitch plumes
Excuse me don't fumble it
Drive where yo mama live
She gon' stumble on my dick like Jack and Jill on the hill
White on me Jonah Hill
Heard of my gang and them
I'ma beat that pussy till it's black as Ms. Lauryn Hill
That's all folks, uh-huh
Looney Tunes, uh-huh
Mink fur pink like the ass on baboon
