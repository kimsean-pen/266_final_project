Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane on that
fast train and our last name should be the exact same
Girl I promise this the last claim that I'll make
I been tryna get it but it's kinda difficult
because the attitude you give me is a little typical
Your body language is becoming invisible and my physical is
sick of all these pitiful attempts to fit the syllables (shit)
The way I get it is irrelevant,
cause its a definite that either way I'm gonna benefit
Cause when I'm in my element I'm never hesitant
cause I'm a specialist with some evidence that I'm elegant
Niggas always hating and they ladies want a piece of me
Other niggas love me and tell me they wanna feature me
300 for a 30 second verse, I do it easily
If you ain't tryna fuck, go get some money, do not speak to me
Cause recently, I been on a whole new frequency
And frequently I been doin' a bunch of shit illegally
Like smoking 7 doobies and doing it all repeatedly
So baby if you wanna come along and take a seat with me
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane on that
fast train and our last name should be the exact same
Girl I promise this the last claim that I'll make
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane on that
fast train and our last name should be the exact same
Girl I promise this the last claim that I'll make
Girl, you already know that I been tryna get it
Everybody want it, I'm gon' try and get it
Baby I don't even love you, tell me why I'm trippin'
I just want you to be the Lois to my Peter Griffin
You wanted to fall in love, I wanted to hit it
But it's a given that I say, cause we constantly kissin'
But when you laugh it's not the same, I been on a mission
To find somethin' the same to the days we missin' (shit)
When everybody lookin' at you in public
You supposed to be humble and act like its nothin'
Takin' pictures with fans, man, I never had that
Now I'm just that ugly nigga givin' bitches autographs
Now you wanna be friends, fuck all that
'member when I rang freshman year and you ain't call back
Now you on Snapchat, ask to lick my ballsack,
acting like these young black bats are for the fall back
Fuck no, baby I'm just tryna' do it
I ain't talkin' bout the sexual, I'm talkin' 'bout the music
Imma do it till I die or till I'm limpin' in the Buick
Imma do it for my gatas and I'm workin' with the Jewish
Holy fuckin' shit my life is changing for the better
Imma rap until I make a billion dollars all together
But for now everybody lookin' at me, I feel the pressure
However, that shit is just another endeavor
In the mean time, all my old relationships is severed
Including that one girl, even though I wanted to get her
Even though I'll never tell her,
even though I never told her that I love
her whatsoever, even though I'm feeling better
I'm getting high, now I'm focused with no distractions
Now I'm making music, trying to make transactions
Focus on my expansions,
so I can get a mansion,
the old girl will always be my main attraction
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane on that
fast train and our last name should be the exact same
Girl I promise this the last claim that I'll make
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane on that
fast train and our last name should be the exact same
Girl I promise this the last claim that I'll make
