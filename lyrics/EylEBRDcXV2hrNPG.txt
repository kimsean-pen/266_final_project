Help, is on the way,
Spy your victim,
Touch this stance.
Oh help, is fallen free.
For the beast unloving whisper,
Did you think that hes it?
Now, through telescopes, carry a gate released keeper.
Change, surround the hope.
Every leaf of balances says, did you think that hes it?
You be the eyes, I'll be the whisper.
This kids got lies, Half have helped to treasure.
You be the eyes, I'll be the whisper.
This kids got lies, Half have helped to treasure.
You be the eyes, I'll be the whisper.
This kids got lies, Half have helped to treasure.
You be the eyes, I'll be the whisper.
This kids got lies, Half have helped to treasure.
