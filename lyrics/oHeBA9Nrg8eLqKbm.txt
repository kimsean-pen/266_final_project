Hop on the private, say hi to my pilot
Black out until we touch down
Champagne and xannys, you can't catch me
I was made for this, you can't tell me shit

'Cause it's been three weeks and four days
No days off, just runways
I'm fucked up, I'll throw shit
I'll work you on a bad day
Pay dues 'cause it's your biz
You can shake my focus
The one thing I know is that I can't stop now

On a mission, got no competition
It's hard to sleep with brunette ambition
Revenge is sweet, pussy my religion
They say slow down, but I never listen

Old me forsaken, these rules are for breaking
I get lonely with no new friends
Associated, but they can't relate
When you want the world, they're uncomfortable

Now it's been three weeks and four days
No days off, just runways

I'm fucked up, I'll throw shit
I'll work you on a bad day
Pay dues 'cause it's your biz
You can shake my focus
The one thing I know is that I can't stop now

On a mission, got no competition
It's hard to sleep with brunette ambition
Revenge is sweet, pussy my religion
They say slow down, but I never listen

Take another stage, shut it down, we, we did
Humble is a pain, but a beast worth feeding
Take another stage, shut it down, we, we did
Humble is a pain, but a beast worth feeding

On a mission, got no competition
It's hard to sleep with brunette ambition
Revenge is sweet, pussy my religion
They say slow down, but I never listen

Take another stage, shut it down, we, we did
Humble is a pain, but a beast worth feeding
Take another stage, shut it down, we, we did
Humble is a pain, but a beast worth feeding
