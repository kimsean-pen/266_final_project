I'm suffocated with desire
I need to save me from myself
I ache for great experience
There's a riot in my senses

Time, space and hurt and tears are not enough, mmm aaa
Love, light and faith and words are not enough
I'm not happy
Drunk 'til I'm drunken
'Til you take all of me

You put me to the test and I understand
There's more and more and more to know
Don't take me half way
(Half way)
Don't take me half way
I won't be contented that way

Time, space and hurt and tears are not enough
Love, light and faith and words are not enough

Time flies like my love for you, and space grows like my envy for you
(Time, space and hurt and tears are not enough)
Hurt comes like my pain for you, and tears pour like my lust for you
Love lies like my hope for you, and light falls like my armour for you
(Love, light and faith and words are not enough)
Faith stays like my care for you, and words wait like my crave for you

I'm not happy
(Drunk 'til I'm drunken)
'Til you take all of me
(All of me)
I'm not happy
(Waste 'til I'm wasted)
'Til you take all of me
(All of me)
I'm not happy
Drunk 'til I'm drunken
'Til you take all of me
I'm not happy
Waste 'til I'm wasted
'Til you take all of me
Time and space and hurt and tears
And love, light, faith and words are not enough
Time, space and hurt and tears
And love, light, faith and words are not enough

Time flies like my love for you, and space grows like my envy for you
Hurt comes like my pain for you, and tears pour like my lust for you
Love lies like my hope for you, and light falls like my armour for you
Faith stays like my care for you, and words wait like my crave for you
