Hey girls, gather round
Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man

I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

If your broken heart should need repair
Then I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come runnin' to me

Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy twenty-four hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

Come, come, come, come, come, come, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come, come, come, come, come, come
Oh now, they'll come runnin' to me

Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy twenty-four hours a day
I fix broken hearts, baby, I'm your handy man

Come, come, come, come, come, come, come
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's me
Come, come, come, come, come, come
I'm your handy man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's me
Come, come, come, come, come, come
I'm your handy man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
