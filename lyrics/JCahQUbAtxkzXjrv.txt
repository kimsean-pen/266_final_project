Imagine you were at my station and you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!

We were shifting hard when we took off put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels too slow
Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!

I'm giving you my room service and you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love
Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life, fuck yeah!
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!

Yeah!
