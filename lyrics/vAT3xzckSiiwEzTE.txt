Then between 13 and 17
I'd dreamed of all the things I'd be and how
I'd see you all from high on a mountain and know I could take it.

Then between 19 and 21
I knew one day that I'd become someone
And I'd stand up in front of a crowd and feel them adore me.

Then from 24 to 25
A girl I liked became my wife I tried,
it was harder than I'd ever imagined to keep all my dreams alive.

Then from 28 to 33
A new responsibility, a child.
And I worked hard to give her a home, to love and to shelter her.

Then from 44 to 48
I knew I'd left it far too late for sure.
To climb up the mountain 'cause time's always running away from me.
