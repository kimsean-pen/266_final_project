Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather, baby
Me and my girl just ain't together no more
And it seems like it's raining all the time
Yes, all the time

Life is bare
And there's misery everywhere
Stormy weather, baby
Me and my girl just ain't together no more
And it seems like it's raining all the time
Yes, all the time

Since you've been away
I said the rocking chair's gonna get me
Last night how I prayed
I said "Lord, won't you let me"
Last night how I prayed
I said "Lord, won't you let me
Walk in the sun once more"

I can't go on
Since my baby's gone
Stormy weather, children
Me and my girl just ain't together no more
And it seems like it's raining all the time
Yes, all the time

Seems like it's raining all the time
Yes, all the time
Seems like it's raining all the time
Yes, all the time
