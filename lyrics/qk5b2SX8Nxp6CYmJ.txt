Love comes and love goes

Love is as love does so
Don't ask for too much

Love is as love was before so u know

All the universe is looking out for the love
But you gotta first, find yourself to love someone else

And love can get ugly
I trust you, you trust me
And love can be trust free
Don't sit back and let it pass you by

So love me, I'll love you
