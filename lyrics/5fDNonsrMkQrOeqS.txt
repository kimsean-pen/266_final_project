Attempt to claim my life
I'll shatter your bones
And to your widowed wife I'll serve your remains
Wallowing in spite
My inner turmoil comes to life

Cultivating deprivation
Vicious mental separation
Cultivating deprivation
Vicious world of tortured souls

They'll fear me in the afterlife
I'm calling their names
I will haunt you endlessly (haunt you endlessly)
They'll fear me in the afterlife
I will haunt you endlessly

Now I will bury your name
And to it all that binds
Inside the darkest cave
I'll burn your remains
You will be erased

I never thought you'd dare to take what is mine
My inner turmoil, it comes to life

They'll fear me in the afterlife
I'm calling their names
I will haunt you endlessly
They'll fear me in the afterlife
I will haunt you endlessly

My inner turmoil comes to life
I'll shatter your bones
