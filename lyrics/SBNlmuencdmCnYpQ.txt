You've been with me all along, all along
Always on my side, you've never gone
You've been with me all along
And you've been holding on, holding on for so long
When others would be gone, you stayed with me all along

You've been with me when I laugh or cry
Anywhere I stood, you'd be standing by
With me when I'm fine, with me when I'm not
With me when I'm giving everything I got

With me all along, not a cameo
Every scene, every episode, in every video
Skip no scenario, there anywhere we go

You've been with me all along, all along
Always on my side, you've never gone
You've been with me all along
And you've been holding on, holding on for so long
When others would be gone, you stayed with me all along

You're still with me and I hope you stay
We've come a long way since the early days
Always had a spot in the escapades, and a suitcase for the getaway

And all along you were always down
Showed up and would hang around
Singing loud, standing out in every crowd
And you're still here now

You've been with me all along, all along
Always on my side, you've never gone
You've been with me all along
And you've been holding on, holding on for so long
When others would be gone, you stayed with me all along

They're not all like you, no
Some blow away in a fairweather gust
Disappear in a cloud of dust
Leave you in the rain to rust, betraying your trust
Say you're pretty good, but not good enough
The ones you thought you knew well
But I guess not well enough

But that's not you, that's not you
You never put me in the rearview
I wouldn't be the same without you

So I thank you, I thank you
You never put me in the rearview
And I wouldn't be the same without you

You've been with me all along, all along
Always on my side, you've never gone
You've been with me all along
And you've been holding on, holding on for so long
When others would be gone, you stayed with me all along.
