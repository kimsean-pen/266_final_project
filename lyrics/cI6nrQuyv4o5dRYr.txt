I, I never thought I'd be
Lost inside your eyes
Living out this fantasy
But now, with every breath we take
All I think about
Is the love we're gonna make

I want you
Boy, forever and a night
(Forever and a night)
For all of my life
(All of my life)
I just wanna hold you tight
From now on (for)
Until the morning light
(Until the morning light)
All I wanna do
Is be with you baby
Forever and a night

(I, I, Until the morning light
Gonna love you
Forever and a night)

In a world that moves so fast
It's so hard to find
Something that you know will last
But
When you touch me there's no doubt
That you and I possess
The one thing that it's all about

I want you
Boy, forever and a night
(Forever and a night)
For all of my life
(All of my life)
I just wanna hold you tight
From now on (for)
Until the morning light
(Until the morning light)
All I wanna do
Is be with you baby
Forever and a night

Oooh

But now, with every breath we take
All I think about
Is the love we're gonna make

I want you
Boy, forever and a night
(Forever and a night)
For all of my life
(All of my life)
I just wanna hold you tight
From now on (for)
Until the morning light
(Until the morning light)
All I wanna do
Is be with you baby
Forever and a night

I want you
Boy, forever and a night
(Forever and a night)
For all of my life
(All of my life)
I just wanna hold you tight
From now on (for)
Until the morning light
(Until the morning light)
All I wanna do
Is be with you baby
Forever and a night
