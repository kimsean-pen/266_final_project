I wrote all night
Like the fire of my words could burn a hole up to heaven
I don't write all night burning holes up to heaven no more
I stood out in the rain
Like the rain might come and wash my eyes clean
I don't stand out in the rain to have my eyes washed clean no more

C'est la vie, she say
But I don't know what she means
I say: Love, easy, hey come to me
C'est la vie, she say
But I don't know what that means
I say: alright, well c'est la vie

I stood out in the night, in an empty field and I called your name
I don't stand out all night in empty fields
And call your name no more
I waited for days for your voice to answer to me
I don't wait up for days for your voice to answer to me no more

C'est la vie, they say
But I don't know what they mean
I say: love's easy if you let it be
C'est la vie, they say
But I don't know what that means
I say: alright, well, c'est la vie
I say: alright, honey, c'est la vie
Ain't that just how it goes, honey
C'est la vie
