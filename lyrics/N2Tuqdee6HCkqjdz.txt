n Los Angeles there's a sign of my final ties
I gave it up for my
Dreams of grandeur unmarried life, this life.

And then I heard again
The preaching voice of reason and fear
Saying "what you did, my dear
Was try to make it out here alive, alive"

Oh, so hard, just let it go, I'm tired of wasting my mind
Oh, so hard, just let it go, I really need to find.

If nature made us that way
Will nature ever start to cry?
Did nature really make us that way?
Does nature ever say goodbye?

Because in America
I get lost in the shuffle and grind
I feel there is no time
To enjoy my single wavering life, this life

And what's the point again?
When we're running in circles and squares
I feel the yearn for air
And dropping all my arrogant cares, my arrogant cares

Oh, so hard, just let it go, I'm tired of wasting my mind
Oh, so hard, just let it go, I really need to find.

If nature made us that way
Will nature ever start to cry?
Did nature really make us that way?
Does nature ever say goodbye?
Did nature really make us that way?

If nature made us that way
Will nature ever start to cry?
Did nature really make us that way?
Does nature ever say goodbye?

Did nature make us that way?
Does nature know this pain of mine?
Did nature make us that way?
Does nature even care tonight?

Tonight, tonight.
