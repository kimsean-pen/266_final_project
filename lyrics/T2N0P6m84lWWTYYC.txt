Well, I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
And I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct

Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
And I'm dreamin'
Stressin' is an instinct

Now
I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh, now
Is making all of my teeth sore

Safe travel
Walk into another
Well, I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct

My partner
Is a clever lover
He told me
Stressin' is an instinct

Now
I'm biting down with my jaw
Oh, now
It's making all my teeth sore

Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
I'm feeling
Stressin' is an instinct

Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
I'm dreaming
Stressin' is an instinct
