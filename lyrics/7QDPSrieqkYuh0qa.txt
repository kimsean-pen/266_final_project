They are standing in front of me
Like it was before
In a sunny day
I can't go back there

I am here and I remember
I am here and I can't forget
Time doesn't pass, while people pass

Childhood was a paradise
Our garden was full of bliss
There's no way back
Someone is missed

I am here and I remember
And I wonder why that is
Time doesn't pass, while people pass
Someone is missed

I am here and I remember
I am here and I can't forget
I am here and I remember
And I wonder why that is
Someone is missed
