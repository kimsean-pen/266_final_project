Who needs remote control
From the civic hall
Push a button
Activate
You gotta work an' you're late

It's so grey in london town
With a panda car crawling around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?

Can't make a noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here

Big business it don't like you
It don't like the things you do
You got no money
So you got no power
They think you're useless
An' so you are - puuuuuuunnnnnk!

They had a meeting in mayfair
They got you down an'
They wanna keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
And you don't count

Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead

Look out' those rules and regulations

Who needs the parliament
Sitting making laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuing for the house of lords

Repression - gonna start on tuesday
Repression - gonna be a dalek
Repression - I am a robot
Repression - I obey
