Husband don't know what he's done
Kids don't know what's wrong with mum
She can't say, they can't see,
Putting it down to another bad day
Daddy don't know what he's done
Kids don't know what's wrong with mum

So this is how it feels to be lonely
This is how it feels to be small
This is how it feels when your word means nothing at all

Black car drives through the town,
Some guy from the top estate
Left a note for a local girl,
And yet he had it all on a plate

So this is how it feels to be lonely
This is how it feels to be small
This is how it feels when your word means nothing at all

Husband don't know what he's done
Kids don't know what's wrong with mum
She can't say, they can't see,
Putting it down to another bad day

So this is how it feels to be lonely
This is how it feels to be small
This is how it feels when your word means nothing at all

So this is how it feels to be lonely
This is how it feels to be small
This is how it feels when your word means nothing at all
