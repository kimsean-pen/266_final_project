July Flame
Firey kind
Will always
Lead me through the night

July Flame
Sweet summer peace
High up in the breath
Just out of my reach

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

July Flame
I'm seeing fireworks
They're so beautiful
Tell me why it hurts
July Flame
Ashes of a secret heart
Falling in my lemonade
Unsinkable thirsting in the backyard

Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

Repeat
