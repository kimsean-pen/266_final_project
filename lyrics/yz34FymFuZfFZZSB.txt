When I go I don't know when
I'll be coming back again
Leaving the past behind my stride
In this way I will abide

They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
You know I got to keep movin' on

I don't let these chains down low
Keep me from getting too heavy to go
When I feel that tug come from within
You know I got to be movin' on

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, they call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
You know I got to be ramblin' on

They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
You know I got to be ramblin' on
