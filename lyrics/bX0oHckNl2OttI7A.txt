Wake up, get paid
'Nother dollar, 'nother day

Go and throw it all away
On Cartier
Creme de la creme

Put my faith in the fun
It's a ritual I live
Tonic and gin

I've been seeing saints holding hands
And my God is trans

And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue
Not what I've been told

Cross my heart and hope to die
Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté

But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say

'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

And I'm not sure
Of anything but couture
And you can say "c'est la amour"

What I live for
It's all first class
When I'm burning through the cash

When the jet starts to crash
Beautiful trash
I've been seeing saints holding hands

And my God is trans
And everyone feels alive
And I like to do what's in Vogue

Not what I've been told
Cross my heart and hope to die

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté

But I don't wanna go through the motions

Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say

'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions

It's all Chanel, go straight to hell
I wish you well, I kiss and tell
My soul to sell 'cause I don't wanna go through the motions

Yves Saint Laurent, do what you want
Light cigarettes and restaurants
I preach it wrong
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions

Maybe I overcompensate
Call it my naïveté

But I don't wanna go through the motions
Maybe I put it on display
Say some things I shouldn't say
'Cause I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
I don't wanna go through the motions
