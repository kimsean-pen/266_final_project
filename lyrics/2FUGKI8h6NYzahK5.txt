I'm so sorry to hear about the news, don't you worry
I'll buy us a bottle and we'll drink in the petrol fumes
I'm so sorry to hear about your world, don't you worry
There's a gap in the fence down by the nature reserve

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one

I'm so sorry to hear the news today, don't you worry
There's been a speeding disaster so we'll go to the motorway
I'm so sorry to hear about the scene, don't you worry
Just put on your trainers and get out of it with me

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one
Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lorries in the litter with my lovely one

We could go dancing, we could go walking
We could go shopping, we could keep talking
We could go drinking, we could sit thinking
We could go speeding or we could go dreaming, see?

Oh hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one
Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lorries in the litter with my little one

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one
Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lorries in the litter with my little one

Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one
Hey, such a lovely day, such a lovely day
Such a fun, looking at the lorries in the litter with my little one
