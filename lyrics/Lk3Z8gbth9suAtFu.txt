Here's a little song you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new yeah
Make your own words up if you want to
Any old words that you think will do, well yeah

I'm telling you truly, yeah

Yellow blue, what'll I do?
Maybe I'll just sit here thinkin'
Black white, stop the fight
Does one of these colours ever bother you, yeah

Here's a little dance you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own steps up if you want to
Any old steps that you think will do, yeah yeah

Welcome

Left right, don't get uptight
Keep in line and you'll be alright
Clap hands move around
And make sure no one puts you down, yeah

Right down to the ground
You got to get up yeah

Here's a little world you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own life up if you want to
Any old life that you think will do

Love yeah, it's nothing new
There's someone much worse off than you are
Help me set them free
Just be what you want to be
What you want to be yeah

Here's a little song you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own words up if you want to
Any old words that you think will do

Yeah that's [Incomprehensible] to and fro
Oh, it's such fun
