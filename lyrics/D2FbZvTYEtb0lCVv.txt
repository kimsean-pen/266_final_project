Come inside, I'll take your coat

Leave your broken outside, I'll close the door
I know that it's hard to do, being you
It's a lonely road so let me bring you home
Don't look back

Don't you ever give your heartache away
'Cos I got you baby, you can give it all to me
And I'll hold it safely
You know you can count on me

So close your eyes, dive, let go of it all
Believe you will survive, let love break the fall
I won't let go, I won't let go, no
If I'm just here to give you love

Then that's what I'm here to do, to do
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
Don't tell me what I could lose
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool

If I'm loving you
Tonight we can take it slow
You need a shoulder to cry on, let me know
Whatever I gotta do, I'll pull you through it

It's a lonely road but I can bring you home (I can bring you home)
Don't look back, don't you ever give your heartache away
'Cos I got you baby, you can give it all to me
And I'll hold it safely, you know you can count on me

So close your eyes, dive, let go of it all
Believe you will survive, let love break the fall
I won't let go, I won't let go, no
If I'm just here to give you love

Then that's what I'm here to do, to do
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
Don't tell me what I could lose
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool

If I'm loving you, loving you
Think of nothing darling
Lay down your head, I've got it
For all the things you've done I'll pay you back with love

And don't you worry about the pressure
'Cos I can make it better
Lean on my love
Let me take away your pain

So close your eyes, dive, let go of it all
Believe you will survive, let love break the fall
I won't let go, I won't let go, no
If I'm just here to give you love
Then that's what I'm here to do to do
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
Don't tell me what I could lose
If I'm loving you better that's cool, cool
If I'm loving you, loving you
