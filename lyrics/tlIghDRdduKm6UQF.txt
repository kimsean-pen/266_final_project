Didn't know what I wanted
I'll admit that
Still don't know what I'm wanting
I'll be honest, I'm not ready to let you go, no

I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
Oh why did I say goodbye?

I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to

Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to

Until I don't need you
Ain't no way I could toss it
I'll admit that
But that don't mean that I needa keep you wrapped around my wrist, oh no, no

I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more

Oh why did I say goodbye?
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to

Until I don't need you

And another day is passing by
Oh I still need you
Oh I still need you
And another day is passing by
Oh I still need you

Oh I still need you
All of these Melatonin tears I cry
Oh I still need you
Oh I still need you
Oh I still need you

I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet

I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it

I used to have you, now I have this bracelet

I let you go but baby I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you, oh
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time

I wake up missing you more, oh (What if I'm missing you?)
Just missing you more
Oh why did I say goodbye?
B-bye, bye, bye, bye, bye bye
B-bye, bye, bye, bye
Did I say goodbye?
B-bye, bye, bye, bye, bye bye
Missing you more, oh I
