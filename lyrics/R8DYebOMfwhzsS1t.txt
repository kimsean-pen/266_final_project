When you walked into my lonely life tonight
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight
And the moment I held you I knew it
What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

In my heart I feel I've loved you all my life
I was in the dark, but now I think I've seen the light
I rang like a bell with your laughter
Something tells me I'll love you forever and ever

Fate, this could only be
Fate, this could only be
Whose fate, this could only be
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

I was meant to be your woman, fate
This could only be, fate
I never thought I'd believe in, fate
Now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman, fate

This could only be, fate
I never thought I'd believe in, fate
Now I understand
It's part of the
I was meant to be your
I was meant to be your woman, fate
this could only be, fate
It's part of the plan, fate
