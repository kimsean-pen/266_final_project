Falling to the ground,
I was anxious to be found
You can always go home
to the safety of your cloud

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I am so broke
and Foolishly in love

I turned around to love revealing,
What did I learn? It's not that easy,
When you get burned and go on burning loud.

Falling into sound
is that less defeating path
One day we will go home
To the safety of our clouds

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I'm so broke
and foolishly in love

I turned around, my life was changing
What did I learn? Its not that easy,
when you get burned and go on burning light.

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I'm so broke
and foolishly in love
I turned around, my life was changing
What did I learn?
Its not that easy when you get burned, and go on burning light.
