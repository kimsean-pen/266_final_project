This is the age of descent
The fresh faced generation of defect
It's gotta come down before we reach for the reset
This is for the lost, downtrodden and rejects
And anybody looking for a purpose
We all kick our way through streets of grey
Some find hope in a TV screen
But nobody has an answer for anything
And no one can seem to agree

And then the 8 Ball said "things don't look great"
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
To tell the truth I never listen, just grit my teeth and split
It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
But no one ever fucking listens
Yeah no one ever fucking listens
So you can take your damn opinion and fucking suck it

And then the 8 Ball said "things don't look great"
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

And then the 8 Ball said "things don't look great"
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

And then the 8 Ball said "things don't look great"
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland
