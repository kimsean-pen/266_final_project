Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, o-oh

R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side
I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
Say don't let me down, don't let me down, no-o-oh
Don't let me down

It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me do-o-own

Yea-ea-eah, don't let me down
Yea-ea-eah, don't let me do-o-own
Don't let me down
