We were one in words
You finished my sentences
I could never attract tomorrow
It pushes me aside

I sink in waters deep
Your presence kept me floating
Far from depths
where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime
I could be the first you meet

I once read a poem
Held my breath
But that moment is gone
First time I felt
life somewhat hurts
I need an option
a reason
and some hope

Yell at me I want to
be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking
and I might fall
I wish that I could say
I wish that I could be your evil
Evil in a closet

Yell at me I want to
be your light that shines
But my ground is shaking
and I might fall
I wish that I could say
I wish that I could be your evil
Evil in a closet
