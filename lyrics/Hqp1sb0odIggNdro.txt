You and I
Violet
Ultra in tune like a violet
Fuzzy floor
Round the room
Opening up like a sun roof
And we connect like all the dots
Constellation for the stars
Ringing out like four alarms
Alarms alarms alarms
So take it slow oh oh oh oh
Cause what are we rushing for
We know its all for show

Spending all my time only where I can get enough
Spending every dime on you but its only stuff
You can run it up
You can run it up
Sending you my love, love
Feel it all around
Got so much to give I ain't need to keep it count
Run it up
You can run it up

You and I
Magical
Slam dunk like its basketball
You got me spinning junk like I'm on alcohol
Feeling all the feels I've never felt before
Babe I got to hand it it ain't delt before
Babe I got to hand it t you thank you lord

Take it slow
Cause what are we rushing for
We know its all for show
Spending all my time where I can get enough
Spending every dime on you but its only stuff
You can run it up
You can run it up
Sending you my love, love
Feel it all around
Got so much to give I ain't even keeping count
Run it up
You can run it up

Breakfast in bed
See some light through the curtain
When she leave me she say
Why does love leave to hurting?"
I say "one things for certain,
I ain't preaching no chairman
But if it aches in your heart,
That means that something is working
Don't think for once it ain't worth it
Don't think for once theres no purpose
Thats right when I see you on caller I still get nervous
Ya I know its not perfect, but let that glove shine
From below to surface
Because you know I'm

Spending all my time on you I can't get enough
Spending every dime on you but its only stuff
You can run it up
You can run it up
Sending you my love, love
Feel it all around
I got so much to give I ain't even keeping count
Run it up
You can run it up
