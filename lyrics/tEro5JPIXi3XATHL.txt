Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

I've got to tell you something
You're not my first ever love
Men come and go I've noticed
But my first love's going

Strong
He swept me off my feet
Strong
With melody and simple beat
Strong
A touch and I feel complete

Music is my love you see, yeah

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

Without the beats I'm nothing
Without a song in my heart
I'd be a different girlfriend
But we're all here, so let's

Start
The things he says are always true
Start
He's never gonna change his tune
Start
And though you're still the boy for me

Music is my life you see, yeah

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

If someone held you with a gun
You know I'd make you number one
I need you both to get along
Music gets the best of me

Oh, my baby
You know you make me smile
But it's the music we're making
That's really driving me
Wild

Can't help it, baby

(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)

Music gets the best of me
But guess who gets the rest of me
And there's no need for jealousy
Music gets the best of me

If someone held you with a gun
You know I'd make you number one
I need you both to get along
Music gets the best of me

Music gets the best of me
Can't help it, baby
