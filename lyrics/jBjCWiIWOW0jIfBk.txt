The reasons why
Oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, baby
And run away
After what you did
I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

Baby, for a long time
You had me believe
That your love was all mine
And that's the way it would be
But I didn't know
That you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone

Now, I've got to say
That it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play
Your games anymore
After what you did
I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
