Somehow it feels I'm getting more frustrated
With every tongue-tied, wild-eyed, overrated
Narcissistic, self-absorbed
Spawn of generation bored

Want to see you vulnerable
I am not your equal
Ruling with an iron fist
And you are on my bad list
Routine casualty
Razor sharp beauty queens
Bridges built, bridges burned
You will get what you deserve

What did they do
Made you so awful
Why do you say
The stupid things you do
The ones you've hurt
I hope they hurt you too
The things you've done
Will eat away at you

And now I think, I'm done caring
Too many mindless, self-obsessed, over-bearing
Misogynistic, plastic hearts
Can't wait to see you torn apart

Want to see you vulnerable
I am not your equal
Ruling with an iron fist
And you are on my bad list
Routine casualty
Razor sharp beauty queens
Bridges built, bridges burned
You will get what you deserve

What did they do
Made you so awful
Why do you say
The stupid things you do
The ones you've hurt
I hope they hurt you too
The things you've done
Will eat away at you

What did they do
Made you so awful
Why do you say
The stupid things you do
The ones you've hurt
I hope they hurt you too
The things you've done
Will eat away at you

You've made this list
You won't be missed
You'll have to learn
Some things you don't deserve

What did they do
Made you so awful
Why do you say
The stupid things you do
The ones you've hurt
I hope they hurt you too
The things you've done
Will eat away at you

What did they do
Made you so awful
Why do you say
The stupid things you do
The ones you've hurt
I hope they hurt you too
The things you've done
Will eat away at you

The things you've done
Will eat away at you
The things you've done
Will eat away at you
