You used to be my closest ally
In this cold, cold world of deception and lies
We would defend and protect one another
Now I can't tell if we're enemies or lovers

So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves
When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for loving

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

Oh baby, where did we go wrong, baby?
Did this cold, cold world turn us into stone
Well, now all I battle is your ego and your pride
It's ticking like a time bomb ready to ignite, hurt me to fight

So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves
When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for loving

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for lovin'

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

When the smoke clears
What will be left for us but tears and pain
Why must we argue over the same things
Just to make up and go back again

It's never too late, living too long
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong
Gotta get out of bed
And take a look at what's goin' on

Oh when we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for loving

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for lovin'

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
Baby
(Wake up)
It's time for loving

When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
My baby
(Wake up)
Before it's too late

Oh baby
(Wake up)
Oh darling
(Wake up)
When we gonna wake up
(Wake up)
When we gonna take a look and see
(Wake up)

What's going on?
(Wake up)
Oh what's going on?
(Wake up)
Seems we're wasting so much time
(Wake up)
And we're about to lose it all
(Wake up)

Oh baby, baby, baby
(Wake up)
Said I need you baby
Oh I need my baby home
(Wake up)
Bring my baby back to me
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
Oh baby, baby, baby
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
