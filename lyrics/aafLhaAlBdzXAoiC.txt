I don't wanna be with anybody else
If I wanted someone like me
I'd hang out with myself

I'm stuck here in the middle of winter
I feel a bit bitter about what you said to me
Well you never talk about it
Instead you scream and shout it
Never let nobody in to let them know what you been through

You love drama, I believe in karma
I'm struggling and might see a shrink
I never thought that I would think that

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?

We're so different, you and I
I think that's what first caught your eye
I'm your mistake, you're my escape

You suggest the theatre
I go just to be with you
It's not something I like to do
I hate musicals, I know about you

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?

I don't wanna be with anybody else
If I wanted someone like me
I'd hang out with myself

I don't wanna be with anybody else
If I wanted someone like me
I'd just hang out with myself

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?

I, no I don't wanna be
With anybody else but you
Can you come with me?
