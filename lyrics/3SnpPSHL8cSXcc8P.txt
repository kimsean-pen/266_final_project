This world is spiraling down
The segregation of everything
Is the source of the blood on the walls
It's passed down by generation
This hatred could swallow us all
Can we unlearn what's been ingrained?

But I alone cannot control what moves us backwards
A story told so full of holes
Just allows the lies to breathe

And to leech onto the heart
Of the disillusioned and the weak
The perfect consumer
For the product of hate

If morality is what's been sacrificed
Then just give me your hands
And I'll pray to god we make it out alive

But I alone cannot control what moves us backwards
A story told so full of holes
Just allows the lies to breathe
I see through this illusion
But what's the solution if all that they see is what's different in me

There's a hole in my heart
Nobody can see
It feels like the sun is gone
And hope is locked away
There's a hole in my heart
Why can't they see?
It feels like the sun is gone
God unstitch their eyes please

Set their minds free
Unstitch their eyes please
Lift the blindfold today
Because so close is so far away

I hope tomorrow's not too late
Cause' time today is running out
Don't turn your back you know it's real
So wake up, Cause' somethings wrong
There's something wrong
