I need a man I can trust
A hand to hold
A way to grow older
Someone to dull the pain
To push it away without having to hold them

Sometimes the words fall apart
A body of art
A centerpiece broken

I need someone to stay sand
To lay themselves down
To keep soft-spoken

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

Look at the street and don't lie
Don't make yourself cry
Don't be your own victim

I need a man who won't run
Someone to call on
Someone with no tricks to them

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

I need a man

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
