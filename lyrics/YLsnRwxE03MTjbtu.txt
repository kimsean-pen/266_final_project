I drank right from your tears of plenty and
I exchanged all the gifts you sent me.
Dreary beats over fast-rapped verses
Leaked through windows in hatchback hearses.

Snacker's conference at the buffet table
Double dip in the goose pate mold.
Posthumous pranks left in the casket.
Plain Jane shining in her spotlight moment.

She lived for the same moments we did:
Morning coffee refilled and endless.
He stumbled into some dinero.
Weeping at the wake like a Catholic hero.
