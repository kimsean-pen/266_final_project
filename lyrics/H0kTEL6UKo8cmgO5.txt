Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

All my friends, they pretend
The end is just around the bend
But since you came along
I'm not believin' it
Sunshine, destiny
The birds and bees and centipedes
Until you came along
I never needed it

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

Money, power, a man of means
Chasing down irrational dreams
But when you came along
I was freed of it
Throw your TV out the door
One, two, three, four, on the floor!
And if you sing a song
You'll believe in it

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way

Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
Love, just love away
Just do it everyday
Just do it every way
