Are you ready?

If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home, you say it

If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
(The glamorous life

By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
(The glamorous life)

By the glamorous, ooh the flossy flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shoppin' for expensive things

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in

We flyin' First class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous

(The glamorous life)
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
(The flossy flossy)

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
(The glamorous life)

By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
(The flossy flossy)

I'm talkin' champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothin' but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us

I got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous

Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yes G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous

(The glamorous life)
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
(The flossy flossy)

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
(The glamorous life)
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
(The flossy flossy)

I got problems up to here
I got people in my ear
Tellin' me these crazy things
That I don't want to know (y'all!)
I got money in the bank
And I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank
Thank you really though
'Cause I remember yesterday
When I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope

And the industry is cold

I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home)

My daddy told me so

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home)

He let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home)

My daddy told me so

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home)

He let his daughter know
