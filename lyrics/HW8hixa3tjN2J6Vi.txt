Lovers, into friends
Move on, to strangers
Let go, no more us
Move on, I'm trying

Denying
Saying "Time will heal"
Keep lying
To make me feel
I'm okay
So you believe
I forget you
Seriously

Really...

Are you kidding me?
You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
To think that I can
Keep you out of mind

Happy, used to be
Together, you and me
Things die, drift apart
Wait for, a new start

Denying
Think you'll fade away
Keep lying
I can hear you say
"You're in touch with Reality"
Mm baby I say

Are you kidding me?

You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
To think that I can
Keep you out of mind

How can you say
I'll be alright?
What makes you think
That I'll be fine?
Baby you have to be
Completely out of your
You're out of mind
To think that I can keep you
Out of mind

You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
You're out of your
You're out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I
To think that I can keep you
Out of mind

You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind
To think that I
To think that I
To think that I
To think that I can keep you
Out of mind
