Facing reality
It is like a noose smothering me
The circle of life closing a chapter behind
Gone with the wind
I'm drowning in this sea
The root of my blood
It's final destiny
Taken away, leaving me lost, left behind
Like dust in the wind
Gone
In mourning

In this dominant stream
I'm grasping my way back to reality
Evolve to believe
Emotional battle divides my vision of life

I am the silence
Crushing your ears
See the sands of time
Slip through your fingers
And bury you in grief

In mourning

Grief
To redefube
Face
The sands of time

Nel tuo silenzio
Non vedi ancora
Nessuna luce che splende per te

The arms of sorrow
Are all embracing
We stared death in the eye
With pained and heavy hearts
Curse this fate!
We fought up to the very end
Just to see the light
Fade away into night

Crack your shell
Let your ego go
Your tear of death
Holds you in control

The essence of life
Embrace the consternation
Surrender yourself
To spiritual salvation

The chain
Anchored by your past
New suns will rise at last

Don't resist when the river's turning red
As we are outnumbered versus soldiers of the dead
Yet hang on, some battles can't the won
We'll need to accept the outcomes, take life as it comes
Embrace
Your rebirth
From despair

Challenges rise
Dance the waltz of life

I am the silence
Crushing your ears
See the sands of time, they go
Bury you in grief

Just face the truth
Beyond the dreams
And realize
Beyond my sense of time
That all your fear keeps you drowning in this sea
I won't deny

Beyond the dream
I won't deny

Reborn!
