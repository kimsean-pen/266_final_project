Yes, but what should I do?

Walking through the abattoir
Disconnected from who we are
We don't see it
There's an animal inside of us
Stocking up on dynamite
No more people left in our sight
Just give us something
So we can kill and watch our hearts adjust

It's all the same thing
It's all non-duality
It's all the same thing
We're all the same thing

Ooh, I think illusions run my life
I need illusions all the time
Grant you illusions from our mind

Paradise came to me on the sofa and a TV screen
I haven't bathed since
And I've escaped my own morality
Holding up a heavy front
Our little arms have taken on too much
And now we're seething
But too depressed to leave our soapy sheets

It's all the same thing
It's all non-duality
It's all the same thing
We're all the same thing

Ooh, I think illusions run my life
I need illusions all the time
Grant you illusions from our mind

Ooh, I think illusions run my life
I need illusions all the time
Grant you illusions from our mind
