Door clicks while his wheels start spinning on the pavement
And I go fill the space up where he has been staying
Won't lose much sleep
He never went that deep
Love you, oh, you sweet thing
No, I never said that
Let me hold your ego
While you get your bag packed
Don't take this the wrong way
But when the spade shows up
I call it by its first name

We were, we were never gonna catch fire
We'd've burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now
So I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire

Mmm, fire
Mmm, fire

Talk, touch, kiss, bend
This one's just like all the others
And I know all too well that I won't beat the waters
I held my breath to swim
The shallow shores aren't safe enough to dive in

We were, we were never gonna catch fire
We'd've burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now
So I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire

That comes-and-stays fire
On-blood-and-veins fire
I've only ever wanted, fire
In my chest, in my mouth, on my tongue, in my mind
In my soul, so my lungs can breathe in fire

We'd've burned up in the flames
Long before they ever rose up higher
Someday I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now
So I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire
