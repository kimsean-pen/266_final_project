If I see the gauge of alchemy
Uprooted by the wind
Could you save it all from the opposite until the end again?
When you crawl across the rooftop
Were you let in by the wind
Maybe we could fall from the living word that was never heard
And just end it
All at once
Never see your face again
As tender as your lover's skin
All at once
Remember where you started from
So sure the day would never come
Did you change the weight or symmetry?
It was never meant to be
Did you move it all from the opposite when you went away?
And I wanted more than anything
To be there until the end
Maybe we could last from the second chance to the end again
And just end it
All at once
Never see your face again
As tender as your lover's skin
All at once
Remember where you started from
So sure the day would never come
And you'll never find an answer
When you're waiting there alone
And you'll never find a reason
Just end it
All at once
Never see your face again
As tender as your lover's skin
All at once
Remember where you started from
So sure the day would never come
