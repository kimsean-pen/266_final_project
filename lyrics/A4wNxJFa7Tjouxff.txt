You gave me hope amidst my sorrow
may it be tomorrow,
that I can love again.
And in return for what I've borrowed
be with you tomorrow
and until the end.
You gave me hope amidst my sorrow
may it be tomorrow,
that I can love again.
And in return for what I've borrowed
be with you tomorrow
and until the end.
I know the road we're on is narrow
along comes tomorrow,
we're gonna see the sun.
And with the wings of the first sparrow
new light of tomorrow
we're gonna be as one.
We're gonna be as one.
We're gonna be as one.
We're gonna be as one.
We're gonna be as one.
