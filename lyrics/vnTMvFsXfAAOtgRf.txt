I've waited for so long
Put up with your shenanigans
I'm going to take you on
And you won't know the half of it

I'm gonna put you in your place
You've got the queen; I've got the ace
I'll light you up and smoke you down
And watch the rings go round and round

Oh, oh, oh oh oh
This is war war
Woah woah, woah
Saturday night
Saturday night

Now I don't know what went wrong
Thought you would get away with it
Now the band are playing just one song
And you shall know the wrath of it

You could have said it to my face
Any time or any place
I'll light you up and smoke you down
And watch your walls come tumbling down

Oh, oh, oh oh oh
This is war war
Woah woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
This is war war
Woah woah, woah
Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

I'm gonna put you in your place
You've got the queen; I've got the ace
I'll light you up and smoke you down
I'll watch your world come crashing down

Oh, oh, oh oh oh
This time it's war war
Woah woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
This is war war
Woah woah, woah
Saturday night
Saturday night
On Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
