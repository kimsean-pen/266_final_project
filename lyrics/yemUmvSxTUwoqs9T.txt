I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love, love, love, love
I want your love

I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love, love, love, love
I want your love (love, love, love, I want your love)

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
