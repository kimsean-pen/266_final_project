Mama, mama, mama made me the way I am
My face, my eyes, someone turn me up, I'm speaking my mind
And I and I, I've been wasting a lotta time
Looking in mirrors and hating on me but now I like what I see

I know, I know
I'll never be perfect
I know, I know
But I'm gonna work it
Let go, let go
Put your new shoes on, the new you on

We are who we are who we are
Pretty's just a pretty word
And I'm gonna shine like a star
'Cause I'm the only me in this world
Throw away the books and the magazines
I'm never gonna look like a beauty queen
We are who we are who we are
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me

Mama, mama, mama made me the way I am
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high
And I and I, I've been wasting a lotta time
Looking in mirrors and hating on me but now I like what I see

I know, I know
I'll never be perfect
I know, I know
But I'm gonna work it
Let go, let go
Put your new shoes on, the new you on

We are who we are who we are
Pretty's just a pretty word
And I'm gonna shine like a star
'Cause I'm the only me in this world
Throw away the books and the magazines
I'm never gonna look like a beauty queen
We are who we are who we are
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me

I know, I know
I'll never be perfect
I know, I know
But I'm gonna work it
Let go, let go
Put your new shoes on, the new you on

We are who we are who we are
Pretty's just a pretty word
And I'm gonna shine like a star
'Cause I'm the only me in this world
Throw away the books and the magazines
I'm never gonna look like a beauty queen
We are who we are who we are
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
And I'm just doing me, just doing me
