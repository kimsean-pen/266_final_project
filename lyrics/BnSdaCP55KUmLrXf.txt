I will rise
To dreams of freedom
And avow
To return the treason that came under your reign
The day and then the shade
I have slept
Inside the season that froze within my grasp
[Chorus:]All my fears come into view
There must be an end soon
And every waking hour
Is part of the lie
I will rise
Over glass cathedrals

And let go
With my eyes resting upon the nearing dark
The day and then the shade
I have slept
Within the reason that kept me so remote
Make a brand new vow
In the heat of an evening
The darkness swarms
I was nothing, ever
But red like the sun
Dying down over the freeway
Is the brand new sky
Over the mountain ridge
[Chorus x2]
