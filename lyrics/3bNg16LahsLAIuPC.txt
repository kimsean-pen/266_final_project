He-He!

I been thrown round once or twice
Beneath it all was born to fight
I hear your voice in my head and it's killing me
I've never been a fan of happy endings

Our love must be tainted
If that's how you paint it
You dont know what your in for
You're so rot into the core

why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You can't toss me out, you can't toss me out)
I've been sitting back keeping quite for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You cant toss me out, you can't toss me out)
You just wanna use me up till I'm all gone
(That's no me at all, that's no me at all)

Ohhhh,
Ash!

He-He!

Won't try so hard you can't admit
Open my heart you never come - in
Can't find my way through your maze
And in my mouth you put a very bad taste

Our love must be tainted
If that's how you paint it
You dont know what your in for
You're so rot into the core

why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You can't toss me out, you can't toss me out)
I've been sitting back keeping quite for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You cant toss me out, you can't toss me out)
You just wanna use me up till I'm all gone
Ohhhh,
Ash!
(That's no me at all, that's no me at all)

Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?
Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?
Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?

Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here
Oooh
Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here
Wohh

why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You can't toss me out, you can't toss me out)
I've been sitting back keeping quite for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll
(You cant toss me out, you can't toss me out)
You just wanna use me up till I'm all gone
Ohhhh,
Ash!
(That's no me at all, that's no me at all)

Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?
Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?
Yooooo
Am I a ragdoll?
