Love and devotion, baby I can't get enough
Of all that love and devotion in my life.
Love and devotion, baby love and devotion,
You are the sunshine of my life.

When a man loves a woman, a woman loves a man,
love and devotion gotta keep it if you can.
A kiss, a smile, even when you cry,
Everybody knows it we need it once awhile.
So come on come on, you gotta keep it if you can.
Love and devotion is the master plan. I
I'm talking about I'm talking about a wonderful emotion,
I'm talking about a game called love and devotion.

Tonight is the night,
When love shines so bright, and we will be reunited.

Oh-la oh-la oh-la oh-la hey,
Oh-la oh-la I want you baby, I want you baby,
Oh-la oh-la oh-la oh-la hey,
Oh-la oh-la I want you baby, I need you baby.

Sweet little dreams as you can see.
Easy come easy go but not for me.
One life one love one family.
Together forever in unity, so come on come on,
You gotta keep it if you can.
Love and devotion is the master plan.
I'm talking about a wonderful untouchable emotion,
I'm talking about guess, right,
Love and devotion.

Tonight is the night,
Then love shines so bright, and we will be reunited.

When a man loves a woman, a woman loves a man,
Love and devotion gotta keep it if you can.
A kiss, a smile, even when you cry,
Everybody knows that we need it once awhile.

Love and devotion baby I
Can't get enough of that love and devotion in my life.
