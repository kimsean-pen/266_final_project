Like plastic brains we change
When losing who you thought you were is not the only thing at stake
Is there any trace left of me?
Is there any trace left of me at all?
Is there any trace left of me?

Cause I've been having visions lately flashes of a different path
Are you feeling the love? Are you feeling the love?
When holding on is thankless is it ever worth looking back?
Are you feeling the love? Are you feeling?
I'll dish it out if you got a sec, dimly lit with a cigarette
Are you feeling? Are you feeling?
Through that smile like a fraudulent
Check chase it down with the triple sec
Are you feeling the love? Are you feeling?

Like plastic brains we change
When losing who you thought you were is not the only thing at stake

So I've been breaking patterns, certain habits of a different man
Are you feeling the love? Are you feeling the love?
We base progress on what we expect to find in the end
Are you feeling the love? Are you feeling?
I don't want to feel this way anymore
(I don't want to feel this way anymore)
I don't want to feel this way anymore
(I don't want to feel this way anymore)

Like plastic brains we change
When losing who you thought you were is not the only thing at stake
Is there any trace left of me?
(I don't want to feel this way anymore)
Is there any trace left of me?
(I don't want to feel this way anymore)

Is there any trace left of me?
