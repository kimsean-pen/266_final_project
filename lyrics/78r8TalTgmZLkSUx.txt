Well, uh beat the drum, and hold the phone
The sun came out today
We're born again, there's new grass on the field
A'roundin' third, and headed for home
It'sa brown eyed handsome man
Anyone can understand the way I feel

Ohh put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Look at me, I can be, centerfield

Well I spent some time in the Mudville nine
Watchin' it from the bench
You know I took some lumps when the mighty Casey struck out
So say, hey Willie, tell Ty Cobb, and Joe DiMaggio
Don't say it ain't so, you know the time is now

Ohh put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Look at me, I can be, centerfield

Yeah, got it, I got it

You got a beat up glove, a homemade bat
And a brand new pair of shoes
You know I think it's time to give this game a ride
Just to hit the ball, an' touch 'em all', a moment in the sun
It's gone, and you can tell that one goodbye

Ohh, put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Look at me, (yeah) I can be (centerfield)

Ohh put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Put me in coach, I'm ready to play, today
Look at me, gotta be, centerfield

Yeah
