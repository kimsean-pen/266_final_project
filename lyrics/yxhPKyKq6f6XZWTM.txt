I've been my own friend-
things lost and won.
When you pull me aside...
It feels like my head
is going blind.

If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.
If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.

I notice old in you,
you notice new in me too.
I've seen the way you wait for redemption
waiting the day away...
I've only noticed, I'd never mention it to you

If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.
If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.

I would follow you.

I would follow you.

If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.
If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.
If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.
If you could take me...
If you could save me from this
If you could take me...
I would follow you.

I would follow you.

I would follow you.

I would follow you.

I would follow you.
