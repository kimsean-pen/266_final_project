To the prisons with those who disobey
Where they shall rot and decay
And to the few who dare deceive me
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me

I will unhinge this world
My endless reign is all that I can see
I will unhinge this world
Kneel at my feet or die in the streets
Your ridicule has made me what I am
What I am

To the honest man I've broken apart (broken apart)
But they fail to understand that
Their ridicule has made me what I am

To the prisons with those who disobey
Where they shall rot and decay
And to the few who dare deceive me
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me
The hate you've placed on me has
Only fed my famished ambition to eradicate you
When you're cast you'll seek forgiveness
May you then realize your worthless existence

The red stains
The red stains

To the honest man I've broken apart (broken apart)
But they fail to understand that
Their ridicule has made me what I am
To the honest man I've broken apart (broken apart)
But they fail to understand that
Their ridicule has made me what I am

Stand in red

The rodents will feast on your insides
Your ridicule has made me what I am
