How does it sound
When I cross your mind?
When you're thinkin' bout us on a Friday night?
Are we black top burnin', spinnin' the tires?
Are we slow dancin'
To a vinyl record, to a mixtape, a coverband playin', on broadway?
Is it quiet in the background or is it turned up loud?

Do you hear that rain on the roof of an F-150
Sittin' up high lookin' out on the city
Me and you meltin' down somethin' ice cold while we're heatin' it up
Is it a little George Strait or a little more Tim McGraw?
It don't matter to me, girl, I like it all
When you think about me and you fallin' in love like we are right now

How does it sound?

If we do something crazy?
Ditch the crowd, get all alone, baby
Make some noise, make a soundtrack

Close your eyes, girl do you hear that

Rain on the roof of an F1-50
Sittin' up high loookin' out on the city
Me and you meltin' down somethin' ice cold while we're heatin' it up
Is it a little George Strait or a little more Tim McGraw?
It don't matter to me, girl, I like it all
When you think about me and you fallin' in love like we are right now

How does it sound?

And are we singing along?
How does it sound?
While we're here, play on all night long

Do you hear that rain on the roof of an F1-50?
Sitting up high lookin' out on the city
Me and you meltin' down somethin' ice cold while we're heatin' it up
Is it a little George Strait or a little more Tim McGraw?
It don't matter to me, girl, I like it all
When you think about me and you fallin' in love like we are right now

How does it sound?

(Hear that rain on the roof of an F1-50) How does it sound?
(Sitting up high looking out on the city) How does it sound?
(You and me melting down something ice cold) So tell me, girl, how does it sound?
