You took my heart and you turned me on
And now the danger sign is on

Never thought the day would come
When I would feel alone without you
And now I'm like a child again
Calling out his mama's name
You got me on a ball of chain
Doin' things that I don't want to

I can't stop running to you
Feel love coming through you
Girl with you beside me
Hold on, heaven guide me.

Red light it spells danger
But I can't hold out no much longer
Because a red light it means a warning
And I can't hold out
Baby, I'm burning.

I had my funk
And I played around
Without a love to tie me down

I used to kiss and run
But never wanted love to catch me.
I thought I had a heart of stone
But now I'm in the danger zone

I can feel the heat is on
Soon the flames are gonna catch me.

Can't stop running to you
Feel love coming through you
Girl with you beside me
Hold on, heaven guide me.

Red light it spells danger
But I can't hold out no much longer
Because a red light it means a warning
And I can't hold out
I'm burning

Red light it spells danger
And I can't hold out no much longer
Because a red light it means a warning
And I can't hold out . . .
Oh baby I'm burning

Never thought the day would come
When I would feel alone without you
And now I'm like a child again
Calling out his mama's name
You got me on a ball of chain
Doin' things that I don't want to

Can't stop running to you
Feel love coming through you
Girl with you beside me
Hold on, heaven guide me.

Red light it spells danger
And I can't hold out no much longer
Because a red light it means a warning
And I can't hold out
Baby, I'm burning.

Red light it spells danger
But I can't hold out no much longer
Because a red light it means a warning
And I can't hold out
Cos', Baby, I'm burning.
