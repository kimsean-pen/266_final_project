To the ground
To the ground
Set it all ablaze
This distancing within our midst
A hungered conquest to devour, an obsession, your obsession
The cost is all
We circumvent this power that was so slowly bled from us
Such arrogance and failure
These crimes now lead to your numbered days

Bulldoze their pedestals
Ignite their fortress to the ground, we begin again
Bulldoze their pedestals
Ignite their fortress to the ground, we begin again
Outdrawn, outnumbered to the ground, we begin again
Outdrawn, outnumbered to the ground, we begin again
Outdrawn, outnumbered to the ground, we begin again
Outdrawn, outnumbered to the ground, we begin

Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground without hesitation
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground, we begin again
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground without hesitation
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground, we begin again

To the ground
No question
No question

Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground without hesitation
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground, we begin again
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
Bulldoze their pedestals, ignite their fortress
To the ground, we begin
