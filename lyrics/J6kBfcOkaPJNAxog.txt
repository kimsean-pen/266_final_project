Where are the dreams of baby gone?
Coz you know it's all so good
You know it's all gone so fast
Keep all your guns at home
I'll keep your momma safe
Coz you know she's pretty good too

Where is the night so warm and so strange?
That no one is afraid of themselves
pick, pick up dig dig out those weeds
Out of your happy-go-lucky fields
Of such polluted thinking

Work through the rockets my fathers
Work through the rockets my fathers
Work through the rockets, my fathers

Where are the dreams of the baby's going?
Coz you know there all going so fast
Take, take as much as you can
Cuz you know its going so fast
But you know it's so good
Where are the men that mountain so brave
That they do not explode over everyone

Pick, pick up dig, dig out those weeds
Out of your happy-go-lucky field of such polluted thinking

Chorus

First Verse

Where are all the dreams of babies going?
Coz you know they're all good
