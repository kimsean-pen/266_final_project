Spinderella Cut It up One Time
Oh, oooh, ooooh, oooh ah (Mmmmh hmmm)
Oh, oooh, ooooh, oooh ah (Ooops)
Oh, oooh, ooooh, oooh ah (Ah ha)
Oh, oooh, ooooh, oooh ah
Come on!

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't be coy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cuz that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know anything goes

Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty, have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it

All right then, come on, Spin
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'

Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with

Or even mess with,
The Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you,
It's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to

She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope (Ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now)

Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex (come on)
Let's talk about sex (do it)
Let's talk about sex (uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

Ladies, all the ladies,
Louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies
Let's talk about sex, all right

Ladies, all the ladies,
Louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies
Let's talk about sex, all right

Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
And why not? Everybody havin' sex
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
Come on, how many guys you know make love?

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
