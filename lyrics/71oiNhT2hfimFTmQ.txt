Hey girl i love you,
Dancing 'round like that will drive me crazy.
But why would i want you,
When it's plain you're not ever wanting me?

Well my whole life all i had was this guitar.
Never gonna be lonely when all i have is music in my heart.
Never gonna wanna be something i am not.
As i get older i'm a be happy with what i got.

(chorus)
'Cause i got music,
and it makes me feel alright.
Got this here music,
and it helps me ease my mind up.
'Cause i got music,
and it takes away the pain.
Got this here music,
and i got it every, every, every day.

Hey my friend's like that,
He drives all those little girls crazy.
Say did you see us,
In the background of the crowd on the TV?
On a summer's day we go and catch some morning waves.
Hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be ok.
Just like I don't remember rainy days when i was small,
You know i won't remember hatred or nothing at all.

(chorus)

No tempremental alibis,
and I'm not wasting all my time.
And I am looking for the truth in this.
And i don't know just what I'll get, just what ill get.
coz i got this in music

(chorus)
