When I was younger
The days all seemed to last
So much longer
But that was once upon a time

There was no one to remind us
A shadow waits behind us
To steal our breath away

In this moment
We pretend we're all that matters
We're endless
Do you think this is forever?

Pretending, believing
That we're safe here
This moment is endless

You run from your shadow
And wait here in the dark for tomorrow
As the days turn into night
When you're looking in the mirror
You can't ignore your fear
There's nothing on the other side

In this moment
We pretend we're all that matters
We're endless
Do you think this is forever?

Pretending, believing
That we're safe here
This moment is endless

In this moment
We pretend we're all that matters
We're endless
Do you think this is forever?

Pretending, believing
That we're safe here
This moment is endless
