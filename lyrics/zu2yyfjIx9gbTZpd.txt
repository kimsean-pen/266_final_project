Watching the patterns born and dead
And catching the beams that we resurrect
It's in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Where you begin and where I start
In a kaleidoscopic heart
It's in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Activate emotion waves, oppression down
Activate the open changes flowing out
Whenever I cross the line
To keep the connection
That's when I realise
The point of perfection
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Capture the light as it ricochets
Filter the view that I'd die to save
Depth of Perception, common mistakes
Screen you release while you freeze the frame
Whenever I cross the line
To keep the connection
That's when I realise
The point of perfection
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Activate emotion waves, oppression down
Activate the open changes flowing out
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
