Waking up back home in New York City
And I know I missed you and I hope you miss me too, yeah
The days away leave me feeling so empty
I can't wait 'til I can take you with me, ooh yeah

Say you're gonna stay with me
Don't you let me go, no
You're the kinda love for me
You already know, know
Come back home late
And fall right into your bed
Every time I feel it over again

You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
I thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen

I'm trying to find my way through LAX
And I'm so lost, don't know what to expect, ooh yeah
Growing up means growing tired I guess, yeah
But nothing gets me when I'm right here next to you, yeah

Say you're gonna stay with me
Don't you let me go, no
You're the kinda love for me
You already know, know
Come back home late
And fall right into your bed
Every time I feel it over again

You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
I thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen

Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
Do you still feel it?
I thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen

You're throwing fuel into my fire
Racing, making me bleed
Do you still feel it in your chest
The way you did at sixteen?
Didn't know I was alive
Until you made my heart beat
I thought my youth was going quickly
But you give me sixteen
