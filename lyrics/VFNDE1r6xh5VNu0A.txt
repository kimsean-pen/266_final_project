The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
And I'll only take medicine
If it's followed by sweets
A sickly pink liquid
That puts me to sleep

My head beats a better way
Tomorrow a better day

And I can watch TV
While I'm wrapped up in bed
And mother makes sure that
I'm watered and fed
My best friends from school will
Come over and stare
At me in my bubble
Of germified air

When I'm asleep the smoke fills me
I feel the heat
My illness leaves me

The sun is a light bulb
A candle's a treat
The curtains stay closed now
On my little retreat
But after a while
The noise from the street
Is making me wish I
Was back on my feet
