The nine

Blasting through the earth as a storm
Spreading their dark coldness
Evolved into creatures that existed at the edge
At the edge of this world and the realm of the shadows
Resisting death, yet unable to die
Magically clung to life

Forever dying but never dead
The nine - Those of the unlight

Frozen on the very brink's of death
Enslaved by the dark lord

Forever dying but never dead
The nine - Those of the unlight

A shadow of the great evil that prolonged his existence
A shadow creature - forever dying but never dead
