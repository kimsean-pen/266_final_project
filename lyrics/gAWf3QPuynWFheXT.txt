Cry with a smile, my heart is bleeding.
Bewildered I'm here, alone.
Why is there pain, in a beautiful moment?
Why do I feel, so lost, so empty?

Cry with a smile, my heart is healing,
From pain I knew that would come.
Why is there luck, in a deeply sad moment?
Why do I feel, so calm, so peaceful?

Take my heart and set it free,
Take my heart and give it time to heal.
I know, in my memories you live.
Take my heart a little while,
Take it with you to the place you go.
I know, we will meet again some day.

Cry with a smile, my heart was dreaming.
Of time I knew that would come to an end.
Why do I cry, about a beautiful memory?
Why do I feel, so hurt, so lonely?

Take my heart and set it free,
Take my heart and give it time to heal.
I know, in my memories you live.
Take my heart a little while,
Take it with you to the place you go.
I know, we will meet again some day.
