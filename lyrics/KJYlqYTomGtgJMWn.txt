You've got a lot to say
For the one that walked away
I give, you take
It's the way it's always been

Oh, how do I know
If I should stay or just go?
The bottom line is this way
That I'll never know

Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, oh

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You've got a lot to say
For the one that pushed me away
I give, you take
Some things, they never change
Just change

Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me

I never knew that I could be this way
I never knew that I could walk away
These things take time to grow
It's been said that time heals wounds

But no, I won't be controlled
And so the story goes
Stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me
And now I know that I can be this way
And now I know that I can walk away
