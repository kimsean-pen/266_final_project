In your eyes
I am magnified
I peep your sides
I do fantasize
I make your mind
And pretend that you've lied

But I take it all the way
I take it all the way
'Cause you taste just like the river

Babe, you've played my heart
But the way that you've played, it was art

In your eyes
I've been televised
Great big lies
As evil as you flies
I meditate to grow wise
I declassified

But I take it all the way
I take it all the way
'Cause you taste just like the others

Babe, you've played my heart
But the way that you've played, it was art

Games for days
Where did you find them
Games all day
We're thankful to find them

Games all days
Help me to shine them
Play all day
I won't let the party die

I can't say I've seen them parked
But I will say I've seen them move
I can't say I've seen them parked
But I will say I've seen them move

You know you're my queen of hearts
And I come back and see you soon

I can't say I've seen them parked
I will say I've seen them move
The day you've played my heart (my heart today)
But the way that you've played, it was art

Games for days
Where did you find them
Games all day
We're thankful to find them
Games all day
Help me to shine them
Play all day
I won't let the party die
Is this is how we are
(This is amazing)
Oh, this is how we are
(This is amazing)
This is how we are
(This is amazing)
