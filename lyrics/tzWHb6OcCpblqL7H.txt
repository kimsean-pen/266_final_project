Stay, I need to be myself
I think I'll go to Austin
Take every road I know

Be alone
I'd ask you for forgiveness
If I think I could deserve it
I know I lost the one
And now I lost the way

Filling that hole in my own chest
Feeling that old and lonely way
Seeing that hold onto my legs
Onto my legs

Where were you when the sky opened up?
Is that when we died?
Is that when we learned to survive?
Watch me as I cut through my relationships
I hold onto love
Then I leave on my own again

Wait, I need to keep myself
I think I heard a knocking
Of everyone I know
Still at home
I'd ask them for forgiveness
If I think they could discern it
I know I lost the one
And now I lost the way

Filling that hole in my own chest
Feeling that old and lonely way
Seeing that hold onto my legs
Onto my legs

Where were you when the sky opened up?
Is that when we died?
Is that when we learned to survive?
Watch me as I cut through my relationships
I hold onto love
Then I leave on my own again

I let it wash over me
I let in the world
And even the opening
We'll see where it goes
I'll give you my honesty
Don't leave here with hope
Don't leave here alone
Don't be like you were
Don't be like you are now

Where were you when the sky opened up?
Is that when we died?
Is that when we learned to survive?
Watch me as I cut through my relationships
I hold onto love
Then I leave on my own again

Where were you when the sky opened up?
Is that when we died?
Is that when we learned to survive?
Watch me as I cut through my relationships
I hold onto love
Then I leave on my own again

I let it wash over me
I let in the world
And even the opening
We'll see where it goes
I'll give you my honesty
Don't leave here with hope
Don't leave here alone
Don't be like you were
Don't be like you are now
