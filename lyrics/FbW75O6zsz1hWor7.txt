I've got a sickening feeling
My life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in

But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win

Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good

I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
Till I light it up and I burn it down

One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground

Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would

Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire, my desire to burn

I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape

The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takes

Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would

Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire
I've got the fire, burning desire
And it burns, yeah, baby it burns
It burns; yeah, it burns, hotter than hell

Sifting the damage done
I'm burning up all the proof
I won't be going down in flames

At large, I'm on the run
They're tightening up the noose
It's too late; I need to get away

Burn, baby burn, 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would
