You burned up all your credit
On a family of kids who pop your pills
And smoke your pipe
And after the war broke your piggy bank
The bastards broke the world this time

So we sleep with our guns
And no jive won't get done
But we're heavy-hand high
Oh stuck in the middle of a
Silly little riddle
Control your dam, control
Till it blows your mind

Oh dance!
Don't stop!
Oh do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop!
Do the no future, do the no future
Oh you're aware, blow your top
Lord, do the no future, do the no future
Oh you're aware, blow your top
Oh do the no future, do the no future

Oh mother dear, did they really cop a feel
Before they robbed you blind?
We're all lacking nourishment
We searched around the world
Looks like a man's gonna drop
Tell it to me, baby girl
Fall into this burning world
Are you ready?
Here comes the cop to lock us up for smoking
Crack well... blow mountaintops
Are you ready?

Oh dance!
Don't stop!
Do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop!
Do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop!
Do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop!
Oh do the no future, do the no future

Honey and it's burning blood money
So i leave the motor running all night
Absurdities confirming me
Like want to start them up
'cause here, funny, it just doesn't seem right (so tight!)
...in the fishery
Clean water running out of sight
Come on come on
See the whores transforming
Feel it...

Oh drop
And bounce
And shake it shake it like it is the end of time
Oh see that you get down
In the town
In the country in the city in the middle of a beautiful
Get-left-behind
Oh work it out

Get ready

Father to the mother:
What went wrong?
I can't say no, won't live too long
Hold it steady
Girl, it falls apart

Don't stop
Oh do the no future do the no future
Don't stop
Do the no future do the no future shock
Don't stop
Do the no future do the no future shock
