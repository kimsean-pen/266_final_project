Oh sweet lungs don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
Drills me in my every step, i'm moving quick but you're always on my heals

Just one more breath, i beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy but it needs you

Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?

Steady lungs, don't fail me now
I feel you bursting but you won't let me die
Fill me up with every step
I'm feeling sick, but i'm leaving it behind

Just one long breath i beg you please
Just one more step you are not weak
My legs are sturdy but they need you to survive
My heart is sturdy but i need you

Breathe, don't you want to breathe
And know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there once more?

I have reason to believe that i have victories to taste
I can feel them on my teeth, upon my lips and in my chest
I can roll them on my tongue, they are more subtle than defeat
I feel the tension in my lungs and every move is filled by my resolve to

Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?
