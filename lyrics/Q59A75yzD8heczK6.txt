This cornerstone, a testament of work
With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion
Force feed a dream in a state of pure unrest
This cornerstone lines the stars never resting

No one can take it away, take it away
A life unresting
No one can take it away, take it away
I'll defend my kingdom
Force feed this dream until I drown
No one will take it away, take it away
Now die my will unconquered

Through the bloodshed burial lines
A darkness waits for the night to come
Blood spilled while the watchers fall
Now face to face to defend my kingdom

With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion

No, not again, keep running through (keep running through)
No, not again, keep rushing through
Not again, I won't let this slip through my fingers
I'll keep running through
I've found my soul's home is at the river's edge
Keep rushing through
I'll keep rushing through
I'll keep rushing

Through the bloodshed burial lines
A darkness waits for the night to come
Blood spilled while the watchers fall
Now face to face to defend my kingdom

Through the bloodshed burial lines
Face to face I defend my kingdom
Through the bloodshed burial lines
Face to face I defend my kingdom
Through the bloodshed burial lines
Face to face
