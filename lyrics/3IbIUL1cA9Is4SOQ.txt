They say that the night life
They say it ain't no good life
But it's my life

I've been a gambler
I've been a thief
And most of my good friends
They don't, hold with my belief

They say that the night life
They say it ain't no good life
Oh but, baby, you know that it's my life

And if you've had them troubles
If you've felt them woes
I don't have to tell you
How this whole world is so cold

Hey now, baby
It can drive you crazy
Oh but, baby, baby
The night life's for me
Listen

Just one more time
I'll hit the road
And I want to thank you
I want to thank the Lord

For that old night life
Some say it ain't no good life
But, baby, baby
There ain't nothing like this night life
