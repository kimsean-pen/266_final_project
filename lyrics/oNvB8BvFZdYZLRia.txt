Well, everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dan
Everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dan

Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man

Well, Dan walked into the old dancehall
Told the women he loved 'em all
Two six women did a dance and crawl
And I'm-a telling ya man this cat'd fool 'em all

Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Go

And three, four, five six, cats linked up against the wall
And mothers you dared the girls
But if you loved ya women and ya loved 'em right
And I'm-a telling ya man, they were in for a fight

From a Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Go

Well, everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dany
Everybody's talking about the working man
Nobody's talking about Rollin' Dany

Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man

Rollin' Dany
He was the rollin' man
Rollin' Dany man
He was the rollin' man
