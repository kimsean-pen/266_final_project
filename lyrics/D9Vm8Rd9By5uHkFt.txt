The sun is rising in the valley
And the sorrow breaks the dawn
The casting of the ages
Shows us the one and the one

We prepare the passage
We see that it is done
The borrowers they see us
And ask for what has come
Before us lays veils of water
Behind us sets the sun
We'll sleep with no dreams tonight
Tomorrow leave as one

The rising is no illusion
The fallen have become
The wisdom is ancient
Our reason bleeds the sun
Fading through the season
The endless age is one
A temple within us
Brings the judgment to the sun
