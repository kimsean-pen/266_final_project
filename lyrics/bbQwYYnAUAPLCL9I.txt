I lie in wonder of all the things that you may dream
And since my eyes met yours
I've done new things
My Jamey you're a sinner
or are you every dream come true
My Jamey yes I wonder all these things about
YOUU
...
And as these times goes by I'll wait
For your CA-A-A-A-LL
I lust for the day that you'll accept me with open arms
My Jamey you're a sinner
or are you every dream come true
My Jamey yes I wonder all these things about
YOUU
You're every dream come true
You're every dream come true
You're every dream come
TRUE
...
My Jamey you're a sinner
or are you every dream come true
My Jamey yes I wonder all these things about you
My Jamey are you a sinner
or are you every dreams come true
Oh, yes I wonder all these things about
YOUU
You're every dream come true
