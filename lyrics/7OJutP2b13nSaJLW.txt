Hey there, sexy lady
I'm loving what you do
I'm a little intoxicated
I'm thinking so are you
You're trying to deny it
But I know I changed your mind
And please don't try to fight it
'Cause I know that you'll be mine
Be mine

I want you, baby
Come get it, boy
I need you, baby
Come get it, boy
I'm on you, girl
I know it, boy
I show you, girl
You're almost there
Let's take it here
Let's get out of here
I'll do that
After tonight

I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go
I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go

All the ladies say
Hey, hey, hey
All the ladies say
Hey, hey, hey

They say that I'm a player
And it might seem kinda true
Don't wanna be a player no more
Well, I just think they're hating
'Cause they ain't got nothing on you
They have nothing on you, girl
And a girl with your credentials
You need someone that's real, real
So I could talk around it
I just tell you how I feel
For real

I want you, baby
Come get it, boy
I need you, baby
Come get it, boy
I'm on you, girl
I know it, boy
I show you, girl
You're almost there
Let's take it here
Let's get out of here
I'll do that
After tonight

I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go
I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go

All the ladies say
Hey, hey, hey
All the ladies say
Hey, hey, hey

Hey there sexy lady
I'm loving what you do
I'm a little intoxicated
I'm thinking so are you

I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go
I love to say
I told you so
And I love to see
You let it go

All the ladies say
Hey, hey, hey
All the ladies say
