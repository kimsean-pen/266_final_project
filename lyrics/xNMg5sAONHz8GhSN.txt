Blood is hot
But your heart is cold
Got nothing but the best intentions
That don't make you go

I gave you everything I had
My money, my happiness
I don't need that much from you
Just more than this

So I tell you here and now
I'm singing a brand new song
And baby, oh baby
Oh you better listen to me

Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you ever get from me
Love in a minor key

Now listen
You can do what you want to
You can play this game
And you can change every single rule
It's gonna end the same

Or honey you could lay it out
But you could just walk away
And I gettin' on my knees to beg
But just to make you stay

Lit a match and the flame went out
Before we set night on fire
Oh sugar, oh sweety
Oh you better believe me

Love in a minor key
Tthat's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
Oh yeah

Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada - uh
Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada

Oh baby, baby
You been singing in a low
It's almost like you need it
Uh a sadder song
My words could never tell ya
Oh, I'm trying to say
But music tells our story
I think you wanted it that way

Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada
Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada

Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
That's all you'll ever get from me
Love in a minor key
Oh yeah

Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada
Daaa dada da da
Daaaaa dadada
