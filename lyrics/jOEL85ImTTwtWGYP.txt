Days filled with joy
And days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today
Am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you

I've been waiting
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before

Open your heart
And tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk
Like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak
I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore

I've been waiting
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before

Open your heart
Let me hear you
And make up your mind
I want to hear you call
Open your heart
Want to come near you
And make up your mind
Oh girl, before I fall

Open your heart
Let me hear you
And make up your mind
I want to hear you call
Open your heart
Want to come near you
And make up your mind
Oh girl, before I fall

Maybe the sun will continue to shine
Maybe the rain will continue to fall
Maybe you want to leave me behind
Maybe you'll change and give me a call

I've been waiting
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before
Oh-Yeah!

Open your heart
Let me hear you
And make up your mind
I want to hear you call
Open your heart
Want to come near you
And make up your mind

Open your heart
Let me hear you
And make up your mind
I want to hear you call
Open your heart
Want to come near you
And make up your mind
Oh girl, before I fall

Open your heart
Let me hear you
And make up your mind
I want to hear you call
Open your heart
Want to come near you
And make up your mind
Oh girl, before I fall
