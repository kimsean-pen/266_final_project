Clouds are marchin' along
Singin' a song, just like they do
If the clouds were singin' a song
I'd sing along, wouldn't you too?

If you just knew
What they could do
Oh, if you just knew
What would they do?

And if the birds
Are just hollow words
Flyin' along, singin' a song
What would they do?
If they just knew
What they could do
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad
But if I go to hell
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad
But if the world were ending
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

Clouds are singin' a song
Marchin' along, just like they do
If the clouds were playin' a song
I'd play along, wouldn't you too?

If you just knew
What they could do
Oh, if you just knew
What would they do?

And if words
Are just hollow birds
Flyin' along, singin' a song
What would they do?
If they just knew
What we could do
Oh, if they just knew

I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

I know it's mad
But if I go to hell
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad
But if the world were ending
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad
That I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me
