Could be calm, claim I'm fine
Say I'm simply needing time but it's needless
I'm a mess and I'm a wreck
Don't lean in, kiss my neck it won't help it

The problematic classic is
You think I'm dramatic
And I call it accurate
I don't get the way you think
Don't get your logic
Please make some sense for once

I say it like it is
When you don't say shit
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it
Do you want me for me?
Or for my body
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it

Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated

Fragile but strong as hell
I'm being by myself without issues
You'll have to take all in
Want to lead me not lead me on

Just for once can you come by
Without a blurry sight
Drunkenly leaning in

I say it like it is
When you don't say shit
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it
Do you want me for me?
Or for my body
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it

Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated

Tell me now what I don't hear
It's obvious I can't see clear
Tell me now why you are here
Am I another souvenir?

I say it like it is
When you don't say shit
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it
Do you want me for me?
Or for my body
All I want is just one lie
Don't complicate it

Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
Don't complicate it
I'm already complicated
