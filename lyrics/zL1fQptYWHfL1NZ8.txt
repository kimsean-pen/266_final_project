You were born
But you don't know why you're existing
You are unable
Why is it you and not me?

Your parents, they're shocked but still they love you
You are their flesh and blood – What else could they do?

Not even modern medicine
Can help your tortured body
Hospitals are your world
Doctors your friends to keep your dreadful life

People never treat you like a normal human being
They often think you shouldn't be a part of their sick society
They smile at you but deep inside they think you shouldn't be here
Because they never ever realize you got a heart and feelings too

People turn their heads whenever you walk by
Because they believe you live a life without sense

Life without sense
Life without sense

People turn their heads whenever you walk by
Because they believe you live a life without sense

Life without sense
Life without sense

If I'd be you
I might decide to commit suicide
But you're strong enough
To live on, because it's you and not me

You were born but you don't know why you're existing
You are unable – Why is it you and not me?
If I'd be you, I might decide to commit suicide
But you're strong enough to live on, because it's you and not me

People turn their heads whenever you walk by
Because they believe you live a life without sense

Life without sense
Life without sense
