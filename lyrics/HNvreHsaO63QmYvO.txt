We were drifting like two icebergs out on the ocean
I was doing all I could to keep you close
There were troubles in the water, you swore it was nothing
You said that we would always stay afloat

Why would true love look me in the eye and lie... Lie...
I thought we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why

Why have you been coming home so late in the evening?
Is there someone else that I should know about?
There's a smile on your face that I haven't seen
Since we started going out

How could true love look me in the eye and lie... Lie...
I thought we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why
I'll forever wonder why

We said until death do us part
And then you chose to break my heart
Remember right back to the start
We said we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together till we die
I'll forever wonder why

You said we'd be together till we die
(You let go of me, you let go of me)
I'll forever wonder why
(You let go of me, you let go of me)
I thought we'd be together till we die
(You let go of me, you let go of me)
I'll forever wonder why
(You let go of me)
I'll forever wonder why
