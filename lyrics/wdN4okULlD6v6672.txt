Well sometimes I get lonely
Well some days you don't know me
And I'll try to explain why I'll be gone by morning
It's like expecting spring until I'm instead the autumn

So come on, let's stop wasting all our energy
Let's stop wasting summer on our knees
And don't act to me, I know you felt the changes
And nothing's new, it's been this blue for ages
So baby, I'm outta here
Baby, I'm outta here

Sometimes I get lonely
And I'll wish you just hold me
And I'll try to explain why some days hurt more than others
It's like asking rain to sing above the thunder

So come on, let's stop wasting all our energy
Let's stop wasting summer on our knees
And don't act to me, I know you felt the changes
And nothing's new, it's been this blue for ages
So baby, I'm outta here
Baby, I'm outta here

And don't act to me, I know you felt the changes
And nothing's new, it's been this blue for ages
Sometimes I get lonely
Some days you don't know me
