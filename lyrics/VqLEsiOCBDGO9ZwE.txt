One love, one love!
Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull
Ya'll know what time it is
We go set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique, holla at them like

Girl, please excuse me if I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night we can really let go
My girlfriend is out of town and I'm all alone
Your boyfriend is on vacation and he doesn't have to know

No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screaming loud, let me hear you go!

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I like it

Party, caramba, fiesta, forever

Girl, please excuse me if I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying keep my hands off, but you're begging me for more
Round round round, give a low low low
Let the time time pass cause we're never getting old

No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better, turn around, I'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screaming loud, let me hear you go!

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I like it

Come DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami boy, you know how we play
I ain't playing with you, but I wanna play with you
Get me? Got me? Good, now watch me
It's a different species, meet me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Wake up Barack and Michelle
And let 'em know that it's on
Pa' fuera! Pa' la calle!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
I see you watchin me, you see me watchin' you
I love the way you move, I like them things you do like

Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough

Party, caramba, fiesta, forever

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I like it

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I like it

Party, caramba, fiesta, forever
Oh yes, I like it!
Party, caramba, fiesta, forever
