What the Doctor said could never be forgotten
"Son, don't you know that there's a pill for every problem
in this little magic bottle that's filled with love".

Little Cricket was only three
he rubbed his magic bottle
suddenly appeared a Genie
(The Genie said)
"I'm the patron saint of prescription drugs".

So, remember when you need a hug
just close your eyes
and give your bottle a rub

Cricket didn't need many friends
cuz the Genie was such a perfect
companion
His horrible Mama had such
an independent boy

Just remember when you need a hug
to close your eyes
and give your bottle a rub

Little Cricket was twenty-three
he rubbed his plastic bottle
but found the bottle was empty
(the Genie was dead)
he was suddenly such an unhappy boy
he decided that he needed some fun
he went to the store and purchased
himself a gun
