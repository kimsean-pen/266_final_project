We've been living on the edge of our seats to feel alive
We've been drinking from the fountain of our youth
But we don't know that the water is poisoned
One, two, one, two, three, go

I hear the sirens of the world getting louder
Here at the vicious streets of death
Let the wings of virtue spread like a blanket of hope
Let us stand beneath it
I can't carry me up, fear weighs me down
I am scared of the change inside of me

I've seen a change in my eyes
The evil that breathes the sickness inside of me
I'm scared it will stay if the world won't change me

Mark my words
We will seek and destroy those who speak of false hope
Mark my words
I will keep holding on to your words of purity

I closed my eyes and let the death caress my heart
I gave it into hatred
I can't carry me up, fear weighs me down
I am nothing but a lost soul
I've seen a change in my eyes
I've seen a change in my eyes

Wake up, don't let me drown in this
I'm almost awake, don't let the time run out on me

I've seen a change in my eyes
The evil that breathes the sickness inside of me
I'm scared it will stay if the world won't change me
How the hell did we get so far?
In the end, we are who we are
I'm scared it will stay if the world won't change me

Time is running away, time is running away
Time is running away, time is running away

Winter came and we followed the seasons
We grow old, and for every reason
We fell apart like the leaves here at ends fall
We caved in though we knew we gave it all
Winter came and we followed the seasons
We grow old, and for every reason
We fell apart like the leaves here at ends fall
We caved in though we knew we gave it all
