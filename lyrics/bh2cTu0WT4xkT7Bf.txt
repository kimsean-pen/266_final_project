Oh, yeah
Endless summer, yeah
Oh, yeah

Pavements are burning in the bright sunlight
Grey striped cat slips out of sight
It's a hot summer day on these small town streets
When our wishful eyes and high hopes meet

Every lucky mistake yet to be made
At the edge of an eternity we play

We were deathless
Those days were endless and full of dreams
You were mine
In the heat of summertime

The air's still warm, but the wind is chill
My heart beats fast, time stands still
In the fullness of late summer days
When we took separate ways

Every lucky mistake yet to be made
At the edge of an eternity we play

We were deathless
Those days were endless and full of dreams
You were mine
In the heat of summertime, yeah

I was broken but withered leaves
Were buried by November trees
When spring unlocked the frozen streams
It already felt like a distant dream
Sometimes I wonder
If your eyes still smile
Like they did in the fading light
Of all those endless summer nights

Summer nights
Ooh, yeah
I remember
I remember
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We were deathless
Those days were endless and full of dreams, hey
You were mine
In the heat of summertime

We were deathless
Those days were endless and full of dreams, hey
You were mine
In the heat of summertime

All those endless
All those endless
All those endless summer nights
