-We used to have a light, now it's too dark to shine
(Ohwo-oh oh ohoh ohwo-ah-ohoh)
Now we're just passing by, two shipwrecks in the night
(Ohwo-oh oh ohoh ohwo-oh ahoh ahoh)

Remember when we met, yeah I know I was mean
Stones shirt, black boots, and black jeans
And you were such a mess, I thought it was sweet
But that night still haunts my dreams

I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost
(Ahwo-oh-oh ahoh)

Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost
Blue from the TV light, two bodies intertwined
(Ohwo-oh oh ohoh ohwo-ah-ohoh)
I guess we tempted fate, always so far away

(Ohwo-oh oh ohoh ohwo-oh ahoh ahoh)
Remember when we met, yeah I know I was mean
Stones shirt, black boots and black jeans
And you were such a mess, I thought it was sweet

But that night still haunts my dreams
I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost

(Ahwo-oh-oh ahoh)
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost
(Ahwo-oh-oh ahoh)
Remember when you left, yeah I thought it was mean

Stones shirt, black boots and everything...
I let you fool me twice, well shame on me
That night still haunts my dreams
I won't keep chasing ghosts
I need somebody I can hold
Gave you my heart and soul
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost
(Ahwo-oh-oh ahoh)
Thought I was chasing love, I was only chasing a ghost
(Ahwo-oh-oh ahoh)
