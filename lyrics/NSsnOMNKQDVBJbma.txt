You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I towed the line
You see
I'm searching for what used to be mine, oh
And I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one
Who's suited to me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers And all that's in between
When she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear, whoa

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I'd miss you

Don't drop me in
It's not my time
If you cut deep then I might burn at you
Scar and left me like a sunburn
Don't drop me in
It's not my time
If you cut deep then I might burn at you
Scar and leave me like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I'd miss you
I'd miss you
And I'd miss you
I'd miss you
