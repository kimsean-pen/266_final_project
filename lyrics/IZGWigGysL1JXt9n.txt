Mind
Of destructive taste
I chose
To stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart
Lost in the dark
Call off the chase

Walls of thought
Strong and high
As my castle
Crumbles with time
I think of you
Oh, yes I do
Such a crime

You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace
I'll never know
How far to go
To reach that place

You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
