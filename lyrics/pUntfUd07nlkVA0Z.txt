Sunshine in my eyes
Yeah, I'm in paradise
Rolling up my shit and just
Wait for it to hit
I just wanna sit down
Sit down with my coffee
And I know your at your place and just longing for the pussy
Then I'll take a walk
Right some dirty talk
Come home to my tub and then
Grind another bud
I know that you are longing
For my precious pussy
But I am in my tub with a new joint and some more coffee
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
I don't need no stress and
I don't need no drama
And if you don't get it
I'll leave it up to karma
I smoke hella more
When I don't have the cash
And I don't even know what I do with my stash
But I need it bae
And I need it right now
I don't care where and I don't care how
No, I don't care how
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
(dududududu)
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae, dudududu
Oh bae
I call it housewife spliffin'
Just without a man and no housekeep mission
