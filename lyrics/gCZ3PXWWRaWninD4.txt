The time has come
Goddess forsaken,
a distant memory for mankind.
Thousand of years confined in lethargy
away from the conscience.
Open your eyes and wake up,
behold this betrayal,
for those whom you gave life forgot you,
it's time for them to die!
Rise and fall,
it's time to be born again.
Fire will rain,
the end will soon begin.
The time has come!
Ancient heralding
revives deep within your guts,
unconscious spark of life
imperceptible to human eyes.
The broken bond will never heal,
we're under nature's will.
Our future seems so dark,
there is no turning back!
Rise and fall,
it's time to be born again.
Fire will rain,
the end will soon begin.
The time has come.
Empires crumble,
when nature awakes!
The black storm is coming
I hear the sound of death
Dark thunders are blasting
above the mankind skies
Rain falls from the heavens
water soon will drown our lives
The fury of nature will drench our souls
Now
Rise and fall,
it's time to be born again.
Fire will rain,
the end will soon begin.
The time has come.
Empires crumble,
when nature awakes!
