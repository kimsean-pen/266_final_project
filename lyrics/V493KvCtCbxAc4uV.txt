i slipped out the front door
went out in the night
took out a cigarette
then i felt for my light
in my front pocket
it was nowhere to be found

i went back in the door
kicked off both of my shoes
i looked around for your coat
and then went looking for you
thought that i heard your laugh
come tripping[?] down the stairs

i walked carefully up
til i was almost halfway
i saw two closed doors
so i let my heart break
are you running around or just running away

why do i
always find the worst in you
do you always find the worst in me
and do i only find the worst in you

so i stood still for a while
trying to hear agin
but then from the living room
i heard you calling my name
i found you smiling
asking me where i had been

why do i
always seek the worst in you
do you always seek the worst in me
do i only seek the worst in you
