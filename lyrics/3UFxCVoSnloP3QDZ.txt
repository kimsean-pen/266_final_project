Today's the day I realized
That I could be loved
It echoed though the park last night
He wasn't our son
He belonged to everyone

And this loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
Cause everybody dies

And this loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
Everybody

And this loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
Cause everybody dies
