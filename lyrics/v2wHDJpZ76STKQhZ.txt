so fine
got everything i need
you got me down on my bended knees
you know to lay me down
when i'm feeling slow
COME ON

so fine
got everything i want
you got me hummin oh that song
you know to lay me back
you know it's true
my baby gives me much more than i can use
you know to lay me back
when i'm feeling slow
COME ON

the river cools
i believe
i wanna step into the breeze
COME ON
