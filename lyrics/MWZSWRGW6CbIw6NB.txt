It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
$now Leopard with the lead in his head, turning me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposing in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talking about blowing my head open
'Till the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit
Thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitching
Lane switching, same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say to get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
