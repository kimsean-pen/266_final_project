I was looking for something
Or maybe someone
Hope a relation
Or revelation
She's not a temptation
Made me be patient
I have to see hey
I have to see her

She recognize lipstick color
In a game let the jacket on
[?] My eyes
Couldn't see her face
She [?] on my heart
Feel the blade
I think I'm color blind
Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

My heart is running
Running, running

She called me apart
From far, from and the distance
When I see a word in a list
She [?]

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

She recognize lipstick color
In a game let the jacket on
[?] My eyes
Couldn't see her face
She [?] on my heart
Feel the blade
I think I'm color blind
Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

She recognize lipstick color
In a game let the jacket on
[?] My eyes
Couldn't see her face
She [?] on my heart
Feel the blade
I think I'm color blind
Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.

Cause I'm bleeding black and grey.
