Forever Dolphin Love

Why dull steed, she has no hair
Ill talk to her
Forever Dolphin Love

And Dun's life, hes turning heads.
He talks to her
Forever Dolphin Love

of Dalston
Forever Dolphin Love

Oh Sunder, I loved her
She was to be my wife
Oh Sunder, I loved her
She was to be my wife
my wife, my wife

From Black Beans

that never back in place

From Big West
