You don't see the fall
you know by now
just how it feels
Well you've got more to learn from this
I'll hold you safe
Raise your hands up on my face
You'll forget me here
I won't forget you
The cursed night falls
This is death I never knew
We walked around the path
we walked a thousand times
in our past
well you've got more to learn from this
so hold my hands
and hold your breath

'Cause you mean everything to me
So just let go of everything between
I get scared of dying so bad
But aren't we all scared?

Someday we'll find
Our hearts will align
And burn out the way
Burn the time
Someday we'll find
Our hearts will align
(Oh)
And burn out the way
Burn the time
