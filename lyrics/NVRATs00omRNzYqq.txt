So inviting, but you were biting
Whole time, playing shy, side-eyeing, huh
If I showed the world what you said, it ain't beautiful, yeah
They think you're so sweet
But behind the scenes, you're cold and cruel
You're my older, I done told ya
Got a motherfucking chip on your shoulder
You got issues, it's official
Take my name out your mouth, don't chew

Stay out my sun with your shady ass
Leaving these comments on my photographs
When you go off, I try not to laugh

You're so, you're so, you're so
Petty, petty, petty ain't the word for you
You got something else that you always do
Petty, petty, petty ain't the word for you
You got something else that you always do
You're so, you're so, you're so petty
You're so, you're so, you're so petty
You're so, you're so, you're so petty
You're so, you're so, you're so

The game started, play broken-hearted
Opportunist, thirsty for stardom
Heard you dropped my name,
stiffing closer to the fame, it's cool, hahaha
It just makes me sad you stay saying shit to come up, to come through
Live in your own world, fiction film girl
When your lights go out, truth comes down
Nobody's playing with you (nobody)
I stay praying for you (you're sorry)

Stay out my sun, with your shady ass (stay out of my)
Leaving these comments on my
photographs (leaving, leaving these comments)
When you go off, I try not to laugh (hey)

You're so, you're so, you're so
Petty, petty, petty ain't the word for you (you're so petty, petty)
You got something else that you always do
Petty, petty, petty ain't the word for you
You got something else that you always do
You're so, you're so, you're so petty (hey)
You're so, you're so, you're so petty (yeah, yeah)
You're so, you're so, you're so petty (oh)
You're so, you're so, you're so (oh, baby, oh no)
