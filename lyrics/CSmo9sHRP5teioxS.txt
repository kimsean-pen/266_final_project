Who have I become?
A nervous wreck obsessed with second guessing myself
(And it's getting harder to keep still)
And I'm so sick
of walking when my lungs are begging me to run

So don't act like I'm not choking while you drown
A picture perfect image that isn't clear

And now I'm back to the same place
that I swore I'd never return to
And now I'm back to the same place
that I swore I'd never return to

(But now it feels like home)
Let me break it down for you
Of what it's like to be stuck in between dishonesty
And the happiness that you call greed

With writing on the wall
But you never took the time to read at all

I tried my hardest to let you know
I'm dying and I'm stuck in time
I tried my hardest to let you know
I'm dying and I'm stuck in time

And now I'm back to the same place
that I swore I'd never return to
And now I'm back to the same place
that I swore I'd never return to
