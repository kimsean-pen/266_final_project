I was just leaving town
Didn't think you'd come
Didn't you'd come around
Long legged coast "will call"
Tickets to the shore
And the open road

So
John For-bid I
Say something
I don't mean
What did, I know
Of my heart at 17?
Crooked sermons
And 3 words that don't mean nothing
Wish I had known
That we were too young to live this old
That you were too young to live this old

I've never been this stoned
Ever felt this grey
Never cured this cold
So spare me the long goobye
So long, I tried
But i'll cheat this time
