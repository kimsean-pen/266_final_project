There came a day when the songs that you play
Are blasting through the speakers in your car
It comes in a flash and you hear the crowd
Screaming out your name for the encore

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real

Who could know that you'd be on the road
Selling out the tickets to your show
Where you're from you're still the one
You were before you left to go on tour

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real

Did you ever think your dreams
Would become a reality?
All you did was just believe

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Yeah

Livin' life
Life in the fast lane
Not that bad
No one can complain
Who's to say
That we won't keep it real
Hold on tight
Don't you dare let go
Now's the time to let the whole world know
You can shine bright but still keep it real
