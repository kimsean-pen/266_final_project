this is what you made it
you can't separate it
you can't segregate yourself
from everyone else

open
cover your eyes
come on cover your eyes
the light will slow and rise
and i never will lie
so come on cover your eyes
covers over mine

this is how you take it
past whatever you set for yourself
you're killing yourself
and everyone else

open
color your eyes
come on color your eyes
why the disguise
and i never will hide
so come on color your eyes
i'll color over mine

said you could see right through
you and where you will be

impress yourself.
