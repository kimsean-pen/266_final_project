Everywhere I turn
There's a life on the line
A cure for a price and fuck it
There's an elephant in the room
Turn the page, another
Headline that you already knew
Paint the picture of a lie
Behind the truth

We're on a flatline in a
Sorry state of affairs
Losing the will to live
Like we're going nowhere
They put the frighteners on us
But we all hide something

Enough is enough
I keep asking myself why us?
Enough is enough
I keep killing myself because
You said we're only as
Strong as the fears
We confront on the way
They won't find me
Praying for a hero
That hides like our
Tears from the pain

While the angels sing
Everything will be okay
Cross my fingers, point the blame
I don't believe a word they say

Everything will be okay
Cross my fingers, point the blame
I don't believe a word they say

I'd like to think
That I don't believe in anything
I'm just a heathen in disbelief
And I know, when I'm desperate I still call
Don't we all?

Enough is enough
We can't see what's in front of us
Enough is enough
Stop the world I want to get off

You said we're only as strong
As the fears we confront on the way
They won't find me praying for a hero
That hides like our tears from the pain
You said we're only as strong
As the fears we confront on the way
They won't find me praying for a hero
That hides like our tears from the pain

While the angels sing
Everything will be okay
Cross my fingers, point the blame
I don't believe a word they say
Everything will be okay
Cross my fingers, point the blame
I don't believe a word they say

Everywhere I turn
There's a life on the line
A cure for a price and fuck it
There's an elephant in the room
Turn the page, another headline
That you already knew
Clean the slate with
The water we pollute
How many times do I
Have to disobey to be saved?
We're already the 'cause
But we call it a mistake, I believed it
Even if it's just a figure
Of our imagination
The ground we walk is sacred
But the grave we make is
Closer to hell

We all hide something
We all hide something
We all hide something
