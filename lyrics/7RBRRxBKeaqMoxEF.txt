Don't hunger for the pain
Hunger for the pain
No other

I can feel the wolves are closing in
And there's no more places to hide
I can feel the end as it begins
Is it over?
I can feel the wolves are closing in
And there's no more places to hide
I can feel the end as it begins
Is it over?

I can feel the wolves are closing in
And there's no more places to hide
I can feel the end as it begins
Is it over?
I can feel the wolves are closing in
And there's no more places to hide
I can feel the end as it begins
Is it over?

Sweet lover
Don't hunger for the pain
