Moon shining down through the cracks
on the shadowy wooden floors
somewhere in a dream

I'll climb the stairs with the missing steps
if I fall
I'll just fall in love
with you

The evening summer breeze
met the skin and made the heart sing
somewhere in a dream

I'll climb the stairs with the missing steps
if I fall
I'll just fall in love
with you

and the rain began to fall in reverse
it's exactly like a dream
like a dream
and the rain began to fall in reverse
it's exactly like a dream
like a dream
