Here's to the few who fared - my love
Only for you - I cared - my love
I've given it hope, and I know it's only you
Encased in silence

Here's to the you who saved - my love
Only to you - I gave - my love
I've given it thought, and it's not all that appears

Lea, how long will you still want me to want you
In and around you
Lea, my concertina
Will you still want me to want you

Here's to the you - who dared - my love
Only with you - I shared - my love
I've given it thought, and it's not all that appears
So I'm asking you

Lea, how long will you still want me to want you
In and around you
Lea, concertina
Will you still want me to want you
Who cares - what the cynics say
I care - if only you're on your way
My Lea - don't let the same be true
Lea - do you still want me to want you
