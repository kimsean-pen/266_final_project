Summer sailed in
Filled my mind you see
Colored my skin
I must say

Saw my wings with the bodies in the gutter
Feel my kiss, now say not a word
Knowing my hands they'll shake like crazy
Some just pray like that

Coming way down
Called my name
Tell him we're here
Pick him up softly

I was wide awake with the bodies in the gutter
Waiting on a man who gave his word
I was told before to be not afraid
Soon my fears will emerge

So I went on my feet
And they came up real quick
And they left me for dead
And I never did forget

And I need my soul, and the sail needs the wind
Cause I get so lost time and again
And away I looked, oh mercy me
Well it just ain't right you see, oh me

And the lovers did feast and the birds flew away
And I was so mad at the coming of the day
But I will leave the monsters all at bay
And we can believe it's better this way

I was her lover
You were a child
She was your mother
We didn't cry

They buried their dead with the flowers in the field
With wounds so deep they never healed
They gathered their children all on the shore
Gonna wait for you to search us and destroy
