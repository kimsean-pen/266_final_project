The world is upside down
Everybody lunatics and clowns
No one speaks the truth
And madhouse runs the town

But you gotta get a grip
Beat it with a stick
Everybody's stuffing their pockets
Everybody's on the take
The news is all fake
Let 'em eat chicken and let 'em eat steak
Let 'em eat shit, let 'em eat cake

We gotta get a grip
We gotta get a grip
You gotta keep it zipped
And shoot 'em from the hip

Chaos, crisis, instability, ISIS
Lies and scandals, wars and vandals
Metadata scams and policy shams
Put 'em in a slammer
Come on!
Gotta get a
Gotta get a
Beat 'em with a stick
Gotta get a
Gotta get a
Gotta get a
Gotta get a grip

I tried diversion and I tried coercion
Mediation and medication
LA culture and aquapuncture
Overeating and sex in meetings
Induced insanity,...
