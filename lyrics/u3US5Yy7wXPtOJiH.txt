Memories
They're her reason why
She takes it all
And slowly starts to cry

Do you really think I easily bruise?
I ask what about the pain that leads to marble (?)
I just wanna spend some time with you
Some time with you, some time with you

And you could beat me up
You could beat me up

You're all the enemy
That's my reason why
I love the pain
It makes me wanna die

Do you really think I easily bruise?
Or do you have a smoke that I could borrow?
I just wanna spend some time with you
Some time with you, some time with you

Or you could beat me up
You could be me up
