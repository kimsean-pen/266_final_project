In a garden in the house of love
Sitting lonely on a plastic chair
The sun is cruel when he hides away
I need a sister, I'll just stay

A little girl, a little guy
In a church or in a school
Little Jesus, are you watching me?
I'm so young, just eighteen

She, she she she shine on
She she she shine on
She she she shine on

In a garden in the house of love
There's nothing real just a coat of arms
I'm not the pleasure that I used to be
So young, just eighteen

She, she she she shine on
She she she shine on
She she she shine on

I don't know why I dream this way
The sky is purple, things are right every day
I don't know, it's just this world's so far away
But I won't fight and I won't hate, well not today

In a garden in the house of love
Sitting lonely on a plastic chair
Sun is cruel when he hides away
I need a sister, I'll just stay

She, she she she shine on
She she she shine on
She she she shine on

Oh she, she she she shine on
She she she shine on
She she she shine on
Oh she, she she she shine on
She she she shine on
She she she shine on
And on and on
Shine, shine on, shine, shine, shine
