I asked your bitch if I could bum a cig,
she said she got a Kool, I said that's cool
I don't give a shit what kind of cigarettes that
you prefer to smoke, I needed a reason to talk to you
Girl it's true, what it do?
You making Ruby drool
Yeah, $lick slapped me across my face
Snapped me right back in my place
What the fuck? My pace sure lacks an ace
I'm such a slave to my old ways, make no mistake
All of these hoes want Ruby cause of the cherry
Fuck her pussy, I want to be buried bitch

She want to be my girl and ride with me
She want to creep up in the night with me
Blowing up my phone like $lick, I love you
I'm too detached, I don't feel nothing for her
I might relapse and put these drugs above you
I might just snap and kill another for you
You see it's dangerous when I think of her, when I think of us
When I think of love, think about my ex
Think about the rest
None of them hoes used to give a fuck
Call Ruby up, get the uzi bruh
I'm so sick of these hoes
Light up the joe
Bury her in the grave I dug
Did it all in the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
