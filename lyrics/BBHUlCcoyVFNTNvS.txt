Where's the girl who I once knew?
Is she still a part of you?
Will she ever get back on the ride,
Dreamin just to be some suckers wife?
All alone baby I'm gettin' so excited,
you can tell cause I just can't hide it.

When you said it's overgrown.
You'll never be alone again.
You're alone again, you're alone again.

When you said you'll never be alone,
You'll never be alone again.
You're alone again, you're alone again, you're alone again.

Christmas blues til the end of time,
Scaring her, have a half a glass of wine.
Thought you'd hide where you couldn't be seen,
In the pages of some filthy magazine.
All alone baby I'm gettin' so excited,
you can tell cause I just can't hide it.

When you said it's overgrown.
You'll never be alone again.
You're alone again, you're alone again.

When you said you'll never be alone,
You'll never be alone again.
You're alone again, you're alone again, you're alone again.
