Save your time for the ones who deserve it
Hold your love for the ones who returned it
And give it all

What a way to be,
What a way to complicated it all
And I wish you could see the way you choose to drag it all

When you return then you all find
This broken kingdom that you left behind

Save your time for the ones who deserve it
(And give it all, give it all)
Hold your love for the ones who returned it
(And give it all, give it all)

Some may never see
Some may never comprehend to fix it all
What a way to be
What a way to disregard the wake up call

When you return then you all find
This broken kingdom that you left behind

Save your time for the ones who deserve it
(And give it all, give it all)
Hold your love for the ones who returned it
(And give it all, give it all)

Be where it's cold, be where is safe
And stand between the ends
Straight from the world
Give what it takes
Don't break before you bend
Don't break before you bend
Don't break before you bend
(Give it all don't break before you bend)

Save your time for the ones who deserve it
(And give it all, give it all)
Hold your love for the ones who returned it
(And give it all, give it all)

Be where he comes, be where he stays
And stand between the ends
Straight from the world, give what it takes
Don't break before you bend
