Open up the door that closes off your mind
Lift up the astral veil you know you are so blind

Shattering perception

You can't trust your eyes
Melting shapes and blurry vision
Acid Fuzz consumes
Becomes your new religion

Shattering perception

Drowning in infinity, but never knowing why
On a plane of consciousness, the acid gets you high

Dose me

When a person feels, society reels
There's no holding back
Morality is limitation
You are what I was

Drowning in infinity, but never knowing why
On a plane of consciousness, the acid gets you high

You've made the choice
Now choose your path
You've made the choice
Now choose your path

(Dropping) Acid Fuzz
