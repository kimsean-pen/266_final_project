Hey, Keith
Alright

Outta my mind on a Saturday night
Nineteen seventy seven babies rollin' in sight
Radio's burning up above
Beautiful baby, be my love

Alright, feel cool always
Alright, feel cool always
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright

Where's your baby? Burn my heart
Take your baby, burn my heart
Fall apart now baby, fall apart
Where's your baby? Burn my heart

Alright, feel cool always
Alright, feel cool always
I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright

Outta my mind on a Saturday night
Nineteen seventy seven babies rollin' in sight
Radio's burning up above
Beautiful baby, be my love

Alright, feel cool always
Alright, feel cool always
I feel alright, I feel alright, feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Alright, alright
