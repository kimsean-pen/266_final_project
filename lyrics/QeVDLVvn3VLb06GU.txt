Won a moment, lost a bet
Saw a mountain, went to bed
Paid a ransom for a ghost
For the thing I want the most
So I left to find a home
For a place to call my own
Even if you think we're not
We're close to close enough
It's an end to end the start
We're moving from the ground floor
Rise inside
Push us up more
How we climb
As the water's pouring in
Like it always should have been
We can crawl or we can run
Towards the sun
Take it all, I'll keep the rest
Burn the wheels and punch your chest
In the days before the cold
All the houses oversold
It's an end to end the start
We're moving from the ground floor
Rise inside
Push us up more
How we climb
As the water's pouring in
Like it always should have been
We can crawl or we can run
Towards the sun
And although we've just begun
We can go until we've won
We can crawl or we can run
Towards the sun
