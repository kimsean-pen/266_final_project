Oh, I, I'm blowing smoke in their eyes
Here from my throne
I play them like my own
Oh, I'm throwing stones from great heights
Here from my throne
Oh, I, I'm blowing smoke in their eyes
White lies don't show
In this kingdom that I own
In this kingdom that I own

Falling bottles
Don't forget me
Falling bottles
In this kingdom that I own
Falling bottles
Don't forget me
Full of answers

Oh I
A shadow dressed in moonlight
Redder than mud
I play them like my own
Oh, I, I'm blowing smoke in their eyes
Here from my throne
Oh, I, I'm throwing stones from great heights
White lies don't show
In this kingdom that I own

Falling bottles
Don't forget me
Falling bottles

Don't forget me
