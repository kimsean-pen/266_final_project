I love you, porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
And I'll be glad
Yes I loves you, porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands
If you can keep me
I wants to stay here with you forever
I've got my man
I love you, porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man
Someday I know he's coming to call me
He's going to handle me and hold me
So, it' going to be like dying, porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes I know I'll have to go
I love you, porgy,
Don't let him take me
Honey, don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man
