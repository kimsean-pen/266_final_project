There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please, don't you cry anymore, can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me, please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow, can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me, why did you deceive me?
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore

Nevermore
Nevermore
