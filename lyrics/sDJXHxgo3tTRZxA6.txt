To be someone must be a wonderful thing
A famous footballer or rock singer
Or a big film star
Yes, I think I would like that.
To be rich and have lots of fans
Have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man
And be number one
And liked by everyone
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me, man, and I dig them
And the bread I spend
Is like my fame, it's quickly diminished
And there's no more swimming in a guitar- shaped pool,
No more reporters at my beck and call,
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk
No more taxis, now we'll have to walk
But didn't we have a nice time?
Didn't we have a nice time?
Oh, wasn't it such a fine time?
I realize, I should have stuck to my guns
Instead of shit out to be one of the bastard sons
And lose myself.
I know it was wrong, but it's cost me a lot.
There's no more drinking when the club shuts down
I'm out on my arse with the rest of the clowns
It's really frightening without a bodyguard
So I stay confined to my lonely room
But didn't we have a nice time?
Didn't we have a nice time?
Oh, wasn't it such a fine time?
To be someone must be a wonderful thing.
