I don't want to get over you
I guess I could take a sleeping pill and sleep at will
And not have to go through what I go through
I guess I should take Prozac, right and just smile all night
At somebody new, somebody not too bright but sweet and kind
Who would try to get you off my mind, I could leave this agony behind
Which is just what I'd do if I wanted to but I don't want to get over you
'Cause I don't want to get over love
I could listen to my therapist, pretend you don't exist
And not have to dream of what I dream of
I could listen to all my friends and go out again
And pretend it's enough or I could make a career of being blue
I could dress in black and read Camus
Smoke clove, cigarettes and drink Vermouth
Like I was 17, that would be a scream but I don't want to get over you
