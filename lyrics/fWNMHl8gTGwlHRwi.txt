You don't know me, I don't know you
That's what we tell ourself inside of our little heads
We could never love again
You don't know me, I don't know you
That's what it's gonna be if you let yourself get in the way
Of what the child inside you says

And if you had another bad romance
Give it another go
It could be beautiful
Wouldn't you like to know?

Sometimes you just gotta leap – yeah
Jump out and just feel the breeze – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are!
Sometimes it's just gonna hurt – yeah
But you gonna live and learn – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are unstoppable!

So take a breath and just dive in
Keep on climbing
Scars are a part of you
We can learn to understand
Carry your heart in your hand

And you will have another grand romance
Like it's do or die
Never giving in
Always let your heart win

Sometimes you just gotta leap – yeah
Jump out and just feel the breeze – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are!
Sometimes it's just gonna hurt – yeah
But you gonna live and learn – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are unstoppable!

You don't know me, I don't know you
Yeah we just wanna be loved
We just have to be loved
We're not getting enough

Sometimes you just gotta leap – yeah
Jump out and just feel the breeze – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are!
Sometimes it's just gonna hurt – yeah
But you gonna live and learn – yeah
You're stronger than you believe you are
You are unstoppable!
