Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was meant for you)
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was made to groove)
Here we are in the room together

Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood
So put your purse down and take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty
You'll love what we gonna do

Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was meant for you)
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was made to groove)
Won't you pull back the sheets and lay down

Put your head upon my shoulders

Let me tell you how I wanna feel
You're the girl that knows my pleasure
So let me go down and find my treasure
Let me see where my pearl is at
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

('cause it was meant for you)
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
('cause it was made to groove)
The cutie pies they all know
They can always lay on my pillow
