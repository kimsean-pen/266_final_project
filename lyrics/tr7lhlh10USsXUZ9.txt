When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke
Like I did when you stayed, you stayed
Till the second round
When I grow old, the sun will coat
Shine on every youth stain, youth stain
Never setteling down

Aims the wonder I keep you close
You're the water to clench my throat
And if I never let you go
Will you keep me young, keep me young

When I grow old, my weathered soul
And memories reclusive, elusive
Help me take them out
So pretty young and call my bluff
And help me out when you say, you say
There's no room for doubt

Say I'm stronger, and keep me close
And be the water and test my cold
And if I never let you go
Will you keep me young, keep me young

Oh, when my heart stops beating
And my blood turns cold
And oh, when my heart stops beating
And my breath won't throw in though
When my heart stops beating
When you go, oh no, I won't

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh, when my heart stops beating

And my blood turns cold
And oh, when my heart stops beating
And my breath won't flow
And oh, when my heart stops beating
When you go oh no I
When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke
But just as long as you stay, you stay
I found a way out
