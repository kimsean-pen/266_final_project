It was a thousand pound weight
Moon down on the sun
I lost you sleeping
Took off with my fun
You'll find the door on the other side, other side

I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside

You crawl like tipped wine
Cheap tricks, dirty calls
Watching paint dry is good for the walls
Its good for the walls
Silence is deep never what you'd think

I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside

Pressure is building up

It was the great escape
Foiled guards left in wait
I changed, I came undone
Inside the cell I won

I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
I'll waste, I'll waste, I'll waste inside the cage
