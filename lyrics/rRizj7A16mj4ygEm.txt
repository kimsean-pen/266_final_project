All this time you thought you had me down
Sure you had snuffed me out
Undermined, you made me come undone
I was your smoking gun

You'd hold me (you'd hold me)
Control me (control me)
You stole me (you stole me)
Your plan almost broke me
Ashes remind me
Just who am I

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)

Lost the fight
You're not the chosen one
But you'll miss me when I'm gone
Reignite
You lost your grip on me
And now I blaze wild and free
You'd hold me (you'd hold me)
Control me (control me)
You stole me (you stole me)
Your plan almost broke me
Ashes remind me
Just who am I

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)

Ashes remind me

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
