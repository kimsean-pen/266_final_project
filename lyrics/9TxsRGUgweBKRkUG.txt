Yesterday, as I went out of the house
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
Lying face down in the sewer
I got up closer and realized that I knew her
All her organs coming from her inside
Slashed up skin sliced up hide
Turned over and saw the tire tracks on her head

That's when I realized she was dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead

Twisted body chopped off feet
She's dead, can't do no harm
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
I wonder, how much would I pay
Her last breath has been spent
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled

Was the rodents using her hair as a nest
Chewed off toes on her chopped off feet
I took a picture 'cause I thought it looked neat

But the thing I liked seeing the best
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead

Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Her last breath has been spent
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
I know, that she won't really be missed
and giver her a little kiss
But make it look good at her funeral

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of red
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
Your dead mommy right in front of me
I hope she dies twenty times more

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Her last breath has been spent
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
I wonder, how much would I pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way
