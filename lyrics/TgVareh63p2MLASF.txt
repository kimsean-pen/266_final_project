Red Bull in my hands (Yeah), feels like I got wings
Lotta people in my face, but I can't hear a thing
It's like my head's up in the clouds, head's up in the clouds
And I ain't coming down, no

Just turn the music on, just let me get lost (Hey!)
I swear that I'ma lose it if somebody turns it off (Hey!)
What are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music up, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

Snapback on my head, I'm so motivated
Nike's on my feet, understand the situation
Yeah, this is not a game, this is not a game

You ain't gon' bring me down, no
Yeah, I mean what I say, and I say what I mean
You best wipe off that hater look before you make me scream

What, are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

I got the adrenaline, rhyme like I'm a veteran
Fine, I've been ahead of the game, no way I'm settlin'
Drained, but I'ma get it in, lame, this is a medicine
Hey, you get the medic kit beats 'cause I don't let 'em live
Fast, better keep pedalin', blast you with the pen again
Laugh, but I'm ahead of them
Act like I don't get it, then that is when I enter in rap
Until I never can, cash, it is irrelevant, passion is the element
Laps around these other men, pass 'em who you runnin' with
Facts is what I'm coming with, back, but I ain't never left

Snap and I will never get wack, you better get a grip
Last isn't a medal, it's glass and I'ma shatter it
Who do you think you're battling?
Who do you think you're laughing at?
I am not a comedian, man, it don't even matter
If you don't know what I'm saying, you better do what the chorus says

You don't know what the chorus is?
Turn up on the choruses!

Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

Turn the music
Turn the music
Up
You must be out your mind
You must be out
