When the Earth split in two
I was I, you were you
I'll run for you, run for me too
When the war rose and fell
And the oceans are swell
I'll run for you, run for me too

Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
Come on, Sir
Now I need an answer
I won't be gone with the goners
Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer

I fear the future
When the club come and go
To the top of your skull
I'll run for you, what can I do?
When the war start anew
In our bed, in our room
I'll come for you (I'll come for you)
Come for me too

Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
Come on, Sir
Now I need an answer
My baby's lost to the monster
Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
I fear the future
