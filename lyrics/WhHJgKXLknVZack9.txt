And if I drown in this sea of devotion
Just a stone left unturned
My need is deep wide endless oceans
Feel it furious the fire burns on

Let there be love, everlasting
And it will live eternally
Will we receive without ever asking?
I'm just curious

Got to find me somebody
But there's nobody to love me
And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me

Somebody tell me
How could there be nobody, nobody to love me
And this life is so empty
There's nobody to love me

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more

And if I drown in this sea of devotion
Just a stone left unturned
My need is deep wide endless oceans
Feel it furious the fire burns on

Let there be love, everlasting
And it will live eternally
Will we receive without ever asking?
I'm just curious

Don't want to see me crying
Just want to see me flying
I need to get so high and
Want somebody to blow my mind

Don't want to see me crying
Just want to see me flying
I need to get so high and
Want don't you blow my mind
(Blow my mind, blow my mind)

Got to find me somebody
But there's nobody
To love me
(Anybody could love me)

And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me
(Anybody could love me)

Somebody to hold my hand
Someone who understands
Somebody to help me write
The poetry of life

Someone to love me
Someone who loves me
(Ooh baby)

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more

Got to find me somebody
But there's nobody to love me
And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me

(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)

(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)
(Most every feeling)
