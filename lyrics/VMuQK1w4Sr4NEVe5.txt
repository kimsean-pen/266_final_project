See my feet on the ground
But it feels like the world's gravity drowned
When I'm with you, I'm high

Instead of hiding my face
My mind's in your eyes
Can your love embrace
Me as I am?

In the silence you stare at the world
Your eyes are screaming to be heard
I want to learn you inside out

Time isn't on our side
All we have is now
For the rest of our lives
Let's stay up all night

In the silence you stare at the world
Your eyes are screaming out to be heard
I want to learn you inside out

All that changes is time
Can't keep you inside of me
You're out of my mind
I wear you on my sleeve

In the silence you stare at the world
Your eyes are screaming to be heard
I want to learn you inside out
I see all that you want to be
Look into your soul
Looking right back at me
I want to learn you inside out
