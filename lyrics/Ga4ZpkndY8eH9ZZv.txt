Small boy, big teeth
Going in for a bite
Small world big dreams
Spilling ink on your life
And now the champagne's raining on your window
And you're all alone
Dream house built inside a snow globe
But there's no one home

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

You can have it all but you never stop
'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top
And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough
You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

Too late, freight train
Spinning out of control
And I've been waiting at every station
you didn't notice at all
Looking for a rose without a thorn
trapped in your thoughts
And they'll never see the calm before the storm
when you missed the drops

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

You can have it all but you never stop
'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top
And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough
You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

And now the champagne's raining on your window
And you're all alone
Dream house built inside a snow globe
But there's no one home

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

You can have it all but you never stop
'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top
And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough
You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on, the cherry on top
