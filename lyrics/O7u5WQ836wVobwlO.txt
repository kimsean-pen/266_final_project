Don't leave yet
It's still early and I haven't even said a word
And I'm hoping that I might upset you
By saying what I want to
Cause it's not like you don't know I've fallen for you
But it's in my head and that's where you can't see it
and I thought that maybe if I had to
Bite the tips of my fingers
I could stumble over words
And tell you just how far
before I hit the ground
And I'm the type to think of all the wrong things to say
And I will shut myself up
And I'll never come out-
I'll close all my doors and only show you the black spots
Where my eyes once were-
I can say this-
I can say this-
I can Say this-
I can collect myself deep down
And then come out punching
I can collect myself down
And then come out punching
And I'll scream out loud
