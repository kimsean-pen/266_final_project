Save me from me
Go on and leave me
I'm not sure you need me
So don't cry over me

Save me from me
Go on and leave me
I'm not sure you need me
So don't cry over me

If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need
If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need

If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need
If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need

Save me from me
Take me out to breathe
This time I'm ready
Ready to escape
Round and round, I'm turning around, ah
I'm in a cage, so help me to fly
Up in the sky I'm feeling high
I see the moon, my heart is full
I see the moon, my heart is full

If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need
If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need

If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need
If you wanna stay growing up with me
If you wanna go I'm the one you need
