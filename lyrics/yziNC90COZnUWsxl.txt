There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight, don't say goodnight

Walkin' down the street, keepin' hush,
Hush on the scene
No one knows you, such a mystery
Opposite of fun 'til you turn the power on
Then you come out turnin' up the heat

Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your roof is on fire, you're losing control

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight don't say goodnight

Dancing with your hands
Turning strangers into friends
Touch the keys please and unlock my heart
You're free to be a freak
Change your picture every week
Show the camera you're a super star

Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your roof is on fire, you're losing control

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight don't say goodnight

It's no debate, when I think of you can't stay on track
'Cause I can't wait, can't stay on track, can't hide the fact
You're all I want, you're all I need
Let's get this party started
Kick it hard just you and me

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight don't say goodnight
