I'll cross the dark side of the moon
I'll do the same with the rings of Saturn
I'll stay awake through the Martian winter
But in the end what does it matter?
And I'll look to the sky for any signs to justify
Or offer reasons why
There can't be a you and I

I am watching from the outside
Dying to be on the inside
It is cold here, it is freezing
While you're asking the impossible
Because it is impossible to be this alone

To be this alone

I cross the dark side of the moon
And cross my heart and hope for this madness
To end very soon before I end in a sea of sadness
And I'm watching from the outside
Dying to be on the inside
And I'm watching from the outside
When I'm lying to be on the inside
And you're asking the impossible
If you want me this alone
Alone, alone, alone
