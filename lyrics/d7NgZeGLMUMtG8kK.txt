Lonesome soul
Where did you go?

An aging wall of stone impedes the path
Guarding the old man's tranquil hearth
Forever alone, awaiting the unknown

Hoi polloi. Hoi hoi polloi
He has turned his back on you
Hoi polloi. Hoi hoi polloi
Ward his solemn soul from you
Never held, never felt love

Cold and tired
The old man dies

A raging fire befall the path
Holding the ashes of his lair
Forever alone, forever at home

Hoi polloi. Hoi hoi polloi
He has turned his back on you
Hoi polloi. Hoi hoi polloi
Ward his solemn soul from you
Never held, never felt love
