Look it's clearing out
Girl it's getting late
You're way too slumped, you're stumbling drunk
Time to call it a day
You don't want to go far
This city's a maze
Go in and out
There ain't no doubt
You're gonna find your way

Ooh you're lookin' for your rock
Cause now you're lean in
Should be actin' calm but
In the inside girl you're screaming
Pullin' out your phone to try and
Get into my mind state
I was thinking of you then I
Feel my pocket vibrate

Wonder if I'm gonna answer
I don't want to hear you banter
Sorry girl just mind my manners
Sometimes I'm just feelin' real tall
Just know I'll answer your call

Oh baby, I'm always on call
Oh baby, I'm always on call
Oh baby, I'm always on call, I'm always on call, I'm always on

Look it's getting tight
They can't get in
They're out the door
They're wanting more
Now you can see my grin
You don't want to get out
This place is an escape
Light up the sign
In perfect time
and I just call it fate

What are we losin'
Steady movin' right to the break of dawn
Somethin' you crave just ride the wave
Knew it would last this long
Words are healing and stealing
They see I'm building the hype
I need to hear you now,
Can't waste no time to type

Feelin' so potent
You know it
Aura can never be stolen
Vibe is unspoken emotion
If you're on the edge
Baby don't fall
Cause oh baby
I'm always on call

Oh baby, I'm always on call
Oh baby, I'm always on call
Oh baby, I'm always on call, I'm always on call, I'm always on
