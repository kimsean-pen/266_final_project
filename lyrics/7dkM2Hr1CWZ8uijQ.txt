Golden sunlight Venus star so bright
Ocean tide bejeweled water child

Unholy daughter of the light
Her morning star is on the rise

Moons in her eyes so lost in time
Her diamond fire laurel burning high

Unholy daughter of the light
Her morning star, the brightest in the sky

The scarlet woman
Of the rising dawn
The scarlet woman
The darkest of them all

You give yourself to the night
Your emerald eyes an ocean wide
By earth and water, wind and fire
Riding high through time
The temple gates are open wide
As above, so below

Rise my morning star
Oh morning star

Unholy daughter of the light
Her morning star is on the rise
Unholy daughter of the light
Her morning star, the brightest in the sky
