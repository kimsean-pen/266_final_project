Rise and shine, Clementine
There is something about you
Do you think you can dance
Cause I'm willing to stay
Fade away and ride along

Sing a song, make it long
Cause there's nothing without you
All I need is a chance
And I'm willing to play, not today
And ride on, on and on

(Yeah, we're all)
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna step on
As we drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow

We've broken our lives
Innocence of our souls
We can drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow

You're the man, Clementine
'Cause I can't live without you
I got something to say
But you've already made
Made your way, so ride on

When you're gone, here's a song
I've been thinking about you
I'll remember your ways
And the clues that you gave, gave away
So ride on, on and on

(Yeah, we're all)
Yeah, we're all just killing time and having fun
Here in the sun

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna step on
As we drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow

We've broken our lives
Innocence of our souls
We can drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow

I gave you all you gave another
I hold the wheel, you light the flame

When there's nowhere to hide
Yeah we're gonna step on
As we drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow

We've broken our lives
Innocence of our souls
We can drink from the flame
That was burning in the meadow
