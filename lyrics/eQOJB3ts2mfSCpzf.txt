I was sent down here for a mission
Like a chess player in position
Gotta play it right
Gotta gotta play it right
I'ma fuck up sometimes, but it's alright

At the end of the day you still love me
It's been a while so I know you trust me
Gotta gimme love
Gimme gimme gimme love
Think you know me well enough?
Well it ain't enough

There is no need to wait
Give it your hardest but that's what it takes, oh-whoa-oh
Darlin', just show your face
I remember the time that I heard you say, oh-whoa-oh

I don't need your touch
I just need your trust
I need it
I don't need your touch
I just need your trust
I need it

To the ones who know they're gifted
Don't give up when the energy's shifted
Gonna be alright
Gonna gonna be alright
Gonna see a lot of dark on the way to light

At the end of the day it's a good time
Gotta be grateful for the whole ride
So we keep it up
Gotta gotta keep it up
Think you know me well enough?
Well it ain't enough

There is no need to wait
Give it your hardest but that's what it takes, oh-whoa-oh
Darlin', just show your face
I remember the time that I heard you say, oh-whoa-oh

I don't need your touch
I just need your trust
I need it
I don't need your touch
I just need your trust
I need it

I need it
I need it
