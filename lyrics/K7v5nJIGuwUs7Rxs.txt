They came once
And they will come again
Their sails darken the moon
Black flags waving in the night
They think they'll catch us unawares
The fires were lit in the night
Their ships carried by rushing waves

But the salmon sang what he heard
The eagle told what he saw

The fires were lit in the night
The fires were lit in the night

Their slave-ships the foams spat out
The raiders of the black waves
They moored their ships to our shores

But the salmon sang what he heard
The eagle told what he saw

The fires were lit in the night
Can you see the pyres on the coast
The fires in the night
From hill to hill the message rings
We know they are coming

Behold the pyres on the coast
The fires in the night
From hill to hill the message rings
We know they are coming

Into bears turned our men
Into wolves our brave women
Into birds our children
Into fire our wise elders

But the salmon sang what he heard
The eagle told what he saw

The fires were lit in the night
Can you see the pyres on the coast
The fires in the night
From hill to hill the message rings
We know they are coming

Behold the pyres on the coast
The fires in the night
From hill to hill the message rings
We know they are coming
We know they are coming
