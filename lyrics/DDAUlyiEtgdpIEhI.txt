It's getting hard to sit here everyday
Pretend I'm still the same
With all the noise, it never goes away
How easy we're replaced
I try and I try but I'm slipping
Too lost to find what I'm missing
Too paralyzed by the fear of being forgotten
I try and I try but I'm slipping
Too lost to find what I'm missing
Too paralyzed by the fear of being forgotten
Will I be remembered or will I be lost in loving eyes?
Will I be remembered or I'll hold off
eternity if you can promise you'll wait
If you can promise me I, feel them move my body from the scene
But my heart still beats
Lost in the shock of all that's happening
Too real to be a dream
I try and I try but I'm slipping
Too lost to find what I'm missing
Too paralyzed by the fear of being forgotten
I try and I try but I'm slipping
Too lost to find what I'm missing
Too paralyzed by the fear of being forgotten
Will I be remembered or will I be lost in loving eyes?
Will I be remembered or I'll hold off
eternity if you can promise you'll wait
If you can promise me
