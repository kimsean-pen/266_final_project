Boofiness
Half in us
Often makin' walls small like
All fall like
Facin' us
Hopeful like, who lose you
Often makin' walls small like
All fall like
Facin' us

Who feelin'
Two feelin's
The girl she faded first
But im the father fare
She wasn't to my missin'
And imma feed her 10
And if she wrap back up I might go in champagne

I hear fakin' ragin' us
Praisin' us
I hear boolin' booful moods in both of us
I hear mixin' loose with us
Faith fucks, no trust
Until you find a real friend

Bougie buddy bitches who you need to get past
Delete 'em and cut 'em down

Boofiness
Half in us
Often makin' walls small like
All fall like
Facin' us
Hopeful like, who lose you
Often makin' walls small like
All fall like
Facin' us

All pour like
All flow like
All ball, dice
No g rice
Three five four, five four three
T-p-g o-f-g

Often makin raise rivers
So I fuck how you feel fellow
Don't you hate it when it starts to feel yellow
Don't you wish you had a partner here?
Don't you wish you had a real friend?

Bougie buddy bitches who you need to get past
Delete 'em and cut 'em down

Crank old cut em niggas
They all need to get gas, lead em and cut em down

Boogie buddy bitches who you need to get past
Lead em and cut em down

Baby please
Be patient, while out on vacation
All round in my station
All in on that bae shit
I need you to pipe up
Ya you need to pipe up
Need to puts your hands on
Need to put your hands up
I need you to be patient
I know you've been waitin'
I've been off the deep end
Trying to get straight and
I've been in Topanga, tryna get my thang up
I've been at the moka trying not to choke up
Boogie bitch bore me
Want you to be gorey
Fuck me like you sorry
Treat me like your money
Get it like it's funny
Drip it like it's honey
Eat it like im bummy
Leave it in her tummy
I hear fakin' ragin' us, praisin' us
I hear boolin' booful moods in both of us
I hear mixin' loose with us
Faith fucks, no trust
Until you find a real friend
