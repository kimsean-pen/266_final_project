I tell you what we're gonna do
What you need to know
What you gotta get to get where you wanna go
Never ever miss an aisle

Keep your eye on all displays
When you find your style
Everyday's a holiday
I'll show you how to work it

To find the fit that's perfect
You know that you deserve it
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (Whoa)
This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life

Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know
Grab a little Gucci bag

And some Prada shoes
(Here) take my credit card
They're all here to wait on you
Jimmy Choo calls out your name
D&G on every wall
When you can't decide
That's o.k. just buy the mall
There's no better feelin' (Oh)
There's nothing more appealin' (Yeah hey)

Couture from floor to ceiling
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (Whoa)
This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life

Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know
Can't be slow

Never stop
Fill those bags up to the top
Turn around
Try it on
Now off to the hair salon
Don't need sales
I'll just pay

There's no need for layaway
Slide your plastic
Flash your cash
Ring it up it's such a blast!

1, 2, 3, 4!
This is the good life (Good life)
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life (Good Life)
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants (Yeah hey)
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know (The good life)
Oh, oh, whoa oh, oh, whoa oh, oh
The good life
Oh, oh, whoa oh, oh, whoa oh
I'm living the good life (Whoa oh)
Oh, oh, whoa oh, oh, whoa oh, oh
The good life (Good Life)
Oh, oh, whoa oh, oh, whoa oh
I'm living the good life, whoa oh
Woo!
The good life
Yeah
