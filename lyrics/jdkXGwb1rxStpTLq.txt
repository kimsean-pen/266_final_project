My mouth is red from Gatorade
I wish that I could make a trade
The sun is hot
I try not to see my friends with clocks for heads
It makes me think about it more instead

Everybody's reaching out to me
Everybody's reaching out to me

My hair is fake
My teeth are soft
Now, I'm awake and you are not
My boyfriend's mom is very smart
If I'm deleted, it's your art
And you're just doing it to leave your mark

Everybody's reaching out to me
Everybody's reaching out to me
Trade your t-shirts, watch TV
Everybody's reaching out to me
