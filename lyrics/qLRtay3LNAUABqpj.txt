Standing by the sea
Waiting for the ending
But on the horizon
There's a new world beginning

Put the shell to your ear
And listen to the rhythm
Singing songs of the sea
It's not an illusion

We are young, we are afraid but we are free
Cool the ashes in the sand beneath your feet

The sea is our constant
There's secrets it holds
Dip your feet in the water
Let it take control

We are young, we are afraid but we are free
Cool the ashes in the sand beneath your feet

If we could breath underwater
If we could hold one another
What would we do, What would we do
We could do anything

If we could run on the sea bed
If we could let go of all regret
What would we do, what would we do
We could do anything

Take me down down down down
Deeper into the sea
(Down down down down deeper)
Take me down down down
Wrap me up in this dream
(Down down down down deeper)

Take me down down down down
Deeper into the sea
(Down down down down deeper)
Take me down down down
Wrap me up in this dream
(Down down down down deeper)

We are young, we are afraid but we are free
Cool the ashes in the sand beneath your feet

If we could breath underwater
If we could hold one another
What would we do, what would we do
We could do anything
