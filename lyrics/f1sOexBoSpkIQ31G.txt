Freedom, la la la la, freedom, follow me
(Freedom, la la la la, freedom)
Cut it!
(Freedom, la la la la, freedom, follow me)
(Freedom, la la la la, freedom)

Let me tell you, I'm vicious
Not passive aggressive
I've got my finger on the pulse
Staring straight into a hole and I get it
And I'm a savage
It's automatic
I got a way of making noise
The power to destroy with no static

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!

(Freedom, la la la la, freedom, follow me) Cut the cord!
(Freedom, la la la la, freedom)

You gotta feel courage
Embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not because it's your obsession
Be a fighter
Backbone, desire
Complicated and it stings
But we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!
Cut it!

Cut it!

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
'Cause agony bringss no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!

(Freedom, la la la la, freedom, follow me) Cut the cord!
(Freedom, la la la la, freedom, follow me)
