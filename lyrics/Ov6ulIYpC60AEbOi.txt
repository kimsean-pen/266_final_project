Take my hand, one two three
Wed will jump together through
The skylight on the sea
Become one with me
Found a gap in the folds
Between the woods

Where I will wait for you, love
With our bruised love
Love does whether has a shape
Beyond a new love

Fucking love
Before they drop the bomb make sure
We get enough
Fucking love
Fucking love
Before they drop the bomb make sure
We get enough

You blow my mind
When we come together
Away ten time
Takes two of us to breathe

You blow my mind
Into the whatever
How high is too high
Singularity

Let me know if you got free
Did your stone map lead you home
The skylight on the sea
Trust outweighs beliefs
We're just guests within these skins
Of blood and bone

Ride inside the star ship
Never twice the same trip
Hold me in a tight grip
Healing for the lovesick
Ride inside the star ship
Never twice the same trip
Hold me in a tight grip
Healing for the lovesick

Ride inside the star ship
Never twice the same trip
Don't wanna be alone
Waiting on my headstone
Ride inside the star ship
Never twice the same trip
Don't wanna be alone
Waiting on my headstone

You blow my mind
When we come together
Away ten time
Takes two of us to breathe

You blow my mind
Into the whatever
How high is too high
Singularity
