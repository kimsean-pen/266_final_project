I want, I want to grow up-up
Oh yeah
I want to grow up, I really do
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Cuz I'm sick of being immature
I want to be responsible
And I'm sick of being insecure
I want to be more comfortable
Sick of being dumb, sick of being young
I want to grow up

Yeah, I want I want to grow up-up
Oh yeah
I want to grow up, I really do
Ooo ooo
Cuz of always being bored
I think I need a schedule
And I'm so sick of being self-absorbed
Trying to be more popular (?)
Sick of being dumb, sick of being young
Sick of waiting in all the time

I'm sick of wondering what's gonna become my life
And I'm tired of having no control
Oh, oh
I've had my fun
I want to be old

Yeah, I want to grow up-up
Oh yeah
I want to grow up, I really do
Oo oo oo oo
