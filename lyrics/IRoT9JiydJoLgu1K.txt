I am Hope
And I'm comin' to fight
Hear me lookin' away
Oh!

I am Hope
And I'm ready to fight
Hear me runnin' away
Nobody knows what's right

I am Hope
And I show my knife
Hear me lookin' away
Oh!

I am Hope
And I'm open-eyed
Hear me shakin' around
Oh, oh, oh

Here am I
Lookin' for a lover to come tonight
Lookin' for a lover to breathe to life
I am you

I am Hope
And I'm ready to fight
Hear me shakin' all over
Nobody knows what's right

I am Hope
And home at night
Hear me lookin' away
Oh, oh, oh

Here am I
Lookin' for a lover to burn the night
Lookin' for a lover to breathe to life
I am you

Here am I
Lookin' for a lover to burn the night
Lookin' for a lover to breathe to life
I am you
Yeah!
