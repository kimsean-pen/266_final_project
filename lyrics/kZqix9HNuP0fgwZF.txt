It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star, and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside, and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you

I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them, too

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars," and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

And so I took your hand
Back through lamplit streets, and knew
Everything led back to you

So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And oh
And oh
And oh

I can see the stars from America
