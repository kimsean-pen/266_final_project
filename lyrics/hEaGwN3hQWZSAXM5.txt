Love Your Friends Die Laughing
Well the night gets old so I m back again.
The day just started because I m up with my old friends,
the fat smoke and funny joke.
Sitting like a sponge, letting everything soak.
And I just got the nerve get in the cage so bite me now.
We made love tonight as the result of a fight.
When you put your arms around me the whole worlds alright.
And a days worth of bitching goes down the drain
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain.
Shut up! It s my turn to talk.
Don t try and run before you learn to walk.
Because a days worth of bitching goes down the drain
when you lay in my bed and pick my brain.
I left my heart with my phone in my center console.
I left my feelings with my wallet and my keys
I feel so stupid because I came here without anything
But I m finally at ease
