We deceive the world with lies we hide
Behind the smiles we can see the home of desperate hearts
The truth is falling down
The illusion we've become
A fear we can't outrun
We're closing in our emptiness
We're broken
You alone

You can see right through this glass house we call home
You alone
You can take away the pain
Yeah, you have shown
You can break right through this glass house of our souls
Make us whole again
Make us whole
We fight to cover up the scars
From our charade there's a war between who we are

Until we make believe
It's over now
We're falling
You alone
You can see right through this glass house we call home
You alone

You can take away the pain
Yeah, you have shown
You can break right through this glass house of our souls
Make us whole again
Make us whole
(Bridge)
I'm running to escape the walls that trapped this heart in
The door is open, please come save me
Never want to hide behind the scars that I've become

That I've become
Because you alone
You can take away the pain
Yeah, you have shown
You can find a way to change

You alone
You can see right through this glass house of our souls
Make us whole again
Make us whole
Make us whole again
