Black Jack whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got that look that you know you're real bad
Yeah, baby, you're right

Everybody loves you
Baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure
I stay out of your sight

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, we're a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without ya
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me, yeah, you're trouble for me
Trouble for me

Sweet talk, here we go
Tell me something credible
You drive me crazy
Every time I smell your cigarettes and cologne

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, we're a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without ya
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me, yeah, you're trouble for me
Trouble for me

Kiss, kiss, tip your glass
I'll do whatever you ask for
But if you want my love
You can only find it on the dance floor

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you, we're a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without ya
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me, yeah, you're trouble for me

Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Yeah, you're trouble for me

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it
You got something that I like
But I might regret it
