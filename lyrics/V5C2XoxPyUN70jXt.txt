When you were asleep
And I was out walking
The voices started to speak
And they wouldn't stop talking

There were signs all around
It really got my mind racing
You were right all along
Something's gotta change

Hold on
Hold on, they're not for me
Hold on
Cause everything's coming up roses,
Roses

Now we're back on the street
Found a song that's worth singing
The bloody nose of defeat
While your victory bell's ringing,

My whole life's turned around
For this thing you keep chasing
You were right all along
That's me who's got to change

Hold on
Hold on, they're not for me
Hold on
Cause everything's coming up roses

(Hold on, Hold on)
Ah (Hold on, Hold on)
Ah (Hold on, Hold on)
(Hold on, Hold on)
Ah (Hold on, Hold on)
Ah (Hold on, Hold on)
Ah (Hold on, Hold on)

Hold on
Hold on, they're not for me
Hold on
Cause everything's coming up
Roses

(Everything's coming up roses)
(Everything's coming up roses)
(Hold on, Hold on)

Roses

(Hold on, Hold on)
(Everything's coming up)
(Hold on, Hold on)
(Everything's coming up)
(Hold on, Hold on)

Roses

(Hold on, Hold on)

Roses
