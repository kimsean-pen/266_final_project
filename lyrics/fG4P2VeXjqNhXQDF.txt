When the humming of the world has fallen silent
Sat across the table from your quiet
Pulled me from my chair like dreams and gravity colliding
Take my hand and walk with me into the night
We'll be better off there
With nothing to fear
And for a moment I'm aware

Faster now, we tumble through the waves
Remember how we stood to face the day?
Further out, pull me deeper to the peaceful waters now
I will keep you, I will hold you in the waves

When the promise of the morning lets me down
When the fog rolls in, I'm cold and all alone
It's better now, I think of how your calm would cover over
Take my hand and lead me safely back to home
We'll be better off there
With nothing to fear
And for a moment I'm aware

Faster now, we tumble through the waves
Remember how we stood to face the day?
Further out, pull me deeper to the peaceful waters now
I will keep you, I will hold you in the waves
We'll be better off there
With nothing to fear
And for a moment I'm aware

Faster now, we tumble through the waves
Remember how we stood to face the day?
Further out, pull me deeper to the peaceful waters now
I will keep you, I will hold you in the waves

Further out, pull me deeper to the peaceful waters now
I will keep you, I will hold you in the waves
