I watched the sun again, it's easy now
I've spent all night long tyring to figure out
What I've lost and what I've failed
When my feet won't hit the ground
Trying to make it, starting over
And will we ever love again?

Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

So here we are again, to make some sense of it all
All these sudden changes, maybe things are not so different
Rearrange the peices, like it's all we know
It's all we know, let it go
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?

How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
I can't put it together, what we've lost

The pieces keep falling one by one
Cause this life has us holding on
Fall tomorrow then it's gone
Fall tomorrow then I call
Hey baby, it looks like you were wrong

How can we make it?
Hey baby, are you alone tonight?

How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late
And we'll take it all

Leave the past behind
There's no one else
Tonight, tonight
And we'll take it all
Leave the past behind
There's no one else
Tonight, tonight
