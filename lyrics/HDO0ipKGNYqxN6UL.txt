Hey baby
this is not a challenge,
it just means that I love you
as much as I always said I did.

I was wrong.
I have been laughable wrong
Sandpaper, paper mâché, chalk, and hung out wet

Oh, the city and your skin
now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
I didn't have to be afraid,
I didn't have to feel so stupid
I can see myself, I can feel

That
just the slightest bit of finesse
I might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Laughing!
Discoverer!

Floating across Houston.
This is where I am.
I see the city rise up tall.
The opportunities. And possibilities.
I have never felt so called.
Remember the vodka expresso night of discovery
Remember that? Laughing! Discovery!

Oh how I look back and reflect.
How I felt it. How It set.
I don't have to feel so wrong,
now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass.

Just the slightest bit of finesse
I might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Just the slightest bit of finesse
I might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!
