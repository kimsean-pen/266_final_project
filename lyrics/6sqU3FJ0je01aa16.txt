Well it's the hardest part you'll never know
Yeah it's the hardest part you'll never know
I tried to capture it on video
But it's the hardest part you'll never know

You push it in the ground for it to grow
I saw it on a television show
I got it from some guy i know
But it's the hardest part you'll never know
I saw the message that your lover wrote
I saw the message that your lover wrote
I sealed it safe inside an envelope
And then I hid it in the undergrouth

You burn the paper with the pen that wrote
I saw it on a television show
It helps to let the demon go
But the hardest part you'll never know

Opening you heart to someone
Fallen leaves for us no fun

Just look what's been going on
Your love's got you holding on
By you fingernails
