Not on our watch
We won't be bound to your prison
Not on our watch
New battlefields have risen

Incinerate
Incinerate the tyrants
Incinerate
Incinerate the tyrants

I see nothing but strangers
(Look what we've become) Look what we've become

Final prayer for the living
Dying hope; I see nothing but strangers
Final prayer for the living; there's a nothingness inside of us breeding

The eyes from above lurk our inner selves
Modify, sterilize, invade our consciousness
The eyes from above lurk our inner selves
Modify, sterilize, invade our consciousness

Not on our watch
We won't be bound to your prison
Not on our watch
New battlefields have risen

Incinerate
Incinerate the tyrants
Incinerate
Incinerate the tyrants

This isn't how our story ends
Giving in to decay
A stranglehold on humanity
This isn't how our story ends

Final prayer for the living
Dying hope; I see nothing but strangers
Final prayer for the living; there's a nothingness inside of us breeding

The eyes from above lurk our inner selves
Modify, sterilize, invade our consciousness
The eyes from above lurk our inner selves
Modify, sterilize, invade our consciousness

E Pluribus Unum
Incinerate the tyrants
Incinerate

Our aim is set and locked
To burn your prisons
Our aim is set and locked
E Pluribus Unum

We will incinerate
We will incinerate
We will
