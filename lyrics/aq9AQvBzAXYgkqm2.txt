Come here
I hear the music, daylight disc
Three men in black said, "Don't report this"
"Ascension," and that's all they said
Sickness now, the hour's dread

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news

Wait, let's move
I'm in fairy rings and tower beds
"Don't report this," three men said
Books by the blameless and by the dead
King in yellow, queen in red

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news

Dead leaves always give up motion
I no longer feel the motion
Where prophecy fails, the fallin' motion
Don't report this, agents of fortune

All praise
He's found the awful truth
Balthazar
He's found the saucer news
