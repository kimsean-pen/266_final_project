Can I have a moment of your time?
Just a single second so you see that indeed we'll be leaving you behind
Fall across that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells
Crashing through the clouds as it rain down the drain we know all too well
It's a living hell

Careful what you say and who you say it and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

Maybe you talked too much and you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking

When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're asking for it, asking for it
Asking

Caught up in the gutter once again
Crashing through the mud, throwing lies, cutting ties 'til the sidewalk ends
And the truth begins
Power through the point of no return
Famously deranged, all the same, hope you change, if the worm is gonna turn
It's none of my concern

Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

Maybe you talked too much and you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking

When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're asking for it, asking for it
Asking

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Asking for it
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Asking for it

Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

Maybe you talked too much and you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it
Asking for it
Asking

When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're asking for it, asking for it
Asking
You know you're asking for it, asking for it
You know you're asking for it
Asking
