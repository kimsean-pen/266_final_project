My love is like a movie scene, yeah
My touch is like a summer breeze
Your heart is lighter, make them hotter
Make you fall in love with me, in love, in love with me
So move it, move it to the floor (move it move it to the floor)
If you want it, let me know
Are you ready for me?
Watch me, watch me dip it low (Watch me, watch me dip it low)
If you want it, let me know
If you're ready, let me know
Just let me be your tropical
And watch me whine it up, whine it up
(Club keep it moving for you)
Yeah, I can be your tropical
So watch me whine it up, whine it up
(Move your weave like a tropical, ya)
(Like a tropical, ya)
My body moves along with the waves
My love is like a mountain road
You never get enough of me, yeah
Make you fall in love with me, in love, in love with me
So move it, move it to the floor (move it move it to the floor)
If you want it, let me know
Are you ready for me?
Watch me, watch me dip it low (Watch me, watch me dip it low)
If you want it, let me know
If you're ready, let me know
Just let me be your tropical
And watch me whine it up, whine it up
(Club keep it moving for you)
Yeah, I can be your tropical
So watch me whine it up, whine it up
(Move your weave like a tropical, ya)
(Like a tropical, ya)
