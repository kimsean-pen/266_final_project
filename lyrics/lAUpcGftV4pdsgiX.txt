Out past beyond the field
Inside the birches
Under rising steam:
A small room

To prove I don't exist
To show that I am beyond
This animal form
And this lost mind
Or am I?

The wood heats up and cracks
And pulls apart
The way the body groans
I transform and the stars show

I don't think the worlds still exists
Only this room in the snow
And the lights through the cold
And only this breath

I annihilate
O, abandon breath
All sensations
(Hanging in the branches
And with the glowing core exposed (exposed)
Exposed
Head first into the frozen lake
Into the lake mid-winter
Cutting through all waking thoughts
In rain and in wind and rain and blanketing night
Shown
Standing under steam rising
My life is a small fire I carry around
Coming into a clearing
Glowing coals on the wet ground
