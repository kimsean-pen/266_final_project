Well here, babe, look at you, in love with someone else
Turned out like all the others, leave me by myself
That's how it works, I guess, and you like all the rest
Guess I can handle it, if that's the way it is

I'm in love with rock 'n' roll, it satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll

I've never been the one to have no steady girl
I love the way I live, runnin' round the world
I like to fool around, I love to tear 'em down
And when I leave, you'll love to miss me when I'm gone

I got rock 'n' roll, it satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll

I can't imagine growin' old with anyone
Marching to a different drum, I hear a different song
I swear I love them all, I don't care if they're small
I don't care if they're tall, I love them anyway

I got rock 'n' roll, it satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad

I got rock 'n' roll, satisfies my soul
If that's how it is, it ain't so bad
I got rock 'n' roll, save me from the cold
If that's all there is, it ain't so bad

I got rock 'n' roll, it satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad

Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll

Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
