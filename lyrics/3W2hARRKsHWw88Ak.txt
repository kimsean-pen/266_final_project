Buzzing up with a musical attack
Rip it up with a boom sound we no lack
Got the rhythms the dub plate killa tracks
Annihilate and destroy them we do that
Letting them know that ah we come fe rock and control again
Setting the pace volume up driving them insane

Oh das right
Turn your system down
No weak heart can take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how it shatters and they break it

Pressure

Stress it jusa drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
We will turn it up but never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure

Annoying neighbors are banging on your door
Saying that they can't take your noise no more
Your bass is right in their face sounds murder raw
We ain't turning it off so call the law
Let them all know that the rockers is hard and is here to stay
Tell to move from your step and back off and just go away

Oh das right
Turn your system down
No weak heart can take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how it shatters and they break it

Pressure

Stress it jusa drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
We will turn it up but never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure

Temperature rise turn up the heat feel the pressure
Hold uno head an feel the pain from the pressure
Cannot take the noise cuz ah we bring the pressure
No bodder tell we turn the music down hold the pressure

Stress it jusa drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
We will turn it up but never down
Stress it jusa drive them underground
Cannot take the music killa sound
We will turn it up but never down
Pressure Pressure Pressure
