Now we come back from the dark side
tell me how you wanna fly
Can you get down real low for a while
maybe for another mile
When we reach the top of the mountain side
tell me where you wanna hide
Now you reach down (...?) real low
tell me where you wanna go

Will you be my light
sitting on the dark side
Will you be my light
sitting on the dark side

We'll come find you

Now we come back from the dark side
tell me how you wanna fly
Can you get down real low for a while
see you in another mile
When I stand on top of the mountain side
can we get a little wild
Now you reach on down now real low
tell me where you wanna go

Will you be my light
sitting on the dark side
Will you be my light
sitting on the dark side

Now we come back from the dark side
tell me how you wanna fly
Can you get down real low for a while
see you in another mile
When I stand on top of the mountain side
can we get a little wild
Now you reach on down real low
tell me where you wanna go

We'll come find you
