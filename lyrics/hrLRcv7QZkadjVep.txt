Well I've been dead all day
Could you tell? Could you tell?
This is where I leave here and I save myself
If there's a God in hell let us pray, let us pray
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
When I fall asleep can this fade away?

Oh my God I am so full of shit
I've been playing a part ever since I was a kid
Now the bullshit is adding up and I've had enough of it
But the crash would be incredible to see

Well I've been dead all day
Could you tell? Could you tell?
This is where I leave here and I save myself
If there's a God in hell let us pray, let us pray
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
When I fall asleep can this fade away?

I feel like Abraham on his little trip
When all he found was death and pain
And he never regretted it
Oh, there's something out there for me
So I think I'd better split
There sure as hell ain't nothing here for me

Well I've been dead all day
Could you tell? Could you tell?
This is where I leave here and I save myself
If there's a God in hell let us pray, let us pray
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
When I fall asleep can this fade away?

That night I actually prayed but I think God's forgotten my name
Cause I'd point the blame every time I got mad
So we kind of lost touch and now we've been playing phone tag

Man and his wife to be, planning their event
One couldn't contain themselves
The other was on the fence
So they silently agreed it's best to practice and pretend
'Cause keeping up appearances is key

Well I've been dead all day
Could you tell? Could you tell?
This is where I leave here and I save myself
If there's a God in hell let us pray, let us pray
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
To be cleansed of everything that we've said
When I fall asleep can this fade away?
