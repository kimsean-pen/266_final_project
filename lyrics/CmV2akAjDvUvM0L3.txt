I should've seen all the signs all around me
But I was comfortable inside these walls
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

How can you help my affliction
If you're the sickness and not the cure?
Too long I've faked this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this

I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget

I know I can never prove this illusion
You aren't the one that I thought you were
And so I learned to embrace this delusion
The line that separates us starts to blur

You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me
And you'll be the death of me
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
And you'll be the death of me
