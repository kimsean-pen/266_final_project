Well, I'm holding on, and holding it all in.
When it all goes wrong, and I just can't win.
I can't stand another sunrise, and I need a little rain
Well the angels left this city, and they won't be back again.

Now I'm leaving California and I'll never look back.
Took a picture for you, but I painted it black.
One more dream around a run away drive
Now there's one less burned out star in the sky
Leaving California tonight.

It's a broken dream in Santa Monica, crushing night
And that old moonbeam, well, it's got in my way tonight.
And the lights are in the rear-view, and the stars up in the sky
And I don't know where I'm going, baby, but it's time to say goodbye.

Now I'm leaving California and I'll never look back.
Took a picture for you, but I painted it black.
One more dream around a run away drive
Now there's one less burned out star in the sky
Leaving California tonight.

It's a one way ticket, I'm a rolling stone
I'm a goodnight kiss and I'm going, going, gone
Like wind, like fire, like rain
No, I'm never coming back again.

'cause I'm leaving California and I'll never look back.
Took a picture for you, but I painted it black.
One more dream around a run away drive
Now there's one less burned out star in the sky
Leaving California
Now I'm leaving California and I'll never look back.
Took a picture for you, but I painted it black.
One more dream around a run away drive
Now there's one less burned out star in the sky
Leaving California tonight
