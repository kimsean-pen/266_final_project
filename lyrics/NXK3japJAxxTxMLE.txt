I know what's to come
The way I'm feeling happy now
The knowing I'm drunk
Of ways of knowing it never lets me down

'Cause I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
I'm in a brawl

'Cause I won't take it lying down
Right inside the bar
The police are on their way right now
'Cause I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
Yeah I always stay too long
The ladies better sing my song, song, song, song

I got my peeps standing with me shouting, pull up your socks
'Cause we just broke the law, and now we're running from cops
I got my lip bust fighting, now there's blood on my top
And I'm still out looking for a party, somewhere to stop
I got my peeps, them telling me they know where it's at
So I pull out twenty notes and jump straight into a cab
I'm on my way to where I'm going thinking I need more Jack
But that probably ain't the brightest idea I've ever had 'cause
I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
On the run from the law
I'm looking worse for wear
I go for a door
And suddenly I find myself somewhere
Something's bound to go wrong

If I stay too long
I know I gotta get to dawn
Before they start singing my song, song, song, song
Song, song, song, song, song
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon

I got my peeps standing with me at the bar doing shots
'Cause now we're so fucking plastered, we don't know when to stop
I got my girlfriend ringing me, belling me up

I know I should probably answer, but I just can't be fucked
I got my peeps standing with me, and I'm having a blast
I'm feeling so fucking good right now, I want it to last
So I put my phone on silent, and I refill my glass
The music's so fucking banging, feel like I wanna dance
I'm at the bar when I see this chick checking me out
From afar, yes she wants my dick, nary a doubt
She's got a skirt so short, make you drool from the mouth
Looking my way as if to say I'm in with a shot
So I pull a chair up near her and her a drink
She says "cheers," I says "yeah," our glasses go clink
Now I'm being bad, in a cab, groping this girl
Once the cab is paid, we make our way up to the hotel
Now I'm in a lift, getting licked, damn this is low

But do I care? Do I fuck?
I'm on a roll, yo
