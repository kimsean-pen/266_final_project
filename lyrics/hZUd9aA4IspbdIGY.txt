Goodbye, sweet love of my life
Losing you cuts as deep as a knife
I know I did you wrong and things werent right
But I loved you girl, more than life

Goodbye, sweet love of my life
I hope he loves you like I do
And everything turns out right
Alone I'll stay with my memories of you
Goodbye sweet love
Goodbye and good night
