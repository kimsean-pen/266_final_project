Someday
we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday
we gonna dance with those lions

Someday
we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
They tellin' me it's all good just wait

You know you're gonna be there someday

Sippin' on Jim Beam ok,
Gotta get these things one day
Till then do another line you know

Searching for that other high
Stop or i gotta steal then steal

Kill or i'm gonna be killed

I got a sack in my pocket
Conscious yellin' drop it
You know we're gonna lose it

Someday
And we tryin' to hold it all together
but the devil is too clever so
I'm gona die you gonna die,

we gonna die Someday, one day i said
Someday
we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday

we gonna dance with those lions

Someday
we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
Yeaah, C'mon
Try to lie buy it ain't me, ain't me

Try to look but i can't see
Can't stop right now cause i'm too far and
I can't keep goin' cause it's too hard
In the day in the night it's the same thing
On the field on the block it's the same game
On the real if you stop then it's no pain,
but if you can't feel pain then it's no gain
Rearrange and you change and it's all bad
and you try to maintain but you fall back
and you crawl and you slip and you slide down
Wanna make it to the top better start now
So i hold my soul and i die hard
All alone in the night in the graveyard
Someday, one day i'm gonna be free
and they won't try to kill me for being me
Hey Someday
Someday
we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday
we gonna dance with those lions
Someday
we gonna break free from these chains and keep on flyin'
If you know how this is
gonna see it's not that easy
Don't stop get it till it's done
From where you are or have begun
I Said
Keep on try a little harder to see everything
you need to be
Believe in your dreams
That you see when you're asleep
Someday
we gonna rise up on that wind you know
Someday
we gonna dance with those lions
Someday
we gonna break free from these chains and keep on
keep on
keep on
keep on flyin'
(c'mon get right now)
