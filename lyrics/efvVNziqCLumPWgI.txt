Must you keep looking at me
before you looked the other way
Must you keep glaring at me
I know you look inside
And see what you made

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own me
Not all of your gloating

Must you keep looking at me
Now you see what I am
Trust
I knew what it was
I don't forget things
Thinking I'm nothing

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own me
Not all of your gloating

Pride of me
No Pride
Why
Why
Why
Why
Why
Why
Why

Must you keep looking at me
Before you looked the other way
Trust
I knew what it was
I don't forget things
Look what you've made

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own me
Not all of your gloating
