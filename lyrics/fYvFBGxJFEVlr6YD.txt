Dissolve into the air
Candles burning
into darkness
Mystery lies under the stars
Fragile worlds break apart
Farther from me
Farther from me
Too far gone from understanding
See a light in a flare
Only shadows gloom at night
Let the distance pass you by
Into darkness
it's only a matter of time
Unfamiliar haze
It's only a matter of time
