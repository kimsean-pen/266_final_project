And no, nothing ever really started with a kiss
Another night, another town, another licensed premises
I'm getting bored of all these songs I write
And the people I've become
Just to stay up late with someone

I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans
I don't want anyone to wanna hold my hand
I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans

It begins in the places that we leave behind
Every year that goes by a little less future on our minds
These girls like to pretend they can't feel anything anymore
Boys break like promises
But only behind closed doors

I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans
I don't want anyone to wanna hold my hand
I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans
(All the sad young men)
We're all beautiful now like they were beautiful then
(All the sad young men)
All the miserable girls
All the sad young men

Do you like my clothes?
My hair?
My conversation?
Did you hear me when i said you were the inspiration?
It's all meaningless now
As it was meaningless then
All the miserable girls
All the sad young men

I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans
I don't want anyone to wanna hold my hand
I don't wanna make love
I don't wanna make plans
(All the sad young men)
We're all beautiful now like they were beautiful then
(All the sad young men)

All the miserable girls
All the sad young men
All the sad young men
All the sad young men
All the sad young men
All the sad young men
All the miserable girls
All the sad young men
