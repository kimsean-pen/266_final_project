The leads are weak
The leads are weak

Fucking leads are weak
You're weak
Remember when America
Had a middle class and an upper class
That was way before the exodus
That was the America that we thought was number one
Thought would overcome, thought would never die
That was just our pride and faith

Two shitty deadly sins

I know faith isn't one of 'em, but it should have been
Cause some things are crumbling
We have no camaraderie, Just a faith
Someone would save us form despondence
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America, woooooah
"Number one America"
Was the slogan used

To keep moral up when we knew we were already cooked

Then the richer western states succeeded in secession
And the eastern ones followed right behind

Mexi-Can-America was the perfect name
That epitomized the order significance, authority
And affluence, we had turned it all around
Went from number one straight to number two (shit)
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America, woooooah
National Bankruptcy
Circumcised Society
USA dined and ditched
FOX Reports "poor is the new rich"
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America, woooooah
We called it America
