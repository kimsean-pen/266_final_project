Night, falls, and I'm alone
Skin, yeah chilled me to the bone
You, turned and you ran
Oh yeah
Oh slipped, right from my hand
Hey, blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on Jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream, doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh yeah, blue on black
Blind, oh, now I see
Truth, lies, and in between
Wrong, cant be undone
Oh slipped, from the tip of your tongue
Hey, blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on Jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead mans touch
Whisper on a scream, doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back, yeah
Blue on black
Oh, blue on black
Oh yeah

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on Jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, is a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream, doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh yeah, blue on black
Hey, blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on Jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, is a dead mans touch
Whisper on a scream, doesn't change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh, blue on black
Oh uh-oh, blue on black
Oh, blue on black
