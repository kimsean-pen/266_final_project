Words sing out into the wind,
Their meaning taken by time.

Your deep sea eyes,
Ancient stars.

We wanted only to love.
How will I find you again?
Fate or chance

A beauty
In uncertainty
We fall down
On gray white sand.

Our shadows ain
Memories

We want
Only to live
Only to love
And breath in again
You're wine
raising the night
Longing our love
and dreams of mine

Ooh,
Yellow angry waves of grass
The iron sky
Turning in the looking glass

Your deep sea eyes
Ancient stars

You were wonderful life
My only love
Sleep well
Goodnight
