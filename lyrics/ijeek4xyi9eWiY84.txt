i wont fear my rivals,
leave them in the silence,
i live in the present,
moment to moment
moment to moment
i dont fear no future,
come live on in silence,
i live in the present,
moment to moment
moment to moment
moment to moment

fears i got all messed up
tearing of and on next to mine
fears i got .?. always done
swe-e-e-e-e-t (re)-configuration
swe-e-e-e-e-t (re)-configuration

everythings standing out like its wants to feels like i've been here before
everythings standing out like a loss and feels like i've been

i wont fear my babbles
leave them in the silence
i live in the present
moment to moment
moment to moment
i wont fear no future
come live on in silence
i live in the present
moment to moment
moment to moment
moment to monent

fears i got, all messed up,
tearing of and on next to mine
fears i got ... always done
swe-e-e-e-e-t (re)-configuration
swe-e-e-e-e-t (re)-configuration

all my senses become acute,
in it, defects, in persuit,
fix piling(?)
from the thrill i had x3
fix down from the thrill i had.
