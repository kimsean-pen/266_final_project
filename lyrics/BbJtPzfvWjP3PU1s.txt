Dreams go on forever
With only one life
You cannot relieve
What you gave me never
Fear of being hurtful
Feelings left unspoken
I'm breaking myself
Out with tears
Through the years
Into you

I find myself in love
The fall of you defining me
I'm always home with her as a shield
You are me

Far away to heaven
I run with the wind
That's how I begin
Road to my deliverance
Paved with my desire
Breathing air like fire
I start to give in my last war
Where I can't walk you carry me
From now into eternity
Into you

I find myself in love
The fall of you defining me
I'm home with her as a shield
You are me

I find myself in love
The fall of you defining me
I'm home with her as a shield
You are me

I found the world through love
The door of hope you cannot see
Army of one is waiting to be
You are me
