To the dark, dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

It doesn't know, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill

It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio

Did they haul you out
On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You've gone away

It doesn't know, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill

It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio

Plastico, plastico, plastico and green green glow
Plastico, plastico, plastico, green green glow
Plastico, plastico, plastico and green green glow
Plastico, plastico, plastico

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's styrofoam deep sea landfill

It's automated computer speech
It's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio
