I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump

Hold up, easy on the syrup
We've been goin' a while
Is it time to cut the butter on a couple?
Light 'em up!
'Cause I know you gonna slip on me
A couple of times
You should think about it
Spark, will you burn for another lover?
I don't wanna waste time, but my flame's hot
Don't wanna put the lifesaver down 'til it's safe to drown
Everything you're sayin', got me out here lookin' for a meanin'
And I know it might be early, but I'm catchin' all the feelings
I forget that we are only human beings
You've been givin' me extraterrestrial readings

I love you, I mean it if you do
Tell me, we're sippin' the same brew
Hooked on the Kool-Aid, I'm thirsty for good news

I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump
I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump

(What, what, what)
The fuck, I want you to show up
Would you throw me a bone?
I've been out here makin' lemonade with all your lemons
You would think by now I'd have learned a hundred lessons
But I'm stupid with it (1, 2, 3, 4)
Cut, feel the burn of another scene
I don't wanna get mean on my sixteenth
But you would never wanna listen to me
When I beg and plead (Bitch, please)
I don't wanna have it your way, I want you to have it mine
It's a give a little, take a little, but you only takin' all the time
You got me twisted, on my knees and cross my eyes
I'm in denial, it's too late to compromise

I love you, I mean it if you do
Tell me, we're sippin' the same brew
Hooked on the Kool-Aid, I'm thirsty for good news

I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much (Way too fucking much)
Don't you play with me (Don't play)
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump
I, I, I love you more than I love myself, boy
And I love myself way too fucking much
Don't you play with me (No, no, don't you play about it)
I love you more than I love myself, boy
And my love for you, caught it from the jump

More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love myself (more than I love, more than I love)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love myself (more than I love, more than I love)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love myself (more than I love, more than I love)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love myself (more than I love, more than I love)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love (more, more, more, more)
More than I love myself (more than I love, more than I love)
More than I love
More than I love
More than I love myself
