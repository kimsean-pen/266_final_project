Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be fine from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be fine from time to time

I'm thinkin' somethin' like Olivia is
What I need to find

There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

I'm thinkin' somethin' like Olivia could
Keep me through the night

Now I'm not tryin' to steal
No love away from no one babe
Now I'm not tryin' to steal
No love away from no one babe

But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd hate to say, I'd let her in

Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
I keep thinkin' somethin' like Olivia is
What I need to find
Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
Somethin' like Olivia
