Something felt so good when you said my name
(I will)

All that I want from you
Is to feel the same (I will)

Stay for the night
I wanna show you what the real you is like (Oh oh ohh)
Turn back the time
I'm only living when you're here in my life
And now you're leaving

My heart's, lonely without you
My eyes, only see you and me
Stupid, thinking about you
It's hard, hard, cause you make me feel good

Cause you make me feel good

Maybe this is love or
Maybe I'm insane (Yeah)
(I will)

Temptations pulling me
Now I can't scape (I will)

Give me the night
I wanna know what lucky secrets you hide (Oh oh ohh)
Lay by my side
I'm only living when you're here in my life
And now you're leaving

My heart's, lonely without you
My eyes, only see you and me
Stupid, thinking about you
It's hard, hard, cause you make me feel good

Cause you make me feel good
