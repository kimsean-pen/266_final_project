My heart's beating
Is it serious?

You're begging me, begging me
I know I got you on the second beat
Oh oh oh oh

But baby back to me
I need to get you maybe baby back a beat
We'll see if you can heat it up and handle that
Go back and get your hat on baby
Hit the track, take that
We're on a mission and it's outta whack, that's a fact
Mission impossible
And that is that, that is that

You gotta listen up
Cos I'm writing the rules yeah
I'll tell you where to begin
You think that your Mr-know-it-all
Yeah but tonight you better think again

You gotta listen up boy
I'm not trying to fool ya
I'll tell you where to begin
You think that you're comin back for more
Yeah but tonight you better think again

The rhythm and the bass, up in my face
But you're block, block, blocking the floor
I'm running out of time, don't need no lines
From a d- d- d- dinosaur

You're begging me, begging me
I know I got you on the second beat
Oh oh oh oh
But baby back to me
I need to get you maybe baby back a beat
We'll see if you can heat it up and handle that
Go back and get your hat on baby
Hit the track, take that
We're on a mission and it's outta whack, that's a fact
Mission impossible
And that is that, that is that

I gotta lotta gadgets, I gotta lotta you
And if you you wanna grab it
Go and break all the rules

I gotta lotta gadgets, I gotta lotta burn
So come on learn

I know I want you to

The rhythm and the bass, up in my face
But you're block, block, blocking the floor
I'm running out of time, don't need no lines
From a d- d- d- dinosaur

You're begging me, begging me
I know I got you on the second beat
Oh oh oh oh
But baby back to me
I need to get you maybe baby back a beat
We'll see if you can heat it up and handle that
Go back and get your hat on baby

Not in love, not in war
Cause I got something to fight for
