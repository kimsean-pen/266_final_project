I like having hurt
So send the pain below
Where I need it
You used to beg me to take care of things
And smile at the thought of me failing
But long before having hurt
I'd send the pain below
I'd send the pain below

Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
I'd send the pain below
Much like suffocating
I'd send the pain below

You used to run me away all while laughing
Then cry about the fact 'til I returned
But long before having hurt
I'd send the pain below
I'd send the pain below

Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
Much like suffocating
I'd send the pain below
Much like suffocating
I'd send the pain below
Much like suffocating

I can't feel my chest
Need more
Drop down
Closing in
I can't feel my chest
Drop down

I like having hurt
So send the pain below
So send the pain below

Much like suffocating (so send the pain below)
I like having hurt
Much like suffocating (so send the pain below)
Much like suffocating (so send the pain below)
Much like suffocating (so send the pain below)
