Having you tonight
I will, when you're unbound
Oh, there's something inside that stirs when I see you

When you're on the down
I'll nurse you back to pieces

Oh-ah Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah
Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah

Pick up the phone and talk like I'm crazy
Oh, there's something inside that stirs when I see you
I'll watch as every thread undoes itself
And when you come around
I'll nurse you back to pieces

Oh-ah Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah
Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah

When you're on the down
I'll nurse you back to pieces

Looking back tonight
I said, I said, I said.
I'll find your missing pieces
I'll love you back to pieces
Oh-ah Oh-ah Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah
Oh, there's something inside that stirs when I see you
Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah!
Ohhhh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-ah
