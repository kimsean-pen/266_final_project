Lonesome tears
I can't cry them anymore
I can't think of what they're for
Oh they ruin me every time

But ill try to leave behind some days
These tears just can't erase
I don't need them anymore

How could this love
Ever turning
Never turn its eye on me

How could this love
Ever changing
Never change the way I feel

Lazy sun your eyes catch the light
With promises that might
Come true for a while

Oh I'll ride farther than I should
Harder than I could
Just to meet you there

How could this love
Ever turning
Never turn its eye on me

How could this love
Ever changing
Never change the way I feel
