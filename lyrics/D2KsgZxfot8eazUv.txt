You try to hide
The fact hidden from yourself
Your own favourite entertainer
Is none other than
The one we call you
And you need the others
To fortify your disgust
For the worst of us, to the rest of us

Entertain the thought that
We are still alive
Entertain the notion
Of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions
And our fears
Just pull us in
And take us down

I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed
Oblivious by design
Not susceptible to any mind

Entertain the thought that
We are still alive
Entertain the notion
Of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions
And our fears
Just pull us in
And take us down

I can take
What's being given
I can down
Whatever comes
I will do
What you deem necessary

My fear compels me
My fear compels me
No more fictitious needs
I will not be made a mockery
No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see
Without a sense of danger
Everything is lost
In the name of entertainment
We are doomed

Entertain the thought that
We are still alive
Entertain the notion
Of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions
And our fears
Just pull us in
And take us down
