High upon that blasted, fortified plateau
within their sanctuary of salt and sorrow

Morbid throngs march to the call of umbral gods
outside comprehension

Dark crusade, from deathless realm they came
to amalgamate dimensions

certa enim gloria.
numquam non parata.
Deus noster pro nobis
Limo vincit omnia

Tainted youth, catechized legions of untruth
do they not yet comprehend?

Now ensnared by the web of their deceit
acquiescent, servile, weak

This ritual of loathsome conjuration
akashic machinations from shadow priests who utter
the gathas of Mollusca
that poisons our existence
between purity and putrescence they draw power

The bloodshed of the ancestors
Forsaken dead
Sacrificed so the worlds might mend
all filaments have opened
the shadows bleed
infinity spewing forth from the gaping breach

We shall dredge the depths of their pestiferous swamp
and the last bastion of light shall fall into ruin

Once besieged, the walls shall liquify beneath
the force of Rhaexorog's harrowing screams

Twin blasphemies; Kak and Ick shall come together
to rouse their father from the nether
