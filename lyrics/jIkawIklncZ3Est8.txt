Deep into the flesh the arrows cut
From the hope of the hunter's bow
Wounded we fall
With bleeding hearts we crawl
Taking shelter from the arrows

Cut the trembling flesh
And don't let the tears tame you
Rip your arrows out
And make them cut deeper
Crush my mouth, for it still sings praises to you
Run the blood out from my throat
For I'm still your's

"And the hope will die
When the curtains fall
And silence the pain"

We drink from the well
The well of poisoned hope
Until the water will burn
All pure hearts away

Keep your eyes on the wounds
Those rivers will run dry soon
Will it leave you wanting more
The taste of flesh that bleeds in your honour
