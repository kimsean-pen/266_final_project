Let me say that since, babe
Since we've been together
Ooo, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my whole life with you

Let me say that since, babe
Since we've been together
Oo, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Good or bad, happy or sad

Why, oh tell me, why do people break up
Ooo, and turn around and make up
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me, oh would ya baby
Just being around you is all I see
So baby

Let's, we ought stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Let's, let's stay together, stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Never need to chase after me

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Good or bad, happy or sad
Baby let's
Good or bad, happy or sad

Let's, let's try to stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Good or bad, happy or sad
