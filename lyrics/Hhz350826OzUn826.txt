(Oh my God! Something's gone terribly wrong and I can't find a way!)
(Can someone...)
My heart is racing faster!
(Save us from...)
We tried so hard; and lost control!
Of everything we've loved and owned!

So this beautiful dream has become a never ending nightmare.
A stranger haunts us in our sleep.
We're terrified. We're terrified!
You're the only one who knows this!
(You're the only one!)
I hope you die with this on your lips!
(On your lips...)

Of everything we've loved and owned.

This is a disaster and I can't get past her.
I'm breathing and I can't feel a thing.
I need a cure for this disease; and holding back won't change a thing.
Your words aren't enough. I need to see more.
Lay down the sword and shed the armor!

You're the only one who knows this!
(You're the only one!)
I hope you die with this on your lips!
(On your lips...)
You're the only one who knows this!
(You're the only one!)
I hope you die with this on your lips!
(Your lips! Your lips! Die with this on your lips!)
