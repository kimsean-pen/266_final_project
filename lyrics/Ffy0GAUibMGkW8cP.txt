It's hard living in a broken world
Too much division in a broken world
Nobody listens in a broken world
We're on a mission, I wanna know

When it's dark as a dungeon can you be a light?
Can you bring peace in the middle of a fight?
When you see separation can you unite?
And when you see 'em doing wrong can you do what's right?

From the bottom of our hearts,
To the top of our lungs
We're crying out for unity
And the battle's just begun
Let love be your foundation,
Let wisdom be your guide
'Til the problems that we're facing
Can no longer divide
A broken world

It's hard living in a broken world
Too much division in a broken world
Nobody listens in a broken world
We're on a mission, I wanna know

If your enemy was drowning would you pull him to shore?
If a stranger was starving would you open your door?
Are there any revolutionaries here anymore?
And what you gonna be remembered for?

From the bottom of our hearts,
To the top of our lungs
We're crying out for unity
And the battle's just begun
Let love be your foundation,
Let wisdom be your guide
'Til the problems that we're facing
Can no longer divide
A broken world

Let's go!

From the bottom of our hearts,
To the top of our lungs
We're crying out for unity
And the battle's just begun
Let love be your foundation,
Let wisdom be your guide
'Til the problems that we're facing
Can no longer divide
A broken world
A broken world
