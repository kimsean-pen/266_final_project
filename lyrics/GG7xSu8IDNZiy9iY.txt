You fell from May today contempt for someone else
Until you've given up your dream
And all your needs have ever been too far to see
In silence you have left from me

You're the sky to the secret side on a secret line
Where the reapers will rise and your face will redeem
And it's up to your destiny, of agony
And you stay for another while on a side of life
Before you let go and the light takes you in
To live for deliverance just swallow it to take

You planned away and let your wings into the sky
Left all the riskiness fall to me (fall to me)
I'm on my knees an endless silence easing me
Wish I could find your voice in me

You're the sky to the secret side on a secret line
Where the reapers will rise and your face will redeem
And it's up to your destiny, of agony
And you stay for another while on a side of life
Before you let go and the light takes you in
To live for deliverance just swallow it to take
