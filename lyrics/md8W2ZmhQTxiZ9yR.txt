Anytime a heart turns from
Darkness to light
Anytime temptation comes and
Someone stands to fight
Anytime somebody lives to serve and not be served

I know I know I know I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move

On the move today

Anytime in weakness someone
Falls upon their knees or
Dares to stand and speak the
Truth that sets men free

Anytime the choice is made to
Stand upon the Word

I know I know I know I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move

Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today
I see a generation
Standing on the truth
In each in every nation
God is on the move

Anytime the Gospel
Stirs a love for searching souls
And someone says send me, here I go
I know I know I know I know
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
On the move today
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move
In many mighty ways
God is on the move, on the move
Hallelujah
God is on the move...

On the move today
I see a generation
Standing on the truth
In each in every nation
God is on the move
