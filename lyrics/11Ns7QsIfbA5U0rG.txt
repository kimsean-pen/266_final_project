Oh yeah
They tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladys look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air

I want bad girl dancing over there
Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves girl I want more
Keep it going girl like I got an encore
She got me saying:

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, go little bad girl
Oh yeah

They tell me I'm a bad boy

All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want bad girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see her move like a movie on flight

She got it how I want it and I want it all night
Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves girl I want more

Keep it going girl i got an encore
She got me saying
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

Popping a gunnin like ain't nobody ever seen.
(Seen seen seen.)

as Matter of fact I seen this woman all up in my dreams.
(Dreams dreams dreams.)
Whippin it, and flippin it, stackin' it and slappin it

David Guetta on the track baby girl don't stop!
(Stop stop stop.)

(Sing sing sing sing.)
And every night on the floor puttin' on a show
(Show show show.)
Everyone in the club, there's a little something you should know!
(Know know know.)
Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves girl i want more
Keep it going girl like i got an encore
She got me saying
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl
