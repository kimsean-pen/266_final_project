Don't give me something to hold in my hand
Something else to believe in
Cause I'm over it
And your reason for wanting to stay
Your reason for wanting to change
My reason for everything I've done to you
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
But you might lock me up
And I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
I could be wild and free
But God forbid then you might envy me
So don't give me love with a whole bunch of rules
'Cause that kind of love is just for fools
And I'm over it
And my reasons for walking away
My reasons for wanting to change
My reasons for everything I lost with you
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
But you might lock me up
And I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
I could be wild and free
God forbid then you might envy me
I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box I'm living with
I could go wild
But you might lock me up
And I have tried but I don't fit
Into this box you call a gift
I could be wild and free
God forbid then you might envy me
I could be wild and free
God forbid then you might envy me
I could be wild and free
