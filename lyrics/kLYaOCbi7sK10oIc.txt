Days are filled with waves of acclaim
We celebrate an arrival so joyful in tone
An orderly rhythm with diligence shown
So how does it feel? Powerful?

Give to the field respectfully now
Devote the labor, make sense of self
Invincible: a torch lit bright
At the center, a guiding light
Nowhere behind, forward motion
To move the mountains with the sea

Again and again I show the thickest of skin
No one could charm me
No fear of harm

Magnify, escalate
Amplify, propagate
Magnify, escalate
Anchor down, bear the weight

Stay behind, surrender with me in mind
I'll fill all the cities with light
Build, up. Build up.
