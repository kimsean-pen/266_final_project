I know your fear of loss and your struggles with faith
And how it takes everything that you have to face the day
The virtues you possess now bring eternal pain
All you have is contempt for a life you can't obtain
All your heroes have failed you yet you try and prevail
Face your torment and dismantle your doubt
Refuse this legacy of shame and deceit
'Cause the only real truth in your life that you know is hostility

Your world is coming apart
Remain steadfast

Perseverance
Against all opposition
Crushing all limitations (perseverance)
Pure strength through solitude
Discipline and determination

You can't accept what you've been told
Anchored in sin you must reverse your descent
Declare the weight of the world has yet to claim you
And admit that your faults will not restrain you
Glimpses of fate bring light to your despair
Realize hope isn't short of your grasp
Resurrect every dream that you buried alive
And never succumb to the war that you fight in your heart

Your world is coming apart
Remain steadfast

Perseverance
Against all opposition
Crushing all limitations (perseverance)
Pure strength through solitude
Discipline and determination
