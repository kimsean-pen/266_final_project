Where you been
'Cause my heart can't forget you
Once again here we are
Don't regret you
Life goes on when you're gone
But I hate it
Lay me down on the floor
Missed you baby

But the walls we've built
Have always been too high
And we'll never be together if it's a lie
We can never get it right
And I don't know why
I don't know why

Right now we can pretend
I am yours
You are mine
For now we can forget
And just drive, drive

There's a memory there, but it's faded
Take them out of the dark and replace it
What I feel for you now never changes
But I know that this love is dangerous

But the walls we've built
Have always been too high
And we'll never be together if it's a lie
We can never get it right
And I don't know why
I don't know why

Right now we can pretend
I am yours
You are mine
For now we can forget
And just drive, drive

Drive, drive, drive
Drive, drive, drive
Drive, drive, drive
Drive, drive, drive

Right now we can pretend
I am yours
You are mine
For now we can forget
And just drive

I am yours, I am yours
Drive
Baby, drive
Drive
