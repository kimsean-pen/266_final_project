Don't hold back
'Cause you woke up in the mornin' with initiative to move
So why make it harder?
Don't hold back
'Cuz you think about it, so many people do
Be cool, man, look smarter
Don't hold back
And you shouldn't even care about those losers in the air
And the crooked stares
Don't hold back
'Cause there's a party over here,
so you might as well be here where the people care

Don't hold back
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on, come on, come on

Don't hold back
If you think about it too much you
may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back
If you think it's time you get up,
crunch time like a sit up, pull monkey face
Don't hold back
Put apprehension on the back burner, let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back
Get involved with the jam, don't be a prick, hot chick, be your fave

Don't hold back
