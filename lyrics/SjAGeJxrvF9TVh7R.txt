Once in your life
You find what you're looking for
A feeling you can't ignore, so right.
Welcome to love, welcome to paradise
Isn't it very nice, alright.

Even though, your havin' your doubts
We can still work it out,
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not,
but it's still worth a shot.

Don't Walk Away,
Listen to your heart, hear what it says
'cause your heart won't lie.

Ohhohoh!

Tears in your eyes, frozen upon your face
Memories we can't replace, disappear.
Nowhere to run
This time there's no place to hide,
You're runnin' but your hands are tied, by fear.

Oh Yeah!

Even though, your havin' your doubts,
We can still work it out
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not
But it's still worth a shot.

Don't Walk Away
Listen to your heart, hear what it says
'Cause your heart won't lie.

Don't Walk Away
Love never let you down, don't be afraid
You'll be allright
Yeah!
You'll be allright.

Ohh

Even though
Your havin' your doubts, we can still work it out
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not
But it's still worth a shot.

Don't Walk Away
Listen to your heart, hear what it says,
'Cause your heart won't lie.

Don't Walk Away,
Love never let you down, don't be afraid,
You'll be allright.
Yeahh
You'll be allright!!!
