All bitches with ambition
get down in position
know I care for you

And know you're looking allright
when your bouncing in sunlight
with your golden tail
(golden tail)

I wanna feel your power
are you free for next hour
I wanna stay in bed
it is buzzing in my head
and I'll go from tip to toe and
been trying to let you know that
I can't get enough of you boo
don't stop the things you do baby
yeah baby

This wintertime it went deep
i'm your Tamagotchi
keep me alive
we'll drive out to the ocean
watch your every motion

Come on mama
pretty mama
I need some of your loving
please tell me why we're rushing
come on mama
I need you
you, you, you

I knew you were up for something
when I caught you bunny bumpin'
up against the wall

Got it ingraved in my scepter
no wonder that I kept her
kept her for so long

I wanna feel your power
are you free for the next hour
I wanna stay in bed
it is buzzing in my head
and I'll go from tip to toe and
been trying to let you know that
I can't get enough of you boo
don't stop the things you do baby

Come on mama
pretty mama
I need some of your loving
please tell me why we're rushing
come on mama
I need you
you, you, you
