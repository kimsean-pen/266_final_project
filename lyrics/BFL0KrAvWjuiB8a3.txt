And we can use a lot of theories
To sound right justifying our desires
I wake up this morning in a distant line
I'm trying to see how far we can go!
Taking a ride on the same distant line
Finding the lane to a portion of light

Maybe it's something that you couldn't believe
Or something secret you never used to see
I'm feeling in my heart the changes in my mind
And in the right time, You'll see how far we can go!

There's distance between reality and dreams
Illusions turn to sins it's hard to admit sometimes
Someone is calling you build your line
Memories will burn inside everywhere I go
