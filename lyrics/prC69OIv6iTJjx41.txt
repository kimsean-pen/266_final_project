the children of the night. They shall rise again,
resurrected through our gathering of the ancient and evil.

They shall rise again, for they are of Him...
The Dark Lord of eternities.

These are the Devils of Darkness.
They can not be laid to rest forever.

"Phantom der nacht", the creatures of the night.
Blood is life. Blood is life.

In the name of the almighty Emperor they shall rise
