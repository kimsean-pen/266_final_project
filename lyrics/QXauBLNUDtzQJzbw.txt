I know you see me, I'm just like you
I know you see me, i'm just like you
I'm just trying to make my way

I gotta feelin that you can relate
And don't talk much, shoot straight

Can't you see me wavin I'm flaggin a ride
Can't you see me wavin I'm flaggin a ride

Maybe you been caught out once before
Maybe you're an angel disguised
Maybe you got room to spare
Maybe you're the one that don't just stare

Can't you see me wavin I'm flaggin a ride
Glad to see you comin I got nothing to hide
Cos I'm tryin to get to providence
not matter the cost
If I don't make it there
I'll...

Can't you see me wavin I'm flaggin a ride
Can't you see me wavin I'm flaggin a ride

Maybe you've been caught out once before
Trying to get to Providence
I know what for
But I'm out in the cold
