Here she comes again
troubles on her brow...
Here she comes again
with worries she can't hide...

Who can stop the rain
pouring down inside?
Who can keep her sane
give her peace of mind?

...
Here she comes again
covered up in black...
Such a pretty face

such sorrow in her eyes...
Do you wanna know
what's killing her inside?
do you dare to walk

the alleys of her mind?
...
Here she comes again
troubles on her brow...

Here she comes again
with worries she can't hide...
Will you let it show
will you cross the line?
Will you take her home
and tell her she'll be fine?
...
