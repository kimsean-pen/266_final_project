Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled the engine was dead
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The crying tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Well when I woke up the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running running my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head and when she smiled and said
Hold me darling for a little while
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew i would miss
but now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night

Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Woh, Woh, Woh, Woh
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
