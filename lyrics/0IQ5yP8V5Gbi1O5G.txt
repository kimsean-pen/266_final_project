I'm getting on that bus
Got to get out of town
It's all that's on my mind
Leave the city behind

I see the mountain side
The trees and sky go by
I'm out here on my own
I might not come back home

I gaze out my window
Scenery comes and goes
I let the time pass by
So I'll be by your side

Heads out like times before
Nothing to wear me for
I'm on my way to you
It's all I want to do
