Keep me awake, and perhaps we will find a place where we belong.
All that we know is left in the world that we haven't explored.
'Cause we don't wanna leave our sheets,
and grow old like we should.
Wondering where it will lead,
whilst feeling misunderstood.
So wake up, and realise how lucky you are.
And breathe another breath and feel us
Walk with you as you walk alone.
Oh, but never mind
never mind
I met a thief, and it stole every part of me, and never left.
And every time, it decides, to arrive, I let in.
And I know what's it's like when your home,
is not a place where you can go.
So wake up, and realise how lucky you are.
And breathe another breath and feel us
Walk with you as you walk alone.
Oh, but never mind me,
I'm just telling you
there's a reason to hold on.
Leave it to the breeze, and you'll see what I mean.
Hold on.
I'm just telling you
there's a reason to hold on.
Leave it to the breeze, and you'll see what I mean.
Hold on.
So wake up, and realise how lucky you are.
And breathe another breath and feel us
Walk with you as you walk alone.
Oh, but never mind,
Never mind
(No no no)
(No no no)
(No no no, Oh)
Just Hold on.
But never mind.
