Pain in my mind
Is turning so alive
Those demons that breed in your eyes
I've just found out
Inside our secret garden
Morning love dew has turned to wicked tears

If your love was just a lie
If you leave with no goodbye
And throw away our love, our life, go over there
If we cannot go back in time
If we don't have a second try
I take a last breath to say without you I will die

I wanna die
Wanna scream my madness
You left me behind
With a million tears of sadness
Night after night
I grope for you but you're not here by my side

Come take my hand
To rekindle the flame
I'm not playing a game
Against odds, against trends
Let's write our future with our hands
I was always so
Keen to give my all
Every piece of my will
Body and soul
You know you can take it all

Fly me to the sun, I want to die
Deep inside the flames, I say goodbye

I wanna die
Wanna scream my madness
You left me behind
With a million tears of sadness
Night after night
I grope for you but you're not here by my side

Fly me to the sun, I want to die
Deep inside the flames, I say goodbye

I wanna die
Wanna scream my madness
You left me behind
With a million tears of sadness
Night after night
I grope for you but you're not here by my side

Fly me to the sun
