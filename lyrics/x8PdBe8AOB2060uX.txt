(so sad baby so glad girl)
When you first came round I was sad
My head hung down I felt really bad
Now I'm glad, glad about the good times that we've had

Walked in the park
kissed in the dark

leaves burned just like just like a spark
Now I'm glad
glad about the good times that we've had

You went away I cried night and day
for what you done I had to pay
Left me so blue I don't know
where to go or what to do
please come back and let the sun shine through

Sun passed behind a cloud
I felt so proud
We walk down the street people smile that we meet
And I'm glad glad about the good times that we've had
You said I was the best man that you've ever had oh!
Now I'm glad oh so glad
