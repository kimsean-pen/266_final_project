In the dark they go like stars, bright, light
In the night I see them glow
Wild eyes
I can see bright light
Ooo, In your wild eyes
I can feel the night
Ooo, in your wild eyes
In your wild eyes
Ooo, in your wild eyes
In your wild eyes
Its the way you love
And the rules you make
You amplify my desire to escape
I need the highs you think you know
Places where I'd never dare to go
In the dark they go like stars, bright, light
In the night I see them glow
Wild eyes
I can see bright light
Ooo, In your wild eyes
I can feel the night
Ooo, in your wild eyes
In your wild eyes
In your wild eyes
In the dark they go like stars, bright, light
In the night I see them glow
