If you left me
How could I go on?
If you walked away from me baby
All the right would turn wrong
I've had too many heartaches
For my blistering hands
But I know your my calling to the promise land

You're the one who runs through my veins
Like a hurricane
You lift the hurt I've felt before
You and me could own this earth
Ditch the dust and dirt
Light up this city with our

Freedom
I fall to grace and into your arms
Cause we got freedom
You've stolen the dark
And turned it to stars

So wont you stay here
Hold my hand for a while
Tell me you won't be leaving
Tell me you'll walk that mile
Cause I've never felt like this
Darling you set me free
And I'll shout it from rooftops
I am you, you are me

You're the one who runs through my veins
Like a hurricane
You lift the hurt I've felt before
You and me could own this earth
Ditch the dust and dirt
Light up this city with our

Freedom
I fall to grace and into your arms
Cause we got freedom
You've stolen the dark
And turned it to stars

I will never leave you stranded
Baby you're the one I need
You found me in the gutter
I was lost now I believe
But let me keep you
Say you'll stay and then you'll kiss me
And say it again

Freedom

I fall to grace and into your arms
Cause we got freedom
You've stolen the dark
And turned it to stars

You give me Freedom

I fall to grace and into your arms
Cause we got freedom
You've stolen the dark
And turned it to stars

You give me Freedom
