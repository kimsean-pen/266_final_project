Have you seen any mention?
It's been quite in detention all week
Is that so?
I saw the winter party person [?]
Shook his fists like this
Is that so?
And everyone sat as blank as a cake
And in love like a stupid lump of clay
Is that so?
I know a good Armageddon might have made my day
Bad day
Is that so?

We aren't the world
We aren't the children
But you are my safety girl

And you know we could go and spend ourselves like money
Let's pretend we're hundred dollar bills
Like so
And complain every day there's a spider in my soup
Title my opinion like everybody else
Is that so?

We aren't the world
We aren't the children
But you're my safety girl

Like so
Oh, is that so?

We aren't the world
We aren't the children
But you're my safety girl
