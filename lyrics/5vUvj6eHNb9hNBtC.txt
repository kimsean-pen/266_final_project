But I am your crazy driver
Honey I'm sure to steer you ' round
I am dying in any story (?)
I'm only living and (when I) sing this song
(Just the same, baby...)

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you

But I'm losing a lot of my feelings
And I'm running out of friends
You know you lied to me in the beginning
Tried to bring me to the end

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you

Well I was trying to leave this signal
In a fury an (it) is too strong
Yea I got my reputation
Write me anyway, not too long

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you.
