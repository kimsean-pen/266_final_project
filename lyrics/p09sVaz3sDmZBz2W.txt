Hey,
you can look, you can look just like anyone else
if that's what you want to do.
I,
I could laugh,
I could laugh in your face if I want
oh, but I'm not going to.
When we met last week on Saturday,
I couldn't make a sentence,
I couldn't even say
what I meant to say:

that I want you
it doesn't hurt to say I want you,
I need you
I never thought I'd say I need you,
I'll keep you,
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away,
and I'll break you
because I lose myself inside you,
I'll make you
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you,
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away.

Yes,
yes, you're all,
yes you're all that I ever desire,
still I'll kill you in the end.
When,
when it seems,
when it seems that it's getting too soft,
when you lapse into a friend,
There's someone just behind the door
so don't betray your feelings,
no don't talk anymore,
never dare to say

that I want you
it doesn't hurt to say I want you,
I need you
I never thought I'd say I need you,
I'll keep you,
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away,
and I'll break you
because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you,
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away.

Now,
now we come,
now we come to the end of it all,
see it squirming, almost dead.
No,
you can't leave,
you can't leave it to die here in pain.
You've got to stamp upon it's head.
I'll go out and you'll stay home
facing up to living,
living on your own,
and I'll curse my pride,
curse my pride,
curse my stupid pride

because I want you
it doesn't hurt to say I want you,
I need you
I never thought I'd say I need you,
I'll keep you,
oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away,
and I'll break you
because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you
fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you,
oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away.
