And he came to me on a northern wind
And he flooded my mind in a river of light
And he wrapped my body in a breath of fire
Then he hid my soul in a cloak of night
like a devil's plaything
And he spoke to me in a language lost
And he turned my head with sweet seduction
And he filled my body with flames of ice
Then he touched my soul and then he gave it back
Like a devil's plaything
As in a ruin where violets grow
In moss covered fields
On cold marble stone
Love sometimes steals into a heart
And he came to me on a northern wind
And he flooded my mind in a river of light
And he wrapped my body in a breath of fire
Then he hid my soul in a cloak of night
And he spoke to me in a language lost
And he turned my head with sweet seduction
And he filled my body with flames of ice
Then he touched my soul and then he gave it back
Like the devil's plaything
As in a ruin where violets grow
In moss covered fields
On cold marble stone
Love sometimes steals into a heart
Love sometimes steals into a heart
Love sometimes steals into a heart
Love sometimes steals into a heart
Love sometimes steals into a heart
