Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever for you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone
I'm so tired of pretending
I just want a happy ending

I wish I could put a spell on you
I wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
I wish I could flick and wave the wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you and make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change, see my heart
It may be broken but that won't stop me hoping

I wish I could put a spell on you
I wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
I wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you and make it all come true

I just wanna know what we should have done
When I figured out what we could have become
'Cause I know in my heart i'm not over you
I just wanna go back and try it again
Turn back the time. This isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us
Woah

I wish I could put a spell on you
I wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
I wish I could flick and wave the wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you and make it all come true

I wish I could put a spell on you
I wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? So magical
I wish I could flick and wave the wand
Get everything that I wanted
And put a spell on you and make it all come true
