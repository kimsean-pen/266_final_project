I guess it's funnier
From where
You're standing
'Cause from over here
I missed the joke

Clear the way
For my
Crash landing
I've done it
Again

Another number
For your notes

I'd be smiling
If I wasn't
So desperate
I'd be patient
If I had the time
I could stop
And answer

All of your
Questions
As soon as
I find out
How I can
Move from

The back
Of the line

So I'll be
Your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too
If I saw me

I'll be your clown
On (y)our
Favourite channel
My life's a circus, circus
Round in circles
I'm selling out

Tonight

I'd be less angry
If it was my decision
And the money
Was just rolling in
If I had more
Than my ambition
I'll have time
For 'Please'
I'll have time for
'Thank you's'
As soon as
I win

So I'll be
Your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too
If I saw me
I'll be your clown
On (y)our
Favourite channel
My life's
A circus, circus
Round
In circles
I'm selling out
Tonight

From a distance
My choice is simple
From a distance
I can entertain
So you 'won't'
See me
I put make-up
On my face
But there's no way
You can feel it
From so far away

So I'll be
Your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh
'Cause it's funny
I would too
If I saw me
I'll be your clown
On (y)our
Favourite channel
My life's a circus,
Circus
Round in circles
I'm selling
Out tonight
