Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't you ever wonder
Is this world all done must over
You just sit there drinkin'
While I'm looking out and thinkin'

Above the clouds beneath them winds
Born to fly, I'm here to sing
Now wear your heart on your sleeve
It's okay 'cause we all bleed

Walking, wind is airy
Saw the tombs, the cemetery
Tokyo and blossom
And the music flows out then

I watch the clouds beneath them winds
Born to fly, I'm born to sing
Have you ever felt the forest
Now lift me up, feel the love

I watch the clouds beneath them winds
I'm born to fly, I'm born to sing
Now wear your heart on your sleeve
It's okay 'cause we all bleed

Seismic shift in you
Seismic shift in me and you
