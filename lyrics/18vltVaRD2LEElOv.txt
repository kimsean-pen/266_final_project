It's been a while
Since I heard your name
Trying to build it all, trying to build it all
Trying to build it all, back again
And I hurt myself it was all in vain
I couldn't build us up, build us up

But don't you worry it's all over, it's all over

Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But it's time I let you go
Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But now it's time to let you go
To let you go

Staying up all night in an empty bar
I thought I knew it all, I thought I had you down
But I don't know who you are
When I need you the most
Yet you still so far
What you do with my heart

Don't you worry it's all over now, it's all over

Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But it's time I let you go
Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But now it's time to let you go

Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But it's time I let you go
Been looking through a telescope
Had me thinking that we were close
All this time I had loved you so
But now it's time to let you go

Don't you worry it's all over now
