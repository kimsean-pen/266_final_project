Went to the fortune teller
Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

When she took a look at my palm
She said "Son, you feel kinda warm"
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said, "You're in love"

I said I could not be so
I'm not passionate with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
I looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well, I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
And I get my fortune told for free
