Slowing down
Stole a kiss
At every red light
Up they go
I wonder which
One that you're on

All around
Moving in and out
Of my mind
A while ago
Somehow I missed the sign

Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
You're set free and I'm there to lose but I'm
Getting lost somewhere I'll be there soon
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa

Falling down
Speeding through
Every red light
Up you go
I wonder which
Flight that you're on

All around
Moving in and out
Of my mind
A while ago
Somehow I missed the sign

Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
You're set free and I'm there to lose but I'm
Getting lost somewhere I'll be there soon
Without you I got nothing to lose

I wonder who I'd be
Without you
I wonder who I'd be
Without you
I wonder who I'd be
Without you

Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa

Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
You're set free and I'm there to lose but I'm
Getting lost somewhere I'll be there soon
Without you I got nothing to lose, whoa
