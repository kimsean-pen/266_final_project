You're taking the punches of a heavyweight
One by one they never hesitate
You've had worse beatings
And you're still breathing
They'll tear you apart until there's nothing left
They'll pin you down and say 'It's over kid'
You feel no fear
All day, all year

No one can make you change who you are
No one can take one beat from your heart
When you're standing tall
You're unbreakable
No one can make you bend, you won't fold
No one can take your shine, you're all gold
When you're standing tall
You're unbreakable

Step out of the dark into better light
And carry your scars like a badge of pride
You've come so far
You know who you are
All this time you've had the will inside
To stand your ground the day that hell arrives
You're armed and ready
You will hold steady
