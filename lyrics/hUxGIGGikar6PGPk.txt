I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees cause I
I want honey on my table
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees cause I
I want honey on my table

But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stingin' me
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
'Til you do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

I try to stick this pin through a butterfly cause I
I like all the pretty colors
It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire
To burn with all the others

Cause I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
'Til you do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

This time, I'll get it right
This time, I'll get it right
It's gonna be this time
I'll get it right
God, let it be this time
I get it right

So I'm cuttin' that branch off the cherry tree
Singin' this will be my victory
Then I
See them comin' after me
And they're followin me across the sea
And now they're stingin my friends and my family
And I
Don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I keep swingin' my hand through a swarm of bees cause I
I want honey on my table.
