You're a paper doll
I fold you how I want
You're not my news
I tie these knots
If this won't be
Our fingers laid together
This is total war
Method not objective
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?

If I can, I'd glue them back together
Back together

Scars on my fingers
Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers
Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers

Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck

Warship my wreck

Cut the hands off
Then kamikaze into your soul
Kamikaze into your soul

Scars on my fingers
Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck
Warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers

Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck
Warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers
Bruises by neck
Crashin' my chains
Warship my wreck

Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
Can you see, I'm breaking the rules?
If I can, I'd glue them back together
