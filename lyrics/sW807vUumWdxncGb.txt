I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my love tonight, c'mon, c'mon
But I've been thinkin' it over
And I remember the last time

I don't need another heartbreak or a headache

Why can't I take you off my mind? (You're my knight in shining armor)
With you I've never felt more alive

This love could be bad for us
Bad for us, bad for us, but I want it
Bad for us, bad for us, dangerous
But you want it too and I'm ready if you are
Bad for us, bad for us, bad for us

So tell me why, boy? (So tell me why)
Nobody can make me feel the way you do
I get so shy, boy (I get so shy)
But when we get home, get down

I wanna just be bad for us

Somehow it was never enough
Nobody's fillin' my cup like you do, come fill me up
But I've been thinkin' it over
So let's forget all the others, babe

I just want another good night full of mistakes

Why can't I take you off my mind? (Off my mind)
So wrong, so why does this feels so right? (Feels so right)

This love could be bad for us
Bad for us, bad for us, but I want it
Bad for us, bad for us, dangerous
But you want it too and I'm ready if you are
Bad for us, bad for us, bad for us

So tell me why, boy? (So tell me why)
Nobody can make me feel the way you do
I get so shy, boy (I get so shy)
But when we get home, get down

I wanna just be bad for us

What a cute boy

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (I wanna)
I wanna just be bad

What is the matter, baby?
Forget all the rules we're breaking
Put on some old school Britney
'Cause baby, you drive me crazy (I wanna)

What is the matter, baby? (What is the matter, baby?)
Forget all the rules we're breaking
Put on some old school Britney
'Cause baby, you drive me crazy

Get home, get down, I wanna just be

Bad for us, bad for us, but I want it (Wanna be bad for us)
Bad for us, bad for us, dangerous
But you want it too and I'm ready if you are
Bad for us, bad for us, bad for us

So tell me why, boy? (So tell me why)
Nobody can make me feel the way you do
I get so shy, boy (I get so shy)
But when we get home, get down

I wanna just be bad for us
