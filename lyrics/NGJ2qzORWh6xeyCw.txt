Eye for an eye
Cold blood on the ground
Is my chosen reprisal

Flowing red washes away
These sins are not defined by God

My retaliation

The teeth of the saw
Like a row of rusty nails
On the backside of a sword
Cuts both ways

Without fear defy
The wrath of fire
With absence of pain
Greet the flame of ice
Stand against the gale
Relentless and dire
With absence of grief
Meet the rising tide

Cut for a scar
Broken bone for a tombstone
I'm the blade of vengeance

River runs red and washes away
These crimes are not defined by laws
Without fear defy
The wrath of fire
With absence of pain
Greet the flame of ice
Stand against the gale
Relentless and dire
With absence of grief
Meet the rising tide
