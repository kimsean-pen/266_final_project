Almost so perfect
Way that I want you
I'm almost deserving when I get close to you
I disappear - lost in the waves - I go under, under

I am an island
You are the ocean
So close we're touching, completely surrounded
But I cannot have you the way that I want to
Because I am an island you are the ocean
No I cannot have you, I cannot have you without.drowning

My breath is shallow, I just can't catch it
My heart is breaking, feel the waves crashing
New storm is building if it rages I'll go under, under

Because I am and island you are the ocean
So close we're touching, completely surrounded
But I cannot have you the way that I want to
cause I am an island you are the ocean
No I cannot have you, I cannot have you without.drowning

I see you out there
I'm lost in the blue
I'm part of the world but I cannot have you
cause I am deserted and you are too deep

I cannot love you without losing me

I am an island you are the ocean
we're so close we're touching, completely surrounded
But I cannot have you the way that I want to
cause I am an island you are the ocean
No I cannot have you, I cannot have you without.drowning
