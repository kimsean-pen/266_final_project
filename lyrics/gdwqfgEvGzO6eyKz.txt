I done did a lot of fucked up shit on my time on the planet
But I couldn't tell you what regret taste like, No!
If you fuck with the Doctur,
you already know "Hakuna Matata" the only rule we follow, hoo
We was ghosts for a minute, had to hit the west coast for a minute
Came back and the hoes were same but the culture was
different,
got me screaming at the glass cause I broke in the mirror like
I am a lion, I am the king of defiance, hater quit trying
I am protected by Zion
You try to test, now I'm just testifying
Looking at the judge like "Hold up your honor!"
Pull out my palms, make promise to god, if I die I'm a goner (Yeah!)
Worked up my ma,
I'm a beam off but nah we like Yeezy and Donda (Yeah!)
My guy do drugs,
if I toss him a pound it's like feeding piranhas (Yeah!)
Shout out to Ross, Spillage Village what we are
A long wait, we can show you the sponsor!

I'm something special yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah woo!
I'm something special yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah woo!
I'm something special yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah woo!
I'm something special yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah woo!

Ass on sale, long, fast, don't factory
But you know why I ain't tripping on the chiller
