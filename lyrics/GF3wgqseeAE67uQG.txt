Show me the body
These pictures will shock you
Love is a drug we don't need anymore
We don't need to score
Show me the body
404, gateway not found
My wife is such a fan
Show me the body
Show me the body, now

We're starring in the movies of our lives
We're starring in the movies of our lives

And the Academy Award for good times goes to you
Yeah, the Academy Award for good times goes to you
There's a camera held in every hand
The glamour of applause in every mind
But the Academy Award for good times goes to you

Show me the body, Hikikomori
Through liquid crystal we look at the world
From our parents' homes
Show me the body
The secret of longevity
Is to stay away from them
Show me the body
Show me the body, now

We're starring in the movies of our lives
We're starring in the movies of our lives

And the Academy Award for good times goes to you
Yeah, the Academy Award for good times goes to you
There's a camera held in every hand
The glamour of applause in every mind
But the Academy Award for good times goes to you

Show me the body
You never realize how much it [?]
Till you see them on the ground
They cover so much ground
Locked up predator, hunted gatherer
Once rare commodity now easily found
Salt, sugar and fat
There's heavy traffic
Show me the body, now

We're starring in the movies of our lives
We're starring in the movies of our lives

And the Academy Award for good times goes to you
Yeah, the Academy Award for good times goes to you
There's a camera held in every hand
The glamour of applause in every mind
But the Academy Award for good times goes to you, you
