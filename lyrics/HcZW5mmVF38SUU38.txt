Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah)
Shoot across the sky (pour on a symphony)
So high, so high (you said)
That we shoot across the sky

Drink from me, drink from me (ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky (now I'm feeling drunk and high)
Symphony (so high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said, "drink from me, drink from me"
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (wooh!)

Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, and your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
