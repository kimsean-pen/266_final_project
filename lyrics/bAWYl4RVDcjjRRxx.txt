I saw it you and me in time part
I get a shiver from broken hearts
I like the sun where it don't shine
I make it hard on anyone
so many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold

In the roll, in the spring time dust
I love you way too much
so I wonder where to go
when love lose way too slow
so when hearts stay will explode
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold

All talk is a waste of time
'cause in dreams you're always mine
why they burn with such delight
a leave of joy awake and rhyme
so many times I've lost control
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold

I saw it you and me in time part
I get a shiver from broken hearts
I like the sun where it don't shine
I make it hard on anyone
so many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold

So many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold
