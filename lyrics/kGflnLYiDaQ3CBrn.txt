Drawing a red line
She refers to the devil's time
Beautiful black priestess
In this town lives Satan's Venus

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard

Daughter of Tituba
Capricorn hallelujah
Damned by profane prayers
Judged by holy sinners

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard

I charge you my lord
By your manifold names
To come as I roared
Beelzebub, inferno rex

Alright, dear sir
The wolves are at your doors
Protect your girls
And chain your boys

Tonight the devil will come
Into your bed and soul
Daughter will join the craze
Hearing the beast's howl

She's running in the woods
Hide from the cross claiming the good
Killed her to save their souls
Didn't know she cursed them all

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard

They called her Salem Girl
The maiden queen of the graveyard
