Give me rainbows
to fill up my eyes
Give me colours
so that I won't cry

Give me flowers
as I go walking by
In these hours
where I only try

Give me love, give me hope, give me faith
Give me all of your dreams...
Now there's joy everywhere in my heart
And it feels like Spring!

Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
And why can't I see you...
Why can'tI feel you?
Give me rainbows, take away the clouds

Give me colours
That's living now
it's all over now
it's all over now
it's all over now
it's all over now
it's all over now
it's over now
it's over now
it's over now
