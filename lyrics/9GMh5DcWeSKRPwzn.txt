These machines are always running
Like the rivers and the clocks
And these wheels don't get tired of turning
On and on and up and up
And everybody's going somewhere
Something's always going on
Barely blink, we might miss out
On so much laughter, so much fun
We want our names on all the lists
Don't really mind if they're misspelled
And if nobody takes a picture
We take pictures of ourselves

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how we celebrate our time
The greenest grass
Right at our feet
Look how we skip from peak to peak

So we're drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch or a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart

It's hard to bear the sound of silence
So we get bored quite easily
Have you heard this song? I found it
Like it, like it, like me please
And we'll fast-forward to the chorus
Join the choir, spread the words
I'll take my finger off the trigger
Just take yours off the trigger first

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how it eats up all our time

So we're drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
That hits the heart
Come hit my heart

On and on and on

So we're drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A thought that sticks and flips the switch
And shakes me up
A little thing that I let in
A word that sparks
And hits my heart
Come hit my heart
