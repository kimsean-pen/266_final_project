All of my life I felt that you were listening
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune
Oh Lord of my dreams
Although confusion keeps trying to deceive
Oh what is it that makes me believe in you?

Oh I know, I know, I know, I know

Ooh yeah

Babaji, oh won't you come to me
Won't you help me to face the music
Bring it out, so we can sing it out
Help us to find it before we lose it

At night when the stars are near
And there's no one to keep you from coming here
And there's no one to shield me before your eyes
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know

I said though I can see it's not too good for me
To be afloat in the sea of glory
Oh Babaji, oh how you comfort me
By showing me it's a different story

Your light in the dark is real
And I know that you know it is how I feel
When I see the reflection that's in your eyes
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know

Oh oh
Can't you hear me
Oh singing low
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, alright

Oh Babaji, have you a song for me
To tell the world of its guardian angel
Bring it out, so we can sing it out
Oh must you always remain a stranger

At night when the stars are near
And I long for delusion to disappear
Then I see the reflection that's in your eyes
Is it time, is it time, is it time
Is is time, is it time, is it time
is it time to know
Oh oh

I said I'm calling you, Babaji (Babaji)
I said I'm calling you, Babaji (Babaji)
Oh oh sing it Babaji (Babaji)
Oh can you hear me, Babaji (Babaji)
I told I'm calling you, Babaji, (Babaji)
Babaji (Babaji)
Oh Babaji (Babaji)
Oh I sing it (Babaji)
Oh sing it (Babaji)
Oh sing it (Babaji)
Oh sing it (Babaji)
Sing it (Babaji)
Sing it (Babaji)
Sing it (Babaji)
Sing it (Babaji)
Sing it (Babaji)
