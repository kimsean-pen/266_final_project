Just another emotion
is this something more
if it's only a passionate phase
I'd rather just close the door

Turn away, turn away, turn away
walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
when you know that I need you
walk away
when you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
don't you see that I want you
here by my side

(Don't) walk away
when you know that I need you
(don't) walk away
when you see me coming
(don't) walk away
when you know that I need you
by my side

I'm sure that I'll get over you
it'll take me a while you see
next time, there won't be no next time
save all my feelings for me

Turn away, turn away, turn away
walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
when you see that I need you
walk away
when your hear me call you
(don't) walk away
don't you know that I need you
here by my side

(Don't) walk away
when you see that I need you
(don't) walk away
when you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
don't you know that I want you
by my side

Turn away, turn away, turn away
walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
when you know that I need you
walk away
when you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
when you know that I need you
here by my side

(Don't) walk away...
