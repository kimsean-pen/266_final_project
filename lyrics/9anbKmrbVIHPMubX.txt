Well, somebody walked up to me but I didn't know what to do
Then somebody said hello to me, but I didn't know what to do
Because I think that my words could get twisted
So I bend my back over, take a gulp, be funny
'Cause I know there's nothing I can do

Then my mother tried to pick me up 'cause I was sittin' down on the ground
Something forced my little eyes to come open, but I couldn't make out the sound
It doesn't matter 'cause my eyes are lying, and they don't have emotion
Don't wanna be social, can't take it when they hate me
But I know there's nothing I can do

When my thoughts start to feel like mine
They're taken from me, it seems to happen every time
And the feelings that are fine for you
There's somebody there who doesn't think they are true
So think of something new
There's nothing left to do

Then my idols walk next to me, I look up at them, they fade away
It's a destruction of a mystery the more I listen to what they say
So does that mean that there's no more doing, and there's no more thinking
And there's no more feeling, 'cause there's no right opinion?
Can you tell me what I'm supposed to do?
