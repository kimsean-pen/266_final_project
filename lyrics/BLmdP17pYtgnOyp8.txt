Here the lights fall just as hard
A bit softer in the stall
It's not really wrong
It's not really right
I'm wide awake
She's upfront, upshot, upstart
Up in every case
The kind of girl that whispers
"Thank God for you"

Oh yeah, and all you've got is me
Oh yeah, and all you'll need is me

Her confusion is in the night
That I stumbled
It's in the morning that I
That I struggled
Because I start to forget but
She will always remember
The kind of girl who laughs and says
"Get up off your knees"

Oh yeah, and all you'll need is me
Oh yeah, and all you'll want is me
Oh yeah, and all you'll need is me
Oh yeah, and all you'll want is me

So you come and so you go
Tell me how hard, how fast
Baby tell me how high
I must go
Tell me what you want, then tell me what you need
Tell me how hard, how fast
Baby how high
I must go
Tell me how high
I must go

Oh yeah, and all you'll need is me
Oh yeah, well all you'll want is me
Oh yeah, well all you'll need is me
Oh yeah, well all you'll get is me

This is the time of my life
