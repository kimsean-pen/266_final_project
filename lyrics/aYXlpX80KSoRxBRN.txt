We can go for miles after midnight
Tracing every shadow 'til the daylight
Going off the edge just to feel what it's like
What it's like, what it's like

You wanna go right, you wanna go left
You know I don't mind (oh oh oh)
My feet on the edge and I come alive
Come alive, come alive

I feel invincible anywhere with you
Indestructible, I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you

It's a technicolor dream all around me
Electric melody through my body
Push me off the edge cause with you I can fly
I can fly, I can fly

You wanna go right, you wanna go left
You know I don't mind (oh oh oh)
My feet on the edge and I come alive
Come alive, come alive

I feel invincible anywhere with you
Indestructible, I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you

I feel invincible
Anywhere with you
Indestructible
I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) with you
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh) I'll go, I'll go
To the end of the earth with you
