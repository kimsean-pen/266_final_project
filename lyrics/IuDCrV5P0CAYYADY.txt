Couldn't stop moving when it first took hold.
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall.
There was a group called 'The Jokers' they were layin' it down.
Don't ya know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound.

Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Drop on out and spread the news.

Skeeters start a buzzin' 'bout this time a year.
I'm goin' 'round back, said she'd meet me there.
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn.
When my ears started ringing like a fire alarm.

Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Drop on out and spread the news.

Yeah, did somebody say keep on rockin'?

Hope you all know what I'm talkin' about.
The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out.
Gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too.
C'mon little closer gonna do it to you.

Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Drop on out and spread the news.

Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Jump on out and spread the news.
That I'm tired of payin' dues (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Done said goodbye to all my blues (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse.
