Angry Guru
Sitting in his own little poopoo
I said, "Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do"

Real connections
Sometimes I need spiritual protection
He said, "Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do"

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have done
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on and on and on

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have become
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on and

Macho, loco
I've seen many friends destroyed by ego
He said, "Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do"

Shyness, ridiculous
Would you like some more of it, your highness?
He said, "Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do"

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have done
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on and on and on

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have become
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on and on

Angry Guru
Trying to out zen his own poopoo
He said, "Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do"

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have done
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on and on and on

Silence leads to violence
Face up to what you have become
Dealing what you're stealing
The story goes on

Angry Guru
Nobody hates you more than I do
Nobody loves you more than you do
