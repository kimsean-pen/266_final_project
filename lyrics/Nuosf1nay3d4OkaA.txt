Two faced! I feel you crawling under my skin
Sickened by your face
By the way, to think that your so fuckin' kind?
You ain't

Hard to find how I feel
Especially when your smothering me
Hard to find how I feel
Oh please someone help me

I knew when an angel whispered into my ear
You gotta get him away
Hey little bitch, be glad you finally walked away or
You may have not lived another day

Hard to find how I feel
Especially when your smothering me
Hard to find how I feel
Oh please someone help me

Hard to find how I feel
Controlling me every step of the way
Hard to find how I feel
You greedy little baby

Hard to find the time to find
Hard to find the time to find
Uh, uh, ha
Yeah, yeah, yea

Hard to find how I feel
Especially when your smothering me
Hard to find how I feel
Oh please someone help me
Hard to find how I feel
Controlling me every step of the way
Hard to find how I feel
You greedy little baby
