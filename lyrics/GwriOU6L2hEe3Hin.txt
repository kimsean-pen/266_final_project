Turn the ugly light off God wanna feel the night
Everyday it shines down on me don't you think that I see
Don't you think that I see what it's all about
Hard to look the other way while the world passes me by
And everyone is trying to bum me out

It's a pretty big world God and I am awful small
Everyday they rain down on me flower in a hailstorm
Flower in a hailstorm and I'm living for the drought
I could throw it back at them but then I play their game
Everyone is trying to bum me out

When I came into this world they slapped me
And everyday since then I'm slapped again
Tomorrow's king, an unsightly coward
You see, I know I'm gonna win

Turn the ugly light off God don't wanna see my face
Everyday it will betray me don't you think that I know
Don't you think that I know what they're talking about
If they step on me tonight they're gonna pay someday
Everyone is trying to bum me out
