Crumz on the beat

I'll hold you down (Yeah, yeah)
You're one in a million, girl, no other around (Yeah, yeah)
Plenty of fishes in the sea but they never taking your crown (Oh, no)
Even though they been talking on the road, I ain't got no doubts
That's from the sky to the ground, flex and get pounds
I'll hold you down

When you hear me on the radio (On the radio)
Turn it up and keep driving slow
If you ever need a break, Kit-Kat, slip-road
Great things never came from comfort zones
Any time you want help, I'll be there in a flash for you
I'll spend my last bit of cash on you
I heard that you would really do the same for me
'Cause I'll break my hands and back for you

One time for my south girl
Two times, she can ride in my Mercedes
Three times, we be living in a mansion
Four times and she can have my babies, yeah
One time for my south girl

Down in every single way that you can't think of, girl
I cannot explain the way you make me feel, you rock my world
You need to let your guard down, get your hopes up and then let me in
I won't be on this planet all my life but I'll love you 'til it ends
