Knew I had to bite you, baby when I first laid eyes on you
That moment turned me on, I can't believe it's true
And I like to watch your body sway
I got no choice, I'm gonna twist your tail

Love me like a reptile
Love me like a reptile
I'm gonna sink my fangs in you

Thunder lizard, stony eye, you got me hypnotised
Hot tongue breaks in and out and I can't believe my eyes
And your soft white belly, next to mine
Scaly baby, see you shine

Love me like a reptile
Love me like a reptile
You're a murder in disguise
Black mamba, murder disguised

Baby, you're a rattlesnake, you know the way I feel
Feel you crawling up my back, you've got no love to steal
You know I've got my eyes on you
You're petrified, gonna stick like glue

Love me like a reptile
Love me like a reptile
Shock you like an electric eel
Shock you like an electric eel
