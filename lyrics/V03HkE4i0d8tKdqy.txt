So, you feel like you ain't nobody?
Always needed to be somebody?
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
(All you gotta do is save the world, yeah)

So, you feel like it's the end of the story?
Find it all pretty satisfactory?
Well, I tell you, my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation is yours for the making
(Yes, you're a hero, ooh, yeah)

Flash, a-ah!

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand (He'll save with a mighty hand)
He'll save with a mighty hand (He'll save with a mighty hand)
He saved with a mighty hand (Save us)
Every man, every woman, every child (man, woman, child)
He's the mighty (mighty)
