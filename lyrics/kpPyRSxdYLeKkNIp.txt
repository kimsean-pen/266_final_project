it's when you walk in it's when you beat my ghosts
that something surprise and you're feeling down
it's when you talk with, with a friend so sad
that seven eighty nine fears going down
when you're walking down the road with saddest signs, there's no green lights and only stars and noone to drive me home
alone i can't say goodbye
i was felling doubts and so who am i, i wake up and no supplies
and there's something inside my head alone i can't say goodbye
