I can believe that it's over,
I lost this one.
Tonight I'll run, free.
I wish I had someone to guide me,
And pull me up,
Cause the lights can't find, me.
Stranger, (oh oh,),
Take me home.

I wish I had already found you.
I've wasted time.
My mind has grown, black.
I wish I had already known you;
You saved my life.
You brought my faith, back.
Stranger, (oh oh),
Take me home.
Stranger, oh oh,

Ohhhh, ohh, oh
And I will love you, only for tonight.
I don't know you, but it's alright.
Let me show you heaven,
Stranger,
Take me home. Somehow I feel like I've

Known you all my life and
We have been together
Since the dawn of time and
I've been missing vital

Pieces of the puzzle,
You might be the answer,
Stranger
I will love you, if only for tonight.
I don't know you, but it's alright.
Let me show you heaven,
Stranger,
Take me home.
Stranger, (oh oh),
Take me home.
