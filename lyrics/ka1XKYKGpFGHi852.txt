Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right

And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light

Like ships in the night letting cannonballs fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fists fly from my mouth as it turns south
You're down the driveway

I'm on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent fifth grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
Cause we'll be okay, I'm not going away

Like you watched at fourteen as you went down the drain
Your pop's stayed the same and your mom's moved away
How many of our parents seem make it anyway
We're just fumbling through the gray

Trying to find a heart that's not walking away
Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone

We can feel so far
From so close
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light
Like ships in the night

You're passing me by
You're passing me by
Like ships in the night
I'm at the airport waiting on a second plane

Had to pack and you had cramps
And I was late heading to a red carpet
They won't know my name
Riding in silence

All that we wanna say
'Bout to board when you call on the phone
You say I'm sorry I'll be waiting at home

Feels like we're burning this out on our own
Trying to find our way down a road we don't know
Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far
From so close
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea

If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light
Like ships in the night
You're passing me by

You're passing me by
Like ships in the night
And I'm gonna find my way
Back to your side
And I'm gonna find my way
Back to your side
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light
Like ships in the night
You're passing me by
You're passing me by
Like ships in the night
