You can talk and I
Can try my best to listen
But I can't
Digest
The contents within
That goes in
One ear and out the other
Honey we try
To ignore each other
Plenty
And I fell so very empty

And I'm sorry
And I'm too late
And I'm too many things at the moment
And I'm sorry
And I'm too late
And I'm too many things at the moment
At the moment
I'm too many things at the moment
At the moment
I'm too many things
I'm too many things

Turn the other shoulder
It's not a joke I'm eager to find
I'm so comfortably
Lying down a path
Although I've lost the time
I've lost the time
I've lost the time
It's gone
I've lost the time
I've lost the time
It's gone
It's gone

And
You can talk and I
Can try my best to listen
But I can't
Digest
The contents within
That goes in
One ear and out the other
Honey we try
To ignore each other
Plenty
And I fell so very empty

And I'm sorry
And I'm too late
And I'm too many things at the moment
And I'm sorry
And I'm too late
And I'm too many things

And I'm too many things at the moment
At the moment I'm
To many things at the moment at the moment
I'm too many things
I'm too many things
Now
