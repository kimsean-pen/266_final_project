Well it's a sad truth, living with these hungry hands
It's a shame we don't know how much me have
We're scared of what we do not know
No matter where we want to go
Wait for it to find you, to find you
But the truth is far behind you now
Time to say it out loud
What are you so scared of?
Judgement's not unfair
It's what we've learned to see
And what are you afraid of?
This is not unheard of
Nothing's how it wasn't always meant to be
Always meant to be
And you can't go on thinking that you're so hard done by
And don't pretend you've worked so hard, just scraping by
It's not a crime to see the light
It doesn't mean you sleep better at night
It's not a crime to wear a smile
So what are you so scared of?
Judgement's not unfair
It's what we've learned to see
And what are you afraid of?
This is not unheard of
Nothing's how it wasn't always meant to be.
Always meant to be
Always meant to be
I used to be scared, I used to be like you
I used to care then I came unglued
Well it's something we all have to learn to do
I used to be scared, I used to be like you
I used to care then I came unglued, unglued
What are you so scared of?
What are you so afraid of?
And what are you so scared of?
So what are you so scared of?
Judgement's not unfair
It's what we've learned to see
