From the shelter of your home
As you walk into the rain
Send a message that you know she'll hear
Though she's so far away
Even though you have been wrong before
She'll hear you now
You know she will
But you don't know how

From the shelter of the rain
As you walk into the Tube
As you think of how you wonder if
She thinks about you too
Even though you've waited so long
To see the day
When she will turn
To you again
So long my friend
Is what you'll say

And I don't know
Why you feel so bad
Where is the life you once had?
And still this horrid feeling grows and grows
The way you want it to

Even though you've waited so long
To see the day
When she will turn
To you again
So long my friend
Is what you'll say

And I don't know
Why you feel so bad
Where is the life you once had?
And still this horrid feeling grows and grows
The way you want it to

You're a fool though
Why you feel so bad
Where is the life you once had?
And stilll this hollow feeling grows and grows
The way you want it to
