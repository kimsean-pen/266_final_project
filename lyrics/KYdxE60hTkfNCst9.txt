All that you ever need

I'm running through time
Don't recognize this place, powder on my plate
Been acting a fool
If you were in my shoes you would do the same
Won't pay you in love, pay you in lust
I'm in no rush, it's never enough
I put in an offer, I paid it in full
Look at the view, it's looking at you

I'm on a high, let it take me
Try to enjoy the ride
Everyone's watching us lately
They won't need alibis
Don't get caught up in between
Watch for the signs

Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Yea I know it look clean in the glass house
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
And the grass grow green in the glass house
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Gotta be here to see from the inside out
Can't never be alone in the glass house

Chips on the table
I think I'm feeling a bit unstable
Too many women, wish I could say no
But you know
I become a monster when the drink's in me
Foolish
Losing myself, I'm feeling foolish
Got too much to offer to stay low
But the party keeps going, baby
And I, I, I, I

I'm on a high, let it take me
Try to enjoy the ride
Everyone's watching us, baby
We won't need alibis
Don't get caught up in between
Watch for the signs

Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Yea I know it look clean in the glass house
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
And the grass grow green in the glass house
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Gotta be here to see from the inside out
Can't never be alone in the glass house

Try to enjoy, ooh, try to enjoy the ride
Get in my way
But I can't focus on you, focus on me
Focus on you, focus on
Stuck in my ways sometimes
But I can't focus on you, focus on me
