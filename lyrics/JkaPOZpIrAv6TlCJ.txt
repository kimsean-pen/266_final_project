I found a mountain on my own, I? m encouraged
Trust history to say it? s unknown, it? s discouraging
There? s a seventeen contest in my own home, discourage
Sick of seventeen contests in my own home, discourage

Don? t cross the road, you? re under a spell
A broken violin, discourage
Don? t cross the road, you? re under a spell
Of broken violins

But all I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage

I ran away from my own telephone, discourage
It rings to tell you what the future holds in store for you, so
There? s a lack of confidence at home, discourage
When a seventeen contest fills your own home, discourage

Put your trust in courage, cause no one can tell
The broken violent
Put your trust in courage, no one can tell
The broken violent

But all I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage

All I need is a little discourage
(The world knows what I need)
All I need is a little discourage
(But it? s proving far too hard for me)

All I need is a little discourage
(The world knows what I need)
All I need is a little discourage
(But it? s proving far too hard for me)

All I need is a little discourage
(The world knows what I need)
All I need is a little discourage
(But it? s proving far too hard for me)
