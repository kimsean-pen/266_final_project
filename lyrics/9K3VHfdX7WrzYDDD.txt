Come home in the summer
Live a life that you miss
It's alright
I'll fill you in
Don't you wait
For me to call your name again

I see the wind blow into my shoes
Each (?) cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that i was hurt

Search for a life
Every second
Every day, every night
It's a blessing

I found a job
I do it fine
Not what i want
But still i try

I see the wind blow into my shoes
Each (?) cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that i was hurt
