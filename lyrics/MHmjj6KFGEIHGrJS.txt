Standing in a forest gazing at the sun
looking at the trees but there's not even one
See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by
run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.

I see her face and run to take her hand
Whey she's never there I don't understand
The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down

Visions of angels all around
dance in the sky
Leaving me here
forever goodbye.

As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love
for the fragile beauty of our lives must fade
Though I once remember echoes of my youth
now I sense no past, no love that ends in love

Take this dream the stars have filled with light
As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees
In vengeance to a god no-one can reach.

Visions of angels all around
dance in the sky
Leaving me here
forever goodbye.

Ice is moving and world's begun to freeze
see the sunlight stopped and deadened by the breeze
Minds are empty bodies move insensitive
some believe that when they die they really live

I believe there never is an end
God gave up this world its people long ago
Why she's never there I still don't understand

Visions of angels all around
dance in the sky
Leaving me here
forever goodbye.

Visions of angels all around
dance in the sky
Leaving me here
forever goodbye.
