Hey, you
So you never really found your way
Stay, true
Did you ever make it through today?
(did you ever make it though the day?)

I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me

No, don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
'Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around (that's when I fall to the ground)

When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But I'm the only one you need

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way

If it's me
That you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find your way

Soon when I get you I won't let you go (let you go)
Oooh, if I let you, you can take away (all that I thought was wrong)
And if you hear me there's not much to say
There's gotta be a better way

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
I know you're going to find your way back to me

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way

If it's me
That you don't need
When the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find a way

You can pace around the world 'til you believe
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
