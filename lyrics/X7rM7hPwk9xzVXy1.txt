I got some poison on the brain
And I'm not scared I'm not ashamed
No more of anything, anything, anything but the rain
It melts my smile straight down the drain
I found black magic and white shame
And I lost everything, everything, everything but the pain

I set my alarm for an early start that I slept through
I've torn apart all chances of stealing your heart
That sunless morning
I got my start on the mean streets
Where Demon and Division meet
Been dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning

Now I have violence on the brain
You're not in love you're just insane
Afraid of everything, everything, everything and the shame
It wipes that smile right off your face
Lost in confusion and disgrace
I once had everything, everything, everything but you

I set my alarm for an early start that I slept through
I've torn apart all chances of stealing your heart
That sunless morning

I got my start on the mean streets
Where Demon and Division meet
Been dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning

Jaw dropped, here in shock on the icy streets
(You're Killing)
All the alcohol in hell and I just watched it freeze
(You're Killing)
Now I'll skate on through

Si tu veux
Means I'm finished

I'm getting out, set the clock for an early start
Dodged a bullet, saw my shadow get blown apart
I won't apologize

You are killing me

I set my alarm for an early start that I slept through
I've torn apart all chances of stealing your heart
That sunless morning

I got my start on the mean streets
Where Demon and Division meet
Been dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning

I got some poison on the brain
