baby I'm sorry things didn't work out the way that I planned
but we both know that planning's not my strong suit
I'm sad that I lost you but I won't chase you
I still dont blame you for making me stall
when I learned how to drive your car
because your best friends were all too sad to take you to the airport

but I miss you every minute of every day tell me
why cant you still make a decision 'cause I'm getting better at
crying without making any noise
all I want is your voice in my head
and your hair in my bed

please tell me why I'm so afraid of dying alone so scared and so stoned
but I don't know what I need so just tell me what you need
you're all I need just please don't make me
