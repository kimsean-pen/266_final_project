Don't think, don't speak, watch out
Don't blink, dissent is a cry for the dead
Chin up now, back straight, don't ask, just hate
The serpent's alive, you are all crucified
Tear down the walls again
And all that remains

He'll see your good deeds
And raise you two rights
He'll lose it all just to stay in the fight
And if you're still blind
Sing praise from your knees
His heel in your back from
Once where you stood free
Building your walls again
And all that remains

Broken, broken
Leave the lies
No use in defending
Shattered, fragile to the core

So hail, hail to deathmocracy
Hell for your thought crimes, hail to your piety
Oh, the irony, the antidote is the desease
The balancing of ignorance and atrophy
Tear down the walls again
It's more of the same
Broken, broken
Leave the lies
No use in defending
Shattered, fragile to the core
