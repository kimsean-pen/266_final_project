Someone forgot that toothbrush at my house

I want to be your lover
Wipe your lipstick across my mirror

Your skin across my skin
Your hands on my hips
My neck on your lips

To the backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
To the backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
To the backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
To the backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone

Where the broken glass has been lying
Next to my heart
Where the broken glass has been lying
Next to my heart, to my conscience
Where the broken glass has been
Next to my heart, to my conscience, to my faith

Your flesh against mine
You fletch your teeth, I'll fletch mine
You fletch your teeth, I'll fletch mine

Up the staircase
Despair case, despair case, despair case
Up the staircase
Despair case, despair case, despair case
Up the staircase (Take care, don't hurt yourself)
Despair case, despair case, despair case
Up the staircase (Take care, don't hurt myself)
Despair case, despair case, despair case
Up the staircase
Despair case, despair case, despair case
