ZODIAC

Like the dead
We'll solve no dess
It's like a? let it
Lost in so
Like a pour-ess
Like a mow low led
Moss walls
Like a sez
A poor song yeah
Lost
In paradise
And rock a Thomas
At home
Walls moan like a? man
Like a tee sure one lag
Hoarse man
Like a toe this
Keeps only

Cost
In both solids
Like a warzone
Lost mole
And both san
...miracles...
Cross man goes like a toad
...only...
Lost...
Like...?
?

...Oh yeah
I forgot to get my pill
Got to go downtown...
