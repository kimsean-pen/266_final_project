Maybe you know that it's been too long
Going through the motions as you sing your song
Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done
Still gotta wake up and be someone
Still gotta wake up and be someone

I don't care what the papers say
It's just another intern with a resume
I'm gonna fall in love with you some day
I'm gonna fall in love and run away
I'm gonna fall in love and run away

Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just wanna be alive make something real
Doesn't matter who you are or what you do
Something in the work will make a fool of you
Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time
Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time

Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
