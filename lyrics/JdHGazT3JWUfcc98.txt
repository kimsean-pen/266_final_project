I'm alone and I'm cold
Just another number on another row
I'm alone and I'm cold
Just another number on another row
And I never knew my name
And I never knew my name

I'm alone and I'm cold
Just another number on another row
I'm alone and I'm cold
Just another number on another row

I dissapear for hours
Over the smallest things, yeah
I dissapear for hours
Bah dah, bah dah dah
Bah bah bah dah dah dah
Bah dah, bah dah dah
Bah bah dah dah dah dah

And I never knew my name
And I never knew my name
