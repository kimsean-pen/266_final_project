What did you think
I would do at this moment?
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me
That you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

And what did you think
I would say at this moment?
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me

Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more?

Did you think
I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you?
Oh, come on, you know me too well

And how could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know
I will never hurt you, no, no no...

What did you think
I would give at this moment?
If you'd stay
I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
I kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again
I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you
I will fall down, that on my knees
Oh, God please, let me hold you
Let me hold you...
Again
I'm gonna miss you girl
I'm gonna miss you girl

I can see the tears in your eyes, baby
Baby I'm down, you know, I'm down on my knees
What do you think I would do, baby?
Did you think I could hurt you?
