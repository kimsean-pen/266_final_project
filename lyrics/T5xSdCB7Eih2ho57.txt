Swim in the sea of love
And fly with the white doves
Don't drown, you're almost there
The Tv will say it's not there
It's all within your heart
It's all within your heart
We cannot see a future age
It is like a nebula of love
Swim in the sea of love (In the sea of love) Swim in the sea of love
Swim in the sea of love
Swim in the sea of love
