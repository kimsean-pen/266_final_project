Oh don't you think,
That people are the strangest things?
Design of desire,
Means all that the heart requires,
Is what it can't recognise, oh no

Oh don't you think,
That people are the hardest things?
Design of desire,
Means all that the heart requires,
Is what it can't compromise, oh no

I've made enough enemies,
No I've made enough enemies!

Forget now,
How many must I forget now?
How many must I forget now?
How many must I forget?

Remember,
As many as I remember,
As many as I remember,
I must forget

Regret now,
How many do I regret now?
How many do I regret now?
How many do I regret?

Slender,
Oh there are some but they're slender,
Oh there are some but they're slender sums I regret

Oh don't you think,
That people are the strangest things?
Design of desire,
Means all that the heart requires,
Is what it can't sympathise, oh no
