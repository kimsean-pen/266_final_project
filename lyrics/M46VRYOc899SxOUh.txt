Usher, Lil' Jon, Ludacris
Yeah, man, once again, it's on (It's on)
You know we had to do it again, right?
(We had to do it again, boy)
(Want you to sing to these ladies, man)
Uh oh-oh-oh
I guess I'm up first
Uh oh-oh-oh, (Let me at 'em)
Let's get it

Baby, how ya doin'?
Hope that you're fine, wanna know what you got in mind
And I, got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here, Patron and it's gon' be on
V.I.P. done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin' it a night
She should holla at your girl, tell her you shaking the scene
Pulled off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Oh, oh, I'm ready to ride, (I was like) yeah
'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
I don't mean to sound impatient
But you gotta promise, baby, oh"

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Ohh, I gotta know, baby, oh, yeah)

Tell me again
(Make sure you right, ohh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, oh it's a good look, baby)

It's really a good look baby, look here
Sometime wanna be your lover
Sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug ya
Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins

Opened up your heart, 'cause you said
I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then
Now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable

I could be your Bud, you could beat me up
Play-fight in the dark, then we both make up
I'd do, anythin' just to feel your butt
Why you, got me so messed up?

I don't know but you gotta stop trippin'
Be a good girl now, turn around and get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back

Here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be settin' separate plays
So on all these separate days
Your legs can go they separate ways

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, it's a good look, baby)

Tell me again
(Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Make sure you right, before you choose)

I's been know you fo' a long time
(Shawty)
But fuckin' never crossed my mind
(Shawty)

But tonight, I seen somethin' in ya
(Shawty)
That made me wanna get wit' ya
(Shawty)

But you ain't been nothin' but a friend to me
(Shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be
(Shawty)

Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin'
(Shawty)
Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin'
(Shawty)

Are you sure you wanna go this route?
(Shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out
(Shawty)

I would never ever cross the line
(Shawty)
Shawty, let me hear ya tell me one more time
One more time

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, it's a good look, baby)

Tell me again
(Make sure you're right, oh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Tell me over and over and over again)

Ah, ah, ooh
Ah, ah, ooh
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah

Please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon and Luda had to do it again
(Hey, hey)
Uh, please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon and Luda had to do it again, that's right
(Hey, hey)

Please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon, and Luda had to do it again
(Hey, hey)
