My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much

It'll take some time
But somewhere down the line
We won't be alone

My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much

It'll take some time
But somewhere down the line
We won't be alone

My boy, we don't see each other much
My boy, we don't see each other much

It'll take some time
But somewhere down the line
We won't be alone
