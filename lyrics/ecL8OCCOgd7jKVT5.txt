Hello
Can I say that there's something wrong with this place?
I got time just to waste if you would be my new escape
So then I say "can't find a lover"
Well there's no other way of pulling me under
Cause it's gotta be fate if we're under the covers
It's all gonna be a-ok, a-ok

I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin' you
I don't want to do it, do it, do this all alone

We can dance in your bedroom with no romance
I got time just to waste if you would be my new escape
So then you say "won't be another"
But you give it away cause you want to discover
That it's gotta be fate if we're under the covers
It's all gonna be a-ok, a-ok

I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin' you
I don't want to do it alone
Tell you what
I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin' you
I don't want to do it, do it, do this all

1, 2, 3, 4
4, 3, 2, 1

I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin' you
I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin you
I don't want to do it alone
Tell you what
I don't want to do it alone
I'm beggin you
I don't want to do it, do it, do this all alone
