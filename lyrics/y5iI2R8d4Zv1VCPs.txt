Too exposed
Back's to everything not need-to-know
Same old stuff
Behind the glass we loved to trust
And turn on to adjust

Wider eyes
Follow the trajectory of your lies
Got too close
Analyze the fibers of your coat

Blessed indecisions
Unfettered ideals
Why do they have to be real?

They say, "Come"
Seemingly inherently alone
Post a seat
Conflicted the past it will succeed
Fall from grace
Publicly get eaten on a plate
And turn on to adjust

Left a room
Discussing my impending doom
Funnel-vision
Trust elision to make a decision
Never wrong
When they've got exactly what we want

Blessed indecisions
Unfettered ideals
Strange visions
Why do they have to be real?

Why do they have to be real?

Why do they have to be real?

Blessed indecisions
Unfettered ideals
Strange visions
Why do they have to be real?

Why do they have to be real?
