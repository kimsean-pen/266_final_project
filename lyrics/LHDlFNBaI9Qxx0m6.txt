Put my thoughts together as I wrote you this letter in my room,
On a crumpled piece of paper there were 3 words addressed to you,
It's alright, it's alright now don't panic too soon,
Kuz my love, well, all my love is there for you,
For you, It's all for you.
It's all for you.

Now the blood-red sky is reflecting like last nights rain.
And i'm starting to think that there's not enough ink on the page.
I hope, hope that you, know the truth.
My time, my effort my soul it's all for you.
It's all for you.

And I know sometimes I seem sad,
blue and grey.
But I don't think this time for you has been a waste.
Kuz it was all for you.

It was all for you.
