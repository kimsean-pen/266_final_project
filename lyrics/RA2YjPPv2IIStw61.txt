Screaming
For more justice
Amazonia burns
Can you hear them?

I'll fight
To save another day
So join us
And we'll make them leave this land

Threatening
To kill how we feel
If we stop them
It'll be worth dying for

When you go down! When you go down motherfucker!
When you go down! You go down fighting!
When you go down! When you go down motherfucker!
When you go down! You go down fighting!
(Motherfucker!)

When you go down! When you go down motherfucker!
When you go down! You go down fighting!
When you go down! When you go down motherfucker!
When you go down! You go down fighting!
Filha da puta!

Why? Why?
