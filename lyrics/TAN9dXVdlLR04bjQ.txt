Here in the valley of darkness again
I'm alone and afraid, and I'm pale and I feel
When I open my arms and I dance with the wind
To the beat of my heart
To the drum of my soul for it
Yeah, sometimes the pain is like a rock and roll band
And you gotta

Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da
Dance and cry, and cry and dance and cry
Dance and cry, and cry and dance and cry

Here in the present, I marry again
With your face and the taste of the love
That we used to make
Yeah, sometimes the pain is like an earthquake
But you gotta

Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da

Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da

Dance and cry, and cry and dance and cry
Dance and cry, and cry and dance and cry

We just keep on moving, keep on grooving
Here in the valley of darkness again
We just keep on moving, keep on grooving
Yeah sometimes the pain is like a battering ram
But you gotta

Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
Dance, dance, dance
As you try
Dance, dance, dance
While you cry
You've never felt so alive until you da-da-da-da

Dance and cry, and cry and dance and cry
