I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
you've got to boost your confidence, so you cross me off your shopping list
lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop

you said you yearned for me, but you turned out to be
just like everyone else, and now I'm by myself
from the way you treated me, I thought you needed me
I'm just an empty bottle to you, you used me up and now you're through

I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
you've got to boost your confidence, so you cross me off your shopping list
lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop

I'm thinking about how you make me glow, you're thinking about different ways to say no
I really should have looked ahead, and ignored all the things you said
take my hand and then drop it
blow my bubble then pop it
hold me tight and then stop it
hold me tight and then stop it

I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
you've got to boost your confidence, so you cross me off your shopping list
lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop

I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
you've got to boost your confidence, so you cross me off your shopping list
lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop
