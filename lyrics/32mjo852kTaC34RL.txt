Carry us from the brink
Keep us from becoming extinct
We let you into our worst nightmares
Spouting fiction that left us cowered and scared

Follow the guidelines, and you'll save our lives
It's sad to see you're quickly choking on your lies
You vulture
You're choking on your lies
You vulture
We see through your disguise

Wishing we could take it all back
The beasts in your pack are the worst ones to attack
We'll change course and use a different track
The beasts in your pack are the worst ones to attack

They will show no mercy
They will show no mercy

Abandonment harbors the most resentment
If truth is the backbone you keep on bending it
One day it will snap into pieces
So shattered you're never able to mend them

They are broken
You are broken

Heads bowed before us
The fearless crumble and crawl
Asking forgiveness from all
Use the anger, and direct it within
This could have been prevented
What was completely divided will come together united
Under the wings of a movement

Wishing we could take it all back
Wishing we could take it all back
Change course, and use a different track

We'll rip and shred every word you said
Every word you said

We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
We will show no mercy
