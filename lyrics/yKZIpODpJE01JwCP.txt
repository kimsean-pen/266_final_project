On the walls of Venus's temple
The tale of Narcissus and Echo
A beautiful young nymph
Sentenced to repeat
The last words of the others
Never to talk first

She fell in love with Narcissus
And followed him longing to speak
He said "Who is here" and she replied "Here"
He called for her saying "Come"
She just replied "Come"

As none came near, Narcissus
Called her again
"Why do you shun me"
She could only say the same

These words hurt deep
His pride his actions leads
"I would rather die
Than you should have me"

Narcissus went forth
To a fountain in the north
He kneeled down to drink
And then he fell in love

He said "Who is here"
His voice kept sounding "Here"
He called again the one
That couldn't ever come

His face was young and
In the crystal waters glowed
His smile was cold reflecting
Back a thought

"I would rather die
Than you should have me"
