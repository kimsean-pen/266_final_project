Last night's dream
We rode our bikes
To our treehouse by the sea
And there we laid
And said we'd never leave

Last night's dream
I promised you
Would have the whole world at your feet
And that we'd lay
On a bed we made of leaves

And we both know
You're everything I need
And now I know
What she does to me

She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
She's got me ten feet off the ground
She takes me high, high
Tonight

She takes me
She takes me
She takes me
She takes me high
Tonight

Last night's dream
We drove your car to
The dead end of your street
And we made love
Where no one else could see

Last night's dream
I held your hand
And asked if you would be
Forever mine
Together you and me

And we both know
You're everything I need
And now I know
What she does to me

She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
She's got me ten feet off the ground
She takes me high, high
Tonight

I'll keep sleeping
If I don't stop dreaming
I would stop my breathing for you
I'm not leaving
This life I'm dreaming
'Cause I can't stop living with you

She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high

She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She takes me high
She wakes me up
She breaks me down
She's got me ten feet off the ground
She takes me high, high

She takes me
She takes me
She takes me
She takes me high
Tonight
