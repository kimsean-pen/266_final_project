Run turn about ace
Drift to an unknown place or a niche
The life of a body split
To reason makes it insecure

You may feel it in jest in your Sunday best
Searching for a tango pariah

Do you think it's pious?
To play around in the fire of lies

Today you say you've changed your name
And your mind
Remake yourself today
Only to say you died in vain

Alone a signal you can't avoid
Emptiness was never filler with a void
Denial, close to your personal trial
When you testify in a vial

Open your eyes to the DNA
Make up your lies for the TSA

Check your spirituality at the door
Pragmatic alure

Today you say you've changed your name
And your mind
Remake yourself today
Only to say you died in vain
