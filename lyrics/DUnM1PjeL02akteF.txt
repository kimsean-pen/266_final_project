I wish my girlfriend
Was more like you
I lose my mind with
The way you move
The way you throw

Your hair around
You got a smile that
Knocks me down
You don't waste time,
You tell the truth

Yeah that's what you do
The world comes crashing down
When you come around
You set it on fire
You take my world and

Turn it up
Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up

Burn it up
And you set it on fire
You take my world and
Turn it up

Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up
Burn it up

And you set it on fire
Let it burn,
Let it burn
You set it on fire
Let it burn,

Let it burn
You set it on fire
I wish my girlfriend
Laughed like you
And got my jokes

Just like you do
I don't want to give
You the run around
I'm holding on to what we've found
You pull me in deeper with

The way you move
Yeah that's what you do
World comes crashing down
When you come around

You set it on fire
You take my world and
Turn it up
Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up

Burn it up
And you set it on fire
You take my world and
Turn it up

Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up
Burn it up
And you set it on fire
Let it burn,
Let it burn
You set it on fire
Let it burn,
Let it burn
You set it on fire
The world comes crashing down
When you come around
You set it on fire
You take my world and
Turn it up
Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up
Burn it up,
You set it on fire
You take my world and
Turn it up
Turn it up,
Turn it up
Yeah the way you move you
Burn it up
