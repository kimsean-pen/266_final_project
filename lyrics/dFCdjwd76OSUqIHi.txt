Link my door tonight
I am sold
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
You said it was a flash of green
But you hadn't known
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
But I am going to shoot
There's nothing like a break
But it may be a consolation
That shows us where we are
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
So most of how you felt
I'm glad I could help
I could talk this over twenty thousand years
Everything is wonderful close to you
So most of how you felt
I'm glad I could help
But I am going to shoot
There's nothing like a break
But it may be a consolation
That shows us where we are
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
And we late, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
