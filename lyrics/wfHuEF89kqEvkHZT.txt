Boom, boom, boom, boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
Love that is true
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
When you walk that walk
And you talk that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
Come on and shake (shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (shake it baby)
Come on now baby (shake it baby)

Alright, alright (ahh...)
Come on now baby
The way you walk
The way you talk
When you walk that walk
When you're talkin' that talk
You knockin' me out
Right off of my feet
I need you right now
I mean right now
I don't mean tomorrow
I mean right now
Come on, come on
Come on, shake it up baby
Come on and shake (shake it baby)
Shake it up baby (shake it baby)
Come on now baby (shake it baby)
Come on now baby (shake it baby)
