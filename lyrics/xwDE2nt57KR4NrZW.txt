He had a plan to kill you all along
The evidence was hidden in this song
I was a ghost
I was there at the scene
As the embers rise, my hands
Smelled like gasoline

So, the headlights murdered my thoughts
I curse this taste that's on my tongue
This taste will last until I rip it out
No, I won't need these gloves
Her bones are withered away, but her ghost will remain

You're the only one that wore your seat belt
We're the only ones that cried
Catastrophic accidents
You're the only one that died

So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
And nothing's as it seems

Hallelujah
So just believe in me
I'll never let you down
This was a curse I can say

As you lie in your grave.
You're the only that wore your seat belt
We're the only ones that cried
Catastrophic accidents

You're the only one that died
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams and nothing's as it seems

(But her ghost will remain as you lie in your grave) 2x
All the choices you've made

And the paths that I take
You're the only one that died
The evidence was hidden in this song
All the choices you've made

And the paths that I take
We're the only ones that cried
Irrelevant
I knew it all along
All the choices you've made

And the paths that I take
(It was never enough, it was never enough
it was never enough now was it)
So keep my casket closed

Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
But nothing's as it seems
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
But nothing's as it seems
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
But nothing's as it seems
