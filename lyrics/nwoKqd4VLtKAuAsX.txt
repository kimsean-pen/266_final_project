"Teach me your mood, o patient stars.
Who climb each night, the ancient sky.
Leaving on space no shade, no scars, no trace of age. No fear to die."
"My allegiance is with the inner self
The dark celestial voice of wisdom
Beyond the dust that is this world"

There is a voice adrift in the starless
and marble black dark space
A voice of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the darkest places
calling... haunting me...
Where no light bears a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed

I am compelled to dissolve
into the eternal unknown eidolon
A voice that leads to a world beyond
a mere mortal's most profound dreams
Yet I know...
There is no turning back from here
There is no place for the undeserved
Gone are the relics!

"Teach me your ways
Of hatred, unlight, and death
I offer myself to your wisdom
My allegiance is with the elite!"

There is a voice adrift in the darkness
calling... calling me...
A whisper of wisdom and purity
Beyond the vestiges of sanity
There is a voice deep in the starless
and marble black dark space
Where no light draws a shadow
Where no time escapes unhallowed

"An effigy; a gift from another kind"

In the glow of a distant aurora light
No dreams shall take form
Gifts dwell in the depths of
things unspoken
this night...
