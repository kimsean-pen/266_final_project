You're more than tongue tied this time
Well I can feel it in your lips
Nobody told me you were a sucker for a kiss

Music low
We're all alone
Being wrong never felt so right

Tell me about your first kiss
Tell me or have you already forgotten it
Tell me about your first kiss
What do I have to do to get through all of this?
I'm writing it down
I bet you thought this song was about you

You're more than just mad this time
You've got that look in your eye
Nobody told me you were a sucker for a kiss

Music low
We're all alone
Being wrong never felt so right

Tell me about your first kiss
Tell me or have you already forgotten it?
Tell me about your first kiss
What do I have to do to get through all of this?
I'm writing it down

And just leave me here
and tell me to my face what you think about.
Can we figure out
what happened to our happy ending anyway?
How you feel about
Leaving me here
With a lot more left to say

Music low
We're all alone
Being wrong never left so right

Tell me about your first kiss
Tell me or have you already forgotten it?
Tell me about your first kiss
What do I have to do to get though all of this?
I'm writing it down
I bet you thought this song was about you
I bet you thought this song was about you
