What do I have to do to make you forgive me?
I wouldn't even tell the world if you could hear I'm sorry
What do I say to make it so you stay around me?
What do I have to do? What will release me?

You won't abandon where you aim
Someday I hope you'll change your hand
Howling into the bed below your sight
It was in your sight
I was another

What do I have to do to make you forgive me?
I wouldn't even tell the world if you could hear I'm sorry
What do I say to make it so you stay around me?
What do I have to do? What will release me?

How can I make you believe me?
How can you command me
When I call out for
Please understand

What do I have? What do I have?
What do I have to do?

What do I have to do to make you forgive me?
I wouldn't even tell the world if you could hear I'm sorry

What do I have? What do I have?
What do I have to do?
