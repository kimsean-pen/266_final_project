I'm a red blooded-rough neck-son of a bitch
I'm a goddamned American capitalist
I've got a kill 'em all-give a shit-license to hate
I'm that one shot-one kill-bringer of fate

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become, where I belong
I'm an American capitalist
American capitalist

War is the answer like I told you before
You're a coward with no power just a stain on the floor
If you're a man be a man, and stop runnin' your lips
Round 3, no mercy, it's the way of the fist

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become, where I belong
I'm an American capitalist
American capitalist

I don't wanna believe I'm empty
I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become, where I belong (I'm an American...)
I don't wanna believe I'm empty
I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I've become, where I belong
I'm an American capitalist
American capitalist
