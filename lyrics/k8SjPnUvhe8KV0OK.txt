I let it happen again
I failed myself
I failed my friends
Check my pulse, I'm alive
Did it cross your mind
Cross your mind

I gave up
I gave up

Take the keys to my car
Just drive me far
Far away
From this hospital bed
Where my soul is sick
And I'm scared of it

I gave up
Somebody help me
I gave up
I gave up
I gave up

Every day is a lie
Every mile a mountain
Mountain
Every day is a lie
Every mile a mountain
Mountain

I give up

I gave up
Somebody help me
I gave up
I gave up

I gave up
Every day is a lie
Every mile a mountain
I gave up
Somebody help me
I gave up
