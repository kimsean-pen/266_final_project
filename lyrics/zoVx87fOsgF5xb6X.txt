Shorty said she wants to run away
Says I look like a boy she used to date
Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs (Not interested, girl)
Put her tongue all up in my ear (Gross)
Almost made me spill my beer (Oh shit!)
She's up and ready to go but I don't care (Pssh, whatever)

Cause I'm in the zone
Turned off my phone
I've got my own agenda

I feel like dancing tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight

Everybody gettin' kinda crunk
I think some dude just grabbed my junk (Whoa)
Now I know how Ke$ha must be feelin' (Like, what if we are the aliens?)
Bros tried to turn me upside down
I put a keg tap to my mouth
But that's okay
I'm dancing on the ceiling (Ahhh)

Cause I've got the groove
I'll bust a move
Just try and stop me

I feel like dancing tonight
I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight

Somebody call the police (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I think they're coming to get me
They said
"You've got the right to remain on the dance floor
So show us what you've got
Cause you know that you've got more!"

I feel like dancing tonight
I came to party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight
Oh, one more time!
I feel like dancing tonight (I feel like dancing)
I'm gonna (dancing) party like it's my civil right (Oh-Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh)
It doesn't matter where
I don't care if people stare
Cause I feel like dancing tonight (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
I feel like dancing tonight (Ha Ha)
