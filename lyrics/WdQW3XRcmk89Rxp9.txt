Where'd you go?

I miss you so

Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"

I don't understand why you have to always be gone I get along but the trips always feel so long and

I find myself tryna stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone, but I feel like an idiot
workin' my day around the call but when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up that I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing
"Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever

That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
You know the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile, but now, you only stop by every once in a while, shit

I find myself just fillin' my time
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up, that I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing
"Where'd you go?"
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever

That you've been gone.

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
I want you to know it's a little fucked up, that I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses, for while you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along

You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career, when you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
