You never close your eyes
When I am near you
You never say you know me
When I am inside of you
Girl you know it's only a feeling
Girl you know you lie and you steal
When you take my trust in your body
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
You are another person
When you are alone
Nothing moves inside you
No one holds you down
Girl you know it's only a feeling
You should never trust what you feel
When you forget your body
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
Nothing inside you is real
You're not real
You're not real
