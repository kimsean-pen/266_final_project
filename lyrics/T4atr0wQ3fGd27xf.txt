You made a mistake
On the day that you met me
And lost your way
You saw all the signs
But you let it go
You closed your eyes

I shoulda told you to leave
Cause I knew all the time you couldn't handle me
But you're hard to resist
When you're on your knees
Begging me

I'll tear you down
I'll make you bleed
Eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you
When it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel

Hate being that wall
That you hit
When you feel like you gave it all
I keep taking the blame
When we both know that I'll never change

I'll tear you down
I'll make you bleed
Eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you
When it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel

I wasn't always this way
I used to be the one with the halo
But that disappeared when I had my first taste
And fell from grace
It left me
In this place

Well I'm starting to think
Maybe you like it

I'll tear you down
I'll make you bleed
Eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you
When it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel
