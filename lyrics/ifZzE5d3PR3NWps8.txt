High above the sea
I haven't slept in days
There's no looking back
Afraid of what's ahead
Head is full of rocks
Pockets full of change
It has been so long
Since I have felt this way

Waiting in your sleep
Forget about the rain
I'm frozen in and out
It's all about to change
Awake from your sleep
When I make it in
Could we get back
Where we were again
