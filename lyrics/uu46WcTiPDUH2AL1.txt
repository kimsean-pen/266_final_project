World in Flames
A Prophecy of Skies
Forces Beyond Nature
Tortured Winds, a Cleansing Plague
Fragment of Bone, Corpses Pile
Black of Night, Red of Skies
Forming the Figure of Desire
Sacrifice, Winds of Death
A Monument to World's End
Plague Bearer, Mouth of the World
Where Your Temple Lies
Purging Their Souls, in Blackened Fire
Immortalized in Dying Glow
Elements Entangled, Drawn from the Dust
Summoned in Silence, Bodies Form the Altar
Order of the Master's Hand
Spewing From Molten Ground
In Soil of Ashes
Forces Converging
Constructing the Spire
