Across the ages the world has been
Changing, it's drifting in space

The rest of you that still remain
Guarding your memories, now sleep

Running fast you're only
A flash inside the pan

Life will never, never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way

Spinning around you
Millions of screams
Deafen all your sanity

Fast decay, no delay
Minutes are lost in sublime

Running fast you're only
A flash inside the pan

Life will never, never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way

All day you feel lonely
Cause you know
The years have gone by
They'll never come again

Life is overrated
But who will ever know

Life will never, never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way.
