I can see my story
Searching to find someone to know me
I can see you're learning
Waiting to find out who you really are

I can SEE my story
So deeply entangled in your own
I can SEE our journey
Waiting to see if we belong
Wandering alone

I can see my story
I can believe in what you wanted to be

I can see you now
I can believe you now
I can see our story
Waiting to find out who we really are

Wandering alone here
Wandering alone here
Wandering alone here
Wandering alone here
