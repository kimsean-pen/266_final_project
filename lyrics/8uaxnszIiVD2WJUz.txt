You're livin' your life and you're down for the fight
And it's wrong or it's right, and you're aware of your might
You're flyin' that kite and you're shinin' that night
Yeah you're shinin' that night, yeah you're shinin' and
You try but stop it[6x]
You try, try, try

You're livin' your life and you're down for the fight
And it's wrong or it's right, and you're aware of your might
But you're shinin' that night and you're flyin' that kite
Yeah you're flyin' that kite, yeah you're flyin' and
You try but stop it[6x]
You try, try, try

And you wonder what's next
You've been put to the test
And you wonder what's next [4x]
