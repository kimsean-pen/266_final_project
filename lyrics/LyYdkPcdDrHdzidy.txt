Momma you're beautiful tonight,
Movie star hair and that black eye,
You can't even notice it when you smile so hard through a heart felt lie,
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh,
Another suitcase full of cash,
Shiny apologies in a velvet box,
What a real good man.

We drive brand new cars and we light fine cigars,
We shine like small town stars through the best days of our lives,

We would walk right down the pavement,
I know we're gonna be just fine,
And I'll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Another fist, another wall,
We lose ourselves we lose it all,
I wrote him a hundred times,
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don't know my name,
The tears I cry all taste of blame,
Bad luck and dirty cops,
I'm a ****ing teenage tragedy,

I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,
So hold on before you see that you're better off without me,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I'm gonna be just fine,
And I'll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

There's a rainbow on the bathroom door again,
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly,
I'm gone and I ain't coming back this time,
I'm gonna find my home underneath the city lights,

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse,
Right out the hole in my fur coat,
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl,
I promise I'll be the one you want,
Don't tell me I'm unfixable,
You don't know what it's like to be seventeen with no place to go,

But give me just one night and I'll be almost fine,
Remind me one more time it's the best days of our lives,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know we're gonna be just fine,
And I'll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Just another Saturday night.
