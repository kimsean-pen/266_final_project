Goodbye Joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh
He gotta go-pole the pirogue down the bayou
His Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, fontaineaux the place is buzzin'
A kin-folk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style the go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my, my Cher a mi-oh
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Settle down far from town get him a pirogue
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap his mom to buy Yvonne what she need-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my, my Cher a mi-oh
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my, my Cher a mi-oh
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my, my Cher a mi-oh
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm a-gonna see my, my Cher a mi-oh
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
