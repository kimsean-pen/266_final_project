So here I lie in the belly of a shark
So fucking cold and so fucking dark
So here I lie in the belly of a shark
And how the fuck did I get this far?
Now all I have to do is swim after you
Convince you to climb in too
Cut yourself first
They can smell your blood
From forty miles away
There'll be here in no time
There'll be here in no time
They can smell you bleeding
Motherfucker, miles away, you
So here I lie in the belly of a shark
So fucking cold and so fucking dark
So here I lie in the belly of a shark
And how the fuck did I get this far?
I'm gonna show you
Exactly what you mean to me
I'm gonna eat every man that you see
I'm gonna show you
Exactly what you mean to me
I'm gonna eat every man that you see
