I was here
When the first morning dawned upon you
I'll be there
I was here
When you first ever drew a breath in
I'll be there
For the last living thing

And I will turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock this wicked world behind me
Lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock the universe

I was here
Will you welcome and recognize me
I'll be there
I was here
Will you dread me, will you despise me
I'll be there
For the last living thing

And I will turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock this wicked world behind me
Lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock the universe

And I will turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock this wicked world behind me
Lights out
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And lock the universe
Turn the lights out
