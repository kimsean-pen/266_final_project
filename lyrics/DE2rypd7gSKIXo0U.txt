We're falling skyward, with heaven below
And you look tired and I think I know
Because I've been there when times were hard
And you stayed too
She's only 23 how could she?
How could she know?
The mood it changed with the turn of tide
I'm scared of the dark and I know why
I gaze my stray and I catch your eyes
And I slip through
She's only 23 how could she?
How could she know?
And I've never known
This kind of fear before
Is this what it means
To be adored?
Falling skyward with heaven below
And you look tired and I think I know
Because I've been there when times were hard
This picture burns as I set it alight
When I can't see there's no need, you know mine
But now it's over do you ask why
You stayed too?
And I've never known
This kind of fear before
Is this what it means
To be adored?
How could she know?
