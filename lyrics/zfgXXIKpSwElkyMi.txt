Under the surface so crystal clear
Everyone was really tense
Waiting down there
He had his own world just like I had mine
We'll go separate ways until the next time

There are no words to say
As my friends swims away

Captain Nemo said, "Okay"
"Five, four, three, two, one"
Then I raised my hand away
Captain Nemo went away
"Love me when I'm gone"

Left me all alone
Nemo's going home

And as I watched him, police boats approached
An alien force
Haunting us like ghosts
Wish I could stay here and play for a while
But I must be on my way
The warmest of smiles

Then he dived into waves
Among the other whales

Captain Nemo said, "Okay"
"Five, four, three, two, one"
Then I raised my hand away
Captain Nemo went away
"Love me when I'm gone"

Left me all alone
Nemo's going home

Going home
