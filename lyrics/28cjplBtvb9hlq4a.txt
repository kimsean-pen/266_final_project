I know that time takes away everything,
I know that time will not shake,
and the only way anyone of us will escape,
is to understand the way,
forever chasing my tail around the bend,
hold on please babe please babe hold onnnnnnn,

is this the way that you remember meeeee-eee,
if this is the way that you remember me,
if this is the way that you remember meeee-eee,
if this is the way that you remember mee...

and i cant explain how much memories,
hold on to nothing else
and the fever comes to take to send me,
hoping the night will come,

if this the way that you remember meeeee-eee,
if this is the way that you remember me,
if this is the way you remember meeee-eee,
if this is the way you remember mee...

if this the way that you remember meeeee-eee,
if this is the way that you remember me,
if this is the way that you remember meeee-eee,
if this is the way that you remember mee...
