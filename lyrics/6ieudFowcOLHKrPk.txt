We threw words like they were sharp knives
Fell like we tripped over a landmine
You said we lost love
You made your mind up
And I just got quiet, and my body went numb
I pretend that I can handle it, and if I hold my head up I won't drown
Can't let go, you're like the chemical, you're racing through me
My heart just pounds, pounds, pounds

It's getting louder and louder
Everytime I think about ya, about ya
I'll be better off without ya, without ya
I wish my heart it would stop, wish my heart it would stop
Beating me up
Beating me up
Beating me up
You've moved on, I know I should too

My cuts are all gone, my pain feels brand new
Who turned the lights down? Who took my flashlight?
Why does my heart sound like it might burst tonight?
It's getting louder and louder
Everytime I think about ya, about ya
I'll be better off without ya, without ya
I wish my heart it would stop, wish my heart it would stop
Beating me up

Beating me up
Beating me up
I wish my heart it would stop, wish my heart it would stop

How'd I let you get the best of me
How'd my heart become my enemy

How'd I let you get the best of me
How'd my heart become my enemy
(Beating me up, Beating me up) (Beating me up, Beating me up)
It's getting louder (louder and louder), everytime I think about ya (about ya, about ya)
I'll be better off without ya (without ya, without ya)

I wish my heart it would stop, I wish my heart it would stop
Beating me up (Beating me up)
Beating me up
Wish my heart it would, wish my heart it would stop
Beating me up
Beating me up
