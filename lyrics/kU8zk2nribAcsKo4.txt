You say we play running back and forth
But im nothing like the girl you knew before
told you i'd be fine on my own
and i can't promise to stay
words we meant to say were i need you
and i wanna make it right
if not for life
just for tonight

in the meantime
well look out for the sun
hold your heart close to mine and for right now well just be
watch and see

round and round and upside down again
now a days he seems a different man
he told me he was making other plans
couldn't promise to stay

but what he really meant to say was
i love you
and he wants to make it right
if not for life just for tonight

in the meantime we'll look out for the sun
hold your heart close to mine and for right now well be
watch and see yea light on windows says we should be going
one more glance and well be on our way

light on window says we should get going
one more dance and well be on our way

light on window says we should be going
come now sit down lets talk about our love.
