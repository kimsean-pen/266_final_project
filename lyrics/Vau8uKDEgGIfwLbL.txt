i'm in a place i told myself i wouldn't go.
a million miles from a house i can't call home.
i wanna leave it behind.
stained carpets and all the things we hide.
i'm gone for it all, in my mind.
god bless the freak show we call "us". i miss home.
an ordinary life seems bland, but ours is chrome.
i never wanted anything more than a room.
some place to lay my head. a place where i'd have you.
it's as bad as it seems. i'm losing sleep over the screams.
i'm away for it all. god help me.
i came down. i turned blue and choked.
i came down again.
