Through the Juno bush you see her lips are miming Gwen Stefani
The horizon takes a trip along her body
Staring at the posters on your wall
As they talk about my chances
Boy, you're so tragic
Your floor was damaged from months ago
Where you dropped a hot comb dancing to neo-soul
The trees are gold on your iPhone background
Which is funny cos you cut down
Like eight last spring for the new lawn
How's it look, baby?
How's it feel?
Is it too much for you?
Big fucking deal
Me me me
That's all we know
Me me me
That's all we know
You might think you do
But I bet you don't
You might think you do
But I bet you don't
I heard you joined the peace corps
Planting ferns & feeding the poor
You're not so bad anymore
Me me me
That's all we know
Me me me
That's all we know
You might think you do
But I bet you don't
You might think you do
But I bet you don't
