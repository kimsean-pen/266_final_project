I felt picture perfect
On and off a shelf to
A broken frame of mind
A broken frame of mind

It comes back and haunts me
A bullet undercover
It fooled me every time, it fooled me every time

But even if I lose it all
I've got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid

I will love you
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you
Like I've never been burned
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you
I will love like I've never been hurt
Never been hurt

You set fire to ashes
You fought through the darkness
And brought me back to life, you brought me back to life

So even if I lose it all
I got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid

I will love you
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you
Like I've never been burned
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you
I will love like I've never been hurt
Never been hurt

I will love you and forever
I will love you like I never
Like I never heard goodbye
Like I never heard a lie
Like I'm falling into love for the first time
Yeah

I will love you
Like I've never been hurt
Run through fire for you
Like I've never been burned
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost
Gonna give it all I've got
I will love you
I will love like I've never been hurt
Never been hurt
