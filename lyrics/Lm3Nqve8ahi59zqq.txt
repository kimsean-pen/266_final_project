I've exposed your lies baby
The underneath's no big surprise
And now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose your own game
Change me, replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
