I gotta keep myself in check sometimes
Cause I tend to dream real big sometimes
The fancy outfits and the sparkly awards
My name in lights, the people lined up at the doors
But I gotta remember to take it one step at a time

People seem to think
That you'll be happier, once you reach the top
You'll have it all
But I'm livin for right now
Cause what if tomorrow never comes
I'm not waitin, I'm not waitin
For the confetti to fall

I can't just sit around and wait for my life to start
I can make a difference, put a little happiness in someone's heart
The fancy cars, the glitter and the fame
It's all nice but it won't be worth a thing
Love is bigger, so imma stand up for love, yeah

If there was a rope stretching up to the sky
With all of my dreams at the very top, so high
I get so caught up in everything around me, movin quickly
I forget to cherish every single moment I receive
I forget about the climb, I just wanna get there
Don't wanna wait in line, even though it's so clear
That I'm called to use patience on this journey that I'm on
I know that I'll come out alive and it'll only make me stronger
Oh oh, while everybody's focused on the hype
Oh oh, oh oh... I'll be wonderin why we seem to think...
