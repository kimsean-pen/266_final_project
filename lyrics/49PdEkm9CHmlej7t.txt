I was going hungry and lazy here
When you stopped me in my tracks
I was going crazy; I was desolate and ready to kill
But maybe I believe in another place
If you go, you won't look back
And anywhere you go you know
The ugliness will follow you still

And you break
This into waste
We are desperate, lonely and underpaid
I m a bitter man, I know
But listen, honey, you're no fun

I will never live like you
But you will probably die like me
Oh lovelessly, an ending
Full of god, and god makes plenty.
You will go on searching
For someone to keep you killing
If you love me, won't you leave me?
'cause I want to settle down

First you
Fade into the background
Wouldn t even call me
Had the nerve to leave me
Go ahead and love me
I m a hungry man
Ever since you went away

First you
Fade into the background
Wouldn t even call me
Had the nerve to leave me
Go ahead and love me
I m a hungry man
Ever since you went away

I don't know if you've got another place
Where you bury all these things
I don't know if you can see the shadow
That you cast on the ground
But maybe I can see through the lonely face
Loose your feet and loose your waist
Anywhere you are, you know the freedom there
Is dragging you down

And you break me into lines
We can shake our bodies
And wreck our minds
I m a bitter man, I know,
But listen, honey, you're no fun

I will never love like you
But you will probably hate like me
Oh lovelessly, and empty
Full of god, and god makes plenty.
You will go on searching
For someone to keep you killing
If you love me, won't you leave me?
'cause I want to settle down

First you
Fade into the background
Wouldn t even call me
Had the nerve to leave me
Go ahead and love me
I m a hungry man
Ever since you went away.

First you
Fade into the background
Wouldn t even call me
Had the nerve to leave me
Go ahead and love me
I m a hungry man
Ever since you went away.

And oh, don't you wanna love?
And don't you wanna feel?
I remember, you were reckless, you were hungry
You were real, you were so uptight
Listen, I don't mind
I feel like I m watching a car crash.

And oh, this is how it ends
You will watch your friends
Take a moment, take a nothing
Then they'll put it in again.
This is how we are
This is how we are
We are young and stupid
And raised by wolves

I will never live like you do
I will never love like you do

I will never live like you do
I, I will never love like you do

I will never live like you do
I will never love like you do

I will never live like you
I will never love like you

I will never live like you do
No, I will never love like you

I will never live like you
Say I, I will never love like you do
