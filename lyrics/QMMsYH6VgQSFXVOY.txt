They see me in a magazine
I'm the one they want to be
Still dont feel I'm good enough
Still don't feel I'm thin enough

I stand up and I'm pushed back down
And every opinion now
It makes me feel inhuman
Givin' in and givin' up

To be worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be confident in this skin

So tell me what is wrong with me
I'm the girl with everything
So why am I not strong enough
I wanna be strong enough
To tell you how I really feel
I know my talent is real
So don't tell me
Don't tell me
I have to prove one or two
I don't have to prove
So don't tell me
Don't tell me

Cause I am worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be real, be real
See the beauty indise this skin
I don't have to hide this skin
I feel, I feel
An awakening in this skin
Stop forsaking me in this skin

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am
oooohhh
To be
worthy
Be beautiful
Love me
For me
Cause I am beautiful

To be worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be confident in this skin
Be real, be real
See the beautiful in this skin
Cause I don't want to have to hide it
I feel, I feel
I'm beautiful in this skin
Beautiful in this skin
I'm beautiful
And your beautiful
Beautiful in this skin
