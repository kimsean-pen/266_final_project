I don't wanna waste my time again
Like getting wasted with so-called friends
'Cause they don't know me
But they pretend to be part of my social scenery
And hey, maybe I'm a critic, a cynic
Or am I jaded?
Or am I afraid of it?
'Cause it's dragging me down
It's bumming me out

It's making my head spin round and round

Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?
Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?
I get the feeling we're on to something
I say jump and you start jumping
Can you say hey!

Can you say ho!
That's that, now what do you want from me?

Just another day in the life for me
It's 3am and I can't sleep
And I've been thinking that we've been drinking
In hopes to maintain our sanity
And hey, maybe I'm a critic, a cynic

Or am I crazy?
Do they all hate me?
'Cause they pick me up and throw me down
It's making my head spin round and round

Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?
Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?

I get the feeling we're on to something
I say jump and you start jumping
Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's that, now what do you want from me?

Everything that I do
It's never good enough for you
I do my best

Dress to impress
Ripped my heart out of my chest
Going no where fast
I don't know where I'm at
When I say jump and you start jumping
Hey! We're onto something

Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?
Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's right, what do you want from me?
I get the feeling we're on to something
I say jump and you start jumping
Can you say hey!
Can you say ho!
That's that, now what do you want from me?
