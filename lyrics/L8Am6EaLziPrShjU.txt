Tired eyes wait on you
Can't please me
The sky is more grey than blue
Bet you hope I'll bloom, bloom, bloom
All the colour we miss
Are some birds left on it
They're all adrift behind
Don't you pay them any mind

Wouldn't pass the hours
Close to me, I see, I can tell
Looking closely, don't you wait
Who will hold me up?
I wanna touch the sky
Who will hold me up?

Days wash over me
I felt it all
I'm caught underneath
And you're falling through, through, through
How soon it will come
Till this world is gone
They're all adrift behind
Don't you pay them any mind

Wouldn't pass the hours
Close to me, I see, I can tell
Looking closely, don't you wait
Who will hold me up?

Wouldn't pass the hours
Close to me, I see, I can tell
Looking closely, don't you wait
Who will hold me up?
I wanna touch the sky
Who will hold me up?
I wanna touch the sky
Who will hold me up?
I wanna touch the sky
Who will hold me up?
