Take you in, like the air, you're a nice surprise (ooh)
Like a rose, full in bloom, I romanticize
Only when I'm with you, colors they show through
Trust I speak the truth, darling I get weak when you

Put your lips on my lips
When you're touching like this
No they don't ever lie
And when the feeling is right
You can tell by my eyes
No, these lips they don't lie

These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips, they go like this, they go like this

See it through, and for you I would take my time (ooh)
Not a phase, comes in waves, let me ease your mind (ooh)
Only one I choose, ride or die with you
Trust I speak the truth, darling I get weak when you

Put your lips on my lips
When you're touching like this
No they don't ever lie
And when the feeling is right
You can tell by my eyes
No, these lips they don't lie

These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips, they go like this, they go like this

You got me hooked on one kiss
I put your lips on my lips
When I think of you it's pure bliss

Put your lips on my lips
When you're touching like this
No, they don't ever lie
You put your lips on my lips
When your touching like this
No, they don't ever lie
And when the feeling is right
You can tell by my eyes
No, these lips they don't lie

These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips they go like this
(They go, they go, they go, they go)
These lips on lips, they go like this, they go like this

Only one I choose, ride or die with you (ride or die with you)
Trust I speak the truth (I speak the truth)
Darling I get weak when
You put your lips on my lips (You put your lips on my lips)
No, they don't ever lie (no, they don't, no, they don't)
And when the feeling is right (ooh, ooh)
No, these lips they don't lie
These lips on lips they go like this
