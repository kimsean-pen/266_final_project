Billie Joe, it is pleasantly meeting you here at the recording studio. Right after you make your first record.How does it feel?
Wonderful!

She smashed the radio
With the board of education
Turn up the static left
Of the state, of the nation

Turn up the flame, step on the gas
Burning the flag at half mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son
An export of the revolution

She is the first voice
Of the last ones in the line
She'll drag the lake
To keep the Vendetta alive

Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Somebody shot the President
And no one knows where Maria went?

Maria, Maria, Maria
Where did you go?

Be careful what you're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing the line in the dirt
Because the last decision is "no"

She smashed the radio
With the board of education
Turn up the static left
Of the state, of the nation

Turn up the flame, step on the gas
Burning the flag at half mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son
An export of the revolution

Maria, Maria, Maria
Where did you go?
Maria, Maria, Maria
Where did you go?
