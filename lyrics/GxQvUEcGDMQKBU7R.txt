Hear, can you hear them coming
The voracious souls are out
There's no sense fighting, no hiding out
They will hunt me
To life worth living
For the taste of fear, a trail of
Tears leads them here
Sense my flesh with me
For I'm still here

Excavate my earth
Exhume my corpses
Parading your dismay
Of a beast that's on it
I lay them to rest
You accept the lie
To display your virtue the eyes
Let them die

Let it die
Let it die

Behind the glass
Barricade yourself in
Slowly isolation
Will confine your feet
Reinvent yourself
What happened to it
or find a place
To force your beliefs

Paragon
From a distance you just play your part
In your own fiction
Paragon
From a distance you tell anyone
Who will listen
From afar a quintessential being
You're a facade, where's your resistance

You cannot in your salt when you suffer
I am above the ruinous faults of your burnt-out skin
That's something they can turn to, you may not be it
The world will look upon you

Let the grace be graves
Let the grace be graves

Are you searching for your life at the gallows?
Are you searching for your light in the shadows?

Paragon
From a distance you tell anyone
Who will listen
From afar a quintessential being
You're a facade, where's your resistance

Gripped upon my corruption and power
Feelings of hatred, self-division, self-greed
See your reflection
All access to fight for this spreading disease
Real world that's bleeding
Do you sell that cross once you renew
The beast comes in pieces
Let the exception of one end with you

Let it die
Let it die
