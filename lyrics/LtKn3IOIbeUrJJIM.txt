Take my hand
We can find a place no one knows
And you can tell me where this goes
And, oh, it's hard for you
You've got scars beneath your clothes
You didn't do this on your own

As I hold my hand out for you
You're too scared to let me in
And we end where we begin

When you gave away the love we gave you
You don't want a soul to save you
Yeah, I'll never stop, I'm not giving in
(No, no, no, no)
'Cause I'll climb the walls that slowly cage you
Break that chains that you can't break through
Yeah, I'll never stop, I'm not giving in

I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in

And don't pretend to understand
What it's like, stood in your shoes
But I would try them on for you
'Cause I hate to see you fade away
On the corner where you lay
Beggin' passers by for change

When the daylight breaks before you
You're too scared to let it in
And we end where we begin

When you gave away the love we gave you
You don't want a soul to save you
Yeah, I'll never stop, I'm not giving in
(No, no, no, no)
'Cause I'll climb the walls that slowly cage you
Break that chains that you can't break through
Yeah, I'll never stop
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in

Now honestly, promise me, tell me the truth
You don't have to do what they're asking o' you
Get out of this place
Don't give them your grace, my dear
And no, no, don't let them treat you like one of their slaves
Promise you laugh just to steal it away
No, don't take that plane
Don't fall for this game, my dear

'Cause you gave away the love we gave you
You don't want a soul to save you
Yeah, I'll never stop, I'm not giving in
(No, no, no, no)
'Cause I'll climb the walls that slowly cage you
Break that chains that you can't break through
Yeah, I'll never stop, I'm not giving in

I'm not giving in
Not giving in
