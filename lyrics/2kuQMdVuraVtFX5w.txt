If it helps you, you can always run away
And if it makes you feel any better
You can tear yourself apart
But in the end you will stand alone
And your shadow stares back at you
You wish for the end of the world
And for sure you will have it all
But when you look at the last sunset
All your dreams begin to fall
Marching through fire without water
Cleanse yourself for tomorrow
Fear is forbidden
Marching through fire without water
Cleanse yourself for tomorrow
Fear is forbidden
It is obvious that we are not here to value life
We are built for greed
Envy is not a deadly sin
It's just a word to explain what you really are
Harness yourself for the last war
A war no one can win
Marching through fire without water
Cleanse yourself for tomorrow
Fear is forbidden
Marching through fire without water
Cleanse yourself for tomorrow
Fear is forbidden
Fear is forbidden!
