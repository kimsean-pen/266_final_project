What wish will ransom me
Unbury violently
All innocents, all innocents?
Lanterns illumine me
Burning the memory
Rise innocent, rise innocent

What rage will usher me
Swallow the enemy
Buy innocence, buy innocence
Lanterns illumine me
Incense from memory
Rise innocent, rise innocent

Or is the long war won?
The army in me gone
Overrun?
To heal this violent son
A breath from one last lung
Overcomes

Pull out the song from every open mouth at once
The lantern tongues!
And i will hear the song in every heart at once
The roaring drums
The harlot and the priest, the prophet and the thief
Up from their knees
In all their open mouths I see the lantern tongues
Light up at once

What wish will ransom me
Unbury violently
All innocents, all innocents?
Lanterns illumine me
Burning the memory
Rise innocent, rise innocent

What rage will usher me
Swallow the enemy
Buy innocence, buy innocence?
Lanterns illumine me
Incense from memory
Rise innocent, rise innocent
