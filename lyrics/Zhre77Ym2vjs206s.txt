I've come to my senses that I've become senseless
I could give you lessons, how to ruin your friendships
And every last conviction, yeah I smoked them all away
I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way

And so I sit and wait and wonder
Does anyone else feel like me?
Someone so tired of their routines
And disappearing self-esteems

I'll sing along, yeah with every emergency
Just sing along and I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone that deep down inside I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy

I could be an expert on co-dependency
And I could write the best book on underage tragedy
And I've been spending my time at the local liquor store
And I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor

And so I sit and wait and wonder
Does anyone else feel like me?
I'm so over dosed on apathy
And burnt out on sympathy

I'll sing along, yeah with every emergency
Just sing along and I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone that deep down inside I think it's fine by me
That I'm my own worst enemy

Let the meaning slip away
I lost my faith in another day
Self deprication seems okay
I never thought I'd make it anyway

I'll sing along, yeah with every emergency
Just sing along and I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone that deep down inside I think it's fine by me
Cause I'm my own worst enemy
That I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
