You only drink when you're lonely
Was it something that I said?
And oh, you think that you know me
You can see inside my head

Oh, I want you, you want me too
And I know that I could find the words to say to make it better
We both know what we can lose
'Cause I know sometimes we do some crazy things to stay together

I'm freaking out, you don't know me now
I don't know what to do, what to do with you
We can see what you do to me
I don't know what to do, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah
Oh, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah

Who said that you could control me?
Feels so good but it hurts so bad
You thought that this would be easy
But you're always stuck in the past

I want you, you want me too
And I know that I could find the words to say to make it better
We both know what we can lose
'Cause I know sometimes we do some crazy things to stay together

I'm freaking out, you don't know me now
I don't know what to do, what to do with you
We can see what you do to me
I don't know what to do, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah
Oh, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah

I love wet things all alone, and you saw me
I should never got alone, and I'm sorry

I want you, you want me too
'Cause I know that I, 'cause I know that I could make it better
We both know what we can lose
'Cause I know sometimes we do some crazy things to stay together

I'm freaking out, you don't know me now
I don't know what to do, what to do with you
We can see what you do to me
I don't know what to do, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah
Oh, what to do with you, yeah
What to do with you, yeah
