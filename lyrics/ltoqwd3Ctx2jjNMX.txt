Oh, oh I
I've been missing all the pieces of my life
Been too busy running
To stop and let the sun in
Oh, oh I

Oh, I try
To keep up with the time as it flies by
But I'm too busy thinking
To stop the ship from sinking
But oh, I try

So maybe I'll just sing at the top of my lungs
It's not the things you wasted, but it's what you've done
You don't know ride until you've been rode
So keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin'
Keep your head up, look to the sky
Rollin'
Don't you've ever ask yourself why
Rollin'
We'll live forever, you and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Oh, oh my
My heart, it keeps on searching for a sign
It's far too busy healing
To hold onto a feeling
Oh, oh my

So maybe I'll just sing at the top of my lungs
It's not the things you wasted, but it's what you've done
You don't know ride until you've been rode
So keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin'
Keep your head up, look to the sky
Rollin'
Don't you ever ask yourself why
Rollin'
We'll live forever, you and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin'
Keep your head up, look to the sky
Rollin'
Don't you've ever ask yourself why
Rollin'
We'll live forever, you and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin'
Keep your head up, look to the sky
Rollin'
Don't you've ever ask yourself why
Rollin'
We'll live forever, you and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Rollin', la la, la la la, rollin'
You and I
Keep on ro-o-o-o-o-ollin'

To love the people you got by your side
Even if they hurt you, loving won't desert you
Take your time
