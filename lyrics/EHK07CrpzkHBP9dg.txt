Submissive tone, you can play like you're willing to fall apart
But could you let this go?
You keep your bones outstretched till the minute I turn around
How do I reach that soul?

You called to say
Can you live with my mistakes?

'Cause you are the one they spoke about
I never believed I'd make it out
You weren't around for quite a while
Were you saving all the killer whales?
'Cause you are the one they spoke about
I never believed I'd make it out
You weren't around for quite a while
You were saving all the killer whales

Save save save!

I am afraid I was made to be able to fall apart
And disconnect like so
I keep my chest locked tight till the minute you come around
How did you reach my soul?

I called to say
Can you live with my mistakes?

Alone in that motor suite tonight
I wonder who paints those faces on pesos
Intricate scenes beyond your mind
She was a concept
I was in love then
Alone in that motor suite tonight
I'm trying to paint your face in my brain so
I can get sleep and calm my mind
She was a concept
I was in love then
