I've got somethin' here, it's a chance
I'm'a make my changes as I go and the city lights
Dance away the stars
I have met all kinds of reasons why the seasons leave their scars
I am thin as cinnamon and tarnish like these metal cars
That drive along the rivers of the tar
I am weatherproof as the rain
And I've fooled every lover into drinkin' up my pain
I am hangin by the edges of my name, but I am warm
So comfortable forgetting bout the storm
I love Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado too
Atlanta and Montana Nebraska and the Moon
And You
Must've been a traveler inside of the womb
Never had a place with a living room
You said a house is a tomb
Well zoom zoom zoom zoom
Here we go, Annie
No more planning
Isn't this dandy
I've got you and you've go me
I'm going back to the lake
This time of year it's frozen through
Aint nothing gonna break
Well I'll take you there and show you where
I used to spend my time
Before workin', before leavin, before wine
I love Minnesota, Michigan, Colorado too
Atlanta and Montana Nebraska and the Moon
And You
Life is easy come and it's easy go too
Hours were the birds and I guess they flew
I just can't get a grip on this place, Billy Lou
Well zoom zoom zoom zoom
Here we go, Annie
No more planning
Isn't this dandy
I've got you and you've go me
