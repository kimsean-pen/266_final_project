Stone cold living in the soul forgiven
When you go, how so
In this better lemon world
All swimming in a hole, home goal

It's alright, we survive
Let's turn the same page
We'll have our say
Maybe we'll fail but don't push trying aside
Find another way

We'll awaken to this reclamation
Of the old, unsold
In our intermittent faze
I didn't want to know, stone cold

It's alright, we survive
Let's turn the same page
We'll have our say
Maybe we'll fail but don't push trying aside
Find another way

Pain
Put the lass to the end
Then
Start again
