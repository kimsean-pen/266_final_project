Mmmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em
Mmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon!

Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low (c'mon)

I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible, professional
Drinkin' X and oh
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think, I whoa!!!

Did her thing, I seen shawty get low

Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bang bro'

I'mma say that I prefer the no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it go

She had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans filled with guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make your moan
1 stack (come on) 2 stacks (come on) 3 stacks (come on)
Now that's 3 grand

What you think I'm playin', baby-girl, I'm the man
I'm dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That Heny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry, but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)

She hit the floor (she hit the floor)

Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin', and make me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them Rosay bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my glock

Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
(C'mon)
