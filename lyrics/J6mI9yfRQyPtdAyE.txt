Just that kiss
Was all there is
Every cell in my body
Lined up to you

Legs a little open
Once again
Awaken my senses
Head topless
Arisen my senses

Just that kiss
Was all there is
My palms pulsating of
The things I want to do to you
Just that kiss
Is all there is

Weaving a mixtape
With every crossfade
On www
To him a he
Weaving a mix tape
With every song

Awaken my senses
Just that kiss
Was all there is
Just that kiss
Was all there is
Just that kiss
Arisen my senses
Was all there is

For him a he
Once again I'm made to merge
To him a he

Am I keen or not keen
To be seen or not seen
With him a he
Am I keen or not keen
To be seen or not seen
With him a he

But he sees me for what who I am
