It's wonderful what a smile can hide
If the teeth shine bright and it's nice and wide
It's so magical all you can keep inside
And if you bury it deep no one can find a thing, no

So come on now, open wide, open up now
Don't you think it's time

To look back at that boy on his way to school
Such a heavy heart, such a heavy jewel hiding
Something that one day he'll sell
But now if no one shows, no one tells a thing, no

So come on love, open wide, open up now
Don't you think it's time

Now after all these years you are at last opening was it
Worth all that war just to win
So caught up in the speed of the days in your sin
Don't forget how the story begins no
Don't forget now

Now I'm seeing all your lovers and enemies
They've been turning their keys so full of need
All trying to see that sure you keep
What makes it shine, what makes it mine
But I don't care, no

Just come on now, open wide, open up now
There's so much love for what you'll find
But what will you find

Now after all these years you are at last opening
Was it worth all that war just to win

If it was can you take me back to where it begins
Come and take me back to where it begins
Come and take me back to where it begins
Come on, open wide and let some light in

Let us in
Let us in
