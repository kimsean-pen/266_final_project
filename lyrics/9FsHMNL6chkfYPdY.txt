The single arrangement's for the lonely heiress
She's got a fruit fly buzzing round her head
And the boys are with the pack, they're looking for some liquor
Coming up with ways to make daddy go quicker

Showing off his diamonds to a downtown girl
Her eyes are like doors and they shine like pearls
He gets a kiss as credit and a crank of the engine
Ready now to give his dad and all of the attention

I want to see some other places
I want to sing my resignation from the races
I want to feel it - winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to ring up to the show
Just to say hello

The heiress got a column in the paper 'bout the poor
She was standing by a picture of a kid laid on the floor
She thought about her future, didn't want it anymore
So she threw it in the river, prayed it never came ashore

She drew up in a limo, and she'd even lost her team (?)
And throw herself into the ring with people from the scene
No sooner people knew her as your one from Terenure
Who wears designer mittens while she's helping out the poor

I want to see some other places
I want to sing my resignation from the races
I want to feel it - winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to ring up to the radio show
I want to ring up to the show
And say hello
And just say hello
