Kickin' as I'm tryin' to sleep
I got the mud beneath my shoes
Rubber band, rubber band
Gun in hand, gun in hand
I wanna use

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much
I don't care, yeah but I don't care
Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much

Trippin' as I'm thinkin'
'Bout a boy, his name was Sue
He's a man, he's man
Crackerman, crackerman
He's a woman too

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much
I don't care, yeah but I don't care
Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much

And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'
And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'

Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much
I don't care, yeah but I don't care
Roamin', roamin', roam
Get away, gotta get away
And I think, I think too much
And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'
And I'm thinkin'
While I'm thinkin'
