Well, I got a friend, who's a man
(Who's a man)
What man?
The man
Who keeps me from the lonely
The only

He gives me
What I need
(What you need?)
What you got?
I need it
All so badly

(Oh)
Oh anything I want, he gives it to me
Anything I want
He gives it but not for free, it's hateful
And it's painful 'n' I'm so grateful
To be nowhere

This year
I've lost some friends
(Some friends)
What friends?
I dunno
I ain't even noticed

You see
I gotta get out again
(Again)
My friend
I gotta
See that main man

Yea
(Oh)
Oh anythin' I want, he gives it to me
Anythin' I want
He gives it but not for free, it's hateful
And it's painful 'n' I'm so grateful
To be nowhere
(Nowhere)
Oh, oh

(Oh)
Oh anythin' I want, he gives it to me
Anythin' I want
He gives it but not for free, it's hateful
Yea and it's painful 'n' I'm so grateful
To be nowhere

I killed
All my nerves
(My nerves)
What swerves?
And I can't drive so steady
And oh really

I've lost
My memory
(My mind)
Behind
I can't
See so clearly

(Oh)
Oh anythin' I want, he gives it to me
Anythin' I want
He gives it but not for free
Anythin' I want, he gives it to me
(Anythin' I want)
Anythin' I want, he gives it, but not for free
(Anythin' I want, me, anythin' I want)
Anythin' I want
(Me)
Anythin' I want
