I want to pick you up from the darkest times
like the sun that shines on those it choose
Don't you mind if these days has gone on too long?
End it now before you break all your dead
words

(End it now before you break all your dead words
I won't lament or cry...)

Take me from the ground
(From the ground)
I feel your skin around
(Skin around)

want to pick you up from the darkest times
like the sun that shines on those it choose

want to pick you up from the darkest times
Even Just a smile
on those it choose

When i feel down and out
And there is no place left to hide

(i know i can count on you to bring all my sorrows to light)
And your kindness is peaceful then everything
(Never mind i want it)

I want to pick you up from the darkest times
like the sun that shines on those it choose
I want to pick you up from the darkest times
Even just one little smile can set me free

Never mind never mind just take me away from here
Ceause maybe your nothing
Or maybe your wasting your time
Ouuuu...
