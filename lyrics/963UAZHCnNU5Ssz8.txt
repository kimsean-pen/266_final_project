Chestnut park on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hand
As the ladies of Cambridge know who I am

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it

Graveyard freaks we're fallin' in style
Lady's the pharaoh, Charles is the Nile
That's a museum, that's a cool place
Stones of your fathers standin' today

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night

Cos when you left my room
To go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid steak runs through
The whole of my family
But for you I could put it to rest

But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it
