What's wrong?
What are you afraid of?
The love below

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
But she lives in my lap

She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Don't need no chain
She lives in my lap
I'll get the courage one day

Make me want you make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are
Then forget you
Girl remind me, just who we are
We're oh, so close but yet so far

Baby why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them
I care about you
Baby I love you

You've got me open wide
I love you, just come inside
Baby
It's yours
It's yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
For sure
For sure
Play baby play

She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
She lives in my lap
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Don't need no chain
She lives in my lap
I'll get the courage one day

The love below
But she lives in my lap
You've got me open wide
She lives in my lap
My, I'm yours
Play baby play
She lives in my lap
Don't need no chain
Baby I love you
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Play baby play
