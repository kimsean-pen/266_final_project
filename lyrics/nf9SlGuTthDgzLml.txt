Hey, Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds
See me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena

Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends, and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more

Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't going to need those I'ma go hard

So far, I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on my shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet

So I can go anywhere (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush because boy I know there's plenty there
About to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
They can't understand my concept

I been climbing up the Great Wall

Haven't had a fall yet
These blogs got to know I'm on next

Clean conscience, Good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them

If you didn't know, well I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb
Then I make music
I don't even talk about it boy I just do it

Everybody got their own opinion
The reasons why they feeling them
You must admit he's killing them
Running off adrenaline

Waiting for the game to want to let him in so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come

I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot

But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you bugging?
