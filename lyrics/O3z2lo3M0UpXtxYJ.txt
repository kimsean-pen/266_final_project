Mislead flock of the faithful
With minds of peace and eyes of blind
Praying to altars, crosses and priests
Satan my master, unleash the beast!
Kill Christ!
Crush the Holy!
Nail him down!
We are Satan's Terror Brigade

Baptized in fire and blood
Sons of damnation arise
Avengers of infernal breed
Hunting the divine fuking trace
Crush the holy
Asphyxiate voices of delusion
Slay the benevolent
Behold the true heirs of creation
Hate, my weapon to kill
Wrath, my force, diabolical will
Evil, my courage, my spell
bich revenge, you will die in hell
Enter the infernal

War command, destroying force
We take our power from the hellish source
burn the churches, trample the grave
Satanic terror, you fuking slaves!
Kill Christ!
Crush the Holy!
Nail him down!
We are Satan's Terror Brigade
Christian capture put to an end
Satan will rise and crush the land
We by his side full of honour and pride
I am your servant in this satanic rite

Crush the holy
Asphyxiate voices of delusion
Slay the benevolent
Behold the true heirs of creation
