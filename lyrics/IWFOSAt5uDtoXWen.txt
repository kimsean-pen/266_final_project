Sha-la-la-la

He might got the biggest ca-ar-r
Don't mean he can drive me wild
Or he can go for miles
Said he got a lot of ca-a-ash
Darlin' he can't buy my love
It's you I'm dreaming of

They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other numbers
When I got my number one

Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause' I realized the truth
They can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue
Can't love me like you

Ah
Used to get it when I wa-a-ant
You were pouring out your love
I could never get enough
Now I'm dealing with these bo-o-ys
When I really need a man
Who can do it like I can

They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other lovers
When I got my number one

Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause' I realized the truth
They can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue
Can't love me like you

Sha-la-la-la
Woo-ooo
Sha-la-la-la
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sha-la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Can't love me like you

Sha-la-la-la
Woo-ooo
Sha-la-la-la
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sha-la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Can't love me like you

L-O-V-E
Love the way you give it to me
When you're with me
Boy I want it everyday
L-O-V-E
Love the way you give it to me
When you're with me
Boy I want it everyday

Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause' I realized the truth
They can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new (new)
Baby they ain't got a clue
Can't love me like you
Last night I lay in bed so blue
(Love the way you give it to me)
Cause' I realized the truth
(Boy I want it everyday)
They can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new (L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me)
Baby they ain't got a clue
Can't love me like you
