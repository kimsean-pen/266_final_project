Fake it to make it,
Nothing sacred, it's basic
Roll up 6 grams and face it,
And I'm sending out raven
You look funny stop playing,
You're a dummy, just pay me
We got Es if you're raving,
And we get em for nothing
Got a ghost in my basement,
He come out when it's raining
Fuck your team you're all leeching,
Wanna feature, you're reaching
100 thousand we speaking,
Nails in coffins for treason
He got played he's a sucker,
You should look out for each other

Gonna make you fall in love,
Spikes on my shoes, stepped in blood
I told my dudes don't give up,
But we all know that we're all fucked
I'm on gluee shit don't get stuck,
But I deal drugs like I'm the plug
You're not in my crew I switched up,
What can I do, yeah it suxx
650 for my coat yeah don't touch,
They don't say shit, they watch us
Cut you off prick, you're stuck up,
Pay me for a pic, yeah what's up

Drain Gang boys in the gutter,
Get a life motherfucker
I bounce back like I'm flubber,
To break bread with my brother
I'm with Cady my cutter, keep a knife in the duster
We got downers for lover,
It can help if you suffer

Gonna make you fall in love,
Spikes on my shoes, stepped in blood
I told my dudes don't give up,
But we all know that we're all fucked
I'm on gluee shit don't get stuck,
But I deal drugs like I'm the plug
You're not in my crew I switched up,
What can I do, yeah it suxx
650 for my coat yeah don't touch,
They don't say shit, they watch us
Cut you off prick, you're stuck up,
Pay me for a pic, yeah what's up
