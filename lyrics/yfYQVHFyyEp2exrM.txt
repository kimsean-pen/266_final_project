Black cats
always seem to find my path
is it just the neighborhood
or are they around for good.

Ghost Dreams
wandering into my sleep
do they want to live or die
are we in the afterlife.

Cold air
coming from a place out there.
is it just the atmosphere
are we not alone in here.

And my heart beats faster at night
I can't open my eyes
Ghost Dream
Following me
Ghost Dream

Tonight
let's sleep in a field of white
nothing but the sand and sea
nothing waiting up for me.

We'll try
to trap the moon against the sky
we won't let the dark in here
we won't let the dark come near.

And my heart beats faster at night
I can't open my eyes
Ghost Dream
following me
Ghost Dream
