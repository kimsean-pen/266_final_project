Everything is tragic
It all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes
It pieces up my heart

If I only had an answer
To put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back
Every word I've said

I walk back in the night alone
Got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping
None of the lights were on

I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself it all began to hurt

So I turned on a picture show
I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in
The tears blew up my eyes

I see an elevator
A moment I am above
I look for you or someone
Who can still remind me of

The tight grip and the sun lick
And the calm way of all things summer
When it's all here and it's all new
And you're not hungover

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are

My feet are always heavy
As I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves
A hundred times before

But I guess we're always leaving
Even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know
That even this will change

If you've still got some light in you
Then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness
It's the only way it's done

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run
