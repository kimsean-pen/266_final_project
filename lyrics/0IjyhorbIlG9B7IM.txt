I don't wanna grow up, no
I don't wanna grow up
I'm still naive
Young, wild and free
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh, ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't wanna hear it, no
I don't wanna feel it
Don't lecture me
Just let me be
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh, ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

If love is a lie
It's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie
Then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you

I don't wanna live it, no
I don't wanna live it
Reality, just not for me
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh, ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like cheap tequila
Makes you sick but it tastes so good
Feels good on your lips, take a sip
Just one more hit
I love it when you do it, when you do it like this
When you do it, when you do it like this

If love is a lie
It's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie
Then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you

If love is a lie
It's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie
Then please don't ever tell me the truth
Cause nothing, nothing makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
