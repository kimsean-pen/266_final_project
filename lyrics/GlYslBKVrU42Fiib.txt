When I grow up, I wanna be a superorganism
Come on give it to me - put your mind in my brain so you'll see
Everything is better when you're everything

Don't let the kids such you up, in flux
Await for the seed to erupt and be gone

Everybody wants to be a superorganism

When I grow up, I need to be a superorganism
Come on give it to me -- are you aware? are you alone with
The taste of architectures falling from my acid haste

It wasn't right for you to refuse
It's okay now you're part of the only thing alive

Everybody wants to be a superorganism
