First thing that I did was buy a pack of smokes
Check into a motel and consult my horoscope
Sitting on the bed with the briefcase in my hands
Patiently awaiting any word from high command

Telekinetic dynamite! Psychic warfare is real! You better believe me, brother, x-ray vision!
Telekinetic prophetic dynamite! Psychic warfare is real! I know what you're thinking sister, x-ray vision!

Next thing that I did was tap out Morse code
With a wooden nickel on the receiver of the phone
Before I could complete it,
I was quickly overtaken By the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan
And on the drums, Gemini On bass guitar, presenting Pisces On lead guitar, we have Aries And on the microphone, Scorpio!

Last thing I remember I was crawling from the ruins
I don't know who's to blame for that, but I know who didn't do it
With every day that passes it keeps on getting stranger
But that really doesn't bother me cause I get off on the danger.
