Hang onto the world as it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving fast
Hold on tight and you will last

Keep your self-respect, you're man, the pride
Get yourself in gear, keep your stride
Never mind your fears
Brighter days will soon be here

Take it from me someday, we'll all be free, yeah

Keep on walking tall, hold your head up high
And lay your dreams right up to the sky
Sing your greatest song
And you'll keep, going, going on

Take it from me someday, we'll all be free, yeah
Hey, just wait and see someday we'll all be free, yeah
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
It won't be long, take it from me someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, take it from me, take it from me
