You know I'm stubborn most the time,
Always caught up in my mind.
You're throwin stones into an ocean
At its highest tide.
And I'm counting all the ways
To turn my back and walk away.
Tellin me to play it safe,
But your routine ain't for me.

We shoot first, ask questions last
Cause the days go by so fast.
Only focused on the outcome
And not stressin on our path.

And I know you don't understand
Why I chase what I can't have.
Yea, you say you know best,
We swear we know better.

Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.
Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.

You're not focused on my climb,
Only promising my fall.
But you should know you're throwing
Punches at a brick wall.

I'm counting all the ways
To turn my back
And walk away.
Telling me to play it safe,
But you're routine aint for me.

'Cause there is a gun
At the back of my head,
And I can't make a decision.
I don't wanna waste
Anymore of their time

We shoot first, ask questions last,
Cause the days go by so fast.
Only focused on the outcome
And not stressin on our path.

And I know you don't understand
Why I chase what I can't have.
Yea, you say you know best,
We swear we know better.

Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.
Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.

So confused as you stand there,
Tired bones and your grey hair.
Don't you ever compare me
To the mistakes you made before me.

Forcing pieces together,
In the end you'll see,
Puzzled look on the faces
Of those who doubted me.

We shoot first, ask questions last,
'Cause the days go by so fast.
Only focused on the outcome
And not stressin' on our path.

And I know you don't understand
Why I chase what I can't have.
Yea, you say you know best,
We swear we know better.

Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.
Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.

Out of sight out of mind,
I'm the simple type.
Out of sight, out of mind.
