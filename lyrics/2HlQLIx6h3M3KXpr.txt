I've never known how it feels to break
Stuck in the waiting room thinking for goodness sake
Don't wanna be the one to comfort no more
I wanna be the one on the floor

Do you think I can make it?
I know I'm six feet away but
I could get overlooked

'Cause I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised
Yeah, I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised

I love the sympathy from all of my friends
I wanna feel the hurt so I don't have to pretend
I wanna hear them asking if I'm okay (Are you okay?)
That's all I really want them to say

Do you think I can make it?
It ain't too far away but
Kinda thought I could go back.

'Cause I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised
Yeah, I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised

This space is nutritious
Tasty and delicious
Exceptionally vicious
Everybody feels

'Cause I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised
Yeah, I feel like I'm broken but I never got a reason
So I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna push myself until I get hospitalised
