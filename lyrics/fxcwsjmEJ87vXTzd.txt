The contact is in the context
the devil is in the detail
i found this
i found this deformity in conformity
i found this
i found this
A nausea that hunts me
i found this
i found this
a nausea that rewards me Time for the onslaught of tomorrow
after all their yesterdays
Taking pleasure in corrosion
the half-crazed have had their say
there is more but i don't want to type it out at the moment
