Don't stand too close to me
If you're left alone with me, uh oh
And leave that door open
Get someone to keep us company

'Cause I've been making up a list of things I'd do to you
As we both dance on either side of the room
But it's too late I'd never say it, anyway I'm taken
And we're both leaving with whom we came

Somewhere you're sleeping it off, but I'm wide awake
Chasing a runaway thought
So come on, say it

You can feel it too, don't hide you liar
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breath, don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive

I know you can feel it too, I saw you liar
Setting off dynamite
One look, one touch, we won't survive it
It's gonna burn us alive

Did I come to close to this
I rubbed myself against it, oh no
I can't touch it but I feel it
Can't use it but I need it, oh

Oh no, you don't fool me but I can keep a secret
I can read it like you wrote it all down
I'm not looking for your love, but we would do it well
And that's the bit I can't stop thinking about

Somewhere you're sleeping it off, but I'm wide awake
Chasing a runaway thought
Just try proving me wrong, but I'll find a way
To make you confess to it all

I know you can feel it too, don't hide you liar
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breath, don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive

I know you can feel it too, I saw you liar
Setting off dynamite
One look, one touch, we won't survive it
It's gonna burn us alive

I want to wrestle with a savage creature
That kind of wild thing could jump up and eat you
Some covet 'cause it's human nature
But I'm coming to the call of danger
Some love has got a built-in heater
Some heat has got to catch on fire
Put it out while you still can
You know you play with fire
You're gonna get burned

I know you can feel it too, don't hide you liar
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breath, don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive

I know you can feel it too, don't hide you liar
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breath, don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive

I know you can feel it too, I saw you liar
Setting off dynamite
One look, one touch, we won't survive it
It's gonna burn us alive
