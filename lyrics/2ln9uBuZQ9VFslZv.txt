Take a break from the wooing mountains, I wanna show you off
Laying low at home, whatever, I wanna show you off
To the boys who think they're clever, I wanna show you off
So that they see who's finally saying yes to you

You can trust this, you can have this
Not playing a game
I wanna let this go public and not be ashamed
Whoo, they don't make them like you anymore (No, no)

Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real and if you want it babe
Show it off
Let us see how you get on
Roll the window down to flaunt it babe
Show it off
Show it off

See, I can be a discrete lover but I wanna show you off
Can't get this undercover (Like the showing better)
If you wanna bring your boys around
Then you can show me off too

You can trust this, you can have this
Not playing a game
I wanna preach this, unleash this and not be ashamed
Whoo, they don't make them like you anymore
So take a second, take a minute

Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real, and if you want it babe
Show it off
Let us see how you get on
Roll the window down to flaunt it babe
Show it off
Show it off

I-I-I'm past the point of asking why
Why I-I-I, why I let the whole world know you're mine

Cause if you got it like we got it
If it's real!
Let us see how you get on
Roll the window down to flaunt it babe
Show it off
Show it off
Cause if you got it like we got it
If you got it like we do
Hey, if it's real (be real)
Gotta see if you're down, down, down

So be real
Let us see how you get down
