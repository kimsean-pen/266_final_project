Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, ohh yay

I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go
(Go without ya, go without ya)
I don't wanna
(Be alone)

When we hooked up, we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
So love will never ever leave us
That was a while ago, oh
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like, all we do is fight
Every single night, we can't make it tight
We can't get it right
I just wanna go back
Take it way back, all the way back
Can we start again, do it over
Can we straighten' it out
Can we work it out

'Cause I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go
(Go without ya, go without ya)
Said sugar I don't wanna
(Be alone)

I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go
(Go without ya, go without ya)
Sugar, I don't wanna
(Be alone)

Do you realize I can't sleep without ya
Think without ya, eat without ya
Speak without ya, be without ya
I can't even breathe without ya
I can't (deal without ya), deal without ya
(Spend without ya)
My whole world is upside down
Don't wanna go out 'cause I can't ride without ya
Feel like I'm gon' die without ya
What is a girl supposed to do
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you
(I don't wanna be)

I can't be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
Said I can't live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I can't go
(Go without ya, go without ya)
Said I don't wanna
(Be alone)

Said I can't be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
Said I can't live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go ohh
(Go without ya, go without ya)
Said I don't wanna be alone
(Be alone)

How can this be
(That it's not working out)
That it's not working out
We vowed to be always together (yeah)
It's hurting me (hurting me)
That we don't talk no more
It wasn't supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes
We gotta carry on

I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go
(Go without ya, go without ya)
I don't wanna (be never alone)
(Be alone)

I don't wanna be (do you hear me)
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go (go)
(Go without ya, go without ya)
I don't wanna
(Be alone)

I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go ooh
(Go without ya, go without ya)
I don't wanna
(Be alone) (yay baby)

I don't wanna be
(Be without ya, be without ya)
I don't wanna live (do you hear me)
(Live without ya, live without ya)
I don't wanna go (baby, are you listening)
(Go without ya, go without ya)
I don't wanna (what you do to me)
(Be alone)
What you do to me, hmm, hmm, hmm
Don't wanna be (no), no (no ohh yeah)
You're long gone, baby come home
