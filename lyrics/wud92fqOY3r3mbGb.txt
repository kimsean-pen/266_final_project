Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
Now the sun don't shine
And the rain don't pour
And I'm still thinking about you

Roll out of bed and straight up to the cloud
Inside my buzy it real the stay
I found the angel and she lives she now
But I can't get it out my case

Then she got the way
Somehow, somehow, somehow
So I'll go and fake
My smile, my smile...

Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
And now the sun don't shine
And the rain don't pour
And I'm still thinking about you
Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you

Still I know, still I know
We get this low, I'll never know

I could get this low
I could get this low
I could get this low for you

Sometimes I wonder why I'm in this place
And maybe I will never know
But if I ever laugh for my mistakes
The future ain't predictable

She ain't got me back
Or I'll, or I'll, or I'll
So I'll go and fake
My smile, my smile...

Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
And now the sun don't shine
And the rain don't pour
And I'm still thinking about you
Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you

Still I know, still I know
We get this low, I'll never know

I could get this low
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
I could get this low
I could get this low
I could get this low for you

Or I'll, or I'll, or I'll
My smile, my smile...

Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
And now the sun don't shine
And the rain don't pour
And I'm still thinking about you
Never did I know
I could get this low
I could get this low for you

Still I know, still I know
We get this low, I'll never know

I could get this low
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
I could get this low
I could get this low
I could get this low for you
