Take me to the place that we met, babe... mmm
We could even go back some more
Not a single thing to regret, babe... mmm
That you are them all... yeah

It's not what you waited for
Or hated for
Awaited through the night
But I still love you, baby

Now, I don't even want to remember... mmm
But I better do unless you forget
As the fire returns to an ember... mmm
That you won't get... yeah

It's not what you waited for
Or hated for
Awaited through the night
All that you meant to me
Was misery
I wasted half of my life
Take all your trophies down
Take off your crown
I still love you, baby
