People knowing that we lit, nigga
They knowing that we lit

Money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich

Lil nigga, I got my weight up
Flexing on the competition who tried to play us
Now we on, you niggas just gotta pay up
And I ain't done, I'm balling like I layup
Switch flows
Switch cars, I switch hoes
My shit goes
I'm whippin' the pot like Crisco
These diamonds on me dancin' like we at the disco
No red light
You hear the shots, come and get low, 'cause

Money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich

Rich, rich as a bitch
Money coming in, my pocket Lilo and Stitch
Flooded the Patek, you see it shine on my wrist
You'd think I was a mess, I'm living my life like this
Put her in Chanel, she taking flights on a trip
I turn up at my show, get the bag and then I dip
You never really know when somebody gonna switch
It's loyalty and trust, I ain't be caught in the mix, 'cause

We got money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they gon' love you when you rich
Money coming in, people knowing that we lit
Do it for the fam, we gon' die for this shit
It's some real ties when we pull up with the clique
It ain't no surprise, they all love you when you rich
