Ok, what have we got here
Horny black boy with frisky white girl
Eye each other across the room and
The chemistry is unbearable and
Definitely not on anyones agenda
He suggests they go to someplace they won't be seen
And she thinks otherwise
Finally they agree to go
And put up with Dunkin donuts
The usual story, they fall in love
Under the hail of spit they ignore
All the while secretly conspiring to murder each other
Hoping that will eleviate the slightly more
Uncomfortable feelings that may arise
in a situation like this
But behind closed doors
The eyes of the world
becoming their wallpaper
They melt into a beautiful example
of a power that definitely exists
And come together on a warm moonlit night
In spite of themselves
Ummmm, likely story
