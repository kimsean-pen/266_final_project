As you walk
The path of least resistance
Is it as simple
As you claim it to be?

C'mon!

Your tongue, your eyes,
Your lies, they do deceive you
Your tongue, your eyes
Your lies, they do deceive you

I stand firm in my solidarity
The path I walk (the path I walk)
I walk it with my own resolve

When darkness falls (when darkness falls)
We are reborn
Our dream since the fall of man
We are reborn

My beliefs
Are not antiquated
We are the hope
Silence them all
With not just words
Let resolution be our voice

I stand firm in my solidarity
The path I walk (the path I walk)
I walk it with my own resolve

When darkness falls (when darkness falls)
We are reborn
Our dream since the fall of man
We are reborn

We are the remnant
We the remnant
Will silence them all
We are the faithful
We the faithful
Will silence them all
Silence them all

When darkness falls (when darkness falls)
We are reborn
Our dream since the fall of man
We are reborn

When darkness falls (when darkness falls)
We are reborn
Our dream since the fall of man
We are reborn.
