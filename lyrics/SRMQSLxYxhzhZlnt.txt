Sun in the Morning
Dave Bixby

The sun in the morning
Comes over the hill
And kisses the tall grass beside me

We are so young
At heart
And living is an art
To be good at

We get our strength in the daytime
By the Sun's golden rays
That lasts us into the nighttime
We find ourselves in many ways

The sun in the morning
The new day is dawning
Look out your window
And see yourself walking
Through fields of love
And the sky up above
Is with you

We are so young
At heart
And living is an art
To be good at

Oh, God, we love you
How can we say
We love you?
We love you.
How can anybody say?
