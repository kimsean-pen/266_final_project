He spins the wheel forth
Wrapped in with flowers
Imagine some to Paris to acquire
His seventh title
His seventh title, for people to admire

Time, design, persistence
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line
Life, tries, decisions
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line

You left the room graced
Wrapped in with flowers
He takes the last chance
In the final hours
He spins the wheel forth
Spins the wheel slow
Champs-Elys√©es, to acquire
His seventh title
His seventh title, for people to admire

Time, design, persistence
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line
Life, tries, decisions
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line

Time, design, persistence
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line
Life, tries, decisions
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line

Time, design, persistence
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line
Life, tries, decisions
He crossed the line
This time, crossed the line
