Party sideways once again, malt liquor
Smiling sideways to my friends
But we're all getting sicker

Parties, love at 5 AM
But who's coming?
Dance around like skeletons
'Cause we forgot what we wanted

And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know it do
And we almost go insane
I know I know, I know it's true
And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know you do
And we always go insane
Tryina chase some pleasure brand new
Some pleasure brand new

The morning's tied back one again
I in the kitchen
Some mornings I wish I'd grow out of this
Just like a pain my decision
'Cause I never learn to tell you no
No I never learn
I never learn to tell you no
And I never learn to tell you no
Oh, I never learn to tell you no
And I never learn to tell you no
Oh, I never learn to tell you no, oho

And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know you do
And we always go insane
I know I know, I know it's true
And it always seems the same
I know I know, I know you do
And we always go insane
Tryina chase some pleasure brand new
Some pleasure brand new
Some pleasure brand new
