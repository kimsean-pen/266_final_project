You took the tunnel route home, you've never taken that way with me before
Did you feel the need for change?
Apologies on your fingernails, love flickered in the city of lights
Like intermittent radio waves

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

You went where the horses cry, you've never taken that way with me before.
Did you feel the need for change?
Guilt smeared across your lips, I was tired and cold from the window
You're tired, nothing's changed

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us
