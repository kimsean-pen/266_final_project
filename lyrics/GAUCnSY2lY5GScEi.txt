When you came in my world, I sweat
And you soft me, and you soft me
When you came in my world, I sweat
And you brought me, and you brought me
And every time I talk
And every time I walk
And every time I sleep
I wanna hear you.
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I wanna hear you
I can't sleep

When I go to sea, you're still there
Where you can't be, where you can't be
Silence is the sign fake I can choose
I won't melt it, I won't???
And every time I talk
And every time I walk
And every time I sleep
I wanna hear you.
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I wanna hear you
I can't sleep
And every time I talk
And every time I walk
And every time I sleep
I wanna hear you.
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my head
I wanna hear you
