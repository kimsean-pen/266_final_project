Well back in time enough justified
As I am free to seek the unknown
Crawled inside as I realized
And I fought with these
These visions in my head

Lost with time
A near scare
A feat that's rare
Rare dark hole
Where stone and terror sells
That bleeds death through the bone

Lost your time is up
Set aside and out
Free to seek the undead
Blood bodies me
Blinded walls
They trap and call
And visions in my head

Lost with time
As cold veins and blood stains
A dark hole
Where stone and terror sells
That bleeds death through the bone

Well back in time enough justified
As I'm free to seek the undead
Crawled inside as I realized
And I fought with these
These Visions in my head
