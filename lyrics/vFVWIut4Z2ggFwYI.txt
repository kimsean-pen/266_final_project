Torment
The stench
One side, inside
No doubt, lost count
Brutalize
Half red eyes
Decide, which side, whose side
You're in the middle of the fire
A scythe, a smock is sharp, so sharp

No conscience
Such confidence
A crooked ear
So insincere
A glue on smile
Your social style
Tyrant rules is such a fool

Superior good advice
It's so nice from you
Arguments so hideous
They're heaven sent
You can't repent
Words like ice
Cut the lies
Announce, announce my demise
Oh, christ, christ why'd you die?

No conscience
Such confidence
The crooked ear
So insincere
The glue on smile
The social style
Your tyrant rule is such a fool

No conscience
Such confidence
Your crooked ear
You're so insincere
The glue on smile
Your social style
Your tyrant, your rule, you're nobody's fool

Superior good advice
Blood red and arguments
Heaven sent torment my stench
Putrefy, putrefy
Wise, so wise, you're not so wise
Shadow, shadow, shadow, why?

No conscience
Such confidence
Your crooked ear
You're insincere
The glue on smile
The social style
The tyrant that rules is such a fool
