Lord, oh yeah

When you need a friend
Through thick and thin
Don't look to those above you
When you're down and out
There ain't no doubt
Nobody wants you
But you're rock candy baby
And you're hard, sweet and sticky... yeah
And you're rock candy baby
Hard, sweet and sticky... oh, yeah

Hard sweet an'
Ooh, yeah

When you're seventeen
Reachin' for your jeans
But don't let no one reach 'em for you
Throw off your pants
Stretch out take a dance
Now if it can be done, well you can do it
'Cause you're rock candy baby
You're hard sweet an' sticky, yeah you are
But you're rock candy, baby
So hard, sweet and sticky, yeah

Ohh

Hard, sweet and sticky... yeah
