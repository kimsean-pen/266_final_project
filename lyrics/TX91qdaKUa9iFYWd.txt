Out at sea
For a year
Floating free
From all fear

Every day
Blowin' spray
In a dolphin's smile

Wind-taut lines
Split the sky
Curlin' crest
Rollin' by
Floating free
Aimlessly
In a dolphin's smile

Rainbow's end
Everywhere
Full of life
Free as air
Childhood's dream
Have you ever seen
A dolphin's smile?
