We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Broken bottles, limp biscuits
I see no way of getting outta here
I can't hear you, fear that you's a secret spy
There's such a lovely way of getting outta here

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now

Took the pocket for the yes love
Got me licking on your '99
Oh that's too much falling on your evil tongue
I said I'd never pretend if I be as high as you

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Everybody pop now to the bassline
Give up or get down, until the sunlight
Never sleep, give my mind a break now
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
Give up or give in or get your flashlight
