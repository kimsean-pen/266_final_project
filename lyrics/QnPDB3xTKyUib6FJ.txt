Lucifer, show me the secrets enshrined
The hidden source of eternal wisdom that dwells within the abyss
Infernal majesty, guide me in my eternal search
Lead me to the ancient empire of dark treasures that once were lost

Lord of darkness, I speak thy name
Bestow me a vision from the deeps beyond the flames
Share me the power, enchant my darkened soul
Grant me the key to the mysteries

Wandering alone in the hall of damnation
Enlightened by the reflections of the moon
As voices of the night call my name
I enter the halls of blasphemy
Rites of ancient sorcery unknown
Since the darkest centuries of time
The hidden chambers reveals the past
Engraved in the archways in stone

Demon lord, the apocryphal king of the abyss
Reveal the unholy secrets, unveil the source of hellish creation
Inferal majesty, I summon the infernal forces
Let the ancient flame burn
Lord - bring us damnation

I'm an enchanter, a disciple of the art aflame
In the depths of my heart, the sigil of satan engraved
Satan, thou who possess the greather force
I'm thy faithful servant, the words of summoning I recite
