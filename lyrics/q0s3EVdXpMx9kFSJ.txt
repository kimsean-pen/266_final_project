I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
Kissin' around all over town, Ohhhhh!
You fly around like a bee, Ohhhhh!
Hurtin' everything you see, Oh!

I try everything I know, Oh!
To make you wanna love me so, Oh!
The only thing you do, Ohhhh!
Is try to put the hurt on me

Can't you see what you're doin' to me?
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath every step I take
I'm more in love with you

I can't go on like this, Ohhhhh!
A little bit of love and not one kiss, Oh!
I've gotta have your love every day
A one that's real and will stay, Ohhhhh!

I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine

I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine, Oh!
Come back baby to me, Ohhhhh!
End my misery, Ohhhh!
I give you love night and day, Ohhhh!
I never ever go away Oh!

I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine, Oh!

{spoken}
Come back baby, cause I'm all alone,
Come back darlin', cause I need your love
Come back, 'cause I wanna love ya
Girl, I want to love ya, tonight

I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh!
I can't seem to make you mine
