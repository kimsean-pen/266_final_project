One morning
As the leaves were falling
I found my life leaving
Couldn't help but calling
And he must have heard my cry
Turning to me with a tear in his eye

One autumn
Parting came relieving
She ran up behind me
Poorly hid her grieving
Come wailing wind chill my heart
Come the rain fall on me as I depart

Life left us
Yesterday's outshining
Our any tomorrow
With a silver lining
Remember a distant day
For even memories may fade away

Come lay down
By my side and sing me
An ode to the fallen
Make it come inside me
Do you ever think thereof
While the cold wind weeps the lay of our love

Come lay down
By my side and sing me
An ode to the fallen
Make it come inside me
Do you ever think thereof
While the cold wind weeps the lay of our love
