We wake up tired, we wake up tired again,
We wake up tired, my head is in your hands,
You hold me tighter, till pressure is too much,
But I say it's all right, cause everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, every night you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Every night, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We wake up tired, your thoughts are miles from here,
I make my mind up, about several times a year,
Really this time, really this time,
We want the same thing, but our paths are not the same,
Maybe this time, maybe this time,
Just hold me tighter, and I'll hold you tighter,
Say it's all right,
Cause everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, oh, oh
Everynight you've got to save my spot till I am perched from your hands,
Oh, oh
It's all undone,
And all of us will be there,
Just hold me tighter, I'll hold you tighter,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, oh oh, everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight you've got to save me,
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, (everynight you've got to save me)
Oh, every night you've got to save me,
(everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight you've got to save me,
(everynight you've got to save me)
Everynight, everynight (everynight you've got to save me)
