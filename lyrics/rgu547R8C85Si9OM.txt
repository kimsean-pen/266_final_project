Well, I know a thing about contrition
Because I got enough to spare
And I'll be grantin' your permission
'Cause you haven't got a prayer

Well, I said, hey, hallelujah
I'm gonna come on, sing the praise
And let the spirit come on, through you
We got innocence, for days

Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down

And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave

S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N

You play ring around the ambulance
Well, like you never gave a care
So get the choir boys around you
It's a compliment, I swear

And I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
I want to hear you sing the praise
I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
We got innocence for days

Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down

And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave

You better run like the devil
'Cause they're never gonna leave you alone
You better hide up in the alley
'Cause they're never gonna find you a home

And as the blood runs down the walls
You see me creepin' up these halls
I've been a bad motherfucker
Tell your sister I'm another
Go! Go! Go!

And say, say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave

Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man

So, get up!
So, get out!
I S-I-N, I S-I-N!
