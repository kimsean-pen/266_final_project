Fifteen years have passed.
Every day in the woods have cried
the words of vengeance and revenge.
The Gods have watched him day and night
by the Northern stars bright light.
Growing stronger. Coming nearer.

Upon a steed as white as snow
he is riding through this land of no return.
His hair blowing in the wind.
A sword in his hand. And his eyes they burn.

"Guide me, my Ravens. Find the way
through the woods and snow.

Let your eyes be mine seeking
for the valley of death.
Come this far I am willing
to face the twin-headed beast's breath.

Let your wings be my heart
in the air, black as the night.
I have steel at side. Powers of thunder.
The Gods with me ride.

I trust on my Ravens, watching from above.
Black as night. Swift as lightning
and graceful as the doves.

I trust on my Stallion. Born by the wind.
Taking me through the valley
where this world ends and the shadows begins.

I trust on my Sword. Forged in fire and ice.
Its sharp blade shall be baptised in blood
as I take the Beast's life.

Cry, old crow, cry...

Come out of darkness, you beast of Hel, face me.
Out on this field of moonlit snow.
I will not be deterred by your ugliness.
Before my sword your two heads will roll.

I will not let my sword rest until its steel
has sung for your ugly twin head.
I'll wipe the sweat off my face with your bloody scalps
and watch your four eyes telling me that your dead."

Gathering speed. Charging forward.
Collision is close now.
The swords are drawn, held high,
they flash in the pale blue moonlight.

Aiming at throats bare. The moment is so near.
The time seems to halt for a while.
Even the stars in the sky hold their breath.

This is the moment of glory or death...

The moment to maim or be put to rest...

"So close now I almost can hear the black blood
in the beast's thick veins pumping.
I am swinging my sword. May the Gods be with me.

I ride out through the vast portals of Hel.
I swing my sword in the air.
And the dead beast's two bloody scalps attached
to a spear.
