I wish we were older
I wish we were older
I wish we were older

Keep your body moving, girl
The beat is thumpin'
Go ahead and let them talk
Their words mean nothing

I know you're scared
But don't leave this place
Just turn around
And let me see your face
And now you're crying
And you hold me
And you whisper in my ear

Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older
Whoa-e, oh-we, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older
I wish we were older

Tonight we'll touch
And they won't know
I know you're dying
To take off your clothes

Just trust in me
I'll never run away
You kiss my lips
And you taste like pain
And while I'm pushing it, I'm moving
Somehow you manage to say...

Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older
Whoa-e, oh-we, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older

Just take my hand
I'll never let go
Just take my hand
I'll never let go
(I love you and I hate you)
Just take my hand
(Now we're dying and we're crying)
I'll never let go
(But I kiss you and I touch you)
Just take my hand
(And you hold me close)
I'll never...
(And scream at me and say)

Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older
Whoa-e, oh-we, oh-oh
Oh-we, oh-we, oh-oh
Whoa-e, whoa-e, oh-oh
I wish we were older

And don't cry now
And don't cry now
