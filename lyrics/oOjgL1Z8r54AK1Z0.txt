Step in front of a runaway train
just to feel alive again
Pushing foward through the night
aching chest and blurry sight

It's all far so far away

It's all far so far away
Cold wind blows into the skin

can't believe the state your in
It's all far so far away
It's all far so far away
Who are you trying to impress
steadily creating a mess
Step in front of a runaway train
just to feel alive again
Pushing foward through the night
aching chest and blurry sight
aching chest and blurry sight
aching chest and blurry sight
