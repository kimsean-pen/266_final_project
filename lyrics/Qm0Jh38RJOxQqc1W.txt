We want that bam bam pop

We want that bam bam pop
We want that bam bam pop
Overkill like we do it for a livin' and
We'll make history before we ever make a million
Moves, sucker, throw it down
Bring it back you know that sound
Icon coming, common sense
Nothing wrong with a little bit of confidence
You tell 'em all what we're about
We're selling out
We're selling out
Sings the beginning then it all goes down
I catch comas just for fun
When I'm done, we all go free
Make room for horrors in history
Icon coming, did you hear?
We lost our minds again this year
Mindless music make it loud
We're selling out
We're selling out
We know what to do
We know what to do
We know what to do
You ready?
Bam bam pop pop
I like this a lot, lot

Turn it up here we go

We wreck the radio
Boom boom, get your fist
Give it to you just like this
Make your heart stop
We want that bam bam pop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We want that bam bam pop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We want that bam bam pop
Everybody here still half a life?
Anybody else can't sleep at night?
I know I'm not the only one going crazy

Same white noise on me daily save me
Maybe I don't want to turn it up

Maybe I want to turn it off when I've had enough
Maybe all your tricks won't fix me
This sick beat just makes me sick
Ready?
Bam bam pop pop
I like this a lot, lot

Turn it up, here we go
We wreck the radio
Boom boom, get your fist

Give it to you just like this
Make your heart stop
We want that bam bam pop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We want that bam bam pop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We want that bam bam pop
. . .
I raise my fist just like this, just like this
I raise my fist just like this, just like this
I raise my fist just like this, just like this

I raise my fist just like this, just like this
Bam bam pop pop
I like this a lot, lot
Turn it up, here we go

We wreck the radio
Boom boom, get your fist
Give it to you just like this
Make your heart stop

We want that bam bam pop
Bam bam pop pop
I like this a lot, lot

Turn it up, here we go
We wreck the radio
Boom boom, get your fist
Give it to you just like this
Make your heart stop
We want that bam bam pop
Bam bam pop pop
I like this a lot, lot
Turn it up, here we go
We wreck the radio
Boom boom, get your fist
Give it to you just like this
Make your heart stop
We want that bam bam pop
