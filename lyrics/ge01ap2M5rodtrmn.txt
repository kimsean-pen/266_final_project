I catch your eyes
Try not to smile
I check your style
I feel your vibes
We have a drink
Then go outside
Talk for a while
And then we kiss
And then we kiss
And then we kiss

We play the game
We start to move
I feel my heart
You feel the beat
I take your hand
You turn around slow
We start to feel
It's time to go

Bright, morning will hit the sky
And it's no surprise, I wake up with you
Right, I shouldn't compromise
I don't have to think twice, what to do

You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized
So you know what to do
So you know what to do

So we slide into the night
Into the wild open flow
All starry-eyed, you see me glow
So will I hide or will I show
You watch me dance, I feel you move
You pull me near, nothing to fear
We drift inside, the dream was sight
Until we slide into the light

Bright, morning will hit the sky
And it's no surprise, I wake up with you
Right, I shouldn't compromise
I don't have to think twice, what to do

You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized
You got me hypnotized
So you know what to do
So you know what to do
