Some people smile with every tooth
Some teeth will lake with every smile
I've said some things that ain't the truth
I've screamed some words that might seem vile

Some people smile with all their teeth
Some teeth will lake with every smile
I've done some things you won't believe
I've stabbed and scratched this (?)
Some people smile with all their teeth
Some teeth will lake with every smile
I've done some things you won't believe
I've said some things that ain't the truth
I've screamed some words that might seem vile
I've done some things you won't believe
