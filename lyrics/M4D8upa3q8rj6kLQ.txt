Hey you, hey you
Devil's little sister
Listening to your
Twisted transistor

Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through
Can't get enough

A lonely life
Where no one understands you
But don't give up
Because the music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you
Forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you
Finally you get it
The world ain't fair
Eat you if you let it

And as your tears fall on
Your breasts, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

A lonely life
Where no one understands you
But don't give up
Because the music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you
Forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Hey you, hey you
This won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who, says who
Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize
Just let me be
Between you and me, don't fit

Music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you
Forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor
