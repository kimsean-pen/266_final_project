I lace the boots up
It's straight to the door
'Cause this is worth fighting for
I get my head right
The heart's gotta follow
Whisper a prayer like there ain't no tomorrow
Take a breath, and I exhale slow
I wasn't made for this kind of cold
This ain't the kinda place that you wanna know
These are the elements I'm telling you bro
This world is up in my grill
This world is shooting to kill
This world always gotta be stealing my heart
This world always tryin' to rip my family apart

I'll fight the elements
I'll fight the elements
I got spirit, I got faith
I might bend, but I won't break
I'll fight the elements

And I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down

This ain't our home
Nah, not even close
They camouflage like we fighting some ghosts
You start to doubt everything that you know
I feel the heat, and it's starting to show
They try to break us, break us
Make us wanna give in
Lay down our arms
Novocain us again
Lay down a fight
I could never relent
And I'mma take it all the way to the end

I'll fight the elements
I'll fight the elements
I got spirit, I got faith
I might bend, but I won't break
I'll fight the elements

And I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
I'mma go down swinging
If I go down
Let's go

Father God let me see it for what it is
This ain't neutral we're up against
These elements push me to the fence
And then I end up on top of it
If I'm not careful

To recognize what is pushing in
Open my eyes to these elements
Stand up and rise to these elements
I'm willing to fight, willing to fight
The elements
