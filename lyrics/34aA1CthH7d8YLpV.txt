I miss you in the mornings
Been up all night
Delicately whisper
I'll be alright
Maybe someone else'll bring a passion
Out of you that I never saw
I am torn and raw.

I miss you in the moments
When it all stops
Listen to the silence
That hurts my heart
Maybe someday we will meet again
And not turn back
Now our love turns to black.

So I write this letter
That I'll never send
Just so I remember
The beauty of the end
And I write this letter
To my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever,
The beauty of the end.
Falling never hurts but landing does.

I miss you when I'm laughing
You're very near
But then I open up my eyes
And you're not here.
Maybe one day you will understand
That I had to
I did it all for you.

So I write this letter
That I'll never send
Just so I remember
The beauty of the end
And I write this letter
To my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever,
The beauty of the end.
Falling never hurts but landing does.

And I'm just as scarred as you about
This freedom
But I need to run with the wind
And I know right now you think there
Is no reason
But you'll see
Nothing in life is easy.

So I write this letter
That I'll never send
Just so I remember
The beauty of the end
And I write this letter
To my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever,
The beauty of the end.
Falling never hurts but landing does.
