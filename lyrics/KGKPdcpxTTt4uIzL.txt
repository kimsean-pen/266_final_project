i like your smile
don't like complication
i like your style
don't like calculation
come towards me, dear
there's something u need 2 hear
[chorus]
I said if u want my love
u can try my love
u can't buy my love
just take my hand
if u want me, dear
then just beckon, dear
and i will appear
i said-u can leave the lights on
u can leave the lights on
I believe in love, dear
without limitation
believe in being clear
2 avoid aggravation
if u want me 2
i will exist just for u
[chorus]
I will mesmerize with milky thighs and languid eyes,
i'll prophesize your moans and sighs
just look at me sacredly, religiously, hungrily,
let your eyes say, "please," i will not leave
[chorus]
