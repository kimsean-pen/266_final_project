Whoo
Doing the best I can
Doing the best I can
I'm only a man
Darling

My life is m
Since you ran away
I'm feeling very very lonely
I'm just trip from day to day

I'm doing the best I can
Trying to get over
Doing the best I can

I'm brokenhearted
It's my fault
Treated you wrong
So many times
I just wanna talk

I'm just a man
Doing the best I can
Yeah
Now darling
Doing the best I can
Missing you very day
So many times
I know you gone away
I said
I know you gone away
I miss you each and every day
Every every every day
I guess
I get lonely
Night after night
Wonder if I'm doing
Was wrong
Or if I'm doing was right

But I'm only a man baby
Baby I'm only a man
I'm for real
And I'm doing the best that I can
(I'm for real)
