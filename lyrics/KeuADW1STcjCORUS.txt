Hammer and a nail, stacking them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
Jesse's getting ready, I'm gassing up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at 6, I hope she's gonna wear
The jeans with the tear that her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
Find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That Fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
I said, that's how we do it 'round here

Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
Been working and trying and flirting and dying
For an all night kind of kiss
Country on the boombox, candles on the toolbox
I'm doing everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

And the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That Fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
I said, that's how we do it 'round here
And the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That Fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
That's how we do it 'round here
I said, that's how we do it 'round here
