If you feel like running, baby, I do to
We settled for a future that we hardly knew, oh
I can see the pieces falling into their place
I can see the look on your face
Oh, oh, used to be so blind
But, baby, now it's clear
Still I have these dreams like useless souvenirs
I can give them all away, down to the last
I can keep on moving like that

Oh, oh, I can't go home and hide in my (?) anymore
But when I look outside, what do I see?
The future's coming faster than I'm leaving, baby
And I don't wanna feel

Hanging out all day, trying to find my peace
I'm tired of my rental and my fantasies, oh
Babe, let's take a chance and live so true for a chance
Walk away from those bygone days
Oh, oh, gonna take the van and drive to Switzerland
Put off execution while we still can, oh
We could still be making some sweet memories
Watch the world go down at our feet

Oh, oh, I can't go home and hide in my (?) anymore
But when I look outside, what do I see?
The future's coming faster than I'm leaving, baby
And I don't wanna feel

It washing over me
