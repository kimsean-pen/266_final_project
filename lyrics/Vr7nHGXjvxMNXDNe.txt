Gotta have it
The feeling you give me, is savage
But why do we all gotta make it complicated
A modest overrated
Can we take it?
Take it back to basics?
Oh, we can rough it
With the moon and the stars up above us
Like the millions of years, before we ever got together
A pre-historic treasure

Can we take it?
Take it back to basics?
Oh yeah
Naked as the day we were born, did you know it could feel like this?
Feel like this?
I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness

The wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Before the fire

We discovered desire
It's no use talking, just let me hear you breathing

Or are you overheated?
Can we take it?
Can we take it back to basics?
Oh yeah
Naked as the day we were born, did you know it could feel like this?
Feel like this?

I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness
The wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
I'll take it back
Let's take it back
I'll take it back
Take it back

Oh, no no no
Take it back
Take it back
I'll, I'll take it back
Take it back
I'll take it back, we're naked as...
Naked as the day we were born, did you know it could feel like this?
Feel like this?
I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness
The wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
