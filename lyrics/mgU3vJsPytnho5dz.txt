I wanna go where the sun sinks low
Eagle, Bear and Buffalo
I wanna watch the stars shine on my own
Lay me down in the morning rain
Rivers row by like runaway trains
You can, you can leave me here
In Yellowstone

Where all the trees grow old and tall
Make me feel so young and small
Make me wonder if I'm here at all
Who am I to say
Lake so clear you can see to the ground
Make all the mountains hang upside down
Make me wonder am I right way round
It doesn't matter anyway

I wanna go where the sun sinks low
Eagle, Bear and Buffalo
I wanna watch the stars shine on my own
Lay me down in the midday sun
Beaten down like a soldier's drums
You can, you can hear them play
In Yellowstone

Worn out souls, aching bones
Fishing poles and stepping stones
Whiskey woman, campfire smoke
The ending of the day
Where you listen to the wind
Whistle her tune
Coyotes sing by the light of the moon
If I ever leave it'll be too soon
But I know that I can't stay

I wanna go where the sun sinks low
Eagle, Bear and Buffalo
I wanna watch the stars shine on my own

Lay me down in the evening light
Keys of smoke and starlet night
You can give me here in
Yellowstone
Leave me close to tears
Yellowstone
Never disappear
Yellowstone
