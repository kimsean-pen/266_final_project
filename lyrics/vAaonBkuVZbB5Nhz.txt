Here's a little song to make you feel good
Put a little light in your day
These are crazy times
And it's all been getting pretty serious

Oh yeah
Here's a little song to make you feel right
Send the blues away
Well it's a crazy game

Tell me who's to blame I'm kinda curious
Oh yeah
Right if you win, wrong if you lose
Nobody listens when you're singin' the blues
Well something's the matter but nothing gets done
Oh everyone's waiting for a place in the sun

Well something is wrong now, can something be wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazy
so crazy yeah
Gimme little left, gimme little right

Gimme little black, gimme little white
Gimme little peace, gimme little hope
Gimme little light
'Cause you know it seems
that the situation's getting serious
Oh yeah

Right if you win, wrong if you lose
Nobody listens when you're singin' the blues
Well something's the matter but nothing gets done
There's no use in waiting for a place in the sun
'Cause something is wrong now
can something be wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazy
Oh crazy yeah

Oh something is wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazy
So crazy
So crazy
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Woah
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Sing on and on and on and on
Oh! gotta be so crazy
Gotta be so crazy
