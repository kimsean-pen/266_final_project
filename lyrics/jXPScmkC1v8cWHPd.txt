Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody
Ooh, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody
Ooh, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
