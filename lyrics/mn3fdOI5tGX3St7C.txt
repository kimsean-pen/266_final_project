What is love
Did I miss it
Am I home
Or still adrift

Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time

Keep on moving
If you still can
A simple home
A love in hand

Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
You're away, but I'll be fine

I'll be fine
Out grow our time
Down the line
You'll see

Love brought weight to this heart of mine
Gone to waste in due time
Love brought weight to this heart of mine
You're away, but I'll be fine
