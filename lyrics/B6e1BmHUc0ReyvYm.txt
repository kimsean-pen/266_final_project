This room is thick with words
A mess a mess of secrets and thieves
But can't you see that we're all the same
Just vessels and we're all afraid

Forgive me I don't mean to intrude
You see my hands are shaking too

Just settle down this storm won't last forever
We're built for more than this world
I'm not that strong honestly I'm not
But you always see the best in me

Now I'm open
At least you see me for who I am
So fragile
I wait with hope that the coming change won't blow us away

Forgive me I don't mean to intrude
You see my hands are shaking too

Just settle down this storm won't last forever
We're built for more than this world
I'm not that strong honestly I'm not
But you always see the best in me

Am I something you can be proud of now

Just settle down this storm won't last forever
We're built for more than this world
I'm not that strong honestly I'm not
But you always see the best in me

Am I something you can be proud of now
