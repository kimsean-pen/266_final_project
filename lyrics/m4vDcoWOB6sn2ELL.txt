You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give...
Won't lie and say this lovin's best...
Leave us in emotional peace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No take a rest

I see you digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean-to
Your troubles must be seen to seen to
Money like it's paper, with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, 'specially when your body's doubled
Duplicate and then you wait for the next Kuwait

Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma

You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest... taste the rest

You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest... taste the rest
Now take a walk, take a rest... taste the rest

Don't want to be on top of your list...
Phenomenally and properly kissed...
We overcome in sixty seconds
With the strength we have to together
But for now... emotional ties they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats
And when we funk we'll hear beats

Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma

Deflowering my baby, I eat my baby mate
I must be crazy... see i'm swazy
Digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy... must be lazy

Don't wanna on top of your list...
Monopoly and properly kissed

Deflowering my baby, I eat my baby mate...
My baby
Deflowering my baby, I eat my baby mate...
(I must be crazy) You must be lazy

Karmacoma... (what?) Jamaica and Roma
