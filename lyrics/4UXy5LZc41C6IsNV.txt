This song is for the lovers out there
And all the lights on the trees
All the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily

We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart ... Yeah!

I can feel it, I can hold it, I can pin it, shape it, mold it,
I can cut it, I can taste it, spank it
Beat it while you ... Ah, wait here

I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol'
City boy won't you spank thru?
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could

I can feel it, I can hold it, pin it, shape it, mold it,
We can cut it, We can taste it, spank it
Beat it 'till you ... Ah, wait here

I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol'
City boy won't you spank thru?
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could

I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol'
City boy won't you spank thru?
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could
You won't think you ever could.
