Oh I know, I know, I know
All the songs you write are about me
But you changed the names
So I can't stake my claim
You're so greedy
And I know, I know, I know
That you think you're a much better writer
And that might be true
But what I've got on you
Is I'm a fighter
This is war
My fingers are sore
So far from the top
But I refuse to stop
Got shakers in my eardrums
Bossing like a new gun
Baby, when it's all done
You won't mind that I've won
This is a battle
You are the prize
Put down that piano
Let's start our lives
You've got more soldiers
But I've got more passion
And I'm right behind you just gaining traction
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
And I know, I know, I know
About the lovers in your bulletproof lining
They don't intimidate
They're just too bit-ah late and bad timing
And I know, I know, I know
You've got your battle plan mapped out in inches
But I'm not scared of you I'm jumping right into these Brooklyn trenches
This is war
My fingers are sore
I might be a masochist just asking for more
Cause this stage is like a standoff
And you're pretty tough
I'm bruised and bloody
But I'll never give up!
This is a battle
You are the prize
Put down that piano
And come to my side
We'll sing songs together
I'll hold your hand
Make perfect-pitched babies
And form a band
I don't really want, I don't really wanna fight no more
I'm sweating in the sun
Camped out with ammo at your door
Uh-oor, uh-oor, uh-oor
Oh, I don't really want, I don't really wanna fight no more
But I just can't be beat
So I will stand the heat
Until your love, your love is sure
Baby, this is war
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
