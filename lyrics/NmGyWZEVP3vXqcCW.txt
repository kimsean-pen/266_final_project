Catch a boat to England baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same

Send out for whiskey baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service honey
Me and room service babe
Me and room service
Well we're living a life of sin

When I'm not drinkin' baby
You are on my mind
When I'm not sleepin' honey
When I ain't sleepin' mama
When I'm not sleepin'
You know you'll find me crying

Try another city baby
Another town
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues come followin' down

Livin' is a gamble baby
Lovin's much the same
Wherever I have played
Whenever I've thrown them dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game

Maybe tomorrow honey
Some place down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older mama
I'll wake up older
And I'll just stop all my trying

Catch a boat to England baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same
