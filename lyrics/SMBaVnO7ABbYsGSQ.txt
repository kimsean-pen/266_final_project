She put your toys away
You carried them and scraped your face
You leave with the dogs again
And she's at the back again

And you said she went away
You carried them and scraped your face
And she's at the back again

So cold, I know where you go
You're telling me no
So cold, I know where you go
Stop telling me no
So cold, I know where you go
You're telling me no
So cold, I know where you go

You put your toys away
Tried to remember your face
You left with the dogs again
And she's at the back again

I could give you all that you don't want
I'll give you all that you don't want
I could give you all that you don't want

So cold, I know where you go
You're telling me no
So cold, I know where you go
Stop telling me no
So cold, I know where you go
You're telling me no
So cold, I know where you go

She keeps on calling
I don't know where
She keeps on coming
I don't know where
She keeps on calling
And calling me where you go
And telling me no

She said "Pray over there"
She sat and prayed over there
How dare you decide what's right?
No, you won't
No, you won't
No, you won't

She keeps on calling
I don't know where
She keeps on coming
I don't know where
These silly little girls don't shine
These silly little girls don't shine

So don't dare
Don't you there say no
So don't dare
Don't you there say no
So don't dare
Don't you there say no

And dim a little light low
And dim a little light low
