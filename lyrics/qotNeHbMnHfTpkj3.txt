we will dance
on our way to heaven
we will dance
on our way to heaven
you say when i'm dead
i will never be afraid again
you say when i'm dead
i will never be afraid again
fall down
standing up is boring
fall down
standing up is boring
you say
when i'm dead
i will never feel the strange again
you say
when i'm dead
i will never feel the strange again
aa-i-haahaay
sing about this feeling
and aa-i-haahaaay
love it when you hear me
aa-i-haahaay
sing about this feeling
we would always feel it
when we're on way to heaven
you laugh
standing in the mirror
you laugh
standing in the mirror
and in our day
you will never be this yaaaaaoung again
and in our day
you will never be this yaaaaaoung again
aa-i-haahaay
sing about this feeling
and aa-i-haahaaay
love it when you hear me
aa-i-haahaay
sing about this feeling
we would always feel it
when we're on way to heaven
when we're dead dead dead dead dead
we will dance dance dance dance dance
when we're dead dead dead dead dead
we will dance dance dance dance dance
on our way to heaven
on our way to heaven
on our way to heaven
