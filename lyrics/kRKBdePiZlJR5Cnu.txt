Remove all the damage
Material debris
Remove scar tissue
Decayed and diseased
Establish a connection
Matter to the mind
My self replication
Run for your life

Look in my eyes
Look in my eyes
It's not over
I will survive
I will survive

I regenerated now
I've finally found new ground
Breathing new life now
I will regenerate

Replace for enhancement
Destroy permanence
Born again and faithless
Shatter the resilient
I have got the power
To effect a change
Amplify my body
Don't fade away

Look in my eyes
Look in my eyes
It's not over
I will survive
I will survive

I regenerated now
I've finally found new ground
Breathing new life now
I will regenerate

You can't kill me!

I regenerated now
I've finally found new ground
Breathing new life now
I will regenerate
New life today
