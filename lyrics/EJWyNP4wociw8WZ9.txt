I was the Duke of Earl
The Duke of Earl
But it couldn't last
I was the Pony Express
But I ran out of gas

Golden dreams
Golden dreams
All lose their glow
I don't need perfection
I love the whole

Give me a life
That needs correction
Nobody loves
Loves perfection

Loneliness
Loneliness
Will run you through
All the kids are laughing
I'm laughing too

If you want my eyes
Take my eyes
They're always true
If you want my heart
Take my heart
It's right here for you

It's been so long
Been so long
But I made it through
It's been so long
Been so long
But I made it through
It's been so long

We'll never leave
We can't be beat
We can't be beat
We'll never leave
We can't be beat
The world is ours
We can't be beat
We can't be beat
