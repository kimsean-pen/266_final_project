Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh
Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh

Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh
Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh

Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh
Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh

I want to be where the boys are
But I'm not allowed
I wait outside of the boy's bar
I wait for them to all come out

I'm not a boy
I'm not a boy

It's not my fault
That I'm not a boy
It's not my fault
I don't have those toys

I'm not a boy
I'm not a boy

Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh
Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh

Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh
Boy, uh huh, boy, uh huh

And now it's alright
(And now it's alright)
Without those boys
(Without those boys)
I stay at home at night
(I stay at home at night)
And I play with my toys
(And I play with my toys)

Boy
I'm not a boy
Boy
I'm not a boy

Boy
I'm not a boy
Boy
I'm not a, not a, not a boy
