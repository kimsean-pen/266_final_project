I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
No nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them for ever and ever
We can be heroes just for one day

I, I will be king
And you-you will be queen
Though nothing-nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us it's just for one day

I, I remember
Standing by the wall
The guns shot above our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
We can beat them forever and ever
We can be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
For just one day
