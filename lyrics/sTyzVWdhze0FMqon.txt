Like a sniper
I've got my sights on you
A windscreen wiper
There ain't no spoiling my view

Silver bandoleer
My profession's clear
Sharpshooter, sharpshooter, sharpshooter

Infrared vein
Don't you come out at night
Infrared chain
You're gonna buy your life

Silver pistol too
With a notch for you
Sharpshooter, sharpshooter, sharpshooter

You're the contract
I'm gonna nail you down
I'm the contact
With your final round

And I'm stalking you
And that ain't all I do
Sharpshooter, sharpshooter, sharpshooter

Sharpshooter
Sharpshooter
Sharpshooter
Sharpshooter
