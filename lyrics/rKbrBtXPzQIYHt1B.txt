Thinking clearly never came as easy as it did for you
Driving this route out of town I wish you were still around

In the dead of night I always wondered whether you were true
Someone better than myself an offer you just can't turn down
A morning fight, A wasted night
You crept back to your room...

Run along back to your new man, Limassol
Hold on, I couldn't trap you
We're gonna head for... new horizons, Limassol

When it's all good, keep things close at hand

I could never bear to hear you struggling against the tide
Promises I couldn't keep
I couldn't admit I was in too deep

Saw the lights on in your window even though you said you'd gone
The darker nights have come again
Quicker than the year before

A morning fight
A wasted night
You slinked back to your room...

You better run along, back to your new man, Limassol
Hold on, I could never trap you
We're gonna head for... new horizons, Limassol
When it's all good
Keep things close at hand
And when it's all good you've got to
Keep things close at hand
