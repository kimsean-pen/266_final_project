Reach through your mind, internal sky
Endless glide into the I
Soul encaged, trapped behind your eyes
Until it's saved, by sharing its light
and darkness...

Save my immortal Soul
From its own chains
From a fate worse than death
Condemned to silence
To turn away
Implode and fade

Days pass me by, carved out of time
I transpire before my own eyes
No decay can touch a fire
But I choke my flame, in fear of shining too bright
or too faintly...

Save my immortal Soul
From its own chains
From a fate worse than death
Condemned to silence
To turn away
Implode and fade
We don't become who we dream of
If we don't face our own demons
If we shun what conceals us
We go blind to that which frees us... if we shun

Reach through your mind, internal sky
Endless glide into the I
