There's a part that doesn't even work at all
Ran out of power 'cause I left it on
But there's a part that still believes in love
But now it's turning cold

'Cause I let somebody handle
And they made it hurt again, yeah
'Cause they did it so much damage
Never thought it would run again, no

But I found the pieces, every single one
And put them all back
Never wanna go through that again
(Oh no, say no, no, say never wanna, say no, no)

Fall through if I hand it over to you
Could you hold my heart out with a beat or two
But if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?
(Careful, careful, careful)

When you're close my heart's way above the ground
But then it falls when you're not around
It beats and it pounds, I can't turn it down
And now I'm afraid

'Cause I let somebody handle
And they made it hurt again, yeah
'Cause they did it so much damage
Never thought it would run again, no

But I found the pieces, every single one
And put them all back
Never wanna go through that again
(Oh no, say no, no, say never wanna, say no, no)

Fall through if I hand it over to you
Could you hold my heart out with a beat or two
But if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?

You got so many things about you
And I don't have the words to say
'Cause my heart is doing the talking
Can't you hear it's calling your name?

I wanna hand it over, hand it over to you
I wanna hand it over

Fall through, if I hand it over to you
Could you hold my heart out with a beat or two
But if I hand it over to you
Would you, would you be careful?

Fall through, if I hand it over to you
Could you hold my heart out with a beat or two
But if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?

Fall through, if I hand it over
Could you hold my heart out with a beat or two
