Err on the side of caution
They're taking in the new girls
(Two faced, too poised to shed a tear)
No memory to speak of
(Passed in the night we didn't hear)
The fading breath of your love

We lose control
Of the moment
Another trend goes out of season
A new love
Forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend: indifference

You are a child of privilege
Your reputation leads you
(All trace of life will disappear)
You're falling into season
(Their every word is insincere)
There is no time for reason

We lose control
Of the moment
Another trend goes out of season
A new love
Forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend: indifference

Remember
Our childhood
It's not quite the same
A pale hue
Of new blood
They all know your name

We lose control
Of the moment
Another trend goes out of season
A new love
Forever
Look the other way
You see through me
A new trend: indifference
