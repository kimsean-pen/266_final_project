I get so distracted
By some peoples reactions
That I don't see my own faults
For what they are
For what they are

At times so self destructive
With no intent on moulding
But behind this emotion
My sensible heart
My sensible heart

See I'm no king, I wear no crown
But desperate times seem over now
But still I weaken somehow
And it tears me apart
It tears me apart

I hope to learn as time goes by
That I should trust what's deep inside
Burning bright, oh burning bright
My sensible heart
My sensible heart
My sensible heart
My sensible heart.
