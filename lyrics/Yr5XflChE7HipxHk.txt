Justify falling away
Don't satisfy you
Do it all the time
Leave it behind
Don't follow me
I never wanted to

Shut it down
Fuck the devine
Want to forget
Now they won't let ya
Give up
At least it's safe
Give up
At least it's safe
Fire
Holding
Fire
Fire
At least it's safe
They just wanna control ya

Sleeps in the sea
Face to the tide
Come undone soon
Got heavy inside
Leave it behind
Want to consume you

Shut it down
Fuck the devine
Want to forget
Now they won't let ya
Give up
At least it's safe
Give up
At least it's safe
Fire
Holding
Fire
Fire
At least it's safe
They just wanna control ya
