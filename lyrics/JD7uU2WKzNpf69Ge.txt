These four walls have got a story to tell
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
The door is off the hinges, there's no wishing them well
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture windows cracked, and there's no where to run
I know, I know, this house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dreams don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Standing on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul, this house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

This house was built on trust
That's what it is, it always was
No wrecking ball could knock it down
This house was built on higher ground

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale
Coming home, I'm coming home

Coming home, I'm coming home
(This house is not for sale)
Coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm) coming home, I'm coming home

(This house is not, is not for sale)
