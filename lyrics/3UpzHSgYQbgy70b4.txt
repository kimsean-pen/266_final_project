I don't need your strength anymore
'Cuz you have made me strong
You may not see the woman in me
That you dreamed of holding me in your arms

All the days that you gave
All the moments you saved me
Praying for my life, sacrificed just to make me
Who I am on my own
You don't have to let go

You don't say it, but it's in your eyes
All the fear of goodbye
But I can promise you'll always
Have a place and a way to my heart

All the days that you gave
All themoments you saved me
Praying for my life, sacrificed just to make me
Who I am on my own
You don't have to let go

I can live, as you lived for me
I can love, 'cuz you loved me
