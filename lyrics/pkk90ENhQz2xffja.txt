Like big love, black love, white love, your love
Here we go
Sit back, hold up, open up, just enjoy the show
Like ice cream, whip cream, nasty dreams
Do you know? Can you feel what I mean?

Say Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Oh oh oh oh
Say Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

It feels so good
And you knew that it would
When we're bringing on the boom boom
And you're so sweet from your head to your feet
When I'm giving you the boom boom

Yeah don't wake up in the morning
In somebody else's room room
Blame it on the boom boom

Now see I would ask you where you like it
Instead I'll tell you where you're

gonna get it, see
In the bedroom, the bathroom, the classroom
the last room on the left
In my fantasy, you're next to me
I'm giving you my everything, my very best

Like back beats, back seats, summer heat
C'mon I wanna hear everybody say
Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Yeah! Yeah!

Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
It feels so good
And you knew that it would
When we're bringing on the boom boom
And you're so sweet from your head to your feet

When I'm giving you the boom boom
Yeah don't wake up in the morning
In somebody else's room room
Blame it on the boom boom

Hey eh eh
Do you like big? Yeah
Black? Yeah

White? Yeah
Sho nuff here we go
Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Hey eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Oh!

It feels so good
And you knew that it would
When we're bringing on the boom boom
And you're so sweet from your head to your feet
When I'm giving you the boom boom

It feels so good
And you knew that it would
When we're bringing on the boom boom
And you're so sweet from your head to your feet
When I'm giving you the boom boom
Yeah don't wake up in the morning
In somebody else's room room
Blame it on the boom boom
Yeah yeah yeah
Huh
Now we've all been thinking
there's just one thing left to say
Blame it on the boom boom!
