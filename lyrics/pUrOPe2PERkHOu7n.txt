Theres a black hole pulling me in
I slowly bend
til I see the back of my own sins
I stole my soul from myself
Now I wonder

I wonder is there somebody with a perfect plan
That goes boom when its stamped
Then we could understand
How the gods of old used to clap their hands
To make thunder

And so were clapping and were laughing
Like it was so absurd
In the future well be laughing at who we were
Right now as man plays god with the land
That he plunders

To the one unknown no one can own
No seed thats resistant to greed
If we listen to time after time
Time can never go under

Theres this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind
Theres this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind, in my mind, in my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb
Through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry and memories
Of a backlit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground
Looking up at the sun coming down

Into a world where boys and girls
Are holding hand held devices
While theyre eating and theyre sleeping
And theyre dreaming of the prices
Well be paying down the line
When the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine

And all the greatest of the heroes
Started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros
Looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future
Took a sip, drank half the glass then put it back

A lot of people like to have a feast
Not so many can stomach the killing
A lot of traffic on the streets
So whos really doing all the drilling?
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imaginations got a hole in it

Theres this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind
Theres this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind, in my mind, in my mind
