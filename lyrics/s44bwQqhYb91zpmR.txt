The sun, beating down on my face
Sweat runs, from my spine to the base
And in the summertime, I don't mind, I can go with whatever you say
There is no other time,
you will find, leaving hearts wide open to embrace

The sun, beating down on my face
Sweat runs, from my spine to the base
And in the summertime, I don't mind, I can go with whatever you say
There is no other time,
you will find, leaving hearts wide open to embrace

These dreams are always running
I don't need, I don't need to be awake
These dreams are always running
I don't need, I don't need to be awake
These dreams are always running
I don't need, I don't need to be awake
These dreams are always running
I don't need, I don't need to be awake
