Don't wanna live
don't wanna live a life disguised in a lie behind the smile
save yourself
I don't pacify

don't wanna talk
don't wanna walk around in circles until we're eye to eye
you find yourself
I have eyes on fire

this wreck is caving in
alert the next of kin
it's worthless yet again like we were told

I gave you all the outs
just in case you had any doubt
so how does it come about that we could get surrounded

tomorrow the forecast's black
though it'd keep me on the tracks til I be ruined
I tried in all the nights
unforgiven and forgot
for nothing, thanks a lot

hey weren't you told how brutal life can be
how it takes all that you can bear to stave defeat
you'll be cursed if you're convinced
it won't leave you in despairs
