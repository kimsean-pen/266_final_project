L.A. lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
Still wanna go
There's something here
In the way, in the way that we're constantly moving
Reminds you of home
So you're taking these pills
For to fill up your soul
And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that you're making
But me, I'm the catalyst

When you say love is a simple chemical reaction
Can't say I agree
'Cause my chemicals, yeah, left me a beautiful disaster

Still love's all I see
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul
And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making

But you, you're the catalyst
You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the scar
You'll be the road, rolling below
The wheels of a car
And all of your thoughts on... God
Don't know if I'm strong enough... no
You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the

Catalyst
These L.A. lights, no no
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco
Do you wanna though...
Still wanna go?
