Hole inside, you fall out
Oh, just a little bit, everywhere you ever been
To drift along, to make us feel
Search for someone, a lover serene

This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home
This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home

This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home
This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home

Getting drunk and getting high
[Incomprehensible] through the night

This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home
This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home

This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home
This is all we've got
'Til we find our way back home

Oh, hide your eyes from the sun
'Cause the light, it shines to bright
As we bid farewell to night, it's morning

Oh, ease us down to the ground
'Cause the ecstasy's over
And it tunes us to our lives again

Lost in the fun just for now
'Cause the stereo, it beats
Drink and talk about the street that's waking

Oh, does that surprise you at all?
Is the light extensible and it lights the morning sky
And suddenly I'm struck
By the beauty of this moment

Just close as friends we love
For a moment, it's seems so
Just take us home
Just take us home
