I feel like the girl at the bar
Who's been there too long, can't stand up
I should be gone
But I just can't get enough, yeah

Fumbling, giggling, silly as ever
I get like this after one too many
But right now I ain't even been drinking
He approached me and asked for a minute

Which turned into five, then turned into ten
And right now I don't know how to say when

So can I get a refill
Can I get a refill, can I get a refill
Yeah, of your time
'Cause you're intoxicating my mind

Feel like a conversational lush 'cause I don't know
How much is too much, yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar
Who's been there too long, can't stand up

Wishing and hoping that I don't blow it, I'm nervous as hell
I don't wanna show it and right now I don't even know what I'm saying
I've never had game, no never, I don't wanna sound like a broken record
But until you say goodnight, all I know is that I'm staying

So can I get a refill
Can I get a refill, can I get a refill
Yeah, of your time
'Cause you're intoxicating my mind

Feel like a conversational lush 'cause I don't know
How much is too much, yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar
Who's been there too long, can't stand up

I need a shot of you on the rocks
'Cause I'm down to my very last drop

So can I get a refill, can I get a refill
Can I get a refill, baby, can I get a refill, yeah
'Cause I feel like the girl at the bar
Who's been there too long, can't stand up
I should be gone but I just can't get enough
So can I get a refill, can I get a refill
I feel like the girl at the bar who's been there too long
Can't stand up, I should be gone, but I just can't get enough
Can I get a refill, can I get a refill
Can I get a refill, can I get a refill
Baby, can I get a refill
Baby, can I get a refill
