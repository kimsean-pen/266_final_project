I'll take my bow
I won't make a sound
I whisper truce
as the ashes hit the ground

Hush love
No I'm not what you think that I am made of
I'm a story
I'm a break up
Just a hero on a bridge that's burning down

Can you see my scars
Can you feel my heart
This is all of me for all of the world to see

So who's it gonna be
The one that you only need
I gave it all and all you gave
Was sweet misery

So who's gonna save us now
When the ashes hit the ground
I gave it all
But all you gave was sweet misery

This is the end
My beloved friends
I'm lost in dreams
and all I know is where I've been

Run love
I'm the truth that you're afraid of
I'm a fever that you made up
Just martyr on a bridge that's burning down

Can you see my scars
Can you feel my heart
This is all of me for all of the world to see

So who's it gonna be
The one that you only need
I gave it all and all you gave
Was sweet misery

So who's gonna save us now
When the ashes hit the ground
I gave it all
But all you gave was sweet misery

Can you see my scars
Can you feel my heart
This is all of me for all of the world to see

So who's it gonna be
The one that you only need
I gave it all and all you gave
Was sweet misery

So who's gonna save us now
When the ashes hit the ground
I gave it all
But all you gave was sweet misery
So who's it gonna be
The one that you only need
I gave it all and all you gave
Was sweet misery
