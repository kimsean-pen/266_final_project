When your day is long

And the night
And the night is your's alone
When you think you've had enough
Of this life
Hang on
Don't let yourself go

'cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong

Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night hold on
Hold on (hold on)
If you feel like letting go
(hold on)
If you're sure you've had too much
Of this life
Hang on
'cause everybody hurts

Sometimes
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts
Don't blow your hands

Oh-oh no
Don't blow your hands
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, not alone
If you're on your own

In this life
The days and nights are long
You're sure you've had too much
Of this life
To hang on
Yeah everybody hurts

Sometimes
Everybody cries
Sometimes
Everybody hurts
Sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
To know you're not alone
