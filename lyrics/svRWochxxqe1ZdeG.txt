Chubby baby,
walks on thin ice
she ate the whole wide world
still she loans for another slice of love
yeah she loans for another slice of love
chubby baby,
???
shes not too blind to see
soon she'll wake up only to find, my love
flew the highways before she rised, my love
one day maybe, broken twilight
while everyones asleep
we'll go chasing butterflies or love
it'd never work with open eyes or love

(take it away)

she did it again
and messed up my heart with a high speed train
she did it again (oh no!)
and messed up my heart
she did it again
and messed up my heart with a high speed train
she did it again (uh oh!)
and messed up my heart
