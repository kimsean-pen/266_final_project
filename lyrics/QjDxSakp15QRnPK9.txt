And I always find, yeah, always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find, yeah
Always find, yeah, always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at you...)
Run away
Don't have to get crazy (Look at you...)
Run away
Think I've found a plan
Run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at you...)
Run away
Doesn't have to get crazy (Look at you...)
Why can't she just run away
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

Okay 24-7, 365 groupies stay on their grind
I, I, I get it, alright I'll help you get it
But now that you're here either leave or get with it
I'm not a chauvinist, this is just reality
You can't afford guilt on a rock band salary
Mickey full of vodka, you're looking like Mallory
Fuck counting money, you should stick to counting calories
Let me tell you this thing here is wearing thin
Unless you've got a couple friends that want sharing in
Yesterday you were outside staring in
And now you're here and next week you'll be here for them
Every tour bus visit every laminate
Comes with expectations from that band you're with
This is everyday business, so manage it
Or runaway now if your ass can't handle it

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Plus the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of an advantage
'Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah, always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can
