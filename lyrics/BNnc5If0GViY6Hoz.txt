Breath you out, breath you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been

In my eyes I see it oh so clear
It was long ago and far away
But it never disappears

I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and so look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)

So let me go just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us
Growing deeper and much darker every day

Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you

Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)

Part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye forever

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
When I'm out from under
