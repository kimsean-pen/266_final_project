Skin so cold
I knew you'd go away
And now I put you down to lay
Nothing to feel for you
This was our last dance

Closer and closer, it's time to surrender
To the desire that you cannot mention
Don't try to breathe
Don't try to run away

But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
But I'm reaching for the sky

Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
With a smile I watch you go
You'll never know I didn't cry

With a smile I saw you die
You'll never know I didn't cry
Closer and closer, it's time to surrender
To the desire that you cannot mention

Don't try to breathe
Don't try to run away
But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay

(going to fly)

But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
...To fly
No more fear

They said you were so weak
And now I put you down to lay
Nothing to feel for you
This was our last dance

Closer and closer, it's time to surrender
To the desire that you cannot mention
Don't try to breathe
Don't try to run away
But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
But I'm reaching for the sky
Won't you please stay
(going to fly)
