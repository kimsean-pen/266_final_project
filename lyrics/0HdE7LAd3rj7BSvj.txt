president
it's time to awaken, the journey's almost done
the quest is over, a new one's begun
and when we reach our destination, our lives won't be the same
we're on our own now and free of the 'Frame

captain
we're closing in on Sirrah's halo
behold the glow of our new sun
an arc of light, a cosmic rainbow
captain and biologist
but far beyond, buried in space
I hear the death cry of a race

opposition leader
Alpha is shattered, their suffering is done
the trial is over and nobody's won
we've got a brand new world at our disposal
this time we'll do it right, we're starting over and no one will die!

preacher
وقال يجب ألا يكون هناك ضوء وكان هناك ضوء

counselor and biologist
time halts as we yearn for the fallen, souls weep as we grieve for the dead
hearts bleed as we cry our last goodbye, in our hearts they will never die

preacher
Fa kaala falyakon nur fa kena nur

counselor and biologist
fire dies as we mourn for the perished, love drowns as we ache for the lost
life stops as we cry our last goodbye, in our hearts they will never die

biologist: ooooh, I can see our future star
opposition leader: we're closing in on Sirrah's halo
biologist: I can feel the force within her heart
opposition leader: behold the glow of our new sun
biologist: I can feel her rays caress my skin
opposition leader: an arc of light, a cosmic rainbow
biologist: I can feel her power draw me in
opposition leader and biologist:
but far beyond, buried in space
I hear the death cry of a race
