Uh huh, honey, alright.

My baby whispers in my ear
Um, um, sweet nothings
He knows the things I like to hear
Um, Um, sweet nothings.
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else
Secrets, baby, I keep them to myself
Sweet nothings, um, um sweet nothings.

We walk along hand in hand
Um, um, sweet nothings
Yeah, we both understand
Um, um, sweet nothings
Sittin' in class or trying to read my book
My baby, give me that special look
Sweet nothings, um, um, sweet nothings.

A sittin' on my front porch
Um, um, sweet nothings
Well, do I love you? Of course
Um, um, sweet nothings
Mama turned on the front porch light
Saying come here darling that's enough for tonight
Sweet nothings, um, um, sweet nothings.

Sweet nothings
Um, um, sweet nothings
Sweet nothings...
