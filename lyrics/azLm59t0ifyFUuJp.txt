Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago
I never thought I would be
At twenty-three, on the verge of
spontaneous combustion
Woe-is-me
But I guess that it comes
With the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see

That I have had all I can take and
exploding seems like an imminent possibility to me
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world
And its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn
And rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me
I'll never be the same

Not two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, I can relate
Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication as a welcome vacation from
The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently
Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games

So pardon me while I burn
And rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me
I'll never be the same
Never be the same
Pardon me, while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me
So pardon me while I burst into flames

I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn
And rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me
I'll never be the same
Pardon me
Never be the same
