It's all a crumble locomotion on you
And we feel out the shining in our signaling suits
And explode into hohohoho!
It's a manner, hehehehehe, stow!

And we won't get to sleep for fifty thousand years
And we won't get to sleep for maybe five minutes
Waving my arms in motion around alot
Waving my arms in motion around alot
