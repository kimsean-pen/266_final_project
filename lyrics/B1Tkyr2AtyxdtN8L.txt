Here in this room
I'm chasing down my demons, I can hear them breathing
But who knew,
That you would be my comfort, you could bring the healing?

But if my friends' gonna let this slide,
How come you never left my side?
Before I go, make it last all night
While I slip into the Great Divide

(Come on!) Stepping out of body
No matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Abandon all your logic
And put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll seize you in another life
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama, I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)

All is not lost
My veins are seething, I can feel the freedom
Let them talk
It's not about the crown, we can share the kingdom

But if my friends' gonna let this slide,
How come you never left my side?
Before I go, make it last all night
While I slip into the Great Divide

(Come on!) Stepping out of body
No matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Abandon all your logic
And put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll seize you in another life
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama, I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)

If my friends' gonna let me slide,
How come you never left my side?
Before I go, make it last all night
While I slip into the Great Divide

Stepping out of body
No matter how you call it
This is suicidal, honey
Nothing you could do about it
Let me take the check with the reckless abandon
Honey, just call me kamikaze (oh-uh oh-uh)

(Come on!) Stepping out of body
No matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Abandon all your logic
And put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll seize you in another life
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama, I'm a kamikaze (oh-uh, oh-uh)
