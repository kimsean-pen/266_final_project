Some were meant to suffer
Some were meant to live their lives like kings
You separate society
Dividing our name
We see in each other
What we don't see in ourselves
Define the words you speak

These words are never like ther're told
There is no Hope
I can't seem to escape
You're everywhere I look
There is no hope

You're a future strain of this addictive disease
Sinking in red eyes they gaze
It's what defines you
You'll never know the feeling of acheving
What's in our hands it our divide

We watch our nation fall before our eyes
We are blind to everything but the paper what we burn
To have and hold
Nothing but empty hands
A life to mislead
And now we see in each other what we don't see in ourselves
To have and hold
