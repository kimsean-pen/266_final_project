Started out as a reserve
Soon promoted well deserved
And the legend has begun
With a bounty on his head
The red army wants him dead
Soviet enemy number one

Cross of Mannerheim
Addicted to the war game
Never-ending flame
Victory reclaimed
Oh we remember
We remember
We remember

Shout! Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of three armies knows the game
Keeps their echo from the past
Rise from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and the Green Beret
May you rest in peace at last
Lauri Allan Törni

Crossed the water a new start
War still beating in his heart
A new legend has been born
Started out as a reserve
Soon promoted when deserved
Changed his name to Larry Thorne

Cross of Mannerheim
Addicted to the war game
Never-ending flame
Victory reclaimed
Oh we remember
We remember
We remember

Shout! Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of three armies knows the game
Keeps their echo from the past
Rise from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and the Green Beret
May you rest in peace at last

From the Finnish lakes
Into Germany and USA
All the wars he came across
Cross of Mannerheim, an Iron Cross
A Bronze Star, Purple Heart
One Distinguished Flying Cross

Shout! Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of three armies knows the game
Keeps their echo from the past
Rise from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and the Green Beret
May you rest in peace at last
Lauri Allan Törni
