Pop the trunk I open up I sold my soul for a good price
Outta' sight, and my hoe got talent right
Whole squad ran through that shit yikes
What can I say I'm a business man I did my business man
But 'Imma bend it down and I'mma lick her up, then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'm gon' kick her out
She gon' talk that shit but say
How you make it up, how you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one of she gon' kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well (but) I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why yall feed off my energy, like I ain't dead yet
Higher entity foreign bitch that thinks she into me with the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay but still into me, said she gay but still into me
Said that she hates that I'm in the streets
And said that I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up and make history
And she said that she hates my Insta feed

Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you and
Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you and
Xans gon' betray you

And her pussy tastes like skittles, what?
Yeah, ayy, and you can really taste the rainbow, what? (hah, no)
Yo' bitch just like a crayola (what, ayy)
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart shaped kisses

666, evil bitches want my mentions
