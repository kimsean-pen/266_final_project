Outside the factory gates
For hours sit and wait
For you to turn around
And show me there's a way

I am a stranger to the life
Enchanted by the wonders of the night

I stepped into the dark
With all the broken hearts
I'm searching empty streets
Distant and apart

I am a stranger in this life
Haunted by yesterday's desires

When we meet again
You'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing
In the rain

They say they can see
What I'm supposed to be
But what is right for them
Don't mean it's right for me

I am a stranger to the life
Enchanted by the wonders of the night

[Incomprehensible]
As I watch from my window
Across the waterfront
But they will never know

I am a stranger in this life
Haunted by yesterday's desires

When we meet again
You'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing
In the rain

I am a stranger to the life
Enchanted by the wonders of the night

When we meet again
You'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing
In the rain

In the rain, in the rain
In the rain, in the rain
In the rain
