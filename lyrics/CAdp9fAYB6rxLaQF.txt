It's not chipped,
We're not cracked,
We're shattered

I thought we had something special

and we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
You see me walking by ya
boy don't you even speak

pretend you are on a sofa and I'm on a Tv
Might see me on a poster
see me at a show
but you won't see me for free

boy this is ain't no promo

You're all shamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the Bbj

And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now

And don't keep calling from your momma's house

When I break I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face

I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face

I break

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
you're gonna get a lot of calls

Cause I cc'd all your friends
I break (I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby

I break

When I break I break

So look who's crying now boo hoo hoo
talking about you're missing your boo hoo hoo
No you ain't getting it

No you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it
- ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
You'll wonder who I'm messin'

With while you ain't next to me
I'm going bye...

So pay the consequences

Cause you acting all ignorant

You're ashamed now
Wherever you been laying
You can stay now

Gotta board the Bbj
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your momma's house

When I break I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break
Up out my face boy

Up out my face boy

Up out my face
I break
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
you're gonna get a lot of calls
Cause I cc'd all your friends
I break (I break)
I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby

When I break I break I break
And no superglue can fix this shhh
When I break I break I break
And not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this sh*t
When I break I break I break
Not even a nail technician with a
whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break I break
If we were two lego blocks even the Harvard University

Graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again

When I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face

I break, I break, I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy

You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
you're gonna get a lot of calls
Cause I cc'd all your friends

I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby
I break boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face

Up out my face boy

Up out my face boy
