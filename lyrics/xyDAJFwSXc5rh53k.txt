If I were a used car
I wouldn't go far
I would just break down and smoke
If you were to go far
I will be next to you
If you ever feel weak
Then I'll be the rest of you
Am I all that's left for you?
I promise I won't let you down

x2
When I feel your heartbeat I know that I'm home
The day I stop holding you is the day I'm a ghost
Lying in the backseat rolling up a bone
Drown in the smoke now I'm dead in my zone
