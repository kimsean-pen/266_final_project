And I need to let you go
Long enough to know I know
Even if it kills me

Hey, just tell me do you feel okay?
Say everything you need to say right now
Hey, I'm sorry you don't feel the same
I tried but now I just can't stay around

And I need to let you go
Long enough to know I know
And I love you so
I love enough to let you go
Even if it kills me

Hey, I hear you're doing better on your own
While you're a hundred miles from home somehow
Hey, I never thought I'd ever be this calm
When everything I loved was gone right now

And I need to let you go
Long enough to know I know
And I love you so
I love enough to let you go
Even if it kills me

I know my worth, I know my worth
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough for me to try
I know my worth, I know my worth
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough for me to try
I know my worth, I know my worth
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough for me to try
I know my worth, I know my worth
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough for me to...

Let you go
Long enough to know I know
And I love you so
I love enough to let you go
I need to let you go
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
And I love you so
I love enough to let you go
Even if it kills me
Even if it kills me
