With you I felt love
With you I felt pain
With you I was me
And a bit of you, too

Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all-or-nothing situation

If I tried to say no
My heart said yes
If I tried to disguise it in my voice
My eyes gave me away

And so we became one
In a mad love that saw no limits

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

The fear of separation
Became an obsession
Jealousy and jealous things
Into the passel tumbled down
And now our love has turned into smoke
That I can smell but not touch
A fire that became a flame
That will never go out

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

With you
I felt love
With you
I felt pain
With you
I was me
And a bit of you, too

Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all-or-nothing situation

Yes, I began to dream of you in my arms
But from this dream I awoke
Call
Knowing you today
We no longer live on
No

Tudo tudo tudo ou nada
Nada nada nada nada
Tudo tudo tudo ou nada
Quase nada nada nada

All or nothing tudo
All or nothing tudo
All or nothing
Nothing nothing

Tudo ou nada?
Tudo para
Tudo
Tudo para
