Venice night at 5 o'clock
The station hazy light
A sleepin' bum, a single girl
She's leavin' overnight

And she knows that it's forever
And she'll never ever return

In Italy on holidays
She had to see da Vinci's style
All the arts for credit cards
She would forgive him for a smile

And she knows that it's forever
And she'll never ever return

Hey little girl
Don't wanna cause you pain
But the big boys feel no sorrow
Hey little girl
Oh little girl
They're all the same
But they feel no sorrow
tudododo doooh...

There she is inside a train
And now she's leanin' back
She's got money for one day
And nothing in the rack
And she knows that it's forever
And she'll never ever return

Hey little girl
Don't wanna cause you pain
But the big boys feel no sorrow
Hey little girl
Oh little girl
They're all the same
But they feel no sorrow
tudododo doooh...

Hey little girl
Don't wanna cause you pain
But the big boys feel no sorrow
Hey little girl
Oh little girl
They're all the same
But they feel no sorrow

Hey little girl
Don't wanna cause you pain
But the big boys feel no sorrow
Hey little girl
Oh little girl
They're all the same
But they feel no sorrow

Hey little girl
