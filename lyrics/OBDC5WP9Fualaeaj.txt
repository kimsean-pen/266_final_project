Haven't you seen me sleepwalking
'cause I've been holding your hand
Haven't you noticed me drifting

Let me tell you I am
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me that I'm not drowning

Let me tell you I am
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go

I can't help falling out of love with you
Why I am feeling so guilty
Why I am holding my breath

Worry about everyone but me and I just keep losing myself
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me that I'm not drowning

Let me tell you I am
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go

I can't help falling out of love with you
Won't you read my mind
Don't you make me like you
And I hear
Please
Please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
With you
Haven't you darling
I'm sleepwalking
