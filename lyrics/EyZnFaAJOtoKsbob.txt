A physical reaction when I get close to your body
A chemical connection when we talk until the morning
Say you're not the type to have a heavy conversation
Yeah, but I need to know
If you're the type that's worth the waiting
'Cause I, I, I, I I'm getting lost in translation
If you fight what feels right You're gonna lose

I wish you would say to my face All the things that you're wanting to
(That you're wanting to)
I wish you would stay on my skin Like a shirt that I'll never lose
(That I'll never lose)
Take the feeling in, let it fill up your lungs
Baby, come on spit it out
Let it roll off your tongue
I wish you would say to my face
All the things that you're wanting to
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would

I'm leading with my confidence 'cause I know that you like it
You light up when you see me like a cigarette that I lit
(No way to hide it)
I don't need another high 'cause you're pure elevation
Yeah, you don't need another cure 'cause I'm your medication
'Cause I, I, I, I I'm getting lost in translation
If you fight what feels right You're gonna lose

I wish you would say to my face All the things that you're wanting to
(That you're wanting to)
I wish you would stay on my skin
Like a shirt that I'll never lose
(That I'll never lose)
Take the feeling in, let it fill up your lungs
Baby, come on spit it out
Let it roll off your tongue
I wish you would say to my face
All the things that you're wanting to
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would
(Oh, I wish you, boy)

I, I, I, I I'm getting lost in translation
If you fight what feels right
You're gonna lose
Oh 'cause I, I, I,
I Need you to heal my frustration
When I'm reading your mind
I can see through...

I wish you would say to my face
All the things that you're wanting to
(That you're wanting to)
I wish you would stay on my skin
Like a shirt that I'll never lose
(That I'll never lose)
Take the feeling in, let it fill up your lungs
Baby, come on spit it out
Let it roll off your tongue

I wish you would say to my face
All the things that you're wanting to
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would
Oh, I wish you would
Take the feeling in, let it fill up your lungs
Baby, come on spit it out
Let it roll off your tongue
I wish you would say to my face
All the things that you're wanting to
Oh, I wish you would
