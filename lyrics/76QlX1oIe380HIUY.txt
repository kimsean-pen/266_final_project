Night-time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs

And awakes the imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently

Night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away

From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to
The music of the night

Close your eyes
And surrender to your
Darkest dreams!

Purge your thoughts
Of the life
You knew before!
Close your eyes
Let your spirit

Start to soar!
And you'll live
As you've never
Lived before

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that
You know you cannot fight
The darkness of
The music of the night

Let your mind
Start a journey through a
Strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts
Of the life
You knew before!
Let your soul
Take you where you
Long to be!
Only then
Can you belong
To me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me
Savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of
The music that I write
The power of
The music of the night

You alone
Can make my song take flight
Help me make
The music of the night
