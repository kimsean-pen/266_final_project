Some granite wall
Numbs our bones, numbs our all
As we sit on skinny hands
Nothin to say, nothin at all
Oh
I don't know you
And I

I don't want to
You're so awkward just like me
But I don't care

Ohhh, you're the reason I'm leavin
You're the reason I'm leavin
If I'm leaving we don't stop livin, you know
I've no idea, oh
That in four years
I'd be hanging from a beam

Behind the door of number ten
Singin' well, fare thee well, fare thee well, fare thee well
I am leaving, yes I leave it all to you...
You're the reason I'm leaving (Leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (Leaving alone)
If I'm leaving we don't stop livin', you know

I'm the reason you're leaving (Leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (Leaving alone)
If I'm leaving we don't stop livin', you know
As we ride along
Under an optimistic sun
The radio sings that everybody song by rem
And here I am fighting, fighting

Yes I'm fighting not to cry
And that's another reason why
I ought to hate you like I do
Like I do, ohh like I do
You're the reason I'm leaving (Leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (Leaving alone)
If I'm leaving we don't stop livin', you know
I'm the reason you're leaving (Leaving alone)
I'm the reason you're leaving (Leaving alone)
If we're leaving we don't stop livin', you know
