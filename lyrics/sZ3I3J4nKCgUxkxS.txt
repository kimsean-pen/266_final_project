Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you, darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over

Everyday we used to make it, love
Why can't we be makin' love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well darlin'

It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you, darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over
Look out

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, mm, we have grown
Although our love still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere

Startin' over

Oo-oo-oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
