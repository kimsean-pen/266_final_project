I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Ooh
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Ooh baby
Let's, let's stay together (Together)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Ooh, ooh, yeah

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break-up
Oh, turn around and make-up?
I just can't deceive
You'd never do that to me (Would you, baby?)
Stayin' around you is all I see

(Here's what I want us to do)

Let's, we oughta stay together (Together)
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad, come on
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
