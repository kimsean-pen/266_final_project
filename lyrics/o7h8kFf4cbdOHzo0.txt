I know I let you down
I think about it all the time
We could have had it all
We could have had it all

Always thought we would make it
The world was ours for the taking
God, I wish I could change it

How you left in the taxi
And I just watched as it happened
I took the round trip for granted

Now I tell myself what's done is done
But really I'm afraid
The only love I'll ever know
Is the one that got away

I know I let you down
I think about it all the time
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
I wish I knew it then
That life is what you leave behind
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
We could have had it all

I get out at the station
Trace our steps where
We made them
Through the maze of the pavement

And at the corner
Where I had to choose
Didn't realize what I had to lose
I should have fought until
My dying breath for you

Now I tell myself what's done is done
But really I'm afraid
The only love I'll ever know
Is the one that got away, yeah

I know I let you down
I think about it all the time
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
I wish I knew it then
That life is what
You leave behind
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
Yeah, we could have had it all

'Cause God it was perfect (Oh, it was perfect)
I know it was all my fault
God it was perfect (And it was my fault)
Oh, we could have had it all (Had it all)

I know I let you down
I think about it all the time
We could have had it all (Could have had it all)
We could have had it all (Could have had it all)
I wish I knew it then
That life is what
You leave behind
We could have had it all (Should've for you)
We could have had it all (Nothing left to lose)
We could have had it all (Could've had you)
We could have had it all

I know I let you down
I think about it all the time
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
