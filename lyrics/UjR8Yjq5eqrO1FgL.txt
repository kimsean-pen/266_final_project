I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
I might get the wrong boy, but imma get you back

I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
The wrong boy, but imma get you back
I might get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
I might get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
Get the wrong boy, but imma, but imma
I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
I'm gonna get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
Get the wrong boy, but imma get you back
