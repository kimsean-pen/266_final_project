Why do we sit around and
Break each others hearts tonight
Why do we dance around
The issues till the morning light
When we sit and talk and
Tear each others lives apart
You were the one to tell me go
But you were the one for me
And now you're going through the door
When you take that step
I love you baby more and more
We need to laugh and sing and cry
And warm each others hearts tonight
Observing the fun of everything
And loving all of mother God
Tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us
Why do we sit around and
Break each others hearts tonight
Why do we dance around
The issues till the morning light
When we sit and talk and
Tear each others lives apart
You were the one to tell me go
But you were the one for me
And now you're going through the door
When you take that step
I love you baby more and more
We need to laugh and sing and cry
And warm each others hearts tonight
Observing the fun of everything
And loving all of mother God
Tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us
Forever alive, forever alive, forever, forever
Forever alive, forever alive, forever
Never and ever again
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us
Forever alive, forever alive, forever, forever
Forever alive, forever alive, forever
Never and ever again
