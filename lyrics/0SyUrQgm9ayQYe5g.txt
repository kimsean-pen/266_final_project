i find you hid in mirrorville
creature of the deep
waifish as a widow
and without sufficient sleep
oh what am i supposed to think
do i pull you out
or do i let you sink
i wait until you're woozy
i won't know until your limp
i take you in the mouth
like a lion takes his game
i love you all the more
forever we thought
but how it got within me
how i cracked the vault
'cause it's a terrible scare
but that's why the dark is there
see you don't have to see what you can't bear
the lion's share
lion's share
i took the lion's share
not 'cause i didn't care
just 'cause i knew it was there
oh oh oh oh
lion's share
i took the lion's share
not 'cause i didn't care
just 'cause i knew it was there
boy-oy-oy-oy whatcha running from
boy-oy-oy-oy
boy-oy-oy-oy whatcha running from
boy-oy-oy-oy
'cause it's a terrible scare
but that's why the dark is there
see you don't have to see what you can't bear
the lion's share
boy-oy-oy-oy whatcha running from
boy-oy-oy-oy
boy-oy-oy-oy whatcha running from
boy-oy-oy-oy
'cause it's a terrible scare
but that's why the dark is there
see you don't have to see what you can't bear
the lion's share
