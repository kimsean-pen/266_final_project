'Ve seen the game played quite a bit
But this really takes the biscuit
Wrapped your lips around every tip
Haven't come up once to catch your breath
All the actors, all the actors
Learnt lines
All the actors
God know they try

We've talked about absolutely nothing
Eyes darting about, while looking round attempt to string
Two words together, plan the route of exit
And repeat, and repeat like so

Be dazzled
Devour the glitz the glamour
Be dazzled
Just never bring it home, never bring it home, no
Find out if it's everything you craved and more
Be dazzled
Don't ever bring it home, ever bring it home
Shadow every single move
Take your cue, laugh when the boss laughs
All the actors, all the actors
Learnt lines
All the actors
God know they try

Met once before, way too pleased to see me
Went full on hug, didn't want you touching me
Obvious, you didn't recognise me
And repeat, and repeat like so

Be dazzled
Devour the glitz the glamour
Be dazzled
Just never bring it home, never bring it home, no
Find out if it's everything you craved and more
Be dazzled
Don't ever bring it home, ever bring it home

I've seen the game played quite a bit
But this really takes the biscuit
All the actors, all the actors
Learnt lines
All the actors
God know they try
