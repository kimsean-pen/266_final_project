Slow dancing
at low tide, low tide.
Drawn to move
by the moon, by the moon.

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
and I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side.
I've got plenty of affection.
I'd be glad to show you some time.

Slow motion
in double time, double time.
You are all
I can't deny.

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
and I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side.
I've got plenty of affection.
I'd be glad to show you some time.

What am I supposed to do
with you in the room?
What am I supposed to say
with your green eyes on my red face?
With your green eyes on my red face...
