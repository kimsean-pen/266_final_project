I'm the serpent here to test you with forbidden fruit
I love the look on your face when I'm tempting you
This is a part of me you begged to let you see
A part of me that'll do anything to get what I need
Maybe I'm sick, maybe I'm already dead
'Cause I'm not really scared of what comes next
Maybe I'm sick, maybe I'm fucked in the head
'Cause I'm not really scared of the consequence

Play with fire, and you'll get burned
Everybody rolls the dice, and it's your turn
You put the gun to your head, all I did was pull the trigger
So don't ask for my pity when I'm not the only sinner

It's a trick, it's a trap, the evil's not in my head
I'd like to think that it's my ugly human nature instead
Because I don't feel remorse for the things that I did
But I pray I have the chance to do them all again

The path to God led me astray
So the Devil came and lit the way, yeah

I'm the reason you don't trust, I'm the reason you don't feel right
I tore you apart, and I still sleep just fine
I'm the reason you don't trust, I'm the reason you don't feel right
I tore you apart, and I still sleep just fine
Yeah, I still sleep just fine

Play with fire, and you'll get burned
Everybody rolls the dice, and it's your turn
You put the gun to your head, all I did was pull the trigger
So don't ask for my pity when I'm not the only sinner
Play with fire, and you'll get burned
Everybody rolls the dice, and it's your turn
You put the gun to your head, all I did was pull the trigger
So don't ask for my pity when I'm not the only sinner, cunt
