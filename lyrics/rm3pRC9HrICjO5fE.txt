I feel your sunshine
When you're deep in shadows
Say you give me nothin'
But it still feels good though
You think you're worthless
But I think you're incredible
Don't say it's empty
When to me it is plentiful

Don't underestimate your power
You're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul
I told you before
Don't underestimate your power
You're stronger than you know
You're stronger than you know
Ooh ooh, no

You say you're strugglin'
And your life's been wasted
You don't wanna get
Back up but you can take it
It's not the same as it
Was when, when you were 17
But fuck it, you're a woman now,
You're stronger than you've ever been

Don't underestimate your power
You're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul
I told you before
Don't underestimate your power

So much power in store
Tell me what the
Hell you blaming for
You're about to explode
You got this again
Like you know you should

Oooooooohh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Listen baby

We both know you can take
Nme down
When you're at your weakest
We both know how I lean on you
Better, keep that a secret
You think it's hard, yes it is
What you been given this,
I'll give you something from me
You just sing a little louder,
Here comes your mind,
You should sing it in the shower

Don't underestimate your power
You're the real rolling stone
The music in my soul
I told you before
Don't underestimate your power
You're stronger than you know
Said you're stronger than you know,
Oh oh
You're stronger than you know

Don't let 'em fool you
Let 'em fool you, ah
You're stronger than you know

Woo-hoo!
You're stronger,
You're stronger
You're stronger than you know
You're stronger than you know
