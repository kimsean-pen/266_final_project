I spend my days in halls of light
Bathed in the healing Sun
I sang a song, so dissonant
And prayed it'd never stop

I moaned and I wept and I wandered
Each night was as bright as the day
I screamed in hysterical voices
Got caught in the labyrinth's haze

This circle that we draw in our own minds
This circle that we draw in our own minds
The pill is on the tip of my tongue
I'm tired of biting my tail
This circle that we draw is infinite

A hundred lives, a hundred deaths
Just to return again
Deep in the realm of Vantablack
I'm neither here nor there

And down came the hand of destruction
To kill what was already dead
Arose in the lap of the Goddess
Dear Mother

This circle that we draw in our own minds
This circle that we draw in our own minds
The pill is on the tip of my tongue
I'm tired of biting my tail
This circle that we draw is infinite
