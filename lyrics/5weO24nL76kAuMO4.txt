It's gone too far
And you're too gone
Could you hide a moment, from the sun?
And how come, it's only shown?
I'll burst the gates, we'll look back when we're done

Oh, you took what you wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me
Oh, you took wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me

You had too much
And it caught up
The tide will turn for no one, in the end
And there's no time
In this lifespan
To break apart the walls you used to tend

Oh, you took what you wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me
Oh, you took what you wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me

And the eyes close
As the light fades
On the last shot
Of a lifespan
And the eyes close
As the light fades
On the last shot
Of a lifespan
Oh, you took what you wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me
Oh, you took what you wanted to take
And yet you never wanted nothing from me
And the eyes close
As the light fades
On the last shot
Of a lifespan
