And if I had my way
I would run to the rescue
It never works that way
When you call a bluff
And all the fools rush in
It's a battle to surround you
Yeah, all the fools want in
But I'm not giving up
I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Look inside my brain
You know what I want before I tell you
Give me the words to say, to make it enough
Don't want your star-crossed fate
You are the Sun, I am the full Moon
Don't leave me lost in vain
I can be what you want
Oh, oh
I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
And you always turn away
Back to the start where I break through
You can run, you can run away
I will wait in the dark for you
Should've never felt this way
'Cause you're the Sun and I'm just a Moon
I'm in the dark 'till you light the way
'Cause I'm see through
You can read my mind
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh
