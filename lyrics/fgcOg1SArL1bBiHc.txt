In the darkness of an endless night
At the dawn of eternal life
In the coldness of a land without sun
Our spirits dive in the world of silence
Farther into infinity
Beyond the nothingness

Atrocious vision of death
Indescribable horror of darkness

Desolation of absolute emptyness
Unbearable sensation of impotence
We're dazzled by total obscurity of the parallel world
Our senses are numb for our longest journey

- Master speak, we're listening!
- Father order, we'll obey!

We're all one
And one is him
