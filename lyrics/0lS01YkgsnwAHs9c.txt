all the places i've known and the faces i've seen
over time are unseen and unknown
when you live in the dark
and you start to believe that everyone is asleep
in the same way that you are

half life and half dream
and half crazy to believe in
anything at all
i thought i knew it well
in my mind i knew well
what i wanted you to be
in this world i know the lover never really is
who he is to me

and it's always half strange to believe in anything
halfway insane and halfway home in your arms

always love
like no other love
like none i've known before

well i saw the way you looked at that woman
i saw the way you looked at that woman
i saw
i was looking, too
