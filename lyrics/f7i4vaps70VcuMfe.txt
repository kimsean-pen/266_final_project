Help me, help me to remember to forget
To forget what hasn't happened yet
Knock me down that mystic slide again
Tell me, tell me about Medusa's outhouse
Medusa's outhouse, and the hornet's nest
Stone me if I didn't pass the test

Season of the slug crawling up the vine
Music like a crow in the cold sunshine
Oh, the rest is up to dreams
Don't leave me hanging upside down

Music, music to forget the little strains
Forget the way I ruin everything
I'm dressing in the [?]

Calliope dancing on thin air
Ambrosia cotton candy until we're free from care
All the rest is up to dreams
Don't leave me hanging, don't leave me hanging
Don't leave me hanging upside down

If it's so easy, you try
Here, you try
Here, if it's so easy, you try
If it's so easy, you try
Here, you try
Here, if it's so easy, you try

Dancing, dancing in music
Sisters are good listeners
Listeners are good kissers

Say nothing if you don't wanna stay
Slow down if you're going my way
All the rest is up to dreams
Don't leave me hanging, don't leave me hanging
Don't leave me hanging, don't leave me hanging
Don't leave me hanging, don't leave me hanging
Don't leave me hanging, don't leave me hanging
