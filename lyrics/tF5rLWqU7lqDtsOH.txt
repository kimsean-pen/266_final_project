Well I had a real good lover,
but she's gone from me now.
Well you know that she's gone,
'cause there ain't no one here now.

So many say that they are in love,
so I can't ignore when there's somebody gone.

Well you know I had a real good lover,
but you, but you know what.
Well she's gone from me now.
She bring me breakfast in the morning.
She be home waiting when I get home from the plow.

So many say that they're somewhat in love.
So I can't ignore when there's somebody gone.

So many say that there's somebody gone,
but I can't ignore that there's nobody mourning,
mourning their love.

Well I had a real good lover,
She's so far from me now.
She know I had a real good lover,
she made promises now.
Well I had a real good lover,
She's gone from me now.
