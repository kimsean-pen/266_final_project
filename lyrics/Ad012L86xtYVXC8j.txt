Bring night
Bring the night on
Bring a little bit of dance
Bring a little bit of song, yeah
Bring night
Bring the night on
I'm not sure I can wait
And this day just feels so long, yeah

Bring night
Bring the night on
The music gets into me
And I know it can't be wrong, oh
Bring night
Bring the night on

'Cause all that we are after
Is a little bit of fun, yeah

Chase your shadow

'Til the sun goes down

Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oooh

Bring night
Bring the night on
Bring me the moon and stars
Let's send away the sun, yeah

Bring night
Bring the night on
Maybe if I'm lucky
I'll end up in your arms

Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh

Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Chase your shadow
'Til the sun goes down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh
Bring night
Bring the night on
