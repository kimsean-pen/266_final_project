It's not alright
It's just scary
But here we are
We're in a bad country

We lost our way
We had a breakdown
So here we are
Stuck in a bad country

We're out of our minds
We're going crazy
Saw a sign
Says we're in
We're in a bad country

Are we saved?
Are we saved?
Are we saved?
No we lost our way

It's not alright
It's just scary
But here we are
We're in a bad country
We're in a bad country
We're in a bad country
We're in a bad country
We're in a bad country
