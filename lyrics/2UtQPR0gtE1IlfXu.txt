Well, baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby looked so right
Well, pick you up at ten, gotta have you home at two
Mama don't know what I got in store for you
But that's all right 'cause we're lookin' as cool as can be
Well, we found a little place that really didn't look half-bad
I had a whisky on the rocks and changed half a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put a quarter right into that can
But all they played was disco, man
Come on, baby, baby, let's get out of here right away
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream 'n' shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock 'til we pop
Gonna rock 'til we drop
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
Well, we're havin' a ball just a-boppin' on the big dance floor
Well, there's a real square cat, he looks a 1974
Well, he looked at me once, he looked at me twice
Look at me again and there's gonna be fight
We're gonna rock this town
We're gonna rip this place apart
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream 'n' shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock 'til we pop
Gonna rock 'til we drop
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
Whoa
