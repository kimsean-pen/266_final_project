Shut the fuck up, bitch
Talkin shit
When the 6-10 splits get off and take a left on St. Bernard
Drive a little bit
Then it hits
Oh shit!
You just drove down the road to Yung Plague's pit
With a pit in the yard
Feed you to my dog then I yawn
Bury your bones until dawn
Mow the lawn to make it seem neat like a bed
Bitch, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Dreaming while they zipping up the body bag from my fucking
Feet up to my head

Sucka busta, fuck that bitch
Riding with some endless trick
On my P's and Q's, I refuse to be broke as shit
Sucka busta fuck that bitch
Ain't got no friends they all turned snitch
Trust no one they bound to switch
Trust no bitch just give them dick
Gutta south pimp with the gold on my wrist
Empty the clip 'til the chamber go click
No faking no flodgin my record legit
I'm banking and dodgin from five-o my clique
Cut Throat cut dope with the all black blade
Sniff coke fuck hoes while I'm laying in the shade
I live up in hell and I sleep in a grave
And if you can't tell bitch I'm fucking insane
Pop pop pop pop make the bodies go drop
Busting these suckas and swerving on cops
Almighty 59 ain't got time for no ops
666 I'm so damn hot
