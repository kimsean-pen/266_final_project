Those were the times
I can't rewind
When we were young
And you were mine
I'll pass it off
As long as I can
But I can't get
You out of my head
I'm all alone
Inside this room
My body is weak and it wants you
I'll try to make
The most of it
But something is wrong...

Oh
Oh no
Oh here we go again
It's my fault
Oh
Oh no
Oh there you go again
It's your fault
And I can't take much more of this
Good-bye, baby
You're no good for me
Good-bye, baby
You're not coming back to me
Oh
Oh no
Oh here we go again
It's my fault
Oh
Oh no
Oh there you go again
It's your fault
And I can't take much more of this

Good-bye baby
You're no good for me
Good-bye baby
You're not coming back to me
