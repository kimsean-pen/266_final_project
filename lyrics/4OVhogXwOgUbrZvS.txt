Give me a reason to stay constantly ignored
Give me an angle that I haven't tried before
A guarantee for being honestly compared
You want to live when life is achingly unfair

Don't make a move you'll look ridiculous again
You share no interest but it's easy to pretend
Don't start the action it will turn against you soon
No one's gonna follow and you'll stand there like a fool

You left the people when the people left you out
Back in the suburbs you're craving for the crowd
Only minded now with defeats of yesterday
The mantra spinning in your head will keep it raised

Give me a reason to stay constantly ignored
(I don't think I can)
Give me an angle that I haven't tried before
(Not from where I stand)
A guarantee for being honestly compared
(Could not be found)
You want to live when life is achingly unfair
(Stick around)

Don't give up
