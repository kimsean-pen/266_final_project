It's getting late for me
But it's too early for you
I shouldn't wait but
This one I'm not gonna lose
I can see it, forever
I got my start off at 10
You give your love for free
So can't you say it again
That this is all that you need
Can you see it?
Can you see it?

Tell me what we're waiting for
I only wanna love

I don't wanna try alone
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever
I only wanna team with you
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever

Sometimes you got to push to start
And then we're gonna go until the wheels fall off
Until the wheels fall off
Can't you see it?
It's forever

Tell me what we're waiting for
I only wanna love

I don't wanna try alone
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever
I only wanna team with you
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever

Oooh...
Oooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh...
Oooh-ooh-ooh...

Oooh...
Oooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh...
Oooh-ooh-ooh...

I don't wanna try alone
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever
I only wanna team with you
We could dream it all
Don't wanna stop the thought
Of you and I forever
Forever
