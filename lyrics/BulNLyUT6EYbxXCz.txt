Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stare, will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom, world of sin
All subside, don't venture near
The island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in

Destroyer of life, demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, gorgon

Serpents bride, the end awaits
Human prey, no swords or armor
Shield you from your fate
Hey you, you can't escape
Wicked smile, full of lies
Head of snakes, approach her cave
But don't look in her eyes
Oh, her eyes

Destroyer of life, demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, gorgon

Seize, appease, deceive, die
Seize, appease, deceive, die
Medusa, she's staring at you

Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa
Evil witch, cast her spell, seducing you
She'll take you to the very depths of hell oh, no, no
Cannot move, no eyes to see, a statue now

For all eternity medusa laughs at you
And you're her slave
Destroyer of life, demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, gorgon
Seize, appease, deceive, die
Seize, appease, deceive, die
Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh, she's cold
Medusa
Solo
Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stare, will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom, world of sin
All subside, don't venture near
The island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in
Destroyer of life, demon
Oh I'm ready to strike, gorgon
Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh, she's cold
Medusa
