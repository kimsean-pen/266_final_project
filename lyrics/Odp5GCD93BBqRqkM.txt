This old town's filled with sin, it'll swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away, you've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

The scientists say it'll all wash away
But we don't believe anymore
'Cause we've got our recruits and our green mohair suits
So please, show your I.D. at the door

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

A friend came around, tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
He trusted his crowd, so he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

On the thirty-first floor a gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
