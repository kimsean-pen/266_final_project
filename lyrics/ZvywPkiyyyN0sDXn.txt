Goodnight, goodnight
It's time now to sleep
The moon's watching over
You and your dreams

Goodnight and goodnight
My sweet little one
Tomorrow your eyes they will light up the sun

But goodnight, goodnight
Sweet dreams for now
Drift off to sleep
On your pillow of clouds

Goodnight, goodnight
My sweet little friend
Tomorrow's adventures, they will soon begin
Tomorrow's adventures will soon begin
