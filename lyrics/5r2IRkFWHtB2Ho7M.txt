1, 2, 3, 4!
Let me see get your arms in the air
And let me hear you sing it loud, loud, loud
Well when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay

And maybe when you get back
I'll be off
To find another way
When after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know

So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can
When you go
And would you even turn to say

I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading

So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay
When after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow

So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
Sing it!
When you go

And would you even turn to say

I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday
Well come on, let me see those arms!
When you go
Would you have the guts to say
I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yester... day-hey-heyja
I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yester... day-hey-heyja
I don't love you
Like I loved you yesterday.
